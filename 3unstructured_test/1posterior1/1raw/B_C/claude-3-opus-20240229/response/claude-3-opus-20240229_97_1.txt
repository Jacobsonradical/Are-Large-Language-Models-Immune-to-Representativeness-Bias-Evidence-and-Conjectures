Based on the personality sketch provided, here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration or computer science in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has a strong interest in nature, puzzles, and abstract concepts, as well as a high intelligence. These traits are more commonly associated with fields like computer science, mathematics, or natural sciences. While it's possible he could be interested in business administration, the given information points more strongly towards computer science or a related field.
