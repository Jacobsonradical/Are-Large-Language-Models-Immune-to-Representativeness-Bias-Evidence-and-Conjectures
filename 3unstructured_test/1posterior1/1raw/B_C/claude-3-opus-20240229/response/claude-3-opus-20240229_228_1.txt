Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in the given fields in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems more likely to be interested in a field related to his curiosity about nature, love of problem-solving, and ability to understand abstract concepts. Computer science aligns well with these traits. While business administration is certainly possible, the description suggests Adam may be more drawn to technical and scientific pursuits rather than business. Of course, there are many other potential fields he could have studied as well.
