Based on the personality sketch provided, here are my estimates for the probability of Adam being enrolled in each field:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts, align more closely with a computer science field than business administration. However, there is still a possibility that he could be enrolled in business administration, as the sketch mentions an appreciation for hard work and dedication, which are valuable traits in that field as well.
