Here is my estimate of the probabilities, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The description suggests Adam has a strong interest in and aptitude for abstract concepts, puzzles, and understanding how things work, which aligns well with computer science. His curiosity about nature could also fit with certain areas of computer science research. Business administration seems less likely given his personality profile, though his intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication could lend themselves to business studies as well. Overall, I estimate a significantly higher likelihood of computer science compared to business administration, while acknowledging that additional graduate fields are also possibilities.
