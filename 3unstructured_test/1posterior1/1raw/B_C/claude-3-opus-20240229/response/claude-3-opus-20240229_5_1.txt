Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.2",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

Based on his personality sketch, Adam seems more likely to gravitate towards fields related to his interests in nature, animals, puzzles and abstract concepts rather than business administration. Computer science has some overlap with his strengths in intelligence and abstract thinking, so I assigned it a somewhat higher probability than business. However, the description suggests he may be most drawn to fields like biology, zoology, environmental science, or perhaps mathematics or philosophy. The probabilities I provided for CS and business are relatively low to allow likelihood for other graduate fields that seem potentially more aligned with his profile.
