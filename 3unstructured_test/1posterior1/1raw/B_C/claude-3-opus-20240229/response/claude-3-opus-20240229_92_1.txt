Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in computer science or business administration in graduate school:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

While Adam is intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts which could point to computer science, his strong interest in nature, plants and animals makes me think he is more likely to be studying something related to biology, ecology, botany, zoology, environmental science, or a similar life science field. Business administration seems less likely given his personality and interests, though it's still possible. There are many other potential graduate fields he could be pursuing related to his curiosity about the natural world.
