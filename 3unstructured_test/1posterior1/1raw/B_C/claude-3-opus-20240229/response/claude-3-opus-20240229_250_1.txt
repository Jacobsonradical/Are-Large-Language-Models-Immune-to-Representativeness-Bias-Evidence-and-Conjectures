Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in each field in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

Given his strong interest in nature, abstract concepts, and problem solving, computer science seems more likely than business administration. However, without more specific information about his academic background and career interests, it's difficult to assign a high probability to any particular graduate field. There are many other possibilities such as biology, environmental science, mathematics, etc. that could also align with his profile.
