Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in computer science or business administration in graduate school:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

Based on his personality traits like a curiosity about nature, love of animals, strong empathy and appreciation for hard work, I estimate a relatively low probability that he studied business administration. His high intelligence, ability to grasp abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles make computer science somewhat more likely, but still not the most probable field given his other interests.
