Based on the personality sketch provided, here is my estimate:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The subject's strong interest in nature, abstract thinking abilities, and high intelligence suggest a higher probability of being enrolled in a computer science graduate program compared to business administration. However, without more specific information about Adam's academic background and career interests, these estimates have a high degree of uncertainty.
