Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

The personality sketch suggests Adam has a strong interest in nature, abstract concepts, and problem-solving, which could align with studies in computer science. However, the sketch doesn't provide clear evidence of technical skills or interest in programming specifically. Business administration seems less likely given the emphasis on nature, animals, and abstract concepts rather than leadership, management or finance. Of course, more information about Adam's specific interests, skills and undergraduate background would help refine these probability estimates.
