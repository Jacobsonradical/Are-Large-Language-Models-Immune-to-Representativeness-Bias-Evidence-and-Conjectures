Based on the given personality sketch, here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in the mentioned fields:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Explanation:
The personality sketch suggests that Adam has a strong interest in nature, animals, and abstract concepts. He is also described as highly intelligent. These traits are more closely aligned with computer science than business administration.

However, the sketch also mentions that he has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication, which could be applicable to both fields. Therefore, while the probability of him being enrolled in computer science is higher, there is still a possibility that he could have chosen business administration.
