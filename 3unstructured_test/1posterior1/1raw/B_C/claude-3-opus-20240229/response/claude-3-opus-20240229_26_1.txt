Based on the personality sketch provided, here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has a strong interest in nature, a love for animals, and good abstract thinking skills. These traits, combined with his high intelligence, make it more likely that he was enrolled in a field like computer science that involves problem-solving and abstract concepts.

While it's possible he could have been enrolled in business administration, the personality sketch doesn't provide strong indicators of interest or skills typically associated with that field, so I assigned a lower probability.
