Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

While Adam's intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could lend itself to computer science, his personality sketch emphasizes more his love of nature, animals, puzzles, and his empathetic qualities. These traits seem less directly relevant to computer science or business administration, compared to fields like biology, environmental science, psychology, or veterinary medicine. However, there is still some probability he could have pursued those fields.
