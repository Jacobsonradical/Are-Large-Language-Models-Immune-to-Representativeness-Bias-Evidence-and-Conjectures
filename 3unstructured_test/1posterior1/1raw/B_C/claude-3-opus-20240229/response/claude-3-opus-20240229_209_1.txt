Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in business administration or computer science in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Based on Adam's strong interest in nature, puzzles, abstract concepts and intelligence, I believe there is a reasonably high probability he was studying computer science. His curiosity and aptitude for understanding complex systems could align well with this field.

The probability for business administration is lower in my estimation. While Adam's empathy, dedication and hard work could certainly be assets in business, his specific interests seem to point more towards the sciences than business administration.

However, it's important to note that these are only rough estimates based on limited information about his personality. Many other fields of graduate study are also possible that could align with Adam's traits and interests.
