Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in the given fields in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Based on Adam's personality traits of being intelligent, good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles, I believe he has a relatively high probability of around 0.6 of being enrolled in a computer science graduate program.

His empathy, warm heart, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could also suit a business administration program to some degree, but I estimate a lower probability of around 0.2 for that field given his specific interests in nature, plants, and animals which seem less directly related to typical business administration curricula.
