Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in computer science or business administration in graduate school in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

Based on his interests and skills, I believe there is a 60% chance Adam studied computer science. His curiosity, puzzle solving, intelligence and grasp of abstract concepts align well with this field. 

I estimate a 20% chance he studied business administration. While his understanding of hard work and dedication could fit with business, his other traits and interests seem less aligned with typical business administration programs.

Of course, there are many other graduate fields he could have pursued given his profile. This is just my best guess based on the limited information provided. Let me know if you would like me to explain my reasoning further.
