Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.25",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts suggest Adam may have an inclination towards computer science. However, the sketch also emphasizes empathy, love of nature/animals, and appreciation for hard work, which don't necessarily point to computer science. So I estimate a 25% probability of computer science.

Business administration seems less likely given Adam's traits. Understanding and appreciating hard work and dedication could fit with business, but overall the personality sketch suggests other fields may be a better match. So I estimate only a 10% probability for business administration.

Of course, this is highly speculative based on limited information. The sketch is also compatible with many other potential fields not mentioned, such as biology, veterinary medicine, psychology, etc. More details would be needed to make a confident assessment.
