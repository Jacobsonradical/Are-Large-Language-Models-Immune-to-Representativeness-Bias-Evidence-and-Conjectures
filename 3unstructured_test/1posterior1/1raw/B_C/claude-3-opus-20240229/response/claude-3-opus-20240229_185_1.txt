Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration and computer science in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Given Adam's strong interest in nature, abstract thinking abilities, and high intelligence, I believe he is more likely to have pursued graduate studies in a scientific or technical field like computer science rather than business administration. However, business administration is still a possibility given his appreciation for hard work and dedication.
