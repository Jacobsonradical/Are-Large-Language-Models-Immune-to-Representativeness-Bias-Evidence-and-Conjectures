Based on the information provided in the personality sketch, we can make some educated guesses about which fields Adam might be studying. Adam shows a strong interest in nature, puzzles, and abstract concepts, which might suggest he leans towards a scientific or analytical field. His empathy and love for animals might also indicate an interest in fields that benefit society or the environment. However, the specific characteristics listed might align more closely with some disciplines than others. Here's an estimation:

- **Business Administration**: While business administration requires strategic thinking and often some understanding of abstract financial concepts, Adamâ€™s interests seem to focus more on nature and scientific exploration, which are typically less emphasized in this field. Therefore, the probability might be relatively low. 
  Probability: 0.2

- **Computer Science**: Given Adam's interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, this field could be more aligned with his skills and interests, as computer science involves complex problem solving and the understanding of both concrete and abstract information systems.
  Probability: 0.65
