Given the personality sketch of Adam and his interests, we can derive some estimates for the likelihood that he might be enrolled in specific academic fields. These estimates are subjective and based on a general understanding of the correlation between personality traits and academic interests, as well as popular tendencies within graduate programs.

Adam's curiosity about nature and love for animals might suggest a stronger inclination toward fields such as biology, environmental science, or veterinary studies rather than fields like computer science or business administration. His enjoyment of solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts does align well with computer science. Business administration, while possible, seems less likely unless his empathy and understanding are directed more towards organizational behavior or leadership in sustainable practices, which is not directly indicated.

Hereâ€™s the estimated likelihood of his enrollment in the specified fields:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

These estimates reflect the intersection of his skills in abstract thinking and puzzle-solving with computer science, which often involves similar skills, versus the lesser alignment of his described personality traits with the typical focus of business administration programs.
