Based on the personality sketch and interests of Adam provided in the description, we can make some informed estimates about his potential field of study.

Adam's curiosity about nature and strong empathy might suggest a tendency towards fields that involve the environment, biology, or animal science, rather than purely analytical or business-oriented courses. His ability to solve puzzles and interest in abstract concepts can align well with fields that involve problem-solving and theoretical knowledge, such as computer science. 

Business administration generally involves skills in leadership, strategic thinking, and often an interest in economic aspects of running businesses, which does not directly align with the traits described.

Here's an estimation reflecting these considerations:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.2"
} 

These probabilities reflect the alignment of Adam's interests and traits with typical demands and focuses of these fields; however, it's important to note that personal interest and individual choices can vary widely, and people often enter fields that might not directly align with their apparent skills or hobbies.
