Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, we can make educated predictions regarding the likelihood of his enrollment in specific graduate programs.

1. **Computer Science:** Given Adam's fondness for solving puzzles and his capability in understanding abstract concepts, computer science could be a suitable field. This domain often requires problem-solving skills and the ability to deal with abstract and systematic thought processes. Additionally, his high intelligence aligns well with the demands of a computer science program, which deals with complex problem-solving and often involves innovation and deep thinking. The interest in nature and empathy might not directly correlate, but his analytical abilities make this a plausible field.

2. **Business Administration:** Adam's strong empathy and warm heart, which are central to the sketch, might make him a good fit in fields requiring strong interpersonal skills and emotional intelligence, like some aspects of business. However, his particular interests in puzzles and abstract concepts, along with a lack of mentioned interest in typical business administration aspects like management, finance, or entrepreneurship, might make this field slightly less probable as compared to computer science. The focus on appreciation for hard work and dedication might be somewhat relevant, but it does not directly align with a specific inclination towards business administration.

Therefore, considering these alignments between the personality traits described and the typical demands and interests affiliated with the fields, the estimated probabilities could be approximated as:
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
