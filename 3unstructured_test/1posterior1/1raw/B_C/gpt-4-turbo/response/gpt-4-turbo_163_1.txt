Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, including his traits and interests, hereâ€™s an estimate of the likelihood of his enrollment in specific graduate fields:

- **Computer Science**: Adam's interest in solving puzzles and his capability in understanding abstract concepts are qualities often associated with the field of computer science. Computer science often requires a good grasp of logical reasoning, problem-solving, and can involve abstract mathematical concepts, all of which align with Adam's described abilities and interests.

- **Business Administration**: While Adam shows empathy, appreciation for hard work, and dedication, which are valuable traits in business, there is less direct correlation between his specific interests (particularly in nature, plants, and animals) and the typical core focus areas of business administration such as management, finance, or marketing. His personality might be well-suited to leadership roles within business focused on sustainability or ethical practices, but these aspects are not predominantly highlighted in the provided sketch.
  
Given these observations, here's the estimated probability:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

These probabilities reflect a stronger alignment with computer science due to direct interest and aptitude-related indicators, while still leaving room for a significant possibility in business administration, considering traits that would also be beneficial in this field.
