Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam:

- Adam's interest in solving puzzles and strong intelligence, along with his ability to understand abstract concepts, align well with the skill set often found advantageous in fields like computer science. Computer science requires logical thinking, problem-solving skills, and an understanding of complex systems, which seems to match Adam's abilities and interests.

- While Adam's empathy, warm heart, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could certainly be beneficial in any field, they do not directly suggest a specific alignment with business administration. Business administration typically requires strong leadership qualities, strategic thinking about market needs, and often a focus on profit maximization, none of which are specifically mentioned in Adam's personality sketch. 

Considering these aspects, the estimated probability that Adam is enrolled in each field could reasonably be assessed as follows:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
} 

Note: These probabilities are subjective estimates based on the personality traits described and do not account for actual enrollment statistics or Adam's personal interest which could affect his field of study choice.
