Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam's traits suggest certain preferences and intellectual strengths that align more closely with some fields than others. His interest in puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts might align well with fields that require logical thinking and problem-solving skills, such as computer science. On the other hand, his empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work could also tie into fields focused more on life sciences or social sciences, though these aren't as clearly connected directly to the fields of business administration or computer science. 

Here's the estimated probability for the fields mentioned:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.65"
}

This suggests that it's somewhat less likely that Adam studies business administration based on his personality traits described, as these don't clearly connect to business administration skills which often emphasize leadership, strategic thinking in a business context, and financial acumen. However, his fit for computer science seems stronger, given his interests and abilities in understanding complex and abstract ideas and problem-solving, which are crucial in computer science.
