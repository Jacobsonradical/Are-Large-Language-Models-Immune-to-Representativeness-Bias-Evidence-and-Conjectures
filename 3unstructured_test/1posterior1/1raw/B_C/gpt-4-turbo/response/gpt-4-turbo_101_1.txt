Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities of Adam's enrollment in the specified fields:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

This assessment accounts for Adam's inclinations towards problem-solving and high intelligence, which align well with typical demands of computer science. His empathy and appreciation for hard work could suit many fields, but they aren't directly indicative of a specific alignment with business administration, hence the lower estimation for that field.
