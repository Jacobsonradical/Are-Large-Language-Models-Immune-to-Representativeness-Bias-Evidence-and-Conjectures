Given Adam's described interests and qualities, here is my assessment:

- Adam exhibits a curiosity about nature and plants, suggesting a potential inclination towards fields related to environmental studies, biology, or related sciences rather than business administration, which typically focuses on management, finance, and organizational behavior.

- His enjoyment of solving puzzles and good understanding of abstract concepts aligns more closely with disciplines that involve problem-solving and analytical thinking, traits often essential in computer science. Furthermore, computer science can involve aspects of abstract thinking and complex problem solving, which seem to be Adam's strengths.

Therefore, the estimated probability of him being enrolled in each of the mentioned fields would be:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

These estimates reflect a lower likelihood of Adam studying business administration due to less alignment with his interests and a higher probability for computer science given his traits and skills.
