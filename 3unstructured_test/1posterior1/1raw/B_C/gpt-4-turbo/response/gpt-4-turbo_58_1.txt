Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, it is evident that his interests and traits align with certain academic disciplines. Adam's curiosity about nature and plants may suggest a leaning towards scientific fields, while his enjoyment in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts align well with disciplines that require analytical and critical thinking skills. His high intelligence further complements this alignment. However, there is limited direct evidence pointing specifically to business administration or computer science based strictly on the description provided.

1. Computer Science – This field often attracts individuals who are good at solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts. Adam's ability in these areas could suggest a fit here. However, there is no explicit mention of his interest in technology or programming, which are central to computer science. Based on these considerations:
   - **Computer Science:** 0.4 (This is a moderate probability recognizing his analytical traits but lacking direct evidence of interest in technology.)

2. Business Administration – While Adam shows strong empathy, a warm heart, and appreciation for hard work, these qualities are somewhat relevant to business administration. However, business studies typically also require a keen interest in organizational behaviors, finance, or strategic management, none of which are explicitly mentioned in his profile:
   - **Business Administration:** 0.2 (This is a lower probability because the described traits and interests do not strongly correlate with the typical demands and focuses of business administration.)
