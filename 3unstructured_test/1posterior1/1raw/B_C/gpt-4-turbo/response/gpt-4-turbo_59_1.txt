Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam shows traits such as a strong empathy, love for animals, and a curiosity about nature and its plants. These interests and qualities typically align more with fields related to biology, environmental science, or perhaps animal welfare. His ability in understanding abstract concepts and solving puzzles also suggests potential strengths in fields that require analytical and strategic thinking, such as computer science. 

However, there is less information suggesting a direct alignment with business administration, which generally involves skills and interests in managing operations, financial planning, leadership, and a more direct focus on commerce and market engagement.

Taking these into consideration, here's an estimation of the probability that Adam was enrolled in each field:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

These probabilities reflect the emphasis on Adam's interest and capabilities that align more closely with analytical and abstract conceptual management (useful in computer science) over business management.
