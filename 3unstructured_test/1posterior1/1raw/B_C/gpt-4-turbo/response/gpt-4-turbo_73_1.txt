Based on the personality sketch of Adam, here are estimated probabilities for his likely graduate fields:

- Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants may suggest an interest in sciences connected to these areas, such as environmental science, botany, or biology, rather than computer science. His enjoyment of puzzles and high intelligence could lean towards fields involving problem-solving and abstract concepts, which are relevant in computer science. However, the description does not directly suggest an emphasis on technology or computing.
  
- Similarly, the description does not particularly highlight interests or capacities typically aligned with business administration, such as finance, management, customer relationships, or business strategy. His warmth, empathy, and love for animals perhaps indicate he might be more aligned with fields requiring nurturing or conservational attributes, rather than business administration.

Here is the probability estimate:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
