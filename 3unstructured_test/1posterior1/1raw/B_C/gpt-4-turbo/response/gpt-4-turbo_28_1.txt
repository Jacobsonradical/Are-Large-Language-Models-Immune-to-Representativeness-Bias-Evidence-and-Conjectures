Based on the personality sketch of Adam, he shows attributes that can be associated with certain academic disciplines. His genuine curiosity about nature and plants, along with his love for animals, might suggest a propensity toward fields like biology, environmental science, or similar areas rather than computer science or business administration. However, his skills in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts align well with the intellectual demands of computer science.

Computer Science:
Adam's interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts pairs well with the problem-solving and theoretical aspects of computer science. These traits are typically beneficial in areas such as algorithm design, software development, and computational theory, which are integral parts of computer science.

Business Administration:
Although Adam has empathy and a warm heart, which are good traits for leadership and management, the description does not directly connect him with skills typically associated with business administration, such as an interest in managing people, strategic decision making, or financial acumen.
