Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, we can make some educated guesses regarding his potential fields of study. Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest a person more inclined towards fields related to natural sciences, environmental studies, or those requiring analytical and complex problem-solving skills such as computer science. His high intelligence and ability to grasp abstract concepts align well with the demands of computer science. 

In contrast, Business Administration typically aligns with interests in management, finance, organizational behavior, and possibly less with a deep curiosity about nature or a primary focus on puzzles and abstract concepts in the way they are described here. While empathy and a warm heart are great traits for any field, including business administration, they do not directly suggest a stronger inclination towards this field given the other characteristics mentioned.

Given this analysis, the estimated probabilities of Adam's enrollment in these fields could be assessed as follows:

{
  "computer science": "0.65",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

These values reflect a higher probability for computer science based on the personality fit and a lower probability for business administration, considering the described characteristics. The assigned probabilities allow for the consideration that there are many other potential fields where Adam could be enrolled.
