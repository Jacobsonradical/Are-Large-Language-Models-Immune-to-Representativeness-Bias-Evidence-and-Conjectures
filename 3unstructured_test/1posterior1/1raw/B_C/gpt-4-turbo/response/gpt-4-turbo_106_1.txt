Based on the personality sketch and interests detailed for Adam, we can infer the probability of his enrollment in each of the specified fields:

1. **Computer Science**: Given Adam's enjoyment in solving puzzles and his high intelligence, particularly his adeptness at understanding abstract concepts, there is a notable alignment with the skills often beneficial in computer science. The field typically requires strong analytical and problem-solving skills, which corresponds well with his traits. However, the description does not explicitly mention a direct interest in technology or programming, which are core aspects of computer science.

2. **Business Administration**: While business administration can benefit from someone who understands hard work and dedication, and empathy could aid in leadership and human resource roles, there is little in the description that directly ties Adam to an interest or aptitude specifically suited for business administration. His main interests appear to be more aligned with nature and possibly more analytical or scientific pursuits rather than purely business-focused areas.

Here are the inferred probabilities based on these considerations:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.2"
