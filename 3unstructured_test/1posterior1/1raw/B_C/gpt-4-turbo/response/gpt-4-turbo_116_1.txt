Given Adam's described interests and characteristics, here's an estimation of the probability for each field:

- His strong empathy, intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and deep love for animals suggest a potential inclination towards fields that involve complex problem solving, empathy, and perhaps technical or scientific understanding. 

- The interest in nature and plants might make him more aligned with environmental sciences, biology, or similar fields rather than computer science. However, his enjoyment in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts can be well aligned with computer science, which often requires abstract thinking and problem-solving skills.

- Business administration typically requires a combination of analytical skills, leadership qualities, and understanding of market mechanisms. Although he might have the intellectual capabilities for this, nothing specifically in the provided sketch strongly aligns with the typical interests or motivations leading to business administration, except a vague possibility linked to the mention of appreciating hard work and dedication, which can be crucial in business studies.

Based on these reflections:

{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

These probabilities reflect that while there's a chance Adam might be inclined towards these fields, other fields might also attract his interest significantly, considering his personality traits and identifiable preferences.
