Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam and considering the typical traits and interests associated with different fields of study, here is my estimation:

- Adam's interests in puzzles and high intelligence, alongside his ability to understand abstract concepts, align with some key skills that are beneficial in computer science which often involves problem-solving, programming, and dealing with abstract algorithms and data structures.

- Adam's strong empathy, deep love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication do not directly correlate with traditional skills or interests associated with business administration, which often focuses more on leadership, management, financial, and operational aspects of organizations.

Given this, the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field might be estimated as follows:

```
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

These values reflect a higher likelihood of Adam being in a program like computer science that suits his problem-solving abilities and intellectual interests, and a lower likelihood for business administration due to less alignment with his described personal traits and interests.
