Based on the provided personality sketch of Adam, which highlights his interest in nature, puzzles, empathy, and high intelligence suited for understanding abstract concepts, we can infer and estimate probabilities for his enrollment in specific graduate fields as follows:

1. **Business Administration**: While business administration might require strategic thinking, which resonates with puzzle solving, the personality traits described - deep interest in plants, animals, and more intellectual and abstract inclinations - do not strongly align with typical characteristics or interests seen in business administration students, who are generally more focused on leadership, management, economic, and financial aspects. Therefore, I estimate:
   - Probability Adam was enrolled in Business Administration: **0.1**

2. **Computer Science**: This field often attracts individuals who excel in abstract thinking and problem-solving, correlating well with his interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts. Furthermore, individuals with a strong technical and intellectual inclination, as demonstrated by Adam, often find the computational and theoretical aspects of computer science appealing. Therefore, I estimate:
   - Probability Adam was enrolled in Computer Science: **0.7**

Here is the response in the specified format:
