Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, his graduate field of specialization can be estimated by considering traits that typically align with particular fields of study. Here's the analysis:

1. **Computer Science:** Adam's traits such as being good at understanding abstract concepts and enjoying solving puzzles are quite indicative of a strong fit for computer science, which often requires high problem-solving skills and abstract thinking. Computer science also involves a degree of curiosity and intelligence, which Adam exhibits.

2. **Business Administration:** Although Adam shows strong empathy, warmth, and appreciation for hard work, these qualities are less directly correlated with the typical analytical and profit-oriented focus of business administration. His profile does not emphasize traits like leadership in business contexts or strong inclination towards managing financial or business processes, which are more central to business administration.

Given this analysis, here are the estimated probabilities:

```
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

These probabilities reflect a higher likelihood for Adam being enrolled in computer science due to his intellectual and problem-solving orientation, and a lesser, but still possible, alignment with business administration considering his appreciation for hard work and dedication, although these attributes are somewhat broader and less field-specific.
