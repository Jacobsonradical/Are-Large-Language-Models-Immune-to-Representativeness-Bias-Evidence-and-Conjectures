Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, we can infer certain preferences and skills that align with various academic fields.

1. **Interest in nature and plants**: This points more towards fields such as biology, environmental science, or botany, rather than business administration or computer science.

2. **Enjoyment in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts**: These traits are highly applicable to fields that involve analytical and problem-solving skills, such as computer science, mathematics, or engineering.

3. **Empathy and love for animals**: These personal traits lean more towards disciplines that involve care or understanding of living beings such as veterinary medicine, zoology, psychology, or perhaps social sciences.

Given these traits:
- **Business Administration**: This field generally requires a knack for leadership, management skills, and possibly an interest in economics, finance, or marketing, none of which are directly suggested in the description of Adam. Therefore, the probability here could be on the lower side.
  
- **Computer Science**: Given his high intelligence, enjoyment in solving puzzles, and strong understanding of abstract concepts, Adam shows compatibility with the analytical and logical thinking required in computer science.

Hereâ€™s a rough estimate:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

These are rough estimates based on the personality sketch shared and could vary in reality based on Adam's specific interests and academic pursuits not explicitly mentioned in the description.
