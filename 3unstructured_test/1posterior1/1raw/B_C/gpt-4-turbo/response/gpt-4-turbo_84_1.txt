Adamâ€™s strengths in understanding abstract concepts and puzzle-solving might make this field a suitable match. Moreover, computer science can sometimes touch on aspects of nature through simulations, environmental modeling, and studies related to animal movements or behaviors via programming, which could satisfy his curiosity about nature.
