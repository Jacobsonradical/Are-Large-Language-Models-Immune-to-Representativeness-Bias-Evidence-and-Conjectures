Given the personality sketch of Adam, here's an estimate of his probable fields of study:

- Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature suggest he may be inclined toward fields related to biology, environmental science, or veterinary studies rather than business administration.
- His love for solving puzzles and good grasp of abstract concepts hint towards an aptitude for areas involving problem-solving and analytical thinking, like mathematics, physics, or computer science.
- Business administration often attracts individuals interested in management, finance, and interpersonal aspects of running businesses, which doesn't directly align with the provided personality traits.

Considering these insights, here are the probabilities:

{
  "business administration": "0.1", 
  "computer science": "0.6"
} 

These estimates reflect that while it's less likely for Adam to have pursued a career in business administration relative to computer science, given his profile and the mentioned interests and skills. However, these are generalized assessments and, in real-world scenarios, individual choices can be influenced by a wider range of factors.
