Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, which highlights his curiosity about nature, a passion for solving puzzles, and a strong empathy with a deep love for animals, it can be inferred that his interests may align more closely with fields involving detailed analytical processes, abstract thinking, and possibly those intersecting with natural sciences or environmental studies. 

Considering computer science involves strong analytical skills, problem-solving, and understanding complex, abstract concepts, it could be a likely fit for Adam. However, his specific love for nature and animals might not directly align with typical computer science studies unless he specifically focuses on areas within computer science that intersect with biological sciences or environmental technology.

On the other hand, business administration typically involves skills in leadership, management, and organizational behavior. While this might leverage his empathy and probably analytical skills, it doesn't overtly link to his strong interests in nature and animals, nor does it directly relate to his interest in solving puzzles and dealing with abstract concepts in the same way computer science might.

Here’s an assessment based on Adam's described characteristics:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

This estimation reflects a higher probability for computer science due to the close match between the skills required in the field and Adam’s interests and abilities, while still acknowledging a lesser but possible fit with business administration.
