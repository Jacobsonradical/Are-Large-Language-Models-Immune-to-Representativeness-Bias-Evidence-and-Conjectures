Based on the personality sketch of Adam, he has a curious nature, affinity for problem-solving and puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts. These traits are highly consistent with the skills and interests often seen in students in scientific and technical fields, specifically those that involve analytical thinking, problem-solving, and a foundational understanding of complex systems.

"Computer Science" is a field that aligns well with being curious about systems (which could extend to computational systems), love for solving puzzles (like coding challenges and algorithm optimization), and understanding abstract concepts (a key component in fields like machine learning, software architecture, etc.).

On the other hand, "Business Administration" often attracts individuals interested in management, entrepreneurship, human resources, and the economic aspects of business operations. While Adam's empathy and understanding might play well into leadership roles within business, his described traits do not directly align with typical business administration interests such as finance, marketing, or operational management.

Thus, I estimate:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
