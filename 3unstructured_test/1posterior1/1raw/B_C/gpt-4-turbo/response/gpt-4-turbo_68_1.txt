Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, here are the estimated probabilities for each of the fields mentioned:

- **Computer Science**: Adam's interest in solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with the skills and traits commonly associated with students in computer science. These areas often require analytical thinking, problem-solving, and comprehension of complex theoretical concepts, which are strongly indicated in Adamâ€™s description. Therefore, I would estimate a higher probability for this field.

- **Business Administration**: While Adam demonstrates qualities such as empathy and a warm heart, which are beneficial in any field, these do not specifically align with typical core interests or skills directly related to business administration (such as a marked interest in leadership, management, finance, or strategic planning). His characteristics might imply a suitability for roles within organizations that focus on environmental or social impact within a business administration context, but less so for the field in general compared to computer science.

Here is the formatted answer:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
