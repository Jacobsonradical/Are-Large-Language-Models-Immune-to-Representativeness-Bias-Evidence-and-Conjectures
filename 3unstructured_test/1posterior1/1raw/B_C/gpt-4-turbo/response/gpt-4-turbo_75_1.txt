Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, the probability estimations for his graduate field of study in business administration and computer science can be considered as follows:

Given that Adam exhibits a strong inclination towards nature, puzzles, empathy, and has a good understanding of abstract concepts, one might argue his interests align more closely with fields that involve analytical thinking, innovation, and possibly technology. Computer science fits well with his love for puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, although his love for nature and animals might not directly relate (unless considering specializations like environmental informatics within computer science).

On the other hand, business administration generally requires strong interpersonal skills, strategic thinking, and a focus on operations, finance, or marketing, which might not directly correlate with Adam's described interests and personality traits. However, his capacity for hard work and understanding could prove advantageous in business studies.

Thus, the probabilities might be estimated as:

- Computer Science: Higher probability due to his analytical skills and inclination towards puzzles and abstract concepts.
- Business Administration: Lower probability due to less direct alignment with his primary interests (though still possible depending on his other, unmentioned, interests or motivations).

Here is the formulated assessment in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
