To estimate the probability that Adam, as described in the personality sketch, was enrolled in various fields, we'll need to consider the alignment of his interests and skills with typical requirements and focuses of these fields. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Computer Science**: This field often attracts individuals who are good at solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, as noted in Adam's description. Skills in problem-solving are highly relevant to computer science, especially in areas like algorithms and programming. However, his interest primarily in nature and plants is not directly related to typical computer science applications, though it could lead to specializations in computational biology or environmental informatics. Thus:
   - Probability: Moderate, considering his problem-solving and abstract thinking skills.

2. **Business Administration**: This field generally requires strong interpersonal skills, empathy, and an understanding of organizational dynamics. While Adam displays empathy and appreciation for hard work, his specific interests in nature and absence of explicit mention of entrepreneurial or managerial ambitions make this a less likely fit. Business administration is less focused on abstract concepts and more on practical and strategic thinking in a business context.
   - Probability: Lower, since the noted characteristics and interests align less directly with typical business administration studies.

Thus, bearing in mind that these estimations are somewhat subjective and based on generalized alignments between personality/interests and academic fields:
