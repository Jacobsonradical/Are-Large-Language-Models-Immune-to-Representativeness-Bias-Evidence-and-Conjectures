Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, here's an assessment of the likelihood of his enrollment in the specified fields of study:

- Computer Science: Given Adam's enjoyment in solving puzzles and high intelligence, particularly his ability to grasp abstract concepts, he fits well into areas that require problem-solving and analytical thinking skills. Computer Science often demands such skills, making it a plausible field for him.

- Business Administration: While Adam demonstrates empathy and a warm heart, which are excellent traits for leadership and management that are often central to business administration, there isn't a direct indication in the provided sketch that he is particularly drawn to business practices or management studies. His interests seem more aligned with analytical and possibly technical or scientific pursuits rather than business-focused studies.

Hence, the estimated probabilities are:
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
