Based on the personality sketch and academic interests you provided for Adam, here are the estimated probabilities of his enrollment in two specified fields of study:

- Adam's attributes such as high intelligence, being good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoyment in solving puzzles, align well with typical qualities beneficial in the field of computer science, which often requires abstract thinking and problem-solving skills. However, his deep interest in nature and plants might suggest a lesser alignment with the common focuses of a computer science program unless interconnected with environmental or biological computing fields.

- On the other hand, business administration generally requires strong interpersonal skills, an understanding of economics, marketing, or management, and a certain strategic mindset. While Adam does demonstrate empathy and a warm heart, these traits are slightly less directly related to typical core focuses of business administration studies unless he is aiming to integrate his love for animals and nature into a business-orientated endeavor (e.g., eco-tourism, sustainability-focused enterprises).

Considering these aspects, here's the estimate:

{
  "computer science": "0.25",
  "business administration": "0.15"
}

These probabilities reflect the broader typical coupes to Adam's noted characteristics with common themes and curriculums associated with these fields of study.
