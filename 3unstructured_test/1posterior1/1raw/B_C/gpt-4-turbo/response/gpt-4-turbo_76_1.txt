Given the personality sketch of Adam, we can determine the likelihood of him enrolling in specific fields based on how the described characteristics align with common interests and requirements of those fields. 

Adam's curiosity about nature and love for animals might incline him more towards fields related to biology or environmental science, rather than business administration, which typically aligns with interests in management, finance, and organizational behavior. Meanwhile, his enjoyment in solving puzzles and his high intelligence, especially in understanding abstract concepts, could indicate a potential fit with computer science, which often requires strong problem-solving skills and the ability to handle abstract thinking regarding algorithms and systems design.

Estimates based on the provided personality sketch:
{
  "business administration": "0.2",  // less likely due to lack of expressed interest in typical business skills and motivations
  "computer science": "0.7"  // more likely given his puzzle-solving inclination and comfort with abstract concepts
}

These probabilities are conjectural and based solely on the limited information provided in the personality sketch.
