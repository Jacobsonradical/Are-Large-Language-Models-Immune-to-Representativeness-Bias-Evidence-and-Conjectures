Based on the personality sketch of Adam, who appears to have an affinity towards nature, puzzles, and possesses high intelligence with an ability to understand abstract concepts, the probability estimations for his fields of study could be inferred as follows:

1. **Business Administration**: While business administration does require a level of intelligence and understanding of complex concepts, Adam's strong interest in nature and empathy towards animals does not directly correlate with typical traits or interests pursued in business administration studies. Based on these aspects, the likelihood might be lower. However, his appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable in this field.

2. **Computer Science**: This field often attracts individuals who enjoy solving puzzles and dealing with abstract concepts, as programming and system design involve significant analytical problem-solving and innovative thinking. Adam's profile fits well with these attributes, making it a potentially suitable field of study for him.

Hence, the estimated probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each of the mentioned fields could be represented as:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
