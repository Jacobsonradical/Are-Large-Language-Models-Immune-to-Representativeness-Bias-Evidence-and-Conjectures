Given the personality sketch of Adam, which highlights his strong empathy, love for animals, curiosity about nature, and an affinity for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, we can make some assessments regarding his likely fields of study. However, it's important to note that the predictions are highly speculative based on the given character traits and do not reflect any specific dataset or statistical information.

1. **Business Administration**: While business administration can indeed require high intelligence and an understanding of complex concepts, the direct interests and personality traits described (such as a focus on nature, animals, and puzzles) do not typically align strongly with business studies, which often focus more on management, finance, and market dynamics. Therefore, the probability of Adam studying business administration might be lower given the profile.
   
2. **Computer Science**: This field often attracts individuals who enjoy solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, elements strongly present in Adamâ€™s description. The methodical thinking and problem-solving aspects of computer science correlate well with his intellectual inclinations and hobbies. Therefore, Adam might be more likely to be enrolled in a computer science program given his characteristics.

Based on this analysis, here are the approximate probabilities:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.65"
}

These assessments are based purely on the personality sketch provided and common characteristics associated with these fields of study.
