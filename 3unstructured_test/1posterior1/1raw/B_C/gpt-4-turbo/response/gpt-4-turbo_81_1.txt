Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, which highlights his curiosity about nature, affinity for puzzles, and high intelligence, particularly in abstract concepts, we can attempt to estimate his likelihood of enrolling in specific graduate programs.

1. **Business Administration**: Generally, business administration programs heavily focus on managerial and financial skills, analytical problem-solving but less on nature or abstract concepts typical of physical or theoretical sciences. Adam's noted interests and skills might not directly align with typical business studies; however, strategic aspects of business and solving organizational puzzles could attract him.
   - **Estimated probability**: 0.2

2. **Computer Science**: This field often attracts individuals who enjoy puzzles and have the capacity for high intellectual and abstract thinking, which aligns well with Adamâ€™s described attributes. Computer science also allows for work on complex problems and can occasionally intersect with natural sciences through areas like bioinformatics, environmental informatics, or computational biology.
   - **Estimated probability**: 0.7

Therefore, the probability estimates formatted as requested would be:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
