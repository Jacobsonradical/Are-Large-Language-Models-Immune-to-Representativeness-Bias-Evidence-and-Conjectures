Based on the personality sketch provided, here's my estimate:

- The description suggests Adam has traits commonly associated with the natural sciences or technological fields, given his love for nature, strong problem-solving skills, and a deeper grasp on abstract concepts. However, his focus seems more centered on biological or environmental elements rather than purely technology or computational elements often associated with computer science.

- Business administration typically requires strong interpersonal skills, appreciation for teamwork, strategic decision-making, and often a competitive spirit, none of which are explicitly mentioned in Adamâ€™s description.

Therefore, my probability estimate would be:

{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.4"
} 

This reflects a lower probability for business administration due to lack of specific indications of interest or skills directly correlated with business study, and a moderate probability for computer science given his strong intellectual capacity and problem-solving abilities, although his specific interests might better align with fields like environmental science or biology.
