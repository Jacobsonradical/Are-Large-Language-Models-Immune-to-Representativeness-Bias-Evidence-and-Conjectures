Given Adam's traits and interests, it seems that he would likely lean towards a field involving analytical thinking, problem-solving, and possibly technology, due to his interest in complexities (i.e., puzzles and abstract concepts). Computer science often aligns with these interests and skills, thus the higher probability. On the other hand, his interests don't directly align with typical business administration roles—which often focus on management, finance, or marketing—hence the lower estimation for that field.
