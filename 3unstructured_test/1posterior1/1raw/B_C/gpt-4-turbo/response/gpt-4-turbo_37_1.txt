Given Adam's interests and personality, I will estimate the probabilities as follows:

- His love for solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts align well with the skills often utilized in computer science, especially when considering problem-solving and dealing with complex systems or algorithms.
- The personality sketch does not draw a straightforward connection between his traits and the typical skills or interests commonly associated with business administration, such as leadership, management, finance, or marketing.

Based on this analysis, my estimations are:

{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

These probabilities reflect that while there is a slight chance Adam could be interested in business administration, his traits and interests suggest a higher likelihood of him studying computer science.
