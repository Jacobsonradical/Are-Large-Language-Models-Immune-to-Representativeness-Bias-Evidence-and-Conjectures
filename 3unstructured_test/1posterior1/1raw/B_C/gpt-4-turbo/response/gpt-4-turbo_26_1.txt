Based on the personality sketch of Adam, his interests align more closely with fields that involve analytical thinking, abstract concepts, and perhaps a connection to natural elements. Computer science and business administration both require analytical skills and understanding abstract concepts, but they differ in focus.

Given what we know about Adam:

1. His genuine curiosity about nature and various plants might not directly correlate with computer science or business administration but could imply an inclination towards environmental sciences or biology. However, his enjoyment of solving puzzles and love for animals could suggest an affinity for scientific or mathematical fields like computer science, which often involves problem-solving skills.

2. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with computer science, which often deals with abstract theoretical concepts and complex problem-solving.

3. His empathy and warm heart, while admirable, aren't directly relevant to the core skills needed in computer science or business administration but could hint at his potential success in teamwork and collaborative environments, which are important in both fields.

4. His appreciation for hard work and dedication is a general trait that can apply to any field but is especially relevant in demanding fields like computer science and business.

Estimating from the general association of his traits and typical demands of the study fields:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}
```
These probabilities are influenced by his problem-solving skills and intellectual abilities, which are pertinent to both fields, though they could potentially be higher for computer science considering his specific interests and skills.
