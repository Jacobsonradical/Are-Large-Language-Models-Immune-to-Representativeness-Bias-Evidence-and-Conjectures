Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam has traits that align well with subjects requiring high intelligence, problem-solving skills, and an appreciation for complex, abstract concepts. His genuine curiosity about nature and a deep love for animals suggests interests that may also lead towards fields like environmental science, biology, or similar areas. However, these inclinations can sometimes align with computer science, especially in areas like artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science, which often engage with complex, abstract problems and can be applied to natural world studies. 

Given this analysis:

- The probability of Adam enrolling in "computer science" might be influenced moderately by his interest in puzzles and abstract concepts. Computer science involves significant problem-solving and often employs abstract thinking, particularly in fields like algorithm development or systems design.
- The probability of Adam enrolling in "business administration" seems less likely given the description. While business programs do require intelligence and an appreciation for hard work, the direct connection to his noted characteristics (like his nature curiosity and love for animals) is less clear without additional information linking him to organizational, leadership, or entrepreneurial interests.

Therefore, the estimates might look like this:

```
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

These estimations account for his described characteristics but remain conservative due to the wide range of possibilities in graduate studies and lack of explicit mention of his professional or academic aspirations beyond the sketch details.
