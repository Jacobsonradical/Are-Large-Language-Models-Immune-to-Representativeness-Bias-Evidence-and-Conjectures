Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam shows a strong inclination towards understanding and solving complex systems and abstract concepts, which aligns closely with typical characteristics of students in computational and analytical fields. His interest in puzzles and high intelligence could suggest a good fit for a field such as computer science, which demands a deep understanding of systems, logic, and abstract thinking.

On the other hand, while business administration does require analytical skills, it also heavily leans on interpersonal skills, strategic thinking in terms of business contexts, and often a focus on financial acumen and leadership. Although Adam has empathy and a warm heart, there is no direct mention of interests that align closely with typical business studies such as finance, marketing, or management.

Given these observations, I can provide the following probabilities:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

These values reflect a higher likelihood for Adam to be associated with a discipline like computer science due to his skill set and personal interests as described, whereas his fit for business administration, while possible, seems less probable based on the provided sketch.
