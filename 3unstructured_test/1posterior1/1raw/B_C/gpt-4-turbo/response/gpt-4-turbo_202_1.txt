Based on the given personality sketch of Adam, here is an estimation:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

Reasoning:
- Adam's interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence, along with his good understanding of abstract concepts, align well with skills beneficial in computer science, which often involves problem-solving and understanding complex systems.
- His interest in nature doesnâ€™t directly suggest a strong alignment with business administration studies, and while empathy and a warm heart are important in any field, they don't specifically correlate with business administration. Moreover, his interests do not explicitly align with typical business administration aspects such as finance, marketing, or management, suggesting a lower probability for this field.
