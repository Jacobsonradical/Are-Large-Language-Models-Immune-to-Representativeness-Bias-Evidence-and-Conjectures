From the personality sketch provided, we can infer certain traits and interests of Adam that may align with specific academic fields. Noteworthy is his curiosity about nature, a passion for solving puzzles, a deep love for animals, and a capacity for understanding abstract concepts. These traits can give us hints about the academic fields he might be pursuing.

1. **Business Administration**: Typically, a field such as business administration requires strong analytical skills, which aligns with Adam's puzzle-solving abilities. However, his mentioned interests leaning more towards nature, empathy, and animals do not directly correlate with the core competencies and focus areas of business administration, such as finance, marketing, or operations management. While he has empathy, which is valuable in management and leadership roles in business, the description provided does not heavily lean towards business-oriented activities or interests.

2. **Computer Science**: This field requires a strong ability to solve complex problems, often involving abstract and structured thinking, which aligns well with Adam's described abilities in puzzle-solving and understanding abstract concepts. Moreover, the nature of computer science, which can include computational biology, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, might appeal to his curiosity about nature and his intellectual capabilities.

Given these interpretations and without additional specific information:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",  
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

These estimations are based on the likelihood that Adamâ€™s skills and interests match typical demands and focus areas of these academic disciplines. Since the description does not definitively specify any direct links to either field, the probabilities reflect estimations based on the alignment of his personality traits and generic requirements of these fields.
