Based on the personality sketch provided, Adamâ€™s interests seem heavily inclined towards solving puzzles, a sign of analytical thinking, along with a curiosity about nature and a deep empathy for animals. His traits suggest a mind well-suited for disciplines that involve complex problem-solving, abstract reasoning, and potentially, elements that involve the natural world or scientific understanding.

Here's the assessment for the probability that Adam was enrolled in the specified fields:

- **Business Administration**: While Adam does possess intelligence and an appreciation for hard work and dedication, there is no specific mention of interest in management, finance, or entrepreneurial activities that would typically align with a business administration degree. His traits do not specifically correlate strongly with business administration but do not altogether rule it out. Given a lack of direct alignment, a reasonable probability can be estimated as somewhat low.

- **Computer Science**: This field often attracts individuals who enjoy puzzles and abstract thinking, both of which are traits displayed by Adam. Consideration for a computer science program includes problem-solving skills and an ability for deep analytical thinking, especially in areas like algorithms, computer theory, and systems programming, which might align well with Adam's personality and skills. There is a more significant likelihood that he might have pursued this closely related to his interests.

Responding in the requested format, the probabilities for Adam's enrollment in the fields of business administration and computer science are provided as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.65"
}
```

This assessment assumes other potential fields closely aligned with his interests, like environmental science, biology, or veterinary studies, which might also be highly probable but are not specified in your query.
