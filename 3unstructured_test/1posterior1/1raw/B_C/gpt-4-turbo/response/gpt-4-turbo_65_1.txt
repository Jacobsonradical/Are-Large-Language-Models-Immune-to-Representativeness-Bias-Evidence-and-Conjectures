Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam exhibits traits that are particularly relevant to the fields he might be studying. His passion for understanding abstract concepts and enjoying solving puzzles aligns well with typical characteristics of students who pursue degrees in fields requiring strong analytical and problem-solving skills, such as computer science. Moreover, his high intelligence further supports the likelihood of him studying in a technically demanding field like computer science.

Conversely, while business administration also requires a good intellect and understanding of complex concepts, the specific interests and personality traits described (such as a love for animals, nature, and a strong empathy) do not align as closely with the typical studies involved in business administration, which often focus more on management, finance, and human resources.

Considering this analysis, my estimates of the probability that Adam was enrolled in these fields are as follows:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
