Based on the personality sketch of Adam, we can infer certain aspects of his academic interests and potential graduate fields of study:

1. **Computer Science**: Adam's interest in solving puzzles and his high intelligence, along with his capability to understand abstract concepts, are traits often beneficial for a field like computer science, which involves problem solving, logical thinking, and understanding complex systems. His strong empathy and love for animals are somewhat less directly connected to the typical pursuits of computer science, but his general intellectual interests align well with this field.

2. **Business Administration**: A graduate program in business administration usually attracts individuals interested in leadership, management, strategic thinking, and business operations. Adam’s profile mentions his appreciation of hard work and dedication which could be relevant in business studies. However, his specific noted interests in plants, nature, puzzles, and abstract concepts do not strongly align with typical business administration studies.

Based on this analysis, here are the probabilities:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

This assessment gives a higher probability to computer science due to the alignment of Adam’s intellectual and problem-solving skills with the typical requirements of the field. The probability for business administration is lower because, although some aspects of his personality (like appreciation for hard work) are relevant, his specific interests and traits do not align as closely with typical business studies.
