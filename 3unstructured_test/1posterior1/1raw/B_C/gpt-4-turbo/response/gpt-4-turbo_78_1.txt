Given Adam's traits and interests, let's estimate his likelihood of being enrolled in either computer science or business administration. 

Adam's characteristics such as his high intelligence, knack for understanding abstract concepts, and enjoyment in solving puzzles align well with the skills beneficial for computer science. His genuine curiosity about nature and plants is less directly related but does show a trait of inquisitiveness that might be beneficial in research-oriented fields like computer science, where problem-solving and innovative thinking are key.

However, there's little in the given description that aligns directly with business administration. While empathy and understanding the importance of hard work and dedication are valuable in business, they don’t specifically point to a preference for business studies. Business administration generally appeals to those with a keen interest in organizational dynamics, entrepreneurship, or the business aspects of a company, none of which are detailed in Adam’s brief.

Based on these assessments:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
} 

This estimation reflects the stronger alignment of Adam's personality and abilities with computer science compared to business administration, but still allows for the possibility of either.
