Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, it appears he has strong interests and abilities that align more closely with particular fields of study. His curiosity about nature and plants, along with a warm heart and empathy toward animals, might suggest an inclination towards fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary studies, rather than fields primarily focused on technology or business. However, his capability for understanding abstract concepts and problem-solving could be highly applicable to computer science.

Conversely, his interests and described personality traits do not strongly suggest a direct alignment with business administration, which typically requires a focus on management, finance, and operational skills that were not highlighted in the provided description.

Let's prepare the probability estimation:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

These estimations consider the probability relative not just to his personality match, but also considering a broad population of graduate students, where fields like computer science are generally popular but might not be the most fitting given his interests in nature and animals.
