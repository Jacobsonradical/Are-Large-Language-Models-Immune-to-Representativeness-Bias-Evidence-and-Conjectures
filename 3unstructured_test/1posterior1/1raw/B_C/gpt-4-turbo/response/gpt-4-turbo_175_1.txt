Based on the personality sketch provided, here's an estimation of the probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the specified fields:

- Computer Science: Adam's interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts align well with studies in computer science, which often involves problem solving and abstract thinking especially in areas like algorithms and computational theory.

- Business Administration: There is less in the sketch that directly suggests a likelihood of Adam studying business administration. Business studies often focus on management, finance, and organizational behavior rather than the strong empathy and love for animals or a big focus on puzzles and nature which are more his traits.

Here are the estimated probabilities:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
