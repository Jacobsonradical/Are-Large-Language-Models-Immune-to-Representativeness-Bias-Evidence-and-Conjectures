Based on the personality sketch of Adam, which highlights his curiosity about nature, strong empathy, deep love for animals, and proficiency in understanding abstract concepts, one can make the following estimates regarding the probability of his graduate studies:

His curiosity about nature and love for animals may suggest a lean towards fields such as environmental science, biology, or veterinary studies, rather than computer science. His skills in understanding abstract concepts do align with computer science, but no specific inclination towards technology or programming is mentioned.

On the other hand, thereâ€™s little in the description that directly aligns with business administration, which often attracts individuals interested in leadership, finance, operations, or marketing.

Based on this analysis, the probabilities can be estimated as follows:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

These probabilities reflect a rough estimate based on the personality traits and interests described, with some potential for overlap in fields like environmental informatics or management of non-profits related to animal welfare, thus explaining the assigned probabilities rather than lower figures.
