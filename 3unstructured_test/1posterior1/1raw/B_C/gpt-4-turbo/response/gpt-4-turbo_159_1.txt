Given Adam's characteristics and interests as described, we can make the following educated guesses about his likelihood of studying in specific fields:

1. **Business Administration**: The details given about Adam do not directly relate to typical interests connected with business administration, such as a focus on management, finance, marketing, or organizational behavior. His deeper attractions lie in nature, puzzles, and abstract concepts, which are somewhat less directly aligned with core themes of business administration. Therefore, the probability he studies this field might be lower. 

2. **Computer Science**: Adam's love for solving puzzles and strong ability in understanding abstract concepts align well with computer science, which often involves problem-solving skills and comprehension of complex and abstract theories (like algorithms, programming, data structures). Hence, the probability of him being enrolled in computer science could be comparatively higher.

Here is the structured response based on this analysis:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.65"
} 

These are estimates based on personality traits and interests and should be viewed as approximations rather than definitive probabilities.
