Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, which includes his interest in solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts, it seems reasonable to assume he might gravitate towards a field that involves analytical and problem-solving skills. Computer science is a popular field for individuals who enjoy these types of challenges, as it involves a significant amount of problem-solving, logical reasoning, and understanding complex systems.

On the other hand, while business administration does require analytical skills, it often emphasizes interpersonal skills, management, and a broad understanding of business operations, which seems less aligned with Adam's described traits focused on puzzles, nature, and a love for animals. Although business programs do attract a diverse group of students, the specific interests and aptitudes described for Adam make it somewhat less likely that he would pursue a degree purely in business administration unless it intersected significantly with his other interests (such as sustainability, ecological economics, etc.).

Applying these considerations, here are the estimated probabilities:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

These estimates reflect a higher probability for computer science based on Adam's strong intellectual tilts towards problem-solving and abstract reasoning, while still acknowledging a possibility for business administration given its broad appeal.
