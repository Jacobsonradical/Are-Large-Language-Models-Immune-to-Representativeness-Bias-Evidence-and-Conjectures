Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, here is the estimated probability for the specified fields:

{
  "computer science": "0.65",
  "business administration": "0.10"
}

Rationale:
- Adam's interest in solving puzzles and his ability to understand abstract concepts could make computer science a likely field for him, as it often involves problem-solving and abstract thinking.
- His empathy, warmth, and love for animals might not directly align with the typical skills and interests required for business administration, which often centers around management, finance, and operational skills. Thus, this field seems less likely for him.
