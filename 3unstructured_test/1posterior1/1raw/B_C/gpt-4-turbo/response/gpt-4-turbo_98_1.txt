From the personality sketch provided, Adam shows traits that somewhat align with typical characteristics found in students of certain academic disciplines. His curiosity about nature and plants, his empathy, warmth, and love for animals suggest interests that may not directly align with traditional focuses in computer science or business administration. His enjoyment in solving puzzles and high intelligence might suggest an aptitude for computer science, as it often requires strong analytical and problem-solving skills.

However, his deep love and empathy towards animals, in combination with his interest in nature, might imply a stronger fit with fields such as biology, environmental science, veterinary studies, or other life sciences rather than computer science. Similarly, while business administration requires understanding complex concepts and appreciates hard work and dedication, Adam's specific characteristics do not strongly suggest a direct interest in business practices or corporate settings, unless there's a specific focus within business studies that would relate to his environmental interests.

Given these observations, the estimated probabilities might be formed as follows, keeping in mind that these are approximations based on personality characteristics:

{
  "computer science": "0.35",
  "business administration": "0.25"
}

This reflects a moderate probability for computer science due to his problem-solving skills and intelligence but a slightly lower probability for business administration, as his described qualities and interests less frequently align strictly with business studies, without more context suggesting a business focus related to his other interests.
