Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, we can infer probabilities for his enrollment in certain graduate fields. Adam's characteristics such as high intelligence, enjoyment in solving puzzles, and good understanding of abstract concepts suggest a likelihood of fitting well into fields that emphasize analytical and problem-solving skills. However, his genuine curiosity about nature and love for animals may suggest interest in fields related to the natural sciences or environmental studies. His empathy and strong dedication may align more with fields that involve personal interaction or social impact.

Considering these aspects in relation to typical graduate fields:

- **Computer Science**: This field requires high intelligence and abstract thinking which aligns well with Adamâ€™s characteristics of enjoying puzzles and understanding abstract concepts. However, there is less direct connection to his interests in nature and animals unless he focuses specifically on areas like bioinformatics or ecological modeling within computer science. 

- **Business Administration**: This field involves understanding complex organizational concepts and strategic thinking, which might appeal to someone good at understanding abstract concepts. However, Adam's characteristics do not heavily suggest a direct lean towards business administration unless combined with an interest in areas like nonprofit management or corporate social responsibility, which could connect to his empathy and dedication.

Estimates based purely on the personality sketch without additional information about Adam's specific academic interests or career goals would be:
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.15"
