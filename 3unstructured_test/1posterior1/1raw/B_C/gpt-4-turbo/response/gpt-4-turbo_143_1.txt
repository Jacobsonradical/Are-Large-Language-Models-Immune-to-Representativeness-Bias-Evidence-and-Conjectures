Given Adam's interests in abstract concepts, high intelligence, and his problem-solving abilities, it is plausible that he might choose a field where these skills are valued. While his attributes could suit various disciplines quite well, let's analyze the likelihood of him pursuing degrees in business administration or computer science.

1. **Business Administration:** Typically, business administration degrees appeal to individuals interested in leadership, management, finance, and the workings of the economy. Adam's described personality is more aligned with empathy, animals, and nature rather than the competitively driven, profit-focused traits often associated with business fields. However, his intelligence could make him capable of handling complex business concepts if he chooses to focus on areas like business ethics or nonprofit management, which might align better with his warm heart and empathy. Therefore, this possibility shouldn't be entirely dismissed.

2. **Computer Science:** This field demands a high aptitude for understanding complex and abstract concepts along with strong problem-solving skills, which aligns well with Adam's described intelligence and interests. The connection between computer science and puzzle-solving is strong, as programming and system design often involve the assembly and dissection of complex information structures. However, his primary interests being in nature and animals may suggest a less direct connection, unless he aims to specialize in areas like environmental informatics, using computational methods to solve environmental problems.

Based on these considerations, probabilities for Adam's field of study are estimated as follows:

{
  "business administration": "0.25",
  "computer science": "0.65"
}

These values reflect an assumption that while business administration could be a possibility due to a broader application of his skills, computer science is somewhat more aligned with his problem-solving capabilities and analytical interests, especially if applied to environmental issues.
