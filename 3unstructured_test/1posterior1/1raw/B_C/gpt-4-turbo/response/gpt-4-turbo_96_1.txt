Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have attributes that align more closely with fields involving analytical and logical thinking, problem-solving, and possibly a strong hands-on or conceptual relationship with nature or technology. Letâ€™s analyze the probabilities:

1. **Business Administration:** This field often attracts individuals with a strong interest in management, leadership, finance, entrepreneurship, or marketing. From the personality sketch, while Adam may possess the intelligence and understanding necessary for business administration, his described interests and demeanor (particularly a love for animals, nature, and solving puzzles) do not directly suggest a strong inclination towards typical business administration subjects.

2. **Computer Science:** This field involves significant problem-solving skills, logical reasoning, and often a relationship with abstract and systemic thinking, which seems consistent with Adam's interest in puzzles and strong grasp of abstract concepts. Additionally, technological fields can sometimes overlap with his interests in nature through areas like environmental informatics, simulation modeling, or data analysis concerning natural phenomena.

Considering these aspects:
```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```
These values are indicative probabilities based on the personality traits listed, without any definitive information about his actual field of study. This assessment assumes a stronger correlation between his traits and computer science, given his described attributes, and a lower but non-zero possibility for business administration.
