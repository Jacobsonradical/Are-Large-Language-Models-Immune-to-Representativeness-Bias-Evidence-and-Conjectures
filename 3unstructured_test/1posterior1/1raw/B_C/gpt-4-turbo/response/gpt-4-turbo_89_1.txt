Based on the personality sketch provided, we can infer certain probabilities for Adam's field of study as a graduate student. Adam's interests and skills may align variably with different academic disciplines.

1. Computer Science: Adam enjoys solving puzzles, which suggests he might enjoy problem-solving tasks that are often found in computer science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts would also be beneficial in this field, which often requires such skills for programming and algorithm development. However, there's no direct mention of an interest in technology or computing, which somewhat moderates the likelihood.

2. Business Administration: While Adam has shown empathy and a warm heart, characteristics that are beneficial in team and project management (important in business administration), there is no explicit indication of an interest in economic, financial, or managerial aspects that are central to business studies. His appreciation for hard work and dedication could be relevant, but it is a trait that could apply across many fields.

Given these considerations, here is an estimated probabilities:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

These estimations consider Adam's profile details while acknowledging uncertainty due to the lack of specific indications toward a particular field. The values reflect a higher probability for computer science given his analytical and problem-solving inclinations, and a lower probability for business administration, which, while plausible, is less directly suggested by the given personality traits.
