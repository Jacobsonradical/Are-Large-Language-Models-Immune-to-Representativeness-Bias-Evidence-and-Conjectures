Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, his interests and traits can inform a guess about his likely field of study. Adam has a warmth and empathy that might not align closely with typical stereotypes of graduate fields like business administration, which often requires a strong focus on management, finance, and operational effectiveness. 

On the other hand, his love for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts could make computer science a fitting choice, especially due to its problem-solving nature and dealing with abstract algorithms and systems design.

Here are the probabilities based on the description given:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

These estimates reflect that Adam is more likely enrolled in a field like computer science that aligns with his analytical skills and interests, whereas business administration may not entirely align with his described characteristics, although it's not entirely out of the question. Other fields related to natural sciences or animal studies might also be a fit but were not requested for probability estimation.
