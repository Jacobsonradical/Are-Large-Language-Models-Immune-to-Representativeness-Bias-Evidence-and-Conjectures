Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, it is possible to make some educated assumptions about the likelihood of his field of study in graduate school. Adam's interest in puzzles and abstract concepts, along with his high intelligence, might suggest a greater affinity for fields that involve problem-solving and analytical thinking. Computer science often involves these aspects, particularly in areas like algorithm development, software engineering, and artificial intelligence.

Meanwhile, his warm heart and strong empathy, along with his love for animals, do not necessarily align closely with the typical skill sets and interests generally associated with business administration, which often emphasizes skills in leadership, management, finance, and marketing.

Considering these traits, here's an estimate of the probability for each field:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",  // higher probability due to his problem-solving skills and interest in abstract concepts
  "business administration": "0.2"  // lower probability due to less direct correlation with his personal interests and skills
} 

These values reflect an estimated probability based on the personality sketch provided, and recognize that these are not definitive and Adam could be involved in other fields as well.
