Based on the personality sketch of Adam, which highlights his intelligence, love for puzzling, and appreciation for abstract concepts, it seems plausible that he may be drawn to fields that involve analytical and complex problem-solving skills. Computer science typically requires strong analytical abilities and often deals with abstract concepts in areas like algorithms and computer systems, aligning well with Adam's interests and skills.

On the other hand, business administration focuses more on management, finance, marketing, and human resources. Although this field might appeal to someone empathetic and with a warm heart, it doesn't directly leverage his noted love for puzzles or direct curiousness about nature, which might slightly lower the probability of him pursuing this field compared to computer science.

Thus, a rough estimation of the probabilities based on the provided personality sketch could look something like this:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
