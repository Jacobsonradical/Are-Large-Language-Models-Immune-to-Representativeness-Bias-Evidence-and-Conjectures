Given Adam's characteristics described in the personality sketch, here are the estimates:

- His genuine curiosity about nature and love for animals indicates an inclination towards disciplines involving environmental sciences, biology, or similar fields rather than business administration. Business administration generally attracts individuals who are keen on leadership, finance, operations, or marketing, which don't closely resonate with Adam's described traits.

- His enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence, particularly in understanding abstract concepts, could align well with a field like computer science, which often involves problem-solving skills and abstract thinking. Computer science students commonly engage with complex logical problems and theoretical concepts.

Considering this analysis, the probabilities can be estimated as follows:

{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
