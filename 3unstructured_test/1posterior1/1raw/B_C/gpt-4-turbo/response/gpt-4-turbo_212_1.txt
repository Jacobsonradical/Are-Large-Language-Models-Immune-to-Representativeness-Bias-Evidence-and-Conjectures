Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have interests and characteristics that align more traditionally with certain fields of study over others. His genuine curiosity about nature and plants, coupled with his problem-solving skills and intelligence, might suggest a natural fit with scientific or technical fields. His warm heart and empathy lean more towards professions involved in care or research for the well-being of others and environments. Given that, here’s an estimation of the probability that Adam could be enrolled in computer science or business administration:

- **Computer Science**: Adam’s enjoyment in solving puzzles and good understanding of abstract concepts align well with computer science, which often requires analytical thinking and problem-solving skills. However, his strong empathy and overarching interest in nature might not directly align with typical computer science programs unless specifically tailored towards environmental applications or similar interdisciplinary studies.
  
- **Business Administration**: Though business administration might benefit from his intelligence and abstract thinking, it generally requires a strong interest in management, finance, or entrepreneurial pursuits, none of which are directly mentioned in the personality sketch. His warm-heartedness and empathy might guide him towards areas within business that focus on social enterprise or ethical business practices, but this might be less likely unless explicitly combined with his other interests.

Considering these aspects, here is the estimated probability:

{
  "computer science": "0.45",
  "business administration": "0.25"
}

These probabilities reflect a rough estimate based on the personality and interest alignment, leaving significant room for interests in other specialized fields not discussed here.
