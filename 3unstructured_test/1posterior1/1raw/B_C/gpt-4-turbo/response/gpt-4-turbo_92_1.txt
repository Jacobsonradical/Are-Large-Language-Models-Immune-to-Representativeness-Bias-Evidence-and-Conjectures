Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, which highlights his curiosity about nature, love for animals, his ability to solve puzzles, and his aptitude for understanding abstract concepts, we can assess his possible fields of graduate study. He shows characteristics that may or may not directly align with typical traits expected in certain fields of study, such as business administration or computer science. Here is an estimate of the probability for each field:

1. **Business Administration**: Given that Adam's interests and characteristics seem more aligned with natural sciences, empathy towards living beings, and theoretical puzzles rather than the often market-oriented, profit-driven focus of business administration, the probability of him being enrolled in this field might be lower. However, skills in solving complex problems could still be an asset in this field.
   - Probability: 0.2

2. **Computer Science**: Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and strong grasp of abstract concepts suggests a good fit for computer science, which often deals with complex problem-solving and theoretical frameworks. Computer science also often intersects with other fields, including those studying natural phenomena through computational biology or environmental informatics, which could pique Adam's interest.
   - Probability: 0.7

These estimates consider Adam's personal interests and intellectual strengths, aligning them with the general skill set and focus typical of these academic disciplines.
