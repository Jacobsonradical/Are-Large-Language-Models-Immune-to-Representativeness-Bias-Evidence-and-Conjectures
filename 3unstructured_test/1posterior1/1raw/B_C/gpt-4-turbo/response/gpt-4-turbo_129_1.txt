Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, which highlights his curiosity about nature, love for puzzles and animals, empathy, and ability to grasp abstract concepts, here's an estimation of his likelihood to be enrolled in the specified graduate programs:

- Business Administration: This field typically attracts individuals who are interested in leadership, management, finance, and organizational operations. Given Adam's profile, which is more aligned with an interest in nature, puzzles (potentially suggesting analytical and problem-solving skills rather than business-focused interests), and abstract concepts rather than direct management or financial topics, he seems less likely to be in business administration.

- Computer Science: This field is well-suited for individuals who enjoy abstract thinking, problem-solving, and potentially, depending on the sub-field within computer science, an appreciation or application of natural patterns (such as in bioinformatics or artificial intelligence). Adam's interest in puzzles and ability to understand abstract concepts might make this field a better fit for him compared to business administration.

Considering these interpretations, here are the estimated probabilities:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.5"
}

These values are speculative based on Adam's described interests and characteristics and do not account for other factors that might influence his actual field of study.
