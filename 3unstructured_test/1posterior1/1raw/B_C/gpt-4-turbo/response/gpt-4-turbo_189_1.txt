Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, which emphasizes a strong affection for nature, solving puzzles, empathy, appreciation for animals, adeptness with abstract concepts, and an inclination toward understanding and valuing hard work and dedication, we can make the following estimations:

1. **Computer Science**: Adam's proclivity for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with disciplines that require analytical thinking and problem-solving skills. Computer science strongly focuses on these aspects, hence he might show an interest in this field due to its technical and often abstract nature, which could appeal to his intellectual curiosity and puzzle-solving inclination.
   
2. **Business Administration**: While business administration requires a good understanding of concepts and dedication, it generally has a more interpersonal and practical focus compared to computer science, including management, finance, marketing, etc. Adamâ€™s characteristics don't strongly suggest an inclination toward business administration as it does not deeply connect with his described interest in nature or animals nor heavily lean on abstract concepts or puzzle-solving.

Given these inferences, the estimates for each field would likely look something like this:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

Note: These values do not sum to 1 as there are many other fields of postgraduate study that Adam might be engaged in. The values reflect the relative likelihood of him being enrolled in each of these two fields given the personality sketch provided.
