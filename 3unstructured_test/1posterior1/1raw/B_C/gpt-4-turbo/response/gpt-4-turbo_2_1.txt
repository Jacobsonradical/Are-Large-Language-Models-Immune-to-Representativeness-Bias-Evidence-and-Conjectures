Given the personality sketch of Adam, which emphasizes his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and a strong inclination towards solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, we can speculate about his likely field of graduate studies.

- **Business Administration:** Typically, this field attracts individuals interested in management, finance, economics, and business operations. While it's possible for a person of any background and interest to enroll in business administration, based on the given description of Adamâ€™s interests and personality traits, it doesn't strongly align with the typical profile of a business administration student, who often focuses more on entrepreneurial activities, business strategies, and finance. Since the description does not imply a strong inclination towards these areas, the probability might be lower.
- **Computer Science:** This field tends to attract individuals with strong analytical skills, problem-solving capabilities, and a fondness for abstract concepts and technology. Given Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his aptitude for understanding abstract ideas, this field appears more aligned with his described characteristics. Moreover, computer science could also encompass facets of artificial intelligence and robotics, which might align with his interest in nature through bio-inspired computing or related areas. Therefore, his probability of being in computer science may be higher.

Considering these assessments, here is an estimation:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

These values reflect an interpretation of Adam's personality sketch and typical student profiles of these fields; actual probabilities could differ based on additional information not provided in the sketch.
