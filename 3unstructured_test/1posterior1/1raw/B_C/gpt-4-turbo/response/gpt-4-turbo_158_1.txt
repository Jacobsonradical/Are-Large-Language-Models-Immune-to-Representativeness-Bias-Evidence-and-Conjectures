Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, we can infer his likely fields of graduate study by considering aspects such as his interests and intellectual strengths. Adam's strong interest in nature, empathy, love for animals, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest a propensity towards fields that involve complex thinking, possibly with a connection to life sciences, technology, or environmental studies. However, without explicit mention of business or technology preferences, estimating the likelihood for business administration or computer science requires considering general interest links and patterns.

1. **Business Administration**: Often appeals to individuals with an interest in leadership, management, strategy, and operational dynamics of businesses. Adam's profile does not directly reflect a clear alignment with typical business studies; there are no direct indications of interest in economic, administrative, or managerial aspects from the given description.

2. **Computer Science**: Could be a fitting choice for someone who enjoys puzzles and has a high capacity for understanding abstract concepts, indicating strong analytical and problem-solving skills. This field could align well with his intellectual interests, particularly if he leverages computational methods to explore natural phenomena or biological systems.

Based on these considerations, here are the estimates:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

These values are subjectively estimated, primarily reflecting Adam's described interests and how typically these might correlate with fields of study, rather than relying on specific statistical data. The value for computer science is significantly higher than for business administration, suggesting a stronger fit based on Adam's characteristics.
