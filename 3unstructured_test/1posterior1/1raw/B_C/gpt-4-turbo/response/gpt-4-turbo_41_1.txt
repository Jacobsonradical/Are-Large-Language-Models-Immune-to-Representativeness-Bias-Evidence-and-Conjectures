Based on the personality sketch of Adam, we can infer specific affinities and interests that may align more closely with certain graduate fields. Adam's interest in puzzles and abstract concepts suggests a strong analytical capacity, which aligns well with a discipline like computer science. Computer science typically requires a robust understanding of complex, abstract theories and systems, and a curiosity about how things work, which might reflect his curiosity about nature. His high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts further support the likelihood of him being enrolled in a field that values these characteristics.

On the other hand, business administration often emphasizes skills in leadership, strategic thinking, and a keen interest in organizational or market dynamics. While Adam's empathy and warmth could be beneficial in a business environment, the description does not directly correlate with a marked interest in economic or business-oriented activities.

With these considerations in mind, the estimates can be formed as follows:

{
  "computer science": "0.75",
  "business administration": "0.25"
}

These estimates reflect a higher probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science due to a clear alignment with his qualities and interests, whereas a possibility exists for business administration but seems less likely from the given description.
