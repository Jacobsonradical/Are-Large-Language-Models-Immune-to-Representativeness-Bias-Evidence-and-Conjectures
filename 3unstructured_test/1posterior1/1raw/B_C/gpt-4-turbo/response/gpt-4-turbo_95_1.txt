Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, which highlights his strengths and interests:

- Adam's curiosity about nature and love for animals could indicate a leaning towards fields related to biology, environmental studies, or similar areas. However, his love for solving puzzles and high intelligence, particularly in understanding abstract concepts, could also align well with disciplines like computer science, which demands strong analytical and problem-solving skills.

- The description doesn't explicitly align with typical interests that lead to business administration. This field often attracts individuals keen on leadership, strategic planning, financial acumen, and a strong interest in business operations, none of which are directly mentioned in the sketch.

Given this information, here are the estimated probabilities:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.1"
