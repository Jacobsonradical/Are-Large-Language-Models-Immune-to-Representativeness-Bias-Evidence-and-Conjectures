Based on the personality sketch of Adam provided, here are the estimates for his possible fields of study:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

These estimates consider that Adam's intelligence, problem-solving skills, and interest in abstract concepts align well with the skills typically useful in computer science. Moreover, computer science often requires understanding complex and abstract theoretical concepts, which matches Adam's attributes. Business administration, while potentially benefiting from his high intelligence and empathy in management roles, seems slightly less likely given the specific interests and skills highlighted in the description.
