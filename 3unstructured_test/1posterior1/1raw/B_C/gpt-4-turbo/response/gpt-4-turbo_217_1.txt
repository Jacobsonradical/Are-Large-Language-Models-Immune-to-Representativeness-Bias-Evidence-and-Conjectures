Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam has traits that suggest he might be aligned with fields that heavily involve analytical thinking, problem-solving, and potentially a connection to nature or scientific curiosity. Below is the estimation of the probability for the fields mentioned:

- **Computer Science**: Given Adam's proclivities for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, there is a significant likelihood that he would be involved in a field like computer science, which values and requires such skills. The inclination towards logical thinking and potentially technology or algorithmic processes also supports this. I would estimate this probability at a moderate to high level.
  
- **Business Administration**: While empathy and a warm heart are important in any field, these traits do not directly align with the core activities typical of business administration, which often involves leadership, management, and economic understanding. However, his intelligence and appreciation for hard work could certainly be advantageous in a business setting. Nevertheless, there's less in the personality sketch that directly correlates with the typical motivations for pursuing a degree in business administration compared to a field directly engaging with puzzles and abstract thinking. Thus, the probability is lower in this case.
