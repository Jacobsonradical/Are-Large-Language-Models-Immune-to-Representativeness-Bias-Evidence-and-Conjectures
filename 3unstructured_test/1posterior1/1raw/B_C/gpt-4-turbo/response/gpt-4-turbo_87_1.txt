Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have a strong inclination towards analysis, problem-solving, and abstract concepts. His curiosity about nature and plants might suggest an interest in areas that intersect with biology, environmental science, or similar fields. However, given his strengths in understanding abstract concepts and problem-solving, there is a reasonable possibility that he could be involved in a field like computer science, which heavily involves these skills.

Business administration, though a popular choice among graduate students, might not align as closely with his described interests and characteristics unless there is a particular focus within the business program that relates to his passion for nature and animals, such as sustainability in business.

Here are the estimated probabilities based on the information provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.65",
  "business administration": "0.25"
} 

These probabilities reflect a higher likelihood for Adam to be in a field like computer science, which typically requires strong analytical and problem-solving skills, and a lower (but still possible) likelihood for business administration unless his focus aligns with his personal interests and empathy.
