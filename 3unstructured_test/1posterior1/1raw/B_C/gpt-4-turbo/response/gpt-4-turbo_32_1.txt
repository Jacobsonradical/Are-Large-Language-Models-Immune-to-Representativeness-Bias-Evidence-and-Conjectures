Given the personality sketch and the interests of Adam, here’s an estimate of the probability that he was enrolled in each of the specified fields:

- **Computer Science**: Adam’s enjoyment of solving puzzles and his ability in understanding abstract concepts align well with the skills beneficial for a computer science program. Many aspects of computer science involve problem-solving and dealing with abstract theories, which might attract someone like Adam.

- **Business Administration**: Although business administration can benefit from strong intelligence and an understanding of complex concepts, Adam’s specific interests in nature, plants, and animals do not directly correlate with common themes in business studies. Furthermore, there isn't a direct indication of an interest in areas typically associated with business studies, such as finance, marketing, leadership, or entrepreneurial activities.

Here is the estimated probability for each field:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.2"
