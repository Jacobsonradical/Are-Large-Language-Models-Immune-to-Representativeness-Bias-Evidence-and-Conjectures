Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's fields of study:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.6)**: Adam's strong intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with the skills required for computer science. His genuine curiosity and quiet nature also fit the stereotype of someone who might be drawn to the more technical and analytical aspects of computer science.
- **Business Administration (0.2)**: While Adam's strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business administration, the other aspects of his personality (such as his love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles) do not strongly correlate with this field. Therefore, the probability is lower.
