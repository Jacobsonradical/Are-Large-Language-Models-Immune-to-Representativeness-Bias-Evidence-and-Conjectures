```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.6)**: Adam's strong intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with the skills required for computer science. His curiosity and analytical mind are also good indicators for this field.
- **Business Administration (0.2)**: While Adam has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication, which are valuable in business, his personality traits such as a love for nature, animals, and quiet activities like puzzle-solving do not strongly correlate with typical business administration interests. Therefore, the probability is lower.
