Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's fields of study:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration (0.2)**: While Adam's traits such as empathy and appreciation for hard work could be beneficial in business, his strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, and interest in abstract concepts suggest that his primary interests might lie elsewhere.
- **Computer Science (0.6)**: Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with the skills required for computer science. His quiet nature also fits the stereotype of someone who might enjoy the more solitary aspects of programming and theoretical computer science.
