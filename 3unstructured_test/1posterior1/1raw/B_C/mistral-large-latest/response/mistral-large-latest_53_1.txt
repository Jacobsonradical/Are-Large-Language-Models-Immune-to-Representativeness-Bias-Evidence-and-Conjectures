Based on the personality sketch provided, here are my estimated probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration (0.2)**: While Adam's profile doesn't strongly indicate an interest in business, it's possible, hence a low but non-zero probability.
- **Computer Science (0.6)**: Adam's aptitude for solving puzzles, understanding abstract concepts, and his high intelligence suggest a higher likelihood of him being in a field like computer science.
