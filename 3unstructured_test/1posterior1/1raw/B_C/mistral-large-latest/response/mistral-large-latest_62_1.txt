Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's fields of study:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

Explanation:
- Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, his love for animals, and his strong empathy suggest a leaning towards fields that might involve environmental or biological sciences, rather than business administration. Hence, the lower probability for business administration.
- His high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with the demands of computer science, leading to a higher probability for this field.
