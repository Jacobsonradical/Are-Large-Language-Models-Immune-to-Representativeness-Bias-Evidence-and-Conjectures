Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's fields of study:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.6
}

Explanation:
- Adam's strong intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving skills align well with the demands of computer science, hence the higher probability.
- While business administration is a possibility, his interests in nature, animals, and empathetic nature do not strongly indicate a pursuit in this field, hence the lower probability.
