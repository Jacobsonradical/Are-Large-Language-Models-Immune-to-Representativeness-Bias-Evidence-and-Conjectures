- **Computer Science (0.6)**: Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with the skills required for computer science. His quiet nature also fits the stereotype of individuals who excel in this field. Therefore, there is a higher probability that he was enrolled in computer science.
