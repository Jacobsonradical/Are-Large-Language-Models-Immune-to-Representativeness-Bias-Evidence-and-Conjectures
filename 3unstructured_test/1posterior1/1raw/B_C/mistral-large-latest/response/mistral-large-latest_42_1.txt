Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's fields of study:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.6
}

Explanation:
- Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication do not strongly correlate with the field of business administration, hence the lower probability of 0.2.
- His high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest a stronger fit with computer science, hence the higher probability of 0.6.
- The remaining probability (0.2) accounts for other graduate fields of specialization that might align with Adam's interests and skills, such as environmental science, biology, or psychology.
