```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.6)**: Adam's strong intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with the skills required for computer science. Additionally, his quiet nature might be more suited to the often solitary work involved in programming and theoretical computer science.
- **Business Administration (0.2)**: While Adam's empathy and appreciation for hard work could be beneficial in business, his interests in nature, animals, and puzzles, as well as his quiet demeanor, do not strongly indicate a preference for business administration. This field typically requires strong interpersonal skills, leadership, and a focus on organizational dynamics, which are not explicitly highlighted in his personality sketch.
