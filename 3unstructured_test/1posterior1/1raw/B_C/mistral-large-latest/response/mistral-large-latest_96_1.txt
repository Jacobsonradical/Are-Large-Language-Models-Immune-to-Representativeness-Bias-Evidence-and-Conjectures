Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.6)**: Adam's strong intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with the skills required for computer science. His curiosity and analytical mind are also good indicators for this field.
- **Business Administration (0.2)**: While Adam has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication, which are valuable in business, his personality traits such as empathy, love for nature and animals, and quiet demeanor do not strongly suggest a business-oriented focus. Therefore, the probability is lower.
