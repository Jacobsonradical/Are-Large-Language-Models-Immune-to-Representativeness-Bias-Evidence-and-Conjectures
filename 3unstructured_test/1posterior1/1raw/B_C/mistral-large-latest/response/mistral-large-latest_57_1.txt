Based on the personality sketch provided, here are my estimated probabilities for Adam's fields of study:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.6)**: Adam's strong intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with the skills required for computer science. Additionally, his appreciation for hard work and dedication fits the demanding nature of this field.
- **Business Administration (0.2)**: While Adam's empathy and warmth could be beneficial in business, the personality sketch does not highlight characteristics typically associated with business administration, such as leadership, extroversion, or a strong interest in management or entrepreneurship. Therefore, the estimated probability is lower.
