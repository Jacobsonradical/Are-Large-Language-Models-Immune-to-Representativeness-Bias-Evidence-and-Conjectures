Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's fields of study:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration (0.2)**: While Adam's traits such as understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be relevant, his strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, and interest in abstract concepts do not strongly align with typical business administration interests.
- **Computer Science (0.6)**: Adam's high intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and ability to understand abstract concepts are all traits that align well with computer science. His curiosity and empathy could also be channeled into fields like AI ethics or computational biology, making this a more likely field of study.
