Based on the personality sketch provided, here are my estimated probabilities for Adam's fields of study:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.6
}

Explanation:
- Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest a leaning towards scientific or environmental fields rather than business administration. However, his appreciation for hard work and dedication might make him suitable for any challenging field, hence a low but non-zero probability for business administration.
- His high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment in solving puzzles align well with the problem-solving and analytical skills required in computer science, hence a higher probability for this field.
