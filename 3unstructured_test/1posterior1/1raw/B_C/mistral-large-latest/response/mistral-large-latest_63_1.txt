Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's fields of study:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration (0.2)**: While Adam's traits such as understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be useful in business, his strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, and preference for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts suggest that his interests might lie more in scientific or analytical fields rather than business administration.

- **Computer Science (0.6)**: Adam's high intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and ability to understand abstract concepts are well-aligned with the skills required for computer science. His quiet nature and strong empathy also fit well with the often collaborative yet individual-focused nature of work in this field.
