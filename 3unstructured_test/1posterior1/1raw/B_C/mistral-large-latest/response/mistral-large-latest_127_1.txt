Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's fields of study:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.6)**: Adam's genuine curiosity, enjoyment in solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with the skills and interests typical of computer science students.
- **Business Administration (0.2)**: While Adam's empathy and appreciation for hard work could be relevant, the personality sketch does not highlight traits typically associated with business administration, such as leadership, strategic thinking, or a strong interest in organizational management. Therefore, the probability is lower.
