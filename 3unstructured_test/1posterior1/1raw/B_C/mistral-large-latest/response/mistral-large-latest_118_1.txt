Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's fields of study:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.6)**: Adam's genuine curiosity, strong intelligence, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with the problem-solving and analytical skills required in computer science. His appreciation for abstract concepts also supports this field.
- **Business Administration (0.2)**: While Adam's empathy and appreciation for hard work could be beneficial in business, the personality sketch does not highlight traits typically associated with business administration, such as leadership, strategic thinking, or a strong interest in organizational management. Therefore, the probability is lower.
