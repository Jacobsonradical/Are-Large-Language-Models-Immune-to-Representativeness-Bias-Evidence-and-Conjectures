Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's fields of study:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.6)**: Adam's genuine curiosity, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with the skills required for computer science. His enjoyment of solving puzzles also suggests a logical and problem-solving mindset, which is common in computer science.
- **Business Administration (0.2)**: While Adam's strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication could apply to business administration, his quiet nature, love for animals, and interest in nature and plants do not strongly correlate with typical traits associated with business administration. Therefore, the probability is lower.
