Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's fields of study:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration (0.1)**: While Adam's traits such as understanding and appreciation for hard work could be relevant, his strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, and interest in abstract concepts do not strongly align with business administration.
- **Computer Science (0.4)**: Adam's high intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest a higher likelihood of him being enrolled in computer science. However, his strong empathy and love for nature and animals might also point towards fields like environmental science or biology, which is why the probability is not higher than 0.4.
