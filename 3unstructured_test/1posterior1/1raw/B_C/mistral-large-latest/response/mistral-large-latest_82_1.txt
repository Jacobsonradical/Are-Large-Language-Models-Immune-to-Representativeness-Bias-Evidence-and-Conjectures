Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's fields of study:

```json
{

- **Computer Science (0.6)**: Adam's genuine curiosity, strong intelligence, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with the skills and interests typical of computer science students. His ability to understand abstract concepts is also a strong indicator.
- **Business Administration (0.2)**: While Adam's strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be relevant, his interests in nature, animals, and puzzles do not strongly correlate with typical business administration traits. Therefore, the probability is lower.
