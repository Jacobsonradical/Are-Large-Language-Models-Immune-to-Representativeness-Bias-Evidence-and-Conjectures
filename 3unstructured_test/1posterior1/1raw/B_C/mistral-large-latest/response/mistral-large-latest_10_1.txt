Based on the personality sketch provided, here are my estimated probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.6)**: Adam's affinity for solving puzzles, understanding abstract concepts, and his high intelligence suggest that he might be well-suited for computer science, which often involves problem-solving and abstract thinking.
- **Business Administration (0.2)**: While Adam's empathy and appreciation for hard work could be applicable in business, the field typically requires strong interpersonal and leadership skills, which are not explicitly highlighted in his personality sketch. Therefore, the probability is lower.
