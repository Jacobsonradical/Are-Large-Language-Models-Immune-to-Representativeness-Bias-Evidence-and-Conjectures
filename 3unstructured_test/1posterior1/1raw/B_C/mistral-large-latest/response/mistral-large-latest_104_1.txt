Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's fields of study:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.6
}

Explanation:
- Adam's strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication, as well as his high intelligence, could make him suitable for business administration. However, his personality sketch does not highlight key traits typically associated with business administration, such as leadership, extraversion, or a focus on management and organizational skills. Hence, the probability is estimated to be 0.2.
- Adam's genuine curiosity, strong empathy, deep love for animals, and enjoyment of solving puzzles, along with his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, align more closely with fields that require analytical and problem-solving skills, such as computer science. Therefore, the probability is estimated to be higher at 0.6.
