Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's fields of study:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.6)**: Adam's strong intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with the skills required for computer science. His genuine curiosity and quiet nature also fit the stereotype of a computer science student.
- **Business Administration (0.2)**: While Adam's strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business administration, his personality traits such as quietness, love for nature and animals, and interest in puzzles do not strongly indicate a business-oriented mindset. Therefore, the probability is lower.
