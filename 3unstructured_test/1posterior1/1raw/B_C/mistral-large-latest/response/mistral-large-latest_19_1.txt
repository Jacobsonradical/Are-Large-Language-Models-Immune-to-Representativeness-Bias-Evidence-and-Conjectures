Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's fields of study:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.6)**: Adam's genuine curiosity, enjoyment in solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with the skills and interests typical of computer science students.
- **Business Administration (0.2)**: While Adam's warm heart, empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication are valuable in any field, these traits do not specifically point towards business administration as strongly as they do towards computer science. Therefore, the probability is lower but still possible.
