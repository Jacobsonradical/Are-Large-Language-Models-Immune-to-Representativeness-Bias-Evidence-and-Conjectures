{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.6)**: Adam's affinity for solving puzzles, understanding abstract concepts, and his high intelligence suggest that he might be drawn to a field like computer science, which involves problem-solving and abstract thinking.
- **Business Administration (0.2)**: While Adam appreciates hard work and dedication, which are valuable in business, his personality traits such as his love for nature, animals, and quiet demeanor do not strongly indicate a leaning towards business administration. Hence, a lower probability is assigned.
