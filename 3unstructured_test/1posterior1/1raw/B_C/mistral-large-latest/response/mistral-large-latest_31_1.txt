Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's fields of study:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.6)**: Adam's traits such as high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with the skills required for computer science. His curiosity and analytical mind also support this field.
- **Business Administration (0.2)**: While Adam has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication, which are valuable in business, his personality sketch does not highlight traits typically associated with business administration, such as leadership, strategic thinking, or interest in organizational management. Therefore, the probability is lower.
