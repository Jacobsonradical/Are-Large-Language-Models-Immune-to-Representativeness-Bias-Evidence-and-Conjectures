Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts strongly suggest an affinity for computer science.  
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, the personality sketch lacks strong indicators typically associated with business interests (e.g., leadership, ambition for financial success, strong communication skills). 

**Important Note:** This assessment is based on limited information and relies on general stereotypes.  Individual personalities and career choices are far more complex.
