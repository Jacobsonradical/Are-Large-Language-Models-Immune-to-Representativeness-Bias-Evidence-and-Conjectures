Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality description:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (Higher Probability):**
    * **Problem-solving:** Adam's love for puzzles aligns strongly with the problem-solving nature of computer science. 
    * **Abstract thinking:** His ability to grasp abstract concepts is essential for programming and theoretical computer science.
    * **Intelligence:** A high intelligence level is generally beneficial in the demanding field of computer science.

* **Business Administration (Moderate Probability):**
    * **Empathy and understanding of hard work:** These traits are valuable in business settings involving teamwork and leadership.
    * **Less direct correlation:** The personality sketch doesn't have strong indicators directly related to business concepts like finance or marketing.

**Important Notes:**

* **Personality is not destiny:** While personality traits offer clues, they don't guarantee specific career choices. Many other factors influence graduate school decisions.
* **Sub-fields:** There's a wide range within both disciplines.  Adam's interest in nature might lead him to specialize in areas like bioinformatics (within computer science) or sustainable business practices (within business administration). 
* **Individual variation:**  People are complex! There are always exceptions, and someone with Adam's traits could thrive in many different fields.
