Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts aligns well with computer science. His high intelligence further supports this possibility. However, his love for nature and animals might suggest other interests.  A 0.4 probability reflects this balance.
* **Business Administration:**  While Adam likely possesses the intelligence for business, his personality description lacks strong indicators of interest in the corporate world or finance. His empathy and love for animals might even point away from more cutthroat aspects of business. A 0.1 probability reflects this lower likelihood. 

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches offer limited information. Other fields related to biology, environmental science, or even animal care could be stronger possibilities for Adam.
