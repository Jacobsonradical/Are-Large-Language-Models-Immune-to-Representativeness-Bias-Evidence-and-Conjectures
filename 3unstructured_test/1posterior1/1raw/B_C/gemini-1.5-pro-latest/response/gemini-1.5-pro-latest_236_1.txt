Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (0.6):**  Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication all strongly align with a computer science student profile. 
* **Business Administration (0.2):** While some aspects of Adam's personality (like intelligence) are useful in business, there's nothing in the sketch that specifically suggests an interest in business administration. His love for nature and animals might even suggest a preference for fields outside of traditional business. 

**Important Note:** This is just an estimate based on a limited personality sketch.  Many other graduate fields could be a good fit for Adam. For a more accurate assessment, we'd need more information about his interests, skills, and aspirations.
