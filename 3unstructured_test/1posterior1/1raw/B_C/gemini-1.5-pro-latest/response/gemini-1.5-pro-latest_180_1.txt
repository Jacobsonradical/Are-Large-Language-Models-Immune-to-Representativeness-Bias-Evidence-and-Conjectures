Here's a breakdown of how we can assess the probabilities based on the information given:

**Analysis:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's profile (puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, high intelligence) strongly aligns with traits often found in computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:**  While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business,  the description emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature. These traits are not as strong of indicators for business administration.

**Probabilities:**

Considering this:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on limited information.  Many other fields could also be a good fit for Adam (e.g., biology, environmental science, data science).
