Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, his core interests in nature, puzzles, and abstract concepts don't strongly align with a typical business administration program. 
* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his ability to understand abstract concepts are strong indicators of a potential interest in computer science. This field often attracts individuals with these traits.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are speculative. Personality sketches offer limited insight into actual career choices. Many other factors (personal experiences, financial considerations, specific program offerings) influence a person's field of study.
