Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts correlate well with skills valuable in computer science.  
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applied to business, his personality sketch lacks strong indicators like an interest in leadership, management, or finance that would be more common in a prospective business administration student. 

**Important Note:** These are just estimates based on limited information.  Many other fields could be equally or even more likely for Adam. For example:

* **Biology/Ecology:**  His love for nature and plants makes these fields strong contenders. 
* **Mathematics/Physics:** His puzzle-solving skills and grasp of abstract concepts could lead him here. 
* **Veterinary Science:** His deep love for animals could be a significant motivator.
