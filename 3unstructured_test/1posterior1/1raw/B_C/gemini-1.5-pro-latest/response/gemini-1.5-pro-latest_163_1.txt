**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts align well with computer science. His high intelligence further supports this possibility. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and work ethic are valuable in business, Adam's personality sketch doesn't show a strong indication of interest in business-related concepts. His empathy and love for animals might even suggest a preference for fields less focused on corporate environments. 

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are estimations based on limited information.  Many other fields could be equally or even more likely for Adam.  For example:

* **Biology/Ecology:**  His love of nature and plants would make these fields strong contenders.
* **Veterinary Science:** His love for animals could point towards this.
* **Mathematics/Physics:** His enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts could translate well here.
