Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (0.6):** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, ability to grasp abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication strongly align with a computer science student profile. 
* **Business Administration (0.2):** While nothing in the description directly precludes business administration, the emphasis on nature, empathy, and lack of explicit interest in business or management makes it seem less likely. However, some business-related fields (like environmental management or non-profit management) could be a possibility.

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative assessment based on a limited personality sketch.  People's interests and career choices are complex and influenced by many factors not described here.
