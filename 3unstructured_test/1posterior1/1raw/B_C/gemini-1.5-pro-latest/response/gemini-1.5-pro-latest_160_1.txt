Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's understanding of hard work and dedication could be applied to business, his personality profile doesn't strongly suggest an interest in the core aspects of business administration like finance, marketing, or management. 
* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his ability to understand abstract concepts align well with the problem-solving nature of computer science. His high intelligence further supports this possibility.

**Important Note:**  This is just an educated guess based on limited information. There are many other fields that could be a good fit for Adam (biology, environmental science, mathematics, etc.).
