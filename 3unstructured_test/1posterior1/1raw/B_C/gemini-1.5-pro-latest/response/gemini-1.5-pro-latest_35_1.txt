Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applied to business, there's nothing in his personality directly suggesting an interest in business concepts like finance, marketing, or management. 
* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly align with the field of computer science. His high intelligence further supports this likelihood. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative estimate.  Personality traits alone are not strong predictors of academic choices. Many other factors influence a person's field of study, including:

* Specific interests within a field (e.g., Adam's love of nature might lead him to environmental science even if he enjoys puzzles)
* Career goals
* Exposure to different fields
* Financial considerations
