Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts strongly suggest an affinity for computer science. This field often attracts individuals with these traits. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, the personality sketch lacks strong indicators of a business-oriented mindset. His love for nature and animals doesn't directly correlate with a typical business administration path.  

**Important Note:** These probabilities are simply educated guesses based on limited information.  A person's field of study is influenced by a wide range of factors beyond personality alone.
