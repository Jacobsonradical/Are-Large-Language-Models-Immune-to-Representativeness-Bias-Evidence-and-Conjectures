Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his high intelligence suggest a possible affinity for computer science. His ability to understand abstract concepts is also a strong trait for this field. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applied to business, the personality sketch lacks strong indicators of interest in business-related areas like finance, marketing, or management. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative estimate based on a brief personality sketch.  Many other graduate fields could align with Adam's interests, such as:

* **Biology/Ecology:**  His love for nature and its plants suggests a strong possibility.
* **Veterinary Science:** His deep love for animals makes this a likely field of interest.
* **Mathematics/Physics:** His intelligence and ability to grasp abstract concepts could lead him to these fields.
