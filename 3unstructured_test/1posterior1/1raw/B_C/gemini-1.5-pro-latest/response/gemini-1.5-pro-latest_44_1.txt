Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly suggest an affinity for computer science.  
* **Business Administration:** The description doesn't offer strong indicators towards business administration. While his understanding of hard work and dedication could be applicable, it's not specific enough to warrant a high probability. 

**Important Note:** This is a subjective assessment based on limited information.  Personality traits alone don't determine academic choices. Many other factors (interests, experiences, career goals) play a significant role.
