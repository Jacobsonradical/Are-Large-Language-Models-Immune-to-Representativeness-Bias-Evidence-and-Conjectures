Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts are strong indicators of a potential interest in computer science.  
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, the personality sketch lacks strong indicators of a business-oriented mindset (e.g., interest in leadership, finance, marketing). 

**Important Notes:**

* This is a highly subjective assessment based on limited information. 
* Many other graduate fields could be a good fit for Adam (e.g., biology, environmental science, mathematics). 
*  A person's chosen field of study is influenced by a complex interplay of factors beyond personality, such as personal experiences, career goals, and available opportunities.
