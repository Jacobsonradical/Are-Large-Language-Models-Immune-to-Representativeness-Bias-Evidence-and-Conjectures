Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.15"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his high intelligence, along with his ability to understand abstract concepts, make him a good fit for computer science. This field often involves problem-solving and abstract thinking. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, his personality sketch lacks strong indicators of a specific interest in business concepts like finance, marketing, or management. The probability is lower than computer science but not impossible.

**Important Note:** This is just a speculative estimate based on a brief personality sketch. Many other graduate fields could align with Adam's interests, such as biology, environmental science, mathematics, or even creative writing. Without more information about his specific passions and goals, it's impossible to provide a definitive probability.
