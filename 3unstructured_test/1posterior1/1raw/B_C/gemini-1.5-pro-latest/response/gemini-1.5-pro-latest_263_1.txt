Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applied to business, nothing in his personality sketch strongly suggests an interest in the core elements of business administration (finance, marketing, management etc.).  
* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with the skills and interests often found in computer science students. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative assessment. Personality sketches offer limited insight into career choices. Many other fields could also be likely for Adam, such as biology, environmental science, or mathematics.
