Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, there's nothing in his personality pointing directly to an interest in finance, management, or marketing. 
* **Computer Science:**  Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his ability to understand abstract concepts strongly suggest an aptitude for computer science. His high intelligence further supports this possibility.

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative assessment.  Personality traits alone are not strong predictors of academic choices. Many other factors influence a person's field of study, including:

* Specific interests within nature (botany? ecology?)
* Access to programs and opportunities
* Financial considerations
* Career goals
