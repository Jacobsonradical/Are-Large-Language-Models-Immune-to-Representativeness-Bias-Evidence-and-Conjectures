Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (0.6):** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication strongly align with a computer science student profile. 
* **Business Administration (0.2):** While some aspects of Adam's personality (intelligence, work ethic) could be found in business students, his core interests (nature, animals, potentially abstract concepts over practical application) make it less likely. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative assessment.  Personality sketches offer limited information. Many other fields could be equally or even more likely for Adam (biology, environmental science, mathematics, etc.).
