Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on Adam's personality sketch:

**Assessment:**

* **Curiosity about nature and plants:** This points *away* from business administration and *slightly towards* computer science (bioinformatics is a niche area within computer science). 
* **Enjoys puzzles, high intelligence, understands abstract concepts:** These are all strong indicators of an aptitude for computer science. They are less common, though not unheard of, in business administration (especially fields like quantitative finance).
* **Warm heart, strong empathy, love for animals:** These traits are not strongly associated with either field.

**Conclusion:**

While the information about Adam's love for nature doesn't directly translate to a specific graduate field, his aptitude for problem-solving and understanding complex concepts points strongly towards computer science. 

**Probabilities:**

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on personality traits. Many other factors influence a person's choice of graduate studies.
