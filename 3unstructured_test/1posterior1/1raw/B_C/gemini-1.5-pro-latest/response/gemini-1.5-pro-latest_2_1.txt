Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, there's nothing in his personality suggesting a strong inclination towards business concepts, leadership, or finance, which are central to business administration. 
* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts strongly align with the field of computer science. This field often attracts individuals who enjoy problem-solving and logical thinking.

**Important Note:** These are just estimates based on a brief personality sketch.  Many other graduate fields could also be a good fit for Adam.  For example, his love of nature could lead him to biology or environmental science. His empathy and warm heart might draw him towards fields like psychology or social work.
