Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (0.6):** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly suggest an inclination towards computer science. This field often attracts individuals with these traits. 
* **Business Administration (0.2):** While the description doesn't directly contradict a business administration pursuit, Adam's core interests (nature, animals, empathy) don't strongly align with the typical focus of business programs.  His appreciation for hard work and dedication could apply to many fields. 

**Important Note:** Personality sketches provide limited information.  Many other graduate fields could be a good fit for Adam. The probabilities are simply estimates based on the provided traits.
