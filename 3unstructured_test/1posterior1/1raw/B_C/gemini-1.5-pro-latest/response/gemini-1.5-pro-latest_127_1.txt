Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, nothing in his personality directly suggests an inclination towards business administration. 
* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and his ability to grasp abstract concepts align well with the field of computer science. His high intelligence further supports this possibility. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are speculative and based solely on a brief personality sketch. Many other graduate fields could also be a good fit for Adam.  Without more information, it's impossible to provide highly accurate probabilities.
