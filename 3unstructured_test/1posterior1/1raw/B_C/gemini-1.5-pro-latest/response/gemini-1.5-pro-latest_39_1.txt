Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his ability to understand abstract concepts strongly suggest an affinity for computer science.  His high intelligence further supports this possibility. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, there's nothing in the description directly pointing to an interest in business administration. His love for nature and animals might even suggest a preference for fields less focused on traditional business pursuits. 

**Important Note:** This is just an estimate based on a limited personality sketch.  Many other fields could also be strong possibilities for Adam (e.g., biology, environmental science, mathematics).
