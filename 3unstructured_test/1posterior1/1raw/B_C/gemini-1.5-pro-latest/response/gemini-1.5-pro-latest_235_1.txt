Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

**Assessment:**

* **Curiosity about nature and plants:** This points away from business administration and might slightly favor fields like botany, environmental science, or even potentially computational biology (which could fall under computer science).
* **Quiet, enjoys puzzles, high intelligence, understands abstract concepts:** These traits could fit well with computer science.  
* **Warm heart, strong empathy, love for animals:** These don't strongly point towards either business administration or computer science. 

**Conclusion:**

While the description suggests a leaning towards scientific fields, there's not enough to definitively place Adam in either computer science or business administration. 

**Probability Estimates:**

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (0.6):** The puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence suggest a higher probability of being in a field like computer science. 
* **Business Administration (0.2):**  The personality description doesn't align strongly with typical stereotypes of business administration students. However, there could be niches within business administration related to, say, sustainable business practices or ethical animal product companies.

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are highly speculative.  Personality sketches provide limited information, and many individuals in both computer science and business administration possess diverse traits.
