Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (0.6):** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts strongly align with skills valued in computer science. 
* **Business Administration (0.2):** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, his core personality traits don't strongly suggest a natural inclination towards this field.  

**Important Note:** These probabilities are speculative.  Personality sketches offer limited insight into actual career choices. Many other factors (personal interests, career goals, financial considerations, etc.) influence a person's field of study.
