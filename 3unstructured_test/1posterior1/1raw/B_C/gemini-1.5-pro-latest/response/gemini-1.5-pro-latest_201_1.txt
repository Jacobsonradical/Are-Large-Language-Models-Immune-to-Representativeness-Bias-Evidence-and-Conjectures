Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (0.6):** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly align with a computer science program. 
* **Business Administration (0.2):** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, the description lacks clear indicators of interest in business concepts like finance, marketing, or management. His love for nature and animals suggests other fields might be more fulfilling. 

**Important Note:** These are just estimates based on limited information.  Many other graduate fields could be a good fit for Adam.  For example, biology, environmental science, or even mathematics could be possibilities.
