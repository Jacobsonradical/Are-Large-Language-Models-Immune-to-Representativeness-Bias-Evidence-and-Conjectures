Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts align well with computer science. This makes it a moderately likely field for him (hence, a probability of 0.4). 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, the personality sketch doesn't offer strong indicators of a business inclination. His interests in nature, empathy, and quiet demeanor don't strongly point towards a business focus. Therefore, the probability is estimated to be lower (0.1).

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to understand that this is a highly speculative exercise. Personality sketches offer limited information, and many individuals with Adam's traits could be found in various other fields, including biology, environmental science, mathematics, or even creative writing.
