Here's a breakdown of how we can estimate the probabilities based on Adam's personality sketch:

**Business Administration:**

* **Lower Probability:** While intelligence and work ethic are valuable in business, Adam's love for nature, animals, and abstract concepts doesn't strongly suggest a business inclination. 

**Computer Science:**

* **Higher Probability:**  Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his ability to grasp abstract concepts align well with the problem-solving nature of computer science. 

**Estimated Probabilities:**

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on a personality sketch. Many other fields could also be a good fit for Adam (biology, environmental science, mathematics, etc.).  His actual field of study could be influenced by factors not mentioned in the description.
