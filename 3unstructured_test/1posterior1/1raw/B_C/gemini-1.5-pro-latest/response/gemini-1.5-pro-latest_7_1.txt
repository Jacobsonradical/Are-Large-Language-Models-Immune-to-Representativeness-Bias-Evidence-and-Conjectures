Here's an estimated probability based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (Higher Probability):**  Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his ability to understand abstract concepts strongly align with skills valued in computer science. His high intelligence further supports this possibility. 
* **Business Administration (Lower Probability):** While some aspects of Adam's personality (hard work, dedication) are relevant to business, his core interests (nature, animals, problem-solving) don't directly suggest a strong inclination towards business administration. 

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on a personality sketch.  Many other graduate fields could be a good fit for Adam. His actual field of study could be influenced by numerous other factors not mentioned in the description.
