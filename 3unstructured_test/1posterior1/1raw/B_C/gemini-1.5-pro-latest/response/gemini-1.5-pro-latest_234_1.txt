Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly suggest an affinity for computer science. This field often attracts individuals with these traits.
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, his personality sketch lacks strong indicators like leadership, risk-taking, or a focus on financial matters, which are more typical of those drawn to business administration. 

**Important Note:** This assessment is based on limited information and relies on general personality trends. Individual preferences are complex, and there's always a chance Adam could be pursuing a field unrelated to these probabilities.
