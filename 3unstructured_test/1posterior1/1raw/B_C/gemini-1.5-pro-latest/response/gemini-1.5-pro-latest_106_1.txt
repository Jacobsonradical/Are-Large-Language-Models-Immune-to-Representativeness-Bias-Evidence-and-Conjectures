Here's a breakdown of how we can approach the probabilities and my estimation:

**Reasoning**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's profile (puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, high intelligence) aligns strongly with traits often found in computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, Adam's love for nature, empathy, and lack of direct mention of business interests make this field less likely.

**Estimation**

Considering the information:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Important Notes:**

* **These are just estimates.**  Personality traits are not perfect predictors of academic choices. 
* **Many other fields fit Adam's profile:** Biology, environmental science, data science (which blends elements of both), and even fields like architecture or design could be possibilities.
