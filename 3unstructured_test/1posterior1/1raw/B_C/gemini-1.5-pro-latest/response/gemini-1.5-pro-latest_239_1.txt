Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly correlate with skills valued in computer science.  
* **Business Administration:** The description doesn't offer strong indicators towards business administration. While "understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication" could apply, it's not specific enough to suggest a high probability. 

**Important Notes:**

* These probabilities are speculative and based on limited information. 
* Many other fields align with Adam's personality, such as biology, environmental science, mathematics, or even creative writing. 
* It's crucial to avoid stereotypes.  Plenty of individuals in business administration are empathetic and animal lovers, and many computer scientists have a deep connection with nature.
