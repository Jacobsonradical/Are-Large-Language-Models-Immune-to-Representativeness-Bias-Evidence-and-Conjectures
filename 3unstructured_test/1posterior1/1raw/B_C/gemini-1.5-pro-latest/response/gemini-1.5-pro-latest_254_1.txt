Here's a breakdown of the probabilities and my reasoning:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.15"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's profile aligns moderately well with a computer science student:
    * **Positive Signals:**  Enjoys solving puzzles, high intelligence, understands abstract concepts. These are strong indicators for computer science aptitude.
    * **Neutral Signals:**  Curiosity about nature and love for animals aren't typical computer science markers, but they don't exclude it either. Many people in STEM fields have diverse interests. 
    * **Uncertainty:** The description doesn't mention anything about technology or programming, which are more direct indicators of interest in computer science.

* **Business Administration:** Adam's profile aligns less strongly with a typical business administration student:
    * **Weak Signal:** The only potential indicator is the appreciation for hard work and dedication. While important in business, this trait is found in many other fields.
    * **Missing Signals:**  The description lacks typical business-oriented traits like leadership, ambition for financial success, or interest in markets and economics. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Personality Isn't Destiny:**  While personality traits can offer clues, they are not foolproof predictors of a person's field of study. 
* **Graduate School Diversity:** Graduate programs attract individuals with a wide range of interests and backgrounds. 
* **Limited Information:** We only have a brief sketch of Adam. More information about his skills, hobbies, and specific academic interests would greatly improve the accuracy of these probability estimates.
