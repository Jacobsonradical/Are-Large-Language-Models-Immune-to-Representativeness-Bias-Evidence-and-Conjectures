Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, there's nothing in the description directly suggesting an interest in business concepts, finance, or management. 
* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, ability to grasp abstract concepts, and quiet nature align well with traits often found in computer science students. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative estimate.  Personality sketches offer limited information, and many other graduate fields could also be a good fit for Adam (e.g., biology, environmental science, mathematics).
