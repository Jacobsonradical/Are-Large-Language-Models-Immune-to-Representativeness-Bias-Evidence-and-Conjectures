Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:**  Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly correlate with skills valuable in computer science. 
* **Business Administration:** While the description doesn't directly point to business, Adam's understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to this field. However, the profile lacks clear indicators of interest in business concepts like finance or marketing.

**Important Notes:**

* This assessment is based on limited information and relies on general stereotypes associated with these fields. There's a significant degree of individual variation within any field of study. 
* A personality sketch alone cannot definitively predict someone's field of study. Many other factors, like personal experiences, career goals, and specific interests, play a role.
