Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (0.6):**  Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly align with a computer science profile. 
* **Business Administration (0.2):** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, there's nothing in the sketch that directly suggests an interest in business administration. His love for nature and animals might even make him less likely to pursue a traditional business path.

**Important Note:** This is based on limited information and relies heavily on stereotypes. There's a wide range of personalities within both fields, and many other graduate programs could be a great fit for Adam.
