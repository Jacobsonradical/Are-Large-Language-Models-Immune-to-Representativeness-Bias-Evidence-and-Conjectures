Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts strongly suggest an affinity for computer science.  
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applied to business, the personality sketch lacks strong indicators typically associated with a business inclination (e.g., interest in finance, leadership, economics).

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative exercise.  Personality sketches offer limited insight into academic choices. Many other fields could align with Adam's profile, such as biology, environmental science, mathematics, or even philosophy.
