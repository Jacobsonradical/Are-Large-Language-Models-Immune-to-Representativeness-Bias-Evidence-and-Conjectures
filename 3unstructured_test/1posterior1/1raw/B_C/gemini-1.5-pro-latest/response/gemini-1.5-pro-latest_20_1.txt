Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.15"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts aligns well with computer science. His high intelligence further supports this possibility. However, the description lacks direct indicators like interest in technology or programming.
* **Business Administration:**  While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, there's little in his personality sketch to suggest a strong inclination towards business administration. His empathy and love for animals might even point away from fields with a strong focus on profit maximization.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are highly speculative. Personality sketches offer limited information, and many other graduate fields could be equally or even more fitting for Adam.
