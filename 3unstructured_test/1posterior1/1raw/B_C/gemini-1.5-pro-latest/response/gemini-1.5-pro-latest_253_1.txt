Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts strongly suggests an affinity for computer science. His high intelligence further supports this.  A 0.4 probability reflects a moderate chance, acknowledging that other fields also involve problem-solving. 

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applied to business, there's little in the description to directly suggest an interest in this field. His love for nature and animals might even point away from a purely business-oriented path. A 0.1 probability indicates a low likelihood. 

**Important Note:** Personality sketches offer limited information.  Many other fields could be equally or more likely for Adam.  For a more accurate assessment, we'd need additional information about his interests, skills, and goals.
