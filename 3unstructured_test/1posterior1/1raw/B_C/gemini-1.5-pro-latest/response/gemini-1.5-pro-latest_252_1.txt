Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on a personality sketch and some very general information:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.15"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts aligns well with computer science. His intelligence further supports this possibility. However, there's no direct mention of technology or programming interests, so the probability isn't overly high.
* **Business Administration:**  While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, nothing in his personality sketch strongly suggests an interest in business administration. His empathy and love for animals might even point away from more traditional business paths. 

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches are very limited in predicting someone's field of study. Many other factors (interests, experiences, goals) play a significant role.
