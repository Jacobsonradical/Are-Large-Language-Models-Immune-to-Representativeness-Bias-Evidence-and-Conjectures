Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on a personality sketch and not concrete data:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work could point towards business, nothing in his profile strongly suggests an interest in the core aspects of business administration (finance, marketing, management). 
* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts align strongly with the skills and interests of someone drawn to computer science. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Personality isn't destiny:**  People's interests and career paths are complex. This sketch provides some clues, but it's not a foolproof predictor.
* **Other fields:** Adam's affinity for nature and animals could lead him to fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine. His empathy and warmth might also draw him to social work or psychology.
