Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (0.6):** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and quiet nature align strongly with a computer science student profile. 
* **Business Administration (0.2):** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, the personality description lacks clear indicators of an interest in business, finance, or management. His other traits point more strongly towards a more analytical and less people-oriented field.

**Important Note:** This is just a probabilistic estimate based on limited information. Many other graduate programs could also be a good fit for Adam. For example, biology, environmental science, or even something like cognitive science would be plausible given his love of nature and interest in understanding how things work.
