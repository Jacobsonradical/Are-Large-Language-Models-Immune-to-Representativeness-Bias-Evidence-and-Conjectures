Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (0.6):**  Adam's love for solving puzzles, high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work strongly align with a computer science student profile. 
* **Business Administration (0.2):** While the description doesn't directly contradict a business administration path, there's less direct evidence to support it compared to computer science.  His empathy and love for animals could suggest alternative career interests, though these traits aren't exclusive to any particular field. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative estimate.  Personality traits alone cannot definitively predict someone's field of study. There are many individuals passionate about nature and animals in diverse fields, including business and computer science.
