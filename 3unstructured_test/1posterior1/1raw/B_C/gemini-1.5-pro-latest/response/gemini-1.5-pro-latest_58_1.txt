Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts aligns well with computer science. His high intelligence further supports this possibility. However, the description lacks a direct indication of interest in technology or programming, so the probability isn't overly high.

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business,  nothing in his personality directly suggests an interest in business management, finance, or marketing.  Therefore, the probability is lower than computer science. 

**Important Note:** This assessment is based on limited information.  Personality traits alone are not strong predictors of academic fields. Many other factors, such as personal experiences, role models, and specific interests, influence a person's choice of study.
