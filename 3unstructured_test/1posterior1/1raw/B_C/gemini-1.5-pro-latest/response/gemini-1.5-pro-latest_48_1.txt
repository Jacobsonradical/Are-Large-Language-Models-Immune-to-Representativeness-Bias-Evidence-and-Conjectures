Here's an estimated probability based on the personality description:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business,  nothing in his profile strongly suggests an inclination towards business administration. 
* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts are strong indicators of a potential affinity for computer science. His quiet nature also aligns with stereotypes often associated with the field. 

**Important Note:** These are just rough estimates based on limited information.  Many other graduate fields could also be a good fit for Adam (biology, environmental science, mathematics, etc.).  Personality sketches are not definitive predictors of career paths.
