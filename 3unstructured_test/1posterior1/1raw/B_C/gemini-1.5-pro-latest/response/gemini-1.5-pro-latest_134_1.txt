Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (Higher Probability):** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly align with a computer science student profile. 
* **Business Administration (Lower Probability):** While the description doesn't directly contradict a business administration path, there's nothing to suggest a strong inclination towards business concepts, leadership, or economicsâ€”areas often associated with business students. His love for nature and animals might even suggest a preference for a less corporate-focused field.

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative assessment based on a limited personality sketch. Many other graduate fields could also be a good fit for Adam (e.g., biology, environmental science, mathematics).
