Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on Adam's personality sketch:

**Analysis:**

* **Curiosity about nature and love for animals:**  This suggests fields like biology, ecology, zoology, or even veterinary medicine as more likely than business or computer science. 
* **Quiet, enjoys puzzles, high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts:** These traits are often associated with STEM fields, making computer science a possibility. However, they could also apply to mathematics, physics, or even philosophy.
* **Appreciation for hard work and dedication:** This is a general trait and doesn't strongly point towards any particular field.

**Probabilities:**

Considering the above, here's a reasonable estimate:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Business Administration (0.1):**  While not impossible, Adam's personality profile doesn't strongly align with a typical business administration student. His interests seem more focused on understanding and exploring the natural world.
* **Computer Science (0.3):** His enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts makes computer science more likely than business administration. However, the lack of any direct mention of technology or programming makes it less probable than fields directly related to his stated interests. 

**Important Note:**  These are just educated guesses based on a limited personality sketch.  Many other graduate fields could be a good fit for Adam.
