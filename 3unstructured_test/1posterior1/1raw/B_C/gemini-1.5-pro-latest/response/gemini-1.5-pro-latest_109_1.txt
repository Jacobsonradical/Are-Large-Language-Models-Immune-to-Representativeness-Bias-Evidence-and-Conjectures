Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts align well with a computer science student profile.  
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be found in business students, his other traits (love for nature, empathy, quiet demeanor) are less typical for this field. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are speculative. Personality sketches offer limited information, and many other fields could be equally or more likely for Adam.
