Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles and his ability to understand abstract concepts suggest a higher probability of being in a field like computer science.  A  curiosity about nature doesn't exclude this, as many computer scientists are drawn to bioinformatics or related areas. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be found in business-minded individuals, the personality sketch doesn't strongly point towards a business administration focus.  His empathy and love for animals are less typical traits emphasized in traditional business programs. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are speculative and based solely on a limited personality sketch.  Many other fields could align with Adam's traits, including:

* **Biology/Ecology:** His love for nature and animals makes these strong possibilities.
* **Mathematics/Physics:** His puzzle-solving skills and understanding of abstract concepts could point here. 
* **Veterinary Medicine:** This aligns well with his love for animals.
