Here's an estimated probability based on the personality description:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts align well with the skills needed for computer science. This makes it a moderately likely field for him (hence a probability of 0.4).

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's understanding of hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, there's little in the description to strongly suggest an inclination towards business administration. His empathy and love for animals might even point away from traditionally competitive business environments.  Therefore, the probability is estimated to be lower (0.1). 

**Important Notes:**

* These are just probabilities based on limited information. There are many other fields Adam could be in, and personality is not a perfect predictor of academic choices. 
* His interest in nature could lead to fields like biology, environmental science, or even landscape architecture. 
* It's also possible he combines interests, such as computational biology or environmental data analysis.
