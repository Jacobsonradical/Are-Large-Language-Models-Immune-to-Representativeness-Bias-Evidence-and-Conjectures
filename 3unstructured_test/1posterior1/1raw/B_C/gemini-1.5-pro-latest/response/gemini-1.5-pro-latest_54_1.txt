Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (0.6):** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, ability to grasp abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work strongly align with a computer science student profile. 
* **Business Administration (0.2):** While nothing in the description directly precludes business administration, the emphasis on nature, empathy, and love for animals makes this field seem less likely. However, it's not impossible, as some business specializations (like sustainable business or non-profit management) could align with his interests. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative exercise. Personality sketches can provide hints, but many other factors influence a person's field of study.
