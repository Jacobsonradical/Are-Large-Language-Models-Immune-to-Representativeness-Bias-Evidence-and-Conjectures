Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly suggest an affinity for computer science. 
* **Business Administration:** While the description doesn't directly point to business, Adam's understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to this field. His empathy and warm heart might lead him towards a people-oriented business path. However, the lack of direct indicators makes the probability lower than computer science.

**Important Note:** This assessment is based on limited information and relies on general personality traits often associated with these fields. There's a significant margin for error, as individuals within any field can have diverse personalities and interests.
