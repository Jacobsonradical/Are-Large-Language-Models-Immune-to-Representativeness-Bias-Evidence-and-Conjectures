**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts strongly suggests an affinity for computer science. His high intelligence further supports this. 
* **Business Administration:** While not as strong a fit as computer science, Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could translate to an interest in business. His empathy might also draw him to aspects of organizational behavior or social impact within a business context.  

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on limited information. Many other fields could also be suitable for Adam.  His interest in nature could lead him to environmental science, biology, or even landscape architecture.  His empathy and warm heart might draw him to psychology, social work, or education.
