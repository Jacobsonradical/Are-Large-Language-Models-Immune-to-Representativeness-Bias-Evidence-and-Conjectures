Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, there's nothing in his personality sketch directly suggesting a strong interest in business concepts like finance, marketing, or management.  Therefore, the probability is assigned a lower value.

* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles and his ability to understand abstract concepts strongly align with the skills and interests common in computer science. His high intelligence further supports this possibility. Hence, the probability is assigned a higher value. 

**Important Note:** This assessment is purely speculative and based on limited information. Many other graduate fields could also interest Adam.
