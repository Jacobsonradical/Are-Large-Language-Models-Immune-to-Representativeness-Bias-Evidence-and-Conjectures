Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts could indicate an aptitude for computer science. However, his love for nature and animals might suggest other interests. A 0.3 probability reflects this uncertainty.

* **Business Administration:** The description doesn't strongly align with a typical business administration student. While appreciating hard work is valuable in business, his other traits point towards different fields. A 0.1 probability reflects this low likelihood. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative exercise. Personality sketches provide limited information, and many other fields could be equally or more probable for Adam.
