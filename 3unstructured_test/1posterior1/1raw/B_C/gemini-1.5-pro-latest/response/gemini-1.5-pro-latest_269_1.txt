Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, there's little in his personality pointing specifically towards business interests. 
* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his ability to grasp abstract concepts align well with the problem-solving nature of computer science. His high intelligence further supports this possibility. 

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are highly speculative. Personality sketches offer limited insight into career choices. Many other fields could be equally or even more fitting for Adam.
