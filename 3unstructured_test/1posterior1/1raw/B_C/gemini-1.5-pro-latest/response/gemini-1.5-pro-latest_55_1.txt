Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts are strong indicators of a potential affinity for computer science.  
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applied in a business context, the personality sketch doesn't offer strong indicators suggesting a high likelihood of him pursuing business administration.  

**Important Considerations:**

* This is a highly speculative exercise. Personality traits alone are not a reliable predictor of academic choices. 
* Many other graduate fields align with Adam's interests, such as biology, environmental science, mathematics, or even creative writing (if he enjoys the puzzle of language). 
* Real-world academic choices are influenced by a multitude of factors beyond personality, including personal experiences, opportunities, and career goals.
