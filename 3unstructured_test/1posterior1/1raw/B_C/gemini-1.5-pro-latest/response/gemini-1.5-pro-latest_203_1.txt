Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (higher probability):**  Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and quiet nature align well with the field of computer science. 
* **Business Administration (lower probability):** While appreciation for hard work and dedication could apply to business, there's nothing in the description directly suggesting a strong interest in business concepts like finance, marketing, or management.

**Important Notes:**

* These are just estimates based on limited information.  Personality is only one factor in choosing a field of study.  
* Other fields Adam might be interested in based on his personality: 
    * **Biology:**  His love of nature and plants.
    * **Veterinary Science:** His love for animals.
    * **Mathematics/Physics:** His enjoyment of puzzles and abstract concepts.
