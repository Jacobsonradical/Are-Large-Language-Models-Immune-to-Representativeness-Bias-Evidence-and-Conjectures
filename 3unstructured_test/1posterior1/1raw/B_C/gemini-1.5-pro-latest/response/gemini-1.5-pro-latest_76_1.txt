Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The description doesn't strongly suggest a business inclination. While understanding hard work and dedication is relevant to business, Adam's other traits (love for nature, empathy, puzzle-solving) point towards different interests. 
* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his ability to grasp abstract concepts correlate well with skills needed in computer science. This makes it a somewhat more likely field of study for him.

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative assessment. Personality sketches offer limited information, and many other graduate fields could align with Adam's traits.  His actual field of study in 2021 could be entirely different.
