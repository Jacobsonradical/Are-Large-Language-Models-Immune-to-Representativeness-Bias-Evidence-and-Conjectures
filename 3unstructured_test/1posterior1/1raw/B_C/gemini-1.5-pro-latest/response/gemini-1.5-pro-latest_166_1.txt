Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts aligns well with computer science. His high intelligence further supports this possibility. However, the description lacks a direct mention of technology or programming, so the probability isn't overly high.
* **Business Administration:** The description doesn't strongly suggest an inclination towards business. While "understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication" could apply to business, it's a general trait. The emphasis on nature and empathy might make this field less likely. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative assessment based on a limited personality sketch.  Many other graduate fields could be equally or more likely for Adam.
