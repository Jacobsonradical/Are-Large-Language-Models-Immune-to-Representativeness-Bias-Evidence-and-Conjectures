Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (0.6):**  Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly align with a computer science student profile. 
* **Business Administration (0.2):** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, the description lacks strong indicators typically associated with business interests like leadership, finance, or marketing. His other traits point more towards a scientific or analytical field. 

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches offer limited information. Many other graduate fields could also be a good fit for Adam. This assessment is purely speculative and based on common stereotypes associated with the mentioned fields.
