Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, nothing in his personality sketch strongly suggests an interest in the core aspects of business administration (finance, marketing, management, etc.).  
* **Computer Science:**  Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his ability to grasp abstract concepts align well with the problem-solving and logical thinking required in computer science. His high intelligence further supports this possibility. 

**Important Note:** These are just estimations based on a limited personality profile.  Many other graduate fields could be equally or even more fitting for Adam.  For example:

* **Biology/Botany/Environmental Science:** His love of nature and interest in plants could lead him to these fields.
* **Mathematics/Physics:**  His high intelligence and ability with abstract concepts are strong indicators for these fields.
* **Veterinary Science/Animal Studies:**  His deep love for animals could point towards these areas.
