Here's an estimated probability based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applied to business, nothing in his profile strongly suggests an interest in the core elements of business administration (finance, marketing, management). 
* **Computer Science:**  Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his ability to understand abstract concepts align well with the problem-solving nature of computer science. His high intelligence further supports this likelihood.

**Important Note:** This is just a probability based on limited information.  Many other graduate fields could be a good fit for Adam. For example:

* **Biology/Ecology:** His love for nature and interest in plants could lead him here.
* **Mathematics/Statistics:**  His puzzle-solving skills and comfort with abstract concepts would be valuable. 
* **Cognitive Science/Psychology:** His empathy and understanding of people could translate into interest in these fields.
