Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with a computer science student. This field often attracts individuals with these traits.
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, the personality sketch lacks strong indicators typically associated with business students, such as leadership, ambition for career advancement, or strong interest in financial markets.  

**Important Notes:**

* These probabilities are speculative and based solely on a brief personality sketch. Many other fields could be equally or even more likely for Adam. 
*  Personality is just one factor in choosing a field of study.  Interests, experiences, and career goals play significant roles as well.
