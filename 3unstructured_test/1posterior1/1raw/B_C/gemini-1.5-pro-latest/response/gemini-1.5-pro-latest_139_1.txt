Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts strongly correlate with skills valued in computer science. This makes it a moderately likely field for him. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication are relevant to business, the personality sketch lacks clear indicators of a strong interest in business concepts like finance, marketing, or management. This makes it a less likely field for him. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative assessment. Personality sketches offer limited information, and many other graduate fields could align with Adam's interests. For example, biology, environmental science, or even mathematics could be strong possibilities depending on how his love for nature and analytical skills manifest.
