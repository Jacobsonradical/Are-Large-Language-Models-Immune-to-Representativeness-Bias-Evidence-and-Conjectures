Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly suggest an affinity for computer science. This field often involves problem-solving, logical thinking, and a deep understanding of complex systems. 
* **Business Administration:** While the description doesn't directly point towards business, Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could translate well into this field. However, the lack of specific mentions of business interests, leadership qualities, or financial acumen makes it less likely than computer science. 

**Important Note:** This assessment is purely speculative and based on a limited personality sketch.  Many other graduate fields could also be strong possibilities for Adam.
