Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts strongly suggests an affinity for computer science. His high intelligence further supports this possibility.  A 0.4 probability reflects a moderate chance, acknowledging other fields could also be a good fit.
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, the personality sketch lacks strong indicators of a business-oriented mindset. His love for nature and animals might suggest different career aspirations. A 0.1 probability reflects a lower chance, but not impossible as some business fields (like sustainable business practices) might appeal to him. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative assessment based on a limited personality sketch.  Many other graduate fields could align with Adam's interests, such as biology, environmental science, mathematics, or even creative writing.
