Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (Higher Probability):** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication all align strongly with the field of computer science. 
* **Business Administration (Lower Probability):** While some aspects like intelligence and work ethic are relevant to business, the description lacks clear indicators of interest in finance, marketing, economics, or leadership â€“ all common in business administration programs.

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on a personality sketch.  Many other fields could be a good fit for Adam. His actual field of study could be influenced by numerous other factors not mentioned in the description.
