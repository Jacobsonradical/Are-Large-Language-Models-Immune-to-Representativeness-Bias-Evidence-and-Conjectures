Here's a breakdown of probabilities based on the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (0.6):**  Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly suggest an affinity for computer science. Many areas within computer science, like algorithm design and theoretical computer science, align with these traits. 
* **Business Administration (0.2):** While the description doesn't directly contradict a business inclination, it lacks strong indicators typically associated with business students (e.g., interest in finance, leadership, markets).  His appreciation for hard work and dedication could apply to many fields.  It's possible, but less likely given the other strong indicators. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Personality isn't destiny:** Personality sketches offer clues, not definitive predictions. Many individuals with Adam's traits might choose fields outside computer science or business administration.
* **Other Possibilities:**  The description hints at other fields Adam might find fulfilling, such as:
    * **Biology/Ecology:**  His love of nature and plants suggests an interest in these fields.
    * **Veterinary Science:**  His love for animals could lead him to a career as a veterinarian. 
    * **Mathematics:** His puzzle-solving skills and affinity for abstract concepts make mathematics a good fit. 
* **Graduate school landscape:** The relative popularity of these fields within graduate programs can influence probability, but we don't have enough data for that here.
