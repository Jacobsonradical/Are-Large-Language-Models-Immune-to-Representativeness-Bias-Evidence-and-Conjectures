Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's understanding of hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, nothing in his profile strongly suggests an interest in business itself.  The emphasis on nature, empathy, and abstract thinking points away from a business focus. 
* **Computer Science:**  Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his aptitude for abstract concepts align well with the field of computer science. His high intelligence further supports this possibility. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are speculative.  Personality sketches provide limited information, and many other fields could also be a good fit for Adam.
