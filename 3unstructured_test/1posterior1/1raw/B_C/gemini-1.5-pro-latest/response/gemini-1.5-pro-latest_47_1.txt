Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (Higher Probability):** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts strongly align with a computer science program. 
* **Business Administration (Lower Probability):** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, the personality sketch lacks strong indicators of interest in finance, marketing, or management, which are core components of business administration. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative assessment.  Personality traits alone are not definitive predictors of academic choices. Many other factors influence a person's field of study.
