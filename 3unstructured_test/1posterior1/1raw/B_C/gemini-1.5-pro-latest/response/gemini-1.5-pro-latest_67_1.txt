Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts suggests a higher probability of being in a field like computer science. However, the direct connection to nature and animals isn't as strong.
* **Business Administration:**  Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, but there's little in his personality pointing specifically to business administration. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Personality isn't destiny:**  While personality traits can correlate with career choices, they are not absolute predictors. 
* **Limited information:**  The sketch provides a glimpse into Adam's character but lacks details about his specific skills, interests, and goals.
* **Subfields:**  There's a wide range of specializations within both computer science and business administration. Adam's interests (like bioinformatics or sustainable business) could increase the probability for either field.
