Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (Higher Probability):** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly align with a computer science student profile. 
* **Business Administration (Lower Probability):** While the description doesn't directly contradict a business inclination, there's less direct evidence.  His empathy and love for animals might suggest different career paths. However, a business administration program could be possible if he's interested in sustainable business or social entrepreneurship.

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative assessment.  Personality sketches provide limited information, and many other graduate fields could be equally or more fitting for Adam.
