Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly correlate with skills needed in computer science.  
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication is relevant to business, his other traits (love for nature, empathy, quiet demeanor) don't align as strongly with a typical business administration student profile. 

**Important Notes:**

* This assessment is based on stereotypes and limited information. There's a wide range of personalities within any field of study. 
*  It's entirely possible for someone with Adam's personality to thrive in business administration, especially with focuses on ethical business practices or environmental sustainability.  
* Without more information about Adam's specific interests and goals, these probabilities are just educated guesses.
