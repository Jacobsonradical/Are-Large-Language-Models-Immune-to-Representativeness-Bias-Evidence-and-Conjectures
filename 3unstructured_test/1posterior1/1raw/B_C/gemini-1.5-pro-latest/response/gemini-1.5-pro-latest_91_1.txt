Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with computer science. His high intelligence further supports this possibility. However, the description lacks a direct mention of technology or programming, making it less certain. 
* **Business Administration:**  While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, the overall profile doesn't strongly suggest this field. His empathy and love for nature and animals seem less central to a typical business administration path. 

**Important Note:** This assessment is based on limited information and relies on stereotypes. Many individuals in computer science are deeply empathetic, and many in business administration are passionate about nature. Adam's true interests could lie in entirely different fields.
