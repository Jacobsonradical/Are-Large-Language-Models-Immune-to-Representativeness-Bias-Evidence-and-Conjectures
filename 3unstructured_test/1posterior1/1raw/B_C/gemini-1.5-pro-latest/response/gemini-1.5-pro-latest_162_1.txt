Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, there's nothing in his personality pointing directly to interests usually associated with business administration (e.g., finance, marketing, management). 
* **Computer Science:**  Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly suggest an aptitude for computer science. This field often involves problem-solving, logical thinking, and abstract reasoning. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are estimations based solely on a brief personality sketch. Many other graduate fields could align with Adam's interests, and there's no guarantee he pursued either of these fields.
