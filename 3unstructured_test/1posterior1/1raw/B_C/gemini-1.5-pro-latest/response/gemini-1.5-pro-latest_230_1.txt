Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles and his ability to understand abstract concepts strongly suggest an affinity for computer science.  His high intelligence further supports this possibility. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, the personality sketch lacks strong indicators of a specific interest in business concepts like finance, marketing, or management.  

**Important Notes:**

* These are just probabilities based on limited information. There's no guarantee about Adam's actual field of study. 
* Adam's interest in nature and animals could lead him to fields like biology, environmental science, or even veterinary medicine.  
* Many other graduate fields could also be a good fit.
