Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles and his ability to understand abstract concepts strongly suggest an affinity for computer science. His high intelligence further supports this possibility. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, the personality sketch lacks strong indicators towards a business inclination. His empathy and love for animals might even suggest a preference for fields less focused on corporate structures. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are speculative and based solely on a brief personality sketch.  Many other graduate fields align with Adam's interests (biology, environmental science, mathematics, etc.).
