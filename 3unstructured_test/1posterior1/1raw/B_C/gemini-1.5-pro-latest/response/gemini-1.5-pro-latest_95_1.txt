Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, his core interests in nature, animals, and abstract concepts don't strongly align with a typical business administration program. 
* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his ability to understand abstract concepts are strong indicators of an aptitude for computer science. His high intelligence further supports this possibility.

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are speculative.  Personality sketches can offer hints, but many other factors influence a person's choice of graduate study.  Interests in nature and animals could lead to fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine.  Without more information about Adam's specific academic background and career aspirations, it's impossible to be definitive.
