Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts aligns well with computer science. His high intelligence further supports this possibility. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, there's nothing in the description directly suggesting an interest in finance, management, or other core business areas.  The probability is therefore lower. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative exercise. Personality sketches can offer hints about a person's interests, but they are not reliable predictors of academic choices. Many other fields could also be a good fit for Adam.
