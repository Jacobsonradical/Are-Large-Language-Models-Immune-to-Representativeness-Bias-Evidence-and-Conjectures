Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's understanding of hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, his core personality traits (love for nature, quiet demeanor, enjoyment of puzzles, empathy) don't strongly align with a typical business administration student. 
* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his ability to understand abstract concepts are strong indicators of an affinity for computer science.  His high intelligence also supports this possibility.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are speculative.  Personality sketches offer limited insight, and many other fields could appeal to someone like Adam (e.g., biology, environmental science, mathematics).
