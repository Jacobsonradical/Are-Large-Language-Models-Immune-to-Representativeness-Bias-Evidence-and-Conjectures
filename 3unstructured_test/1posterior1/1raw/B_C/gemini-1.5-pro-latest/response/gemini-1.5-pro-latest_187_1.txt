Here's a breakdown of how we can estimate the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

**Business Administration:**

* **Points against:**  The description emphasizes curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and understanding abstract concepts. These traits are not as strongly associated with typical business administration career paths.
* **Points for:** High intelligence and appreciation for hard work are relevant but not exclusive to business. 

**Computer Science:**

* **Points for:** Enjoying puzzles and being good at understanding abstract concepts are strong indicators of aptitude for computer science.
* **Points against:**  The description focuses heavily on nature and animals, which might suggest interests outside of computer science. However, many computer scientists have diverse interests. 

**Assessment:**

While the description leans more towards interests aligned with biology or environmental sciences, it's important to remember:

* **People are complex:**  Personality is just one factor in choosing a field of study. Background, opportunities, and specific passions also play a role. 
* **Computer science is broad:** It encompasses fields like AI and bioinformatics, which could intersect with Adam's interests.

**Probabilities (Educated Guesses):**

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Business Administration (0.2):**  A relatively low probability because the personality sketch doesn't strongly suggest typical business interests. 
* **Computer Science (0.4):** Moderate probability. The puzzle-solving and abstract thinking fit well, but the strong emphasis on nature might pull in other directions. 

**Important Note:** These are just estimates based on limited information. It's impossible to determine Adam's field of study with certainty.
