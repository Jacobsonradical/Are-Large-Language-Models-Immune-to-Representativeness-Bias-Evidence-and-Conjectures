Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles and his high intelligence with an aptitude for abstract concepts strongly suggest an affinity for computer science.  This field often attracts individuals who enjoy problem-solving and logical thinking.
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, the personality sketch lacks strong indicators of a business-oriented mindset.  There's no mention of interests in leadership, finance, or market dynamics, which are more typical of someone drawn to business administration. 

**Important Notes:**

* These probabilities are subjective estimations based on limited information.  
*  Adam's true field of study could be entirely different. Many other graduate programs align with his personality traits (e.g., biology, environmental science, mathematics).
