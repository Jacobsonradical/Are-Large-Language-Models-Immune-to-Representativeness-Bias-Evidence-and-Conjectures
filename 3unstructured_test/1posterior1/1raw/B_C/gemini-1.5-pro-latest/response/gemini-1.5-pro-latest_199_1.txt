Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

**Analysis**

* **Curiosity about nature and plants:**  This points away from both business administration and computer science, suggesting fields like botany, environmental science, or biology might be more likely.
* **Quiet, puzzle-solver, good with abstract concepts:** These traits are often associated with computer science. While someone interested in business can be analytical, the "quiet" and "puzzle-solver" aspects hint more strongly at a technical field.
* **Warm heart, empathy, love for animals:**  These traits don't strongly suggest either business or computer science. They might point towards fields involving animal care or social work, but aren't exclusive to those areas.

**Probabilities**

Considering these factors:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Business Administration (0.2):** While Adam's intelligence could lead him to business, his core interests don't align strongly. A 0.2 probability reflects a low chance.
* **Computer Science (0.6):** The problem-solving skills and affinity for abstract concepts make this a more likely field for Adam. However, the lack of direct mention of technology or programming keeps it below a very high probability.

**Important Note:** This is a speculative assessment based on a brief personality sketch.  Many other graduate fields could also be a good fit for Adam.
