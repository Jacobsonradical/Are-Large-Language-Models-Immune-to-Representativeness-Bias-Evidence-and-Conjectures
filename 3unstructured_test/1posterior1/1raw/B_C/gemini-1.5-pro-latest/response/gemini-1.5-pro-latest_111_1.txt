Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (0.6):** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication strongly align with a computer science student profile. 
* **Business Administration (0.2):** While some aspects of Adam's personality (like understanding hard work) could apply to business, there's nothing in the sketch specifically suggesting an interest in business, finance, or management.  

**Important Note:** This is just a probabilistic estimate based on limited information.  Many other graduate fields could also be strong fits for Adam (e.g., biology, environmental science, mathematics).
