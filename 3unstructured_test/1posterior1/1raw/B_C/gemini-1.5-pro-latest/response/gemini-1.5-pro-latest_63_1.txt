Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (Higher Probability):** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work strongly align with the field of computer science. 
* **Business Administration (Lower Probability):** While some aspects like intelligence and work ethic are relevant to business, the description lacks clear indicators of interest in finance, marketing, management, or other core business areas.  

**Important Notes:**

* This is a highly speculative estimate based on a limited personality sketch. 
* Many other graduate fields could be strong possibilities for Adam (e.g., biology, environmental science, mathematics). 
* People's personalities and career choices are complex and can't be accurately predicted from a short description.
