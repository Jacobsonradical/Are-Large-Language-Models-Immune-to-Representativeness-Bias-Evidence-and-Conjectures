Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's understanding of hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, nothing in his personality directly points towards an interest in business administration.  
* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his aptitude for abstract concepts are strong indicators of a potential interest in computer science. This field often attracts individuals who enjoy problem-solving and logical thinking. His intelligence further supports this likelihood.

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative estimate based on limited information.  Many other graduate fields could align with Adam's personality.  For example:

* **Biology/Botany:** His love of nature and interest in plants could lead him to these fields.
* **Environmental Science:**  His empathy and love for animals might translate into a passion for environmental protection.
* **Mathematics/Physics:** His high intelligence and ability with abstract concepts could indicate an interest in these areas.
