Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts aligns well with computer science. His intelligence further supports this possibility. However, the sketch lacks direct mentions of technology or programming, making it less certain.
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, there's little in his personality to suggest a strong inclination towards the core aspects of business like finance, marketing, or management. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative exercise. Personality sketches provide limited information, and many fields could be compatible with Adam's traits.
