Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts align well with computer science. His high intelligence further supports this possibility.  A 0.4 probability suggests a moderate chance, acknowledging that these traits could apply to other fields as well.
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, the personality sketch doesn't strongly suggest a leaning towards business concepts, finance, or management. A 0.1 probability indicates a lower chance. 

**Important Note:** This assessment is purely speculative based on a brief personality sketch.  Many other graduate fields could be strong possibilities for Adam.  His love of nature and animals might suggest fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine.
