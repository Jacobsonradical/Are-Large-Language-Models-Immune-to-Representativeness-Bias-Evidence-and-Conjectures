Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (Higher Probability):** Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly align with the skills and interests often found in computer science students. 
* **Business Administration (Lower Probability):** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applied to business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of a specific interest in business concepts like finance, marketing, or management. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative assessment. Personality sketches provide limited information, and many other graduate fields could also be a good fit for Adam (e.g., biology, environmental science, mathematics).
