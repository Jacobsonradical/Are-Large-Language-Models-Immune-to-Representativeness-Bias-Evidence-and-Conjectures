Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the provided information:

**Assessment:**

* **Curiosity about nature and plants:** This slightly points away from computer science and business administration and could suggest fields like botany, environmental science, or even veterinary medicine. 
* **Quiet, puzzle-solver, good with abstract concepts:** This is a classic profile for someone drawn to computer science. It also fits with fields like mathematics or physics.
* **Warm heart, strong empathy, love for animals:** These traits are less typical of those heavily focused on computer science or business, suggesting fields like veterinary medicine, animal science, or social work could be appealing.
* **High intelligence:**  Applies to many graduate fields.
* **Appreciation for hard work and dedication:** A general trait applicable to most graduate fields.

**Probabilities (estimates):**

While the description hints at a few possibilities, it leans more towards someone who might not choose business administration. 

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.35",
  "business administration": "0.15"
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Computer Science (0.35):** The puzzle-solving and abstract thinking skills are strong indicators. However, the lack of direct mention of technology or programming, combined with the nature affinity, lowers the probability.
* **Business Administration (0.15):** The personality profile doesn't align strongly with traditional business traits. While intelligence and work ethic are valuable in business, the other traits suggest alternative paths might be more fulfilling for Adam. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are speculative. A person's choice of graduate study is influenced by numerous factors beyond personality, including interests, experiences, and career goals.
