Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (0.4):** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his aptitude for abstract concepts strongly suggest an affinity for computer science.  His high intelligence further supports this possibility. 

* **Business Administration (0.1):**  While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applied in a business context, the personality sketch lacks strong indicators of a business inclination. His interests in nature, animals, and potentially abstract concepts (which might point to more scientific fields) make a business administration path less likely. 

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches offer limited information. Many other graduate fields could be a good fit for Adam. His love for nature might lead him to environmental studies, biology, or a related field. His empathy and warm heart could also make social work or psychology viable options.
