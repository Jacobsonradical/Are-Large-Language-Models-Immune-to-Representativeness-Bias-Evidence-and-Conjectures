Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

**Assessment:**

* **Curiosity about nature and plants:** This points away from typical business administration programs and might slightly favor fields like environmental science or even computational biology (which could fall under computer science).
* **Quiet, enjoys puzzles, good with abstract concepts:**  These traits are often associated with computer science students. 
* **Warm heart, empathy, love for animals:** These don't directly correlate with either field but could suggest an interest in fields with an ethical component.

**Probabilities:**

While Adam's description leans towards computer science, it's important to remember that personality is just one factor in choosing a graduate field. 

Here's my best estimate:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Business Administration (0.2):** Adam's profile doesn't strongly suggest a traditional business inclination. However, there are specialized areas within business administration like sustainability or social entrepreneurship that might appeal to his love for nature and empathy.  
* **Computer Science (0.7):** His problem-solving skills, affinity for abstract thinking, and quiet nature align well with computer science. His interest in nature could manifest in specializing in areas like artificial life, bioinformatics, or computational biology.

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are speculative. Many other graduate programs could be a good fit for Adam.
