Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, nothing in his personality sketch directly suggests an interest in business concepts like finance, marketing, or management.  Therefore, the probability is relatively low.

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts are strong indicators of a potential affinity for computer science. This field often attracts individuals who enjoy problem-solving and logical thinking. Therefore, the probability is moderate.

**Important Note:** This assessment is based on limited information and relies heavily on stereotypes.  Many other graduate fields could also be a good fit for Adam (biology, environmental science, mathematics, etc.).
