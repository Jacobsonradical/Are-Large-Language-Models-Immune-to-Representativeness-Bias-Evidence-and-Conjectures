Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, his core personality traits (love for nature, quiet demeanor, enjoyment of puzzles, empathy) don't strongly align with the typical image of a business administration student. 
* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts are strong indicators of an inclination towards computer science. His quiet and introspective nature also somewhat aligns with the stereotype of individuals in this field. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative assessment.  Personality sketches offer limited insight into academic or career choices. Many other fields could be equally or even more fitting for Adam.
