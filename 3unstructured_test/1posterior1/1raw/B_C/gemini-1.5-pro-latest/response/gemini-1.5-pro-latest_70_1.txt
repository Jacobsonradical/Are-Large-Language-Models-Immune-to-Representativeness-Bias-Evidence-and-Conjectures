Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

**Assessment:**

* **Curiosity about nature and plants:** This points slightly away from computer science and business administration and might suggest fields like botany, environmental science, or even veterinary medicine. 
* **Quiet, puzzle-solver, good with abstract concepts:** These traits are common in computer science students. 
* **Warm heart, empathy, love for animals:** These traits are less typical markers for either computer science or business administration. They might suggest fields involving animal care or social work. 
* **Understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication:** This is a general trait applicable to many fields, including both computer science and business administration.

**Probabilities:**

While the description leans more towards interests outside of the two specified fields, here's a plausible probability estimate:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (0.3):** Adam's problem-solving skills and aptitude for abstract concepts make computer science a possibility, even though his primary interests seem to lie elsewhere.
* **Business Administration (0.1):** The description offers little to suggest an inclination towards business administration. The appreciation for hard work is not unique to this field. 

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of academic choices.  Many other factors influence a person's field of study.
