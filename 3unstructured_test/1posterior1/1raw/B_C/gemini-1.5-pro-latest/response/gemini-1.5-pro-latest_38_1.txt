Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.15"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his high intelligence, along with his ability to grasp abstract concepts, suggest a strong aptitude for computer science. This field often attracts individuals who enjoy problem-solving and logical thinking. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be valuable in a business context, the personality sketch doesn't offer strong indicators for this field. His love for nature and animals, coupled with his quiet demeanor, might point towards interests less aligned with traditional business pursuits.

**Important Notes:**

* These probabilities are simply educated guesses based on limited information.  
* Many other graduate fields could be strong fits for Adam.  His personality traits align well with fields like biology, environmental science, veterinary medicine, or even mathematics. 
* It's crucial to avoid stereotypes when making assumptions about career paths based on personality.
