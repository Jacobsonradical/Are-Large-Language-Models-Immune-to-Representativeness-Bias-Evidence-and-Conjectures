Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (0.6):** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his ability to understand abstract concepts align strongly with the skills and interests common in computer science students.  
* **Business Administration (0.2):** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, there's nothing in the description directly suggesting a strong interest in business concepts like finance, marketing, or management. His other traits point more towards analytical or scientific fields. 

**Important Note:** This assessment is based on limited information and relies on general stereotypes. Individual personalities and career choices are far more complex.  It's entirely possible for someone with Adam's traits to thrive in business administration or choose a completely different field altogether.
