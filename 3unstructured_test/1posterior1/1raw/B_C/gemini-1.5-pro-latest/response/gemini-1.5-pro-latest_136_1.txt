Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's intelligence and understanding of hard work could be applicable to business, his core interests (nature, animals, abstract concepts) don't strongly align with a typical business administration path. 
* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his ability with abstract concepts suggest a higher likelihood of interest in computer science. This field aligns well with problem-solving and logical thinking skills. 

**Important Notes:**

* These probabilities are simply estimations based on limited information. 
* Many other graduate fields could be strong possibilities for Adam (e.g., biology, environmental science, mathematics). 
* Personal interests are not always perfect predictors of career choices.
