Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, there's little in his personality sketch to suggest a strong inclination towards the corporate world or financial matters. 
* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his ability to grasp abstract concepts align well with the problem-solving nature of computer science. His high intelligence further supports this likelihood.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are speculative and based solely on a brief personality sketch.  Many other fields could also be strong contenders for Adam's graduate studies (e.g., biology, environmental science, mathematics).
