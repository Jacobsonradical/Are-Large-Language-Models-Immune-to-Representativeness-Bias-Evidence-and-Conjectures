Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts aligns well with computer science. His high intelligence further supports this possibility.  A 0.4 probability reflects a moderate chance, acknowledging that other fields also involve problem-solving.

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, his other traits (love for nature, empathy, quiet demeanor) don't strongly suggest a business inclination. A 0.1 probability reflects a lower chance.

**Important Note:** Personality sketches offer limited insight into academic choices. Many other factors influence graduate program decisions. This assessment is purely speculative based on the provided information.
