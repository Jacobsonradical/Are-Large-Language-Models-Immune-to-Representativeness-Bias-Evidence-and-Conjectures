Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (0.6):** Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly suggest an affinity for computer science. This field often attracts individuals with these traits. 
* **Business Administration (0.2):** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, his other traits (love for nature, empathy, quiet demeanor) are less typical of individuals drawn to this field. It's possible he pursued an MBA with a focus on sustainability or social impact, hence a low but non-zero probability.

**Important Note:** This assessment is based on probabilities and stereotypes.  Many individuals in business administration are empathetic and nature-loving, and many computer scientists are not drawn to puzzles.  This is just a framework for considering the likelihood based on the provided information.
