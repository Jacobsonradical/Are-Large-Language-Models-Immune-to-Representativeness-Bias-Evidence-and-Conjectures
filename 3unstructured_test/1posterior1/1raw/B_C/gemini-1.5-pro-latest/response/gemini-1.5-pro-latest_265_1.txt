Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, there's little in his personality sketch to suggest a strong inclination towards the core aspects of business administration like finance, marketing, or management. 
* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his ability to grasp abstract concepts are strong indicators of an aptitude for computer science.  His high intelligence further supports this possibility.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are speculative and based solely on a brief personality sketch.  Many other graduate fields could be equally or even more fitting for Adam.  For example:

* **Biology/Botany:**  His love for nature and interest in plants could point towards these fields.
* **Environmental Science/Conservation:** His empathy for animals and appreciation for nature might draw him to these areas. 
* **Mathematics/Physics:** His intelligence and ability with abstract concepts could also be well-suited here.
