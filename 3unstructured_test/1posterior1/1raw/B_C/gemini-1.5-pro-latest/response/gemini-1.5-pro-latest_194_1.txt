Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (Higher Probability):** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly align with the skills and interests common in computer science students. 
* **Business Administration (Lower Probability):** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, the description lacks clear indicators of interests typically associated with business administration (e.g., leadership, finance, marketing). His love for nature and animals might suggest different career paths.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are speculative.  Personality sketches provide limited information, and many individuals with Adam's traits may thrive in fields outside of computer science or business administration.
