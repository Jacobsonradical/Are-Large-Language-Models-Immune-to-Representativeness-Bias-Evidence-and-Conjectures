Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, there's nothing in his personality pointing directly to interests commonly associated with business administration (finance, marketing, management). 
* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles and his ability to understand abstract concepts strongly suggest an aptitude for computer science. His high intelligence further supports this likelihood.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are speculative.  Personality traits alone cannot definitively predict a person's field of study. Many other factors influence career choices, including personal experiences, opportunities, and specific interests within a broader field.
