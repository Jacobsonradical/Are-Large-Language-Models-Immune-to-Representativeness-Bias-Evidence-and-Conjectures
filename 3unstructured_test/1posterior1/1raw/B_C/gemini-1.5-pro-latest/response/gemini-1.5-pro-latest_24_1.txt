Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts strongly suggest an affinity for computer science. 
* **Business Administration:** While the description doesn't directly point to business administration, Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could translate well into this field. However, the lack of explicit mentions of business-related interests makes it a less likely choice than computer science. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative estimate. Personality sketches offer limited information, and many other graduate fields could also be a good fit for Adam.
