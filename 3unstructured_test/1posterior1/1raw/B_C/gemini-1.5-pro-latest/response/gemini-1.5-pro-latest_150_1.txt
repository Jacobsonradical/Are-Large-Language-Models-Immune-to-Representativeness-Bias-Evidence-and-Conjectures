Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (0.6):** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly align with a computer science student profile. 
* **Business Administration (0.2):** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, his other traits (love for nature, empathy, quiet demeanor) are less typical of students drawn to this field.  

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative estimate. Personality traits alone are not a reliable predictor of academic choices. Many other factors influence a person's field of study, including:

* **Specific Interests:**  Adam's love for nature could lead him to environmental science or related fields.
* **Skills and Experience:**  Prior experience in programming or business could sway his decision. 
* **Career Goals:**  His aspirations (research, entrepreneurship, etc.) heavily influence his academic path.
