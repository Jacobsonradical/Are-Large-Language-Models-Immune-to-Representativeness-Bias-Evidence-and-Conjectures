Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his intelligence suggest a possible affinity for the problem-solving nature of computer science. His ability to grasp abstract concepts further supports this. However, there's no direct mention of technology or programming, so the probability is moderate.
* **Business Administration:**  While Adam's understanding of hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, his other traits (love for nature, empathy, quiet demeanor) don't strongly align with the typical image of a business student. Hence, the probability is low. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative exercise. Personality sketches provide limited information, and many other graduate fields could be just as likely, if not more so, for Adam.
