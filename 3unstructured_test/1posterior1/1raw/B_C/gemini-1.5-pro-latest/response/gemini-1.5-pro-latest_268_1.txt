Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, there's little in his personality sketch to suggest a strong inclination towards the core aspects of business like finance, marketing, or management. 
* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his ability to grasp abstract concepts align well with the problem-solving and logical thinking often required in computer science. His high intelligence further supports this possibility. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are speculative and based solely on a brief personality sketch.  Many other graduate fields could be strong contenders for Adam. For example:

* **Biology/Ecology:**  His love for nature and plants suggests a strong affinity for these fields.
* **Mathematics/Physics:** His intelligence and ability with abstract concepts could point towards these areas. 

Without further information about Adam's specific interests and goals, it's impossible to provide a definitive answer.
