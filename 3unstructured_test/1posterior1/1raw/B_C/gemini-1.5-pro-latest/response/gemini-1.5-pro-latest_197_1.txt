Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could align with a business career, nothing in his personality strongly suggests an interest in the core aspects of business administration (finance, marketing, management, etc.). 
* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts are strong indicators of a potential affinity for computer science. This field often attracts individuals who enjoy problem-solving and logical thinking. His love of nature might even lead him towards areas like computational biology or environmental modeling. 

**Important Note:**  These are just educated guesses based on limited information.  Personality provides some clues, but many other factors influence graduate study choices.
