Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, his core interests (nature, puzzles, abstract concepts) don't strongly align with a typical business administration program. 
* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his ability to grasp abstract concepts are strong indicators of an aptitude for computer science. His high intelligence further supports this possibility.

**Important Note:** These are just estimates based on a brief personality sketch.  Many other graduate fields could also be a good fit for Adam.  His love for nature and animals might draw him towards biology, ecology, or veterinary science. His empathy and warm heart could make him interested in social work or psychology.  More information would be needed for a more accurate assessment.
