Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, his core interests in nature, animals, and problem-solving don't strongly align with a typical business administration path.  
* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and quiet nature are strong indicators of potential interest in computer science.  

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on limited information.  People's personalities and career choices are complex. There's a chance Adam could be drawn to business for its strategic elements or pursue a field combining his love of nature with technology.
