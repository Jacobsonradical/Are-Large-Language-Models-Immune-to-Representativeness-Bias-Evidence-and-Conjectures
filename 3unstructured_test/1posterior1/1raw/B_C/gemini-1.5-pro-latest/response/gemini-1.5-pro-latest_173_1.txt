Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (0.6):** Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly align with a computer science student profile. 
* **Business Administration (0.2):** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, the personality sketch doesn't offer strong indicators towards a business inclination.  His love for nature and animals might suggest different career interests.

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative exercise. Personality traits alone are not reliable predictors of academic choices.  Many other factors influence a person's field of study.
