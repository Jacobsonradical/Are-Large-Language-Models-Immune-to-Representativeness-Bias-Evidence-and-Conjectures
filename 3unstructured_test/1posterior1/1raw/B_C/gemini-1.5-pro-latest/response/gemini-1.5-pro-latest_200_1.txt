Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (0.6):** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work strongly align with a computer science profile. 
* **Business Administration (0.2):** While the description doesn't directly contradict a business administration path, there's less direct evidence pointing towards it.  His empathy and love for animals could suggest interests outside of a purely business-focused field. However, it's possible he could be interested in sustainable business practices or non-profit management, hence a low probability is assigned. 

**Important Note:**  This is a highly speculative exercise. Personality sketches offer limited information, and people's academic pursuits are influenced by a multitude of factors not mentioned in the description.
