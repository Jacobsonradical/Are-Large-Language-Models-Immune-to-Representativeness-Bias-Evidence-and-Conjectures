Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the provided information:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.10",
  "computer science": "0.30"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam possesses qualities like understanding hard work and dedication, his core interests in nature, animals, and puzzle-solving point away from a strong likelihood of pursuing business administration.  A 0.10 probability acknowledges that it's not impossible, as someone can have diverse interests. 

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly suggest an affinity for computer science. This field often attracts individuals who enjoy problem-solving and logical thinking.  A 0.30 probability reflects this higher likelihood. 

**Important Note:** These are just estimations based on limited information.  Many other graduate fields align well with Adam's personality:

* **Biology/Ecology/Environmental Science:** His love for nature and animals makes these areas highly probable.
* **Mathematics/Physics:**  His intelligence and puzzle-solving aptitude could easily lead him here.
* **Cognitive Science/Psychology:** Adam's empathy and understanding of others could spark an interest in these fields.
