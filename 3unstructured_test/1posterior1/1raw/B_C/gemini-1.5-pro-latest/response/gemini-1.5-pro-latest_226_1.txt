Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on personality inferences and not hard data:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work could align with business, his personality sketch doesn't strongly suggest an interest in the core aspects of business like finance, marketing, or management.  
* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly correlate with aptitudes often found in computer science students.  

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches are very limited in predicting career choices. Many other factors (practical skills, specific interests within a field, financial considerations) heavily influence graduate program decisions.
