Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts aligns well with computer science. His high intelligence further supports this possibility. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and an appreciation for hard work are relevant to business, the personality sketch doesn't strongly suggest an inclination towards business administration.  

**Important Note:** These probabilities are speculative.  Personality sketches provide limited information, and many other graduate fields could align with Adam's interests. For example:

* **Biology/Ecology:** His love for nature and animals could lead him to these fields.
* **Mathematics/Physics:**  His puzzle-solving skills and understanding of abstract concepts could translate well here.
