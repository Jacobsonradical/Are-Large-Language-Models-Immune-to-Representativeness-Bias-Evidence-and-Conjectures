Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's understanding of hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, there's nothing in his personality directly suggesting an interest in business administration. 
* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly align with the field of computer science. 

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on limited information.  People's personalities are complex, and their chosen fields of study are influenced by many factors not captured in a short description.
