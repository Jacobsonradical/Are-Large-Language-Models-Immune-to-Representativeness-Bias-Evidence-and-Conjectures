Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (0.6):** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication all align strongly with a computer science student profile. 
* **Business Administration (0.2):** While nothing in the description directly precludes business, the emphasis on nature, empathy, and lack of explicit interest in finance or management makes it less likely.  

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative exercise. Personality sketches can offer hints, but many other factors (past experiences, career goals, financial considerations) heavily influence a person's field of study.
