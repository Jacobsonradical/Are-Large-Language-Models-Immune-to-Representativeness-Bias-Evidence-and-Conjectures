Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his ability to understand abstract concepts strongly suggest an affinity for computer science.  His intelligence further supports this possibility. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, there's nothing in the description directly suggesting an interest in business administration. His empathy and love for animals might even make him less inclined towards more corporate-focused fields.

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on limited information.  People's personalities are complex, and there's no guarantee that Adam fits neatly into any stereotype. He could very well be passionate about a field not even considered here.
