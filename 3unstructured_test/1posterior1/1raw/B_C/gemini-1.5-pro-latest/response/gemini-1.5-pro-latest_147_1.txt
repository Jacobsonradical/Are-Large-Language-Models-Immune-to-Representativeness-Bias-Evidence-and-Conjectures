Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

**Analysis:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's intelligence and appreciation for hard work could be applicable to business, the description lacks strong indicators of interest in finance, marketing, or management.
* **Computer Science:**  Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts aligns well with computer science. His high intelligence further supports this possibility.

**Probabilities:**

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Explanation:**

* I've assigned a moderate probability (0.7) to computer science due to the strong alignment of Adam's traits with the field. 
* Business administration receives a lower probability (0.2) as the description lacks direct evidence of his interest in typical business-related areas.

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on a limited personality sketch. Many other graduate fields could be equally or even more fitting for Adam.
