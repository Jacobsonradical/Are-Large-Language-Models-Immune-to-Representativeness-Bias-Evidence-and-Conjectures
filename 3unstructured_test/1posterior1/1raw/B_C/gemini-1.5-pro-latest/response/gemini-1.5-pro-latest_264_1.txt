Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration (Low Probability - 0.2):** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, his core personality traits (love for nature, empathy, puzzle-solving) don't strongly align with a typical business administration student. 
* **Computer Science (Moderate Probability - 0.6):**  Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts are strong indicators of potential aptitude and interest in computer science. 

**Important Note:**  This is a highly speculative exercise.  Personality sketches offer limited insight into actual career choices. Many other fields could be equally or even more likely for Adam.
