Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (0.6):** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly suggest an affinity for computer science. This field often attracts individuals who enjoy problem-solving and logical thinking. 
* **Business Administration (0.2):** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, his other traits (love for nature, empathy, quiet demeanor) don't strongly align with the typical profile of a business administration graduate student. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative estimate based on a limited personality sketch. Many other graduate fields could also be a good fit for Adam (e.g., biology, environmental science, mathematics).
