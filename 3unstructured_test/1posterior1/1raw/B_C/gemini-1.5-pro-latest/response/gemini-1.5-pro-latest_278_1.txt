Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, his core interests (nature, puzzles, abstract concepts) don't strongly align with a typical business administration program. 
* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his ability to understand abstract concepts are strong indicators of potential interest in computer science. This field often attracts individuals with these traits. 

**Important Note:** This assessment is based on limited information and general stereotypes. There's a chance Adam could be in either field, or something entirely different. Personality sketches aren't definitive predictors of academic pursuits.
