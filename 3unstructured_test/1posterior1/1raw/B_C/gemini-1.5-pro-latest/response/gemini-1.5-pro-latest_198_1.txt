Here's an estimation based on the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (0.6):**  Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication all align strongly with the field of computer science. 
* **Business Administration (0.1):** While intelligence and an appreciation for hard work are useful in business, the personality sketch doesn't highlight traits typically associated with a strong interest in business administration, such as leadership, ambition for financial success, or a focus on market trends. Adam's affinity for nature and animals might suggest other career paths.

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative estimate. Personality traits offer limited insight into actual career choices. Many other factors, like personal experiences, opportunities, and specific interests within a field, influence graduate program selection.
