**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts aligns well with computer science. His high intelligence further supports this possibility. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, there's nothing in the description directly suggesting an interest in business concepts like finance, marketing, or management.  

**Important Note:** These probabilities are speculative.  Personality sketches offer limited information, and many other graduate fields could be a good fit for Adam.
