Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work could be applicable to business, his core personality traits (love for nature, puzzle-solving, empathy) don't strongly align with a typical business administration student. 
* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and ability to understand abstract concepts are strong indicators of an affinity for computer science.  His high intelligence further supports this likelihood.

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative exercise. Personality sketches offer limited insight, and many other graduate fields could be equally or more fitting for Adam.
