Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (0.6):** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication strongly align with a computer science student profile. 
* **Business Administration (0.2):** While Adam's personality doesn't directly contradict a business administration path, his core interests (nature, empathy, animals) are less aligned with the typical focus of business programs. However, it's not impossible, as some business specializations, like sustainability or non-profit management, could appeal to him. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly subjective assessment based on limited information.  Many other graduate fields could be equally or more likely for Adam.
