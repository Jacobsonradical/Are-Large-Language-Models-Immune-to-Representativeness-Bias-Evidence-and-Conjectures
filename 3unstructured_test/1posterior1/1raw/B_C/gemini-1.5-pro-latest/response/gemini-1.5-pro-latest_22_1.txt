Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the provided description:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts could point towards an interest in computer science.  His high intelligence also aligns with the field. However, there's no direct mention of technology or programming, so the probability is moderate.

* **Business Administration:**  While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, nothing in his personality sketch strongly suggests an interest in the core aspects of business like finance, marketing, or management. Therefore, the probability is low. 

**Important Note:** This assessment is based on limited information.  A more accurate prediction would require details about Adam's hobbies, experiences, or specific skills.
