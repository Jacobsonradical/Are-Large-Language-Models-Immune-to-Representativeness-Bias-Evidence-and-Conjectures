Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (0.7):** Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly suggest an affinity for computer science. This field often attracts individuals who enjoy problem-solving and logical thinking. 

* **Business Administration (0.2):** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, his other traits (love for nature, empathy, quiet demeanor) don't align as strongly with the typical image of a business administration student.  

**Important Note:** This is just a probability estimate based on limited information.  Many other graduate fields could be a good fit for Adam.  For example, biology, environmental science, or even something like data science could be strong possibilities.
