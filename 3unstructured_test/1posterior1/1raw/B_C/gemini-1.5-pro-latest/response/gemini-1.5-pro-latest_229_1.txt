Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, his core interests (nature, puzzles, abstract concepts) don't strongly align with a typical business administration program. 
* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his ability to grasp abstract concepts are good indicators of potential aptitude and interest in computer science. This field often attracts individuals who enjoy problem-solving and logical thinking.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are based on limited information and stereotypes. It's crucial to remember that people's personalities and career choices are complex and cannot be accurately predicted solely based on a short description.
