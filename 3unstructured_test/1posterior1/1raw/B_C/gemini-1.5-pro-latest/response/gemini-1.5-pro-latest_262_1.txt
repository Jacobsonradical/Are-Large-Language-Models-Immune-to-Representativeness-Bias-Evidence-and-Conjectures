Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:**  While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, his core interests (nature, puzzles, abstract concepts) don't strongly align with a typical business administration program. 
* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his ability to grasp abstract concepts are strong indicators of potential aptitude and interest in computer science. This field often attracts individuals who enjoy problem-solving and logical thinking. 

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on limited information.  Personality traits alone are not a reliable predictor of academic choices. Many other factors influence graduate program selection.
