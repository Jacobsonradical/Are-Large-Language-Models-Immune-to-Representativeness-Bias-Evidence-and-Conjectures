Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, his core interests (nature, animals, abstract concepts) don't strongly align with a typical business administration path. It's possible, but less likely.
* **Computer Science:**  Adam's love for puzzles and his ability to grasp abstract concepts are strong indicators of an affinity for computer science.  His high intelligence further supports this possibility. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are just estimates based on limited information. Many other graduate fields could be a good fit for Adam, such as:

* **Biology:** His love for nature and animals makes this a strong contender.
* **Environmental Science/Studies:**  A natural extension of his interest in nature.
* **Mathematics/Statistics:** His puzzle-solving skills and affinity for abstract concepts point towards potential in these areas.
