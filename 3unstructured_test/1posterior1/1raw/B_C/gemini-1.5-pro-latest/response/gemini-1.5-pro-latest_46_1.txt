Here's a breakdown of how the personality sketch relates to the probabilities, formatted as requested:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:**  Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly suggest an affinity for computer science.  
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, nothing in the sketch specifically indicates an interest in business concepts like finance, marketing, or management. 

**Important Notes:**

* These are just estimates based on limited information.  Personality traits alone cannot definitively determine a person's field of study. 
* Many other graduate fields could align with Adam's personality.  For example:
    * **Biology/Botany:** His love of nature and plants.
    * **Veterinary Science:** His love for animals.
    * **Mathematics/Physics:**  His intelligence and enjoyment of puzzles.
