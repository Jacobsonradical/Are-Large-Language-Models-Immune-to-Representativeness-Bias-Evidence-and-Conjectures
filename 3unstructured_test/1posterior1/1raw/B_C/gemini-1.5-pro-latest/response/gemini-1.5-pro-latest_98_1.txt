Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, there's nothing in the sketch specifically suggesting an inclination towards business concepts like finance, marketing, or management. 
* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with the skills and interests often found in computer science students. 

**Important Note:** These are just estimates based on limited information.  Personality traits alone are not highly predictive of academic specialization. Many other factors influence graduate program choices.
