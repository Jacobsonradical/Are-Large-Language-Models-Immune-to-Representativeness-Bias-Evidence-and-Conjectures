Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts aligns well with computer science. His high intelligence further supports this possibility. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, there's little in the sketch to suggest a strong inclination towards the core aspects of business administration (finance, marketing, etc.).

**Important Notes:**

* This is a highly speculative exercise. Personality sketches offer limited insight into actual career choices. 
* Many other graduate fields could be likely for Adam.  His interest in nature could lead him to environmental science, biology, or related fields. 
*  It's crucial to avoid stereotypes.  Many people with Adam's traits excel in diverse fields.
