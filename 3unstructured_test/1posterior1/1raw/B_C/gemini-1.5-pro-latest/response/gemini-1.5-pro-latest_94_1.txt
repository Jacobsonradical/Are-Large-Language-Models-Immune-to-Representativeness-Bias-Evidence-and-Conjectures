Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, his core interests in nature, animals, and puzzle-solving don't strongly align with a typical business administration path. 
* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts are strong indicators of a potential affinity for computer science.  

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative estimate based on a limited personality sketch. Many other graduate fields could also be a good fit for Adam, such as:

* **Biology:** Aligns with his love for nature and animals.
* **Environmental Science:** Connects to his curiosity about nature.
* **Mathematics:**  Fits with his puzzle-solving skills and abstract thinking.
