Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts align well with the field of computer science.  
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, there's nothing in the description strongly suggesting an inclination towards business administration. His empathy and love for animals might even point away from a purely business-focused path. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on limited information.  Many other graduate fields could also be a good fit for Adam.  For example:

* **Biology/Ecology:**  His curiosity about nature and love for animals could lead him to these fields.
* **Mathematics:**  His puzzle-solving skills and high intelligence are strong indicators of a potential interest in mathematics.
