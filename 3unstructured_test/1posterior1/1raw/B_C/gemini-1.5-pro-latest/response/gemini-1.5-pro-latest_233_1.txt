Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on a personality sketch and not concrete data:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applied to business, there's nothing in his personality sketch directly suggesting an interest in business concepts like finance, marketing, or management. 
* **Computer Science:**  Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts strongly aligns with skills valuable in computer science. His high intelligence further supports this likelihood.

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches are not foolproof predictors of academic choices. Many other fields could also be a good fit for Adam, such as biology (given his love of nature), mathematics, or even engineering.
