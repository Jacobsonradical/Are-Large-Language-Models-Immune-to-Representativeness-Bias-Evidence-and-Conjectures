Here's a breakdown of how we can estimate the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

**Analysis**

* **Curiosity about nature and plants:** This leans slightly away from computer science and business administration, suggesting potential interests in biology, environmental science, or related fields.
* **Quiet, enjoys solving puzzles, high intelligence, good with abstract concepts:** This combination strongly suggests an aptitude for computer science.  It also fits with fields like mathematics, physics, or engineering.
* **Warm heart, strong empathy:**  These traits are less typical markers for computer science or business administration, although they certainly don't exclude those fields. They might point towards fields involving human interaction or social impact.
* **Deep love for animals:** This could suggest interests in veterinary medicine, zoology, or animal behavioral science.

**Probabilities**

Given the above, here's my assessment:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3", 
  "business administration": "0.1" 
}
```

**Reasoning**

* **Computer Science (0.3):** While Adam's puzzle-solving abilities and intellect make computer science a possibility, his love for nature and animals lowers the likelihood. It's plausible he combines his technical aptitude with his other interests (e.g., bioinformatics, computational biology).

* **Business Administration (0.1):** The personality sketch provides very little indication of interest in business, finance, or management.  While his intelligence could lead him to any field, his other traits make business administration less likely. 

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on limited information.  People are complex, and personality traits alone cannot definitively predict career choices.
