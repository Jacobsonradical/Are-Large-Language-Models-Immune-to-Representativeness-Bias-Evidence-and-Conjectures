Here's a breakdown of how we can estimate the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

**Analysis**

* **Curiosity about nature and plants:** This slightly points away from business administration and is more neutral towards computer science. Biology, environmental studies, or related fields would be a stronger match. 
* **Quiet, puzzle-solver, good with abstract concepts:** These traits are often associated with computer science.
* **High intelligence:** Applicable to both fields, but perhaps slightly more common in STEM fields like computer science.
* **Empathy and love for animals:**  This doesn't strongly suggest either field.

**Probabilities**

Given the information, here's a reasonable probability estimate:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Business Administration (0.2):** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the description doesn't strongly suggest an inclination towards business concepts.
* **Computer Science (0.6):**  The puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, and quiet nature align well with common perceptions of computer science students.

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on limited information.  Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of academic choices. Many other fields could be equally or more likely for Adam.
