Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts suggests an affinity for logical thinking and problem-solving, key traits in computer science. However, the description lacks clear indicators of a passion for technology or programming, making the probability moderate rather than high. 
* **Business Administration:**  While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, his personality profile leans more towards intellectual pursuits and empathy-driven interests. The probability here is low, as the description doesn't highlight common traits associated with business aspirations, such as leadership, ambition for financial success, or interest in market dynamics.

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative estimate. Personality sketches offer limited insight into academic choices. Many other fields (biology, environmental science, mathematics, psychology) could be equally or more likely for Adam.
