Here's a breakdown of how the personality sketch might inform our probability estimates:

**Indicators that might suggest Computer Science:**

* **"Enjoys solving puzzles"**: This aligns well with computational thinking.
* **"High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts"**:  Key skills for computer science. 

**Indicators that might suggest against Computer Science (or at least don't strongly point to it):**

* **"Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants"**, **"Deep love for animals"**: While not mutually exclusive with computer science, these suggest interests that might lead to fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine.

**Indicators that might suggest against Business Administration:**

* The personality sketch emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work.  These are not traits traditionally associated as core to business administration, though certainly not absent in the field. 

**With this analysis, here's a possible probability assignment:**

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses.  Personality sketches are not reliable predictors of academic majors. Many other factors (personal experiences, career goals, financial considerations) heavily influence graduate school choices.
