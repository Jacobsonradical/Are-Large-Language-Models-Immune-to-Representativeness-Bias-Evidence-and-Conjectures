Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, his core personality traits (love for nature, puzzle-solving, empathy) don't strongly align with a typical business administration student.  
* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly suggest an aptitude for computer science. This field often attracts individuals who find satisfaction in problem-solving and logical thinking.

**Important Notes:**

* These are just estimates based on a brief personality sketch.  Many other fields could also be a good fit for Adam (biology, environmental science, mathematics, etc.). 
* Personality is just one factor in choosing a field of study.  Interests, experiences, and career goals also play significant roles.
