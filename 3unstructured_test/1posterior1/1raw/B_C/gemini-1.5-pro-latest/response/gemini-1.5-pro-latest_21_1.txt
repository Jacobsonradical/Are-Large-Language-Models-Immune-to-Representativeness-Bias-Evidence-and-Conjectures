Here's an estimated probability based on the personality description:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (Higher Probability):**  Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly align with a computer science student profile. 
* **Business Administration (Lower Probability):** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, the description lacks clear indicators of interest in finance, management, or marketing â€“ typical business administration themes. His love for nature and animals might suggest a preference for fields outside the traditional business realm.

**Important Note:** This is a purely speculative assessment based on a limited personality sketch. Many other graduate programs could also be a good fit for Adam.  His actual field of study could be entirely different.
