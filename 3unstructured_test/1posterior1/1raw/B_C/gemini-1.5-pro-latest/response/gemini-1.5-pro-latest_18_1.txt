Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (Higher Probability):** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, ability to grasp abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication strongly align with the field of computer science. 
* **Business Administration (Lower Probability):** While some aspects of Adam's personality (e.g., intelligence) could be applicable to business, his core interests in nature, animals, and potentially abstract problem-solving don't have as strong a connection to the core elements of a typical business administration program.

**Important Notes:**

* These are just estimates based on limited information.  
* People's personalities are complex, and their career choices can be influenced by many factors not mentioned in the sketch.
* There are many other graduate fields that could be a good fit for Adam (e.g., biology, environmental science, data science).
