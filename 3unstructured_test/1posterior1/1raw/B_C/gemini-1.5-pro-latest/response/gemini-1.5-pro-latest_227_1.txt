Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business,  his core interests in nature, animals, and abstract concepts don't strongly align with a typical business administration focus. 
* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his ability to grasp abstract concepts suggest a higher likelihood of interest in computer science. This field often involves problem-solving, logical thinking, and working with complex systems.

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are speculative. Personality traits alone cannot definitively determine a person's field of study. Many other factors influence graduate school choices, including career goals, specific interests within a field, financial considerations, and opportunities available.
