Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts strongly correlate with skills valued in computer science. 
* **Business Administration:** While the description doesn't directly contradict a business inclination, Adam's core traits (love for nature, empathy, appreciation for hard work) don't align as strongly with the typical image of a business administration student. However, it's not impossible, as business administration is a broad field and some specializations (like sustainable business or non-profit management) might appeal to him.

**Important Note:**  This is a highly speculative estimate. Personality sketches are not reliable predictors of academic choices. Many other factors influence a person's field of study, including:

* **Specific Interests:**  Adam's interest in "nature and its various plants" could point to fields like botany, environmental science, or even landscape architecture. 
* **Experiences:**  Past experiences, mentors, and opportunities play a significant role in shaping career paths.
* **Goals and Values:**  Adam's "warm heart" and "strong empathy" could lead him to fields focused on helping others, such as social work or healthcare.
