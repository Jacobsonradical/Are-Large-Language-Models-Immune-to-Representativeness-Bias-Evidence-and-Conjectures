Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

**Analysis**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts could point towards computer science. His high intelligence further supports this possibility.
* **Business Administration:**  The description doesn't offer strong indicators for business administration. While intelligence and work ethic are valuable in business, they aren't specific enough to suggest this field. 

**Probability Estimates:**

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Computer Science (0.7):**  The profile heavily suggests an affinity for analytical and problem-solving skills often associated with computer science. 
* **Business Administration (0.3):**  While not impossible, there's not enough evidence to assign a high probability.  A love for nature and empathy might even make Adam less likely to pursue a traditionally corporate-focused field.

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on a limited personality sketch.  Many other graduate fields could be equally or even more fitting for Adam.
