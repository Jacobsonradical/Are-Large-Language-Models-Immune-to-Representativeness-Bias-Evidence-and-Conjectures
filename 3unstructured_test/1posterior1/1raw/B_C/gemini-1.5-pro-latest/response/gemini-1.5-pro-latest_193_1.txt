Here's a breakdown of how we can assess the probabilities and a potential answer:

**Assessing the Probabilities**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's profile (puzzle-solving, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts) aligns well with traits often found in computer science students.  
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and work ethic are valuable in business, Adam's personality sketch doesn't have strong indicators specifically pointing to business administration. His love for nature and animals might suggest interests elsewhere.

**Estimated Probabilities** (These are subjective based on the provided information)

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3" 
}
```

**Important Note:**  These are just estimates. People are complex, and personality sketches don't always directly translate to career choices. There's a chance Adam is passionate about applying technology to environmental studies, combining his interests in unexpected ways.
