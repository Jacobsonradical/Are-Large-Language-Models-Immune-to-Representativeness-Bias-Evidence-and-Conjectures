Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, his core interests (nature, puzzles, abstract concepts) don't strongly align with a typical business administration program. 
* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts are strong indicators of potential interest in computer science. His high intelligence further supports this possibility. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on limited information.  Many other graduate fields could also be a good fit for Adam.  For example:

* **Biology/Ecology:**  His love of nature and plants makes this a strong contender.
* **Mathematics/Physics:** His interest in puzzles and abstract concepts could lead him here.
* **Cognitive Science/Neuroscience:** His empathy and intelligence could spark interest in how the brain works.
