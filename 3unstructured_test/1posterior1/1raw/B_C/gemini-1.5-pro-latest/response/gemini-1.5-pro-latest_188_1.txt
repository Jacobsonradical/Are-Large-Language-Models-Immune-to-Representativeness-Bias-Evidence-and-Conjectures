Here's an estimated probability based on the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts align well with computer science. This field often attracts individuals who enjoy problem-solving and logical thinking. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, the personality sketch lacks strong indicators of a business-oriented mindset (e.g., interest in finance, leadership, marketing). His empathy and love for animals might even suggest a preference for fields with a less corporate focus.

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on limited information.  Personality sketches can offer some clues, but they are not definitive predictors of a person's field of study. Many other graduate programs could align with Adam's traits, such as biology, environmental science, or even something like architecture.
