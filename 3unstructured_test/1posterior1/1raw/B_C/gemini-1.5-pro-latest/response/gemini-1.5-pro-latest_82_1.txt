Here's an estimated probability based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, there's nothing in his personality directly suggesting an interest in finance, management, or marketing, which are core components of business administration. 
* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his ability to understand abstract concepts strongly align with skills valuable in computer science.  His high intelligence further supports this likelihood.

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative estimate.  Personality traits alone cannot definitively predict a person's field of study. Many other factors, like personal experiences, career goals, and specific interests, play a significant role.
