Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (Higher Probability):** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his aptitude for understanding abstract concepts align strongly with skills valued in computer science. His high intelligence further supports this likelihood. 
* **Business Administration (Lower Probability):** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, there's nothing in the sketch directly suggesting an inclination towards business concepts like management, finance, or marketing.  

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative assessment based on limited information.  Many other fields could also be a good fit for Adam. For example:

* **Biology/Ecology:** His love for nature and plants suggests a strong affinity for these fields.
* **Veterinary Science:** His love for animals could lead him to a career working with them.
* **Mathematics/Physics:** His enjoyment of puzzles and abstract concepts might draw him towards these areas.
