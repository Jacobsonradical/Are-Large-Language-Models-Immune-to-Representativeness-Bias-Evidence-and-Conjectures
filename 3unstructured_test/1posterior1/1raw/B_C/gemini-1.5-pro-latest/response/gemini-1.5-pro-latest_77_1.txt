Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly suggest an affinity for computer science. This field often involves problem-solving, logical thinking, and abstract reasoning.
* **Business Administration:** The personality sketch doesn't provide strong indicators for business administration. While empathy and understanding hard work are valuable in business, they aren't specific enough to suggest a high probability of Adam pursuing this field. 

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are speculative. Personality sketches offer limited insight, and many other fields could align with Adam's traits (e.g., biology, environmental science, mathematics).
