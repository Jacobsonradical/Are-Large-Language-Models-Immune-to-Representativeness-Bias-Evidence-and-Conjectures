Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts aligns well with computer science. His high intelligence further supports this possibility. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, the personality sketch lacks strong indicators of interests typically associated with business administration (e.g., leadership, finance, marketing). 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Personality is not destiny:**  While personality traits can offer clues about career preferences, they are not definitive predictors of graduate school enrollment.  
* **Other fields:** The description strongly suggests Adam might be drawn to fields like biology, environmental science, or even veterinary medicine due to his love of nature and animals. 

**Therefore, the probabilities assigned are just estimations based on limited information.**
