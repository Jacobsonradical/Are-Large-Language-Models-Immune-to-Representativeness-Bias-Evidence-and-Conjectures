Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (Higher Probability):** Adam's enjoyment of puzzle-solving, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts strongly align with skills valued in computer science. 
* **Business Administration (Lower Probability):** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication is relevant to business, the description lacks clear indicators of a strong interest in business concepts like finance, marketing, or management.  His love for nature and animals might suggest other career paths. 

**Important Note:** This assessment is based on limited information and stereotypes. Many individuals with Adam's personality traits excel in diverse fields.
