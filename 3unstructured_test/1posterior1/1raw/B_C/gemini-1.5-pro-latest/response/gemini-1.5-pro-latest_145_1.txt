Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the description of Adam:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:**  While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, nothing in his personality sketch strongly suggests an interest in the core aspects of business like finance, marketing, or management. 
* **Computer Science:**  Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his ability to understand abstract concepts are good indicators of a potential affinity for computer science. His high intelligence further supports this possibility.

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative exercise. Personality sketches provide limited information, and many other graduate fields could align with Adam's interests.  For example, biology, environmental science, or even mathematics would be strong contenders.
