Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's understanding of hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, nothing in his personality directly suggests an interest in finance, management, or other typical business fields. 
* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his ability to grasp abstract concepts are strong indicators of a potential affinity for computer science. This field often attracts individuals who enjoy problem-solving and logical thinking. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative estimate based on a limited personality sketch. Many other fields could also be likely fits for Adam (e.g., biology, environmental science, mathematics).
