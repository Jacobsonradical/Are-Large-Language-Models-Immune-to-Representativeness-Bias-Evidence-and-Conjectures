Here's an estimated probability based on the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, his core interests (nature, puzzles, abstract concepts) don't strongly align with a typical business administration program. Hence, a low probability is assigned.
* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his aptitude for abstract concepts are good indicators of potential interest in computer science.  His high intelligence further supports this. Thus, the probability is higher than business administration but not overly high as his love for nature and animals might suggest different academic pursuits. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative estimate based on limited information.  Personality traits alone are not strong predictors of academic choices. Many other factors influence a person's field of study.
