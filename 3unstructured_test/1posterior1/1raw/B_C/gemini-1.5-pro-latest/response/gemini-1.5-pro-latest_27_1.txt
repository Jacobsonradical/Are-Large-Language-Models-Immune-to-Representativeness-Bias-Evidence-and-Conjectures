Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's understanding of hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, nothing in his personality sketch directly suggests an interest in business administration. 
* **Computer Science:**  Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts align strongly with skills and interests common in computer science. His quiet nature also somewhat fits the stereotype of the field.

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative assessment. Personality sketches provide limited information, and many other graduate fields could be just as likely, if not more so, for Adam.
