Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (0.6):** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly suggest an affinity for computer science. This field often attracts individuals who enjoy problem-solving and logical thinking. 

* **Business Administration (0.2):** While the description doesn't directly contradict a business administration pursuit, there's little direct evidence to support it. Adam's empathy and love for animals might suggest different career paths. His appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applied in various fields, including business, but it's not a defining characteristic.

**Important Note:** Personality sketches offer limited information. Many other fields could be equally or more likely for Adam.  His passion for nature could lead him to environmental science, biology, or related areas.
