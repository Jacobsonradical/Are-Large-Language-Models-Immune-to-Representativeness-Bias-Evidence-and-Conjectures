Here's an estimation of probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts align well with the field of computer science. This suggests a moderate to good chance (0.4) of him being enrolled in this field. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's understanding and appreciation for hard work are relevant to business, his personality sketch lacks strong indicators of direct interest in business concepts like finance, marketing, or management. This makes it less likely (0.1). 

**Important Note:** This is just a probabilistic estimation based on limited information.  Many other fields could be equally or even more likely for Adam. For a more accurate assessment, we would need additional information about his interests, skills, and aspirations.
