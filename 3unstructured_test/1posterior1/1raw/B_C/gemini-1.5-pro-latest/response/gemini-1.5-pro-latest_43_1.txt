Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (Higher Probability):** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly align with the field of computer science. 
* **Business Administration (Lower Probability):** While the description mentions an appreciation for hard work and dedication, it lacks direct indicators of interest in business, finance, or management â€“ core elements of a business administration program.

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative estimate.  Personality traits offer limited insight into actual academic choices. Many other fields could be equally or even more likely for Adam.
