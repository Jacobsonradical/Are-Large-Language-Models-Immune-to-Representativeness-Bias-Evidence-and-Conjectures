Here's a breakdown of how we can estimate the probabilities based on the provided information:

**Analysis:**

* **Computer Science:**  Adam's love for puzzles and his high intelligence correlate with skills often found in computer science students. His ability to understand abstract concepts further supports this possibility. 
* **Business Administration:** The description doesn't offer strong indicators for business administration. While empathy and understanding hard work are valuable in business, they aren't specific enough to suggest a high probability.

**Probability Estimates:**

Considering the above, here's a reasonable estimate:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Important Note:** These are just estimates based on a limited personality sketch. Many other fields could also be likely fits for Adam (biology, environmental science, mathematics, etc.).
