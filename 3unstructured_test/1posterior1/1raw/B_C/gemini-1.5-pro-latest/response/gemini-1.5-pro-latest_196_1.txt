Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, there's nothing in the sketch directly suggesting an interest in business concepts like finance, marketing, or management. 
* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his ability to understand abstract concepts are strong indicators of a mind drawn to computer science. This field often involves problem-solving, logical thinking, and working with complex systems.

**Important Note:** This assessment is based on limited information and relies on general stereotypes.  Many other graduate fields could be a good fit for Adam, such as:

* **Biology/Botany:**  His love for nature and interest in plants suggest this field.
* **Environmental Science:** This could combine his love for nature with his empathy and potentially lead to a career focused on conservation or sustainability. 
* **Mathematics:** His enjoyment of puzzles and abstract concepts could translate well to mathematics. 
 
Ultimately, a more complete picture of Adam's interests and goals would be needed to make a more accurate prediction.
