Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.15"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly correlate with traits often found in computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:**  While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, the personality sketch lacks strong indicators typically associated with business aspirations, such as leadership, ambition for financial success, or interest in markets. His empathy and love for animals might even suggest a preference for fields with a less corporate focus.

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative exercise. Personality sketches provide limited information, and many other fields could be equally or even more likely for Adam.
