Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work could be applied to business, his core personality traits (love for nature, empathy, puzzle-solving) don't strongly align with a typical business administration path. 
* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his ability to grasp abstract concepts are strong indicators of a potential interest in computer science.  

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on limited information. Many other graduate programs could also be a good fit for Adam.  Personality traits alone are not a reliable predictor of someone's field of study.
