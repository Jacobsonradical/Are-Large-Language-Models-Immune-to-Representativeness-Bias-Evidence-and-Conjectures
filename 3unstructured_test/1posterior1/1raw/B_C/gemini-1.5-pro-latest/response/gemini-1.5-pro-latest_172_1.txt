Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (0.6):** Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly suggest an affinity for computer science. This field often attracts individuals who enjoy problem-solving and logical thinking. 
* **Business Administration (0.2):** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, the personality sketch lacks strong indicators of a business-oriented mindset.  His interests in nature and animals don't directly correlate with business administration.  

**Important Note:** These are just estimates based on a limited personality sketch.  People's interests and career choices are complex, and there's always a chance Adam could be drawn to a field not immediately obvious from this description.
