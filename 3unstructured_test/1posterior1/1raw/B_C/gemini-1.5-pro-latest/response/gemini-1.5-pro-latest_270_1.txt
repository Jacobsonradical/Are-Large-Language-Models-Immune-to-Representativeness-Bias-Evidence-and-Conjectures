Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, nothing in his personality profile strongly suggests an interest in the core aspects of business like finance, marketing, or management. 
* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his ability to grasp abstract concepts align well with the problem-solving and logical thinking often required in computer science.  His high intelligence further supports this likelihood. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative exercise. Personality sketches can offer hints about career preferences, but they are not reliable predictors. Many other fields could be just as likely, if not more so, for Adam.
