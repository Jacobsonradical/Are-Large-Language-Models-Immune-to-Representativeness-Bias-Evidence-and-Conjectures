Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts strongly suggests an affinity for computer science.  His high intelligence further supports this. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, the personality sketch lacks strong indicators typically associated with business aspirations (e.g., leadership, ambition for financial success).

**Important Notes:**

* These are just estimates based on limited information.  Many other fields could be equally or even more likely for Adam. 
*  Interests and personality traits are not always perfect predictors of career choices.
