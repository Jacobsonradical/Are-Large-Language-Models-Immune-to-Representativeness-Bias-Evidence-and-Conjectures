Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, his core interests in nature, puzzles, and abstract concepts don't strongly suggest a business inclination. 
* **Computer Science:**  Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts align well with the skills and interests often found in computer science students. 

**Important Notes:**

* This is just an estimate based on limited information. 
* Many other graduate fields could be a good fit for Adam (e.g., biology, environmental science, mathematics, data science).
*  Personality is just one factor in choosing a field of study. Adam's actual enrollment would be influenced by his specific academic background, career goals, and opportunities.
