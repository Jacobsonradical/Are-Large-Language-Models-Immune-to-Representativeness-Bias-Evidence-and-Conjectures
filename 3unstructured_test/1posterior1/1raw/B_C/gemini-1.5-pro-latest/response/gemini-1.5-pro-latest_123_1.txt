Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (Higher Probability):**  Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly align with a computer science student profile. 
* **Business Administration (Lower Probability):** While the description doesn't explicitly exclude business administration, there's no strong indication of interests typically associated with the field like leadership, finance, or marketing. Adam's empathy and love for animals might even suggest a preference for fields with a more direct positive impact. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative exercise. Personality sketches offer limited information, and many individuals with Adam's traits could be found in various other fields (biology, environmental science, mathematics, etc.).
