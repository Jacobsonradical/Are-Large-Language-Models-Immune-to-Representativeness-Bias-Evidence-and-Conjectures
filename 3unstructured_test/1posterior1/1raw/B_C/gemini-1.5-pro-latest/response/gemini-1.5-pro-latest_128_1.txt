Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

**Analysis:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts are strong indicators of potential aptitude for computer science.  His high intelligence further supports this.
* **Business Administration:**  While intelligence is valuable in business, the description doesn't strongly suggest an inclination towards business administration.  His empathy and love for animals might even point away from fields with a heavy focus on profit maximization.

**Probability Estimates:**

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Explanation:**

* It's more likely that Adam is in a field aligning with his puzzle-solving and abstract thinking skills, hence the higher probability for computer science. 
* Business administration is assigned a lower probability, as the personality sketch doesn't offer strong supporting evidence.

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are speculative.  Personality provides some clues, but many other factors (interests, experiences, opportunities) ultimately determine a person's field of study.
