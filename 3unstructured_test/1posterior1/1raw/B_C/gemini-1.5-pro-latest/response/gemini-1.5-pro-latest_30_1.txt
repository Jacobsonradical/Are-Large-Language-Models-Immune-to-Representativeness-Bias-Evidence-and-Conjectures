Here's an estimated probability based on the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his ability to understand abstract concepts correlate well with skills often found in computer science students. His high intelligence further supports this possibility. 
* **Business Administration:** The personality sketch doesn't strongly suggest an inclination towards business. While understanding hard work and dedication is valuable in business, it's not a defining characteristic and is applicable across many fields.  

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative estimate.  Personality traits alone provide limited insight into academic choices. Many other factors influence a person's field of study, including:

* **Specific Interests:**  Adam's interest in nature and plants might draw him towards environmental science, biology, or related fields.
* **Career Goals:**  His career aspirations would heavily influence his choice of study. 
* **Experiences:** Past experiences, mentors, and opportunities play a significant role.

It's crucial to avoid stereotypes when making these types of estimations.
