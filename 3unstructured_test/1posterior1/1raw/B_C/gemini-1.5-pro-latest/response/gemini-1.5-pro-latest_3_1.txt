Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly suggest an affinity for computer science. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work aligns with business, the personality sketch doesn't offer strong indicators of an interest in the core elements of business administration (e.g., finance, marketing, management). His empathy and love for nature might even suggest a preference for fields less focused on corporate settings.

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on limited information.  Personality traits alone cannot definitively determine a person's field of study. Many other factors influence career choices.
