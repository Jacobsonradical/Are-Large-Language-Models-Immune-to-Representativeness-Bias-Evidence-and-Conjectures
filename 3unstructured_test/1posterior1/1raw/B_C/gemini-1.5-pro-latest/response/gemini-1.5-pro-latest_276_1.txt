Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

**Assessment:**

* **Curiosity about nature and plants:** This points away from business administration and slightly towards fields like biology or environmental science. It doesn't strongly suggest computer science, though some in the field might be drawn to bioinformatics.
* **Enjoys solving puzzles, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts:** This is a strong indicator for computer science. It could also be applicable to fields like mathematics, physics, or even economics within business administration.
* **Quiet, warm heart, strong empathy, love for animals:** These traits don't strongly correlate with any of the listed fields. 

**Probabilities:**

Considering the above, here's a reasonable estimate:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Business Administration (0.2):** While intelligence and problem-solving are useful in business, Adam's other traits don't strongly suggest this field. The probability isn't zero because he could be interested in fields like data analysis or quantitative finance within business schools.
* **Computer Science (0.7):**  His love for puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts make computer science a much more likely choice. 

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches provide limited information. Many other factors influence a person's choice of graduate study.  This assessment is purely speculative.
