Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's understanding of hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, his core personality traits (love for nature, quiet demeanor, puzzle-solving) don't strongly align with the typical image of a business administration student. 
* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his ability to understand abstract concepts are strong indicators of an inclination towards computer science. His high intelligence further supports this possibility. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative exercise. Personality sketches can offer hints about a person's interests, but they are not reliable predictors of academic choices.  Many other fields could also be a good fit for Adam.
