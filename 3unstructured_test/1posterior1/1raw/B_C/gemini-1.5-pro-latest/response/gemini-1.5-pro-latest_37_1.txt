Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, nothing in his personality profile strongly suggests an inclination towards the core aspects of business administration like finance, marketing, or management. 
* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his ability to grasp abstract concepts align well with the problem-solving and logical thinking required in computer science. His high intelligence further supports this likelihood.

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are speculative and based solely on a brief personality sketch. Many other graduate fields could also be a good fit for Adam.  His actual field of study could be influenced by a multitude of other factors not mentioned in the description.
