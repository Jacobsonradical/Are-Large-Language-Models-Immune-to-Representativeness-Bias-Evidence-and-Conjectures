Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (0.6):** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly align with a computer science profile.  
* **Business Administration (0.2):** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, his other traits (love of nature, empathy) are less typical of students drawn to this field. 

**Important Note:** This is just an educated guess based on limited information.  Personality traits alone cannot definitively predict a person's field of study. Many other factors, like personal experiences, interests, and career goals, influence this decision.
