Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his high intelligence make computer science a possibility. His ability to understand abstract concepts is also a strong indicator for this field. However, there's no direct mention of technology or programming interests, which are more typical for computer science students. 

* **Business Administration:** Adam's personality sketch doesn't strongly suggest a business inclination. While his appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applied to business, his other traits (love for nature, empathy, quiet demeanor) are less common in the stereotypical image of a business student. 

**Important Notes:**

* These probabilities are based on general stereotypes and the limited information provided. There's no guarantee that Adam fits these stereotypes.
* Many other graduate programs could align with Adam's personality, such as biology, environmental science, mathematics, or even creative writing.
