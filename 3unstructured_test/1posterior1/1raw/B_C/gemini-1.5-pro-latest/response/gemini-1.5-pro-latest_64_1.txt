Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with the skills often found in computer science students.  
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, the personality sketch lacks strong indicators of a specific interest in business concepts like finance, marketing, or management.

**Important Note:** These are just estimates based on a brief description.  Personality traits alone cannot definitively predict someone's field of study. Many other factors (interests, experiences, goals) influence a person's academic path.
