Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could align with a business career, nothing in his personality sketch strongly suggests an interest in business administration. 
* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly correlate with skills valuable in computer science. His quiet nature also somewhat aligns with the stereotype of computer science students.

**Important Note:**  These are just educated guesses based on a brief personality sketch. There's not enough information for a definitive answer. Adam could easily be pursuing other fields like biology, environmental science, or even creative writing.
