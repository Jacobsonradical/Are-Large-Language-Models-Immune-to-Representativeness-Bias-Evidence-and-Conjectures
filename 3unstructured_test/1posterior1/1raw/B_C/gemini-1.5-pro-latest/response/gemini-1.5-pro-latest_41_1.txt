Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly correlate with skills valuable in computer science. This makes it a moderately likely field for him (hence a probability of 0.4). 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication are relevant to business, his other traits (love for nature, empathy, quiet demeanor) don't align as strongly with a typical business administration path. This makes it a less likely choice (hence a lower probability of 0.1).

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches provide limited information. Many other graduate fields could be strong possibilities for Adam.  Fields like biology, environmental science, or even mathematics could be equally or even more likely than computer science given his love for nature and analytical skills.
