Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be found in business-minded individuals, nothing in his profile directly suggests a strong interest in business administration.  A 0.2 probability acknowledges the possibility, but keeps it low.

* **Computer Science:**  Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly align with traits often found in computer science students. This, combined with his quiet nature, makes computer science a more likely field for him. A 0.6 probability reflects this higher likelihood.

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on personality traits.  Many other graduate fields could also be a good fit for Adam.  His actual field of study could be influenced by factors not mentioned in the sketch.
