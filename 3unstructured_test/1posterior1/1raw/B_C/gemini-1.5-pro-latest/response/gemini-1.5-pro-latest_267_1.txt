Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, his core interests (nature, puzzles, abstract concepts) don't strongly align with a typical business administration path. 
* **Computer Science:**  Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his ability to grasp abstract concepts are strong indicators of an aptitude for computer science. His high intelligence further supports this likelihood. 

**Important Note:** These are just estimates based on limited information.  Many other fields could be a good fit for Adam (biology, environmental science, mathematics, etc.).  His actual field of study in 2021 could be influenced by many other factors not mentioned in the personality sketch.
