Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (0.6):**  Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly align with a computer science profile. 
* **Business Administration (0.2):** While the description doesn't directly contradict a business administration path, there's nothing that explicitly supports it either.  His empathy and love for animals might suggest less interest in the corporate world, but it's not impossible.  

**Important Notes:**

* **Personality Isn't Destiny:** Personality traits offer clues, not guarantees, about career choices. Many factors influence a person's field of study.
* **Limited Information:** The sketch provides a narrow view.  Interests like economics, data analysis, or even computational biology could bridge the gap between Adam's personality and a business-oriented field.
