Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts strongly suggest an affinity for computer science. His high intelligence further supports this likelihood. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, the personality sketch lacks strong indicators of interests typically associated with business administration (e.g., leadership, finance, marketing).  

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative exercise. Personality sketches can offer hints about a person's interests, but they are not definitive predictors of academic choices. Many other fields align with Adam's profile, such as biology, environmental science, mathematics, or even something like architecture.
