Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly correlate with a computer science student profile. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, Adam's other traits (love for nature, empathy, quiet personality) are less typical of students drawn to this field. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative estimate. Personality traits alone cannot reliably predict someone's field of study. Many other factors (interests, opportunities, financial considerations) influence a person's academic choices.
