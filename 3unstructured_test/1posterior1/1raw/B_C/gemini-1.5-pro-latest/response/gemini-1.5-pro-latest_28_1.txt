Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's understanding of hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, there's nothing in his personality sketch that directly points towards an interest in business administration. 
* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, ability to grasp abstract concepts, and quiet nature align well with traits often found in computer science students. 

**Important Notes:**

* These are just probabilities based on limited information. Many other fields could also be a good fit for Adam (e.g., biology, environmental science).
* People are complex, and personality sketches don't always predict career choices accurately.
