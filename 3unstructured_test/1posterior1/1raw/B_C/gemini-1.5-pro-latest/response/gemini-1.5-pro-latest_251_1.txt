Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly suggest an affinity for computer science. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, there's nothing in the description directly suggesting an interest in business concepts like finance, marketing, or management. 

**Important Notes:**

* These are just estimates based on limited information.  
* Many other graduate fields align well with Adam's personality (e.g., biology, environmental science, mathematics). 
* People's interests and career choices are complex and can't be perfectly predicted by a personality sketch.
