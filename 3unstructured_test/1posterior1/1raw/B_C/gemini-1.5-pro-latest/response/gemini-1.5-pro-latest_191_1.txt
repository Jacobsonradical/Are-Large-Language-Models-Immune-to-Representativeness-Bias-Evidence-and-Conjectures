Here's a breakdown of how we can assess the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on a personality sketch and not concrete data:

**Analysis**

* **Curiosity about nature and plants:** This points slightly away from business administration and could suggest fields like botany, environmental science, or even (less directly) chemical engineering (plant-based materials). 
* **Quiet, puzzle-solver, good with abstract concepts:** This is a classic profile for someone in computer science, mathematics, or theoretical physics. 
* **Warm heart, strong empathy, love for animals:**  These traits don't strongly correlate with the given fields. He might be drawn to veterinary medicine, animal behavior, or social work, but these aren't graduate fields directly related to our options. 
* **Understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication:** This is a general trait applicable to most successful graduate students.

**Probability Estimates**

Considering the above, here's a possible probability assignment:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning**

* **Business Administration (0.2 - Unlikely):**  While Adam's intelligence could lead him to business, his personality sketch doesn't strongly suggest an interest in the core aspects of business administration (finance, marketing, management).
* **Computer Science (0.7 - Likely):** The description heavily implies an aptitude and likely interest in computer science. His problem-solving skills, comfort with abstract concepts, and quiet nature fit the profile of someone who might thrive in this field.

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches are limited.  Many other fields could be a good fit for Adam. This assessment is purely speculative and based on the provided information.
