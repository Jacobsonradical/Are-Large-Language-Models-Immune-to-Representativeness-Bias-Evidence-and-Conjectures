Here's a breakdown of how I'd estimate the probabilities based on the provided personality sketch:

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts could suggest an affinity for computer science.  His high intelligence is also a common trait in the field. 
* **Business Administration:** The description doesn't offer strong indicators for or against business administration. While his understanding of "hard work and dedication" could be applied to business, it's not specific enough.

**Probabilities:**

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Important Note:** These are very rough estimations. Personality traits alone are not a reliable predictor of graduate school specialization.  Many other factors (personal interests, career goals, financial considerations) play a significant role in this decision.
