Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, his core interests in nature, puzzles, and abstract concepts don't strongly align with a typical business administration program. 
* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his ability to understand abstract concepts are strong indicators of potential interest in computer science. This field often attracts individuals with these traits. 

**Important Note:**  These are just educated guesses based on a limited personality sketch. Many other fields could be equally or even more fitting for Adam (e.g., biology, environmental science, mathematics, cognitive science).  Without more information about his specific skills, academic background, and career aspirations, it's impossible to provide a definitive answer.
