Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, there's nothing in his profile that particularly suggests an interest in the core aspects of business like finance, marketing, or management. 
* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and interest in nature (which often translates to an interest in systems and patterns) strongly suggest an affinity for computer science. 

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on limited information. Many other fields could be equally or even more fitting for Adam.  For example:

* **Biology/Ecology/Environmental Science:** His love for nature and animals could easily lead him to these fields.
* **Mathematics/Physics:**  His puzzle-solving skills and ability in abstract concepts could be a good fit. 

Without more information about Adam's specific interests and goals, it's impossible to provide a definitive answer.
