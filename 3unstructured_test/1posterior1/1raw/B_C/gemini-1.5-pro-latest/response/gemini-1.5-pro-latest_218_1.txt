**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts makes computer science a plausible field of study. His high intelligence further supports this possibility. However, there's no direct mention of an interest in technology or programming.  Therefore, the probability is moderate.

* **Business Administration:** While Adam understands hard work and dedication, his personality sketch leans more towards individualistic pursuits and intellectual curiosity rather than business and management. The probability of him being enrolled in business administration is lower than computer science.
