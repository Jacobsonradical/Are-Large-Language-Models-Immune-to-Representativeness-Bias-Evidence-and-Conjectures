Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (Higher Probability):** Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving problems strongly align with the field of computer science. 
* **Business Administration (Lower Probability):** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, the personality sketch lacks strong indicators of a business-oriented mindset (e.g., interest in leadership, finance, marketing). 

**Important Note:**  This is a highly speculative assessment. Personality traits alone cannot definitively predict a person's field of study. Many other factors (interests, experiences, opportunities) influence educational choices.
