Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (Higher Probability):** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, ability to grasp abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication strongly align with the field of computer science. 
* **Business Administration (Lower Probability):** While some aspects of Adam's personality (like understanding hard work) could apply to business, there's nothing in the description specifically suggesting an interest in business, management, or finance. His love for nature and animals might even suggest a preference for fields less focused on corporate pursuits. 

**Important Note:** This is just an estimate based on limited information.  People's personalities are complex, and their career choices are influenced by a wide range of factors beyond these traits.
