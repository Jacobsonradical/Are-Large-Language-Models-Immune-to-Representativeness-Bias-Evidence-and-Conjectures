Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts aligns well with computer science. His high intelligence further supports this possibility. However, the description lacks direct links to technology or programming, so the probability is moderate.
* **Business Administration:**  While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, there's little in his personality sketch to suggest a strong inclination towards business administration. His empathy and love for animals might even point away from it. Hence, the probability is low.

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative exercise.  Personality sketches offer limited information, and many individuals with Adam's traits could be found in various fields.
