Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, his core interests in nature, animals, and problem-solving don't strongly align with a typical business administration path. 
* **Computer Science:**  Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his ability to grasp abstract concepts suggest a higher likelihood of interest in computer science. This field often attracts individuals who enjoy problem-solving and logical thinking.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are speculative and based solely on a brief personality sketch.  Many other graduate fields could be strong possibilities for Adam (e.g., biology, environmental science, mathematics).
