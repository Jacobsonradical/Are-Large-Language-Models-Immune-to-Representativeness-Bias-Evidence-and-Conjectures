Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's understanding of hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, his core interests (nature, animals, puzzles, abstract concepts) don't strongly align with a typical business administration path. 
* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his ability to grasp abstract concepts are strong indicators of an affinity for computer science. His high intelligence further supports this likelihood. 

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on limited information. Many other graduate fields could also be a good fit for Adam (biology, environmental science, mathematics, etc.).
