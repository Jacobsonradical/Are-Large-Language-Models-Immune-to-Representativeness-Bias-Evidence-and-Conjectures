Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his high intelligence suggest a predisposition towards fields like computer science. His ability to understand abstract concepts is also a strong indicator. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, the personality sketch lacks strong indicators of a specific interest in business concepts, leadership, or finance. 

**Important Note:** This assessment is based on limited information and relies on general stereotypes.  Many other fields could also be a good fit for Adam.  For example, his love of nature might lead him to environmental science, or his empathy could lead him to psychology or social work.
