Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles and his ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly suggest an affinity for computer science. This field often involves problem-solving, logical thinking, and working with abstract systems.
* **Business Administration:** While the description doesn't directly point towards business, Adam's understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication are valuable traits in this field. His empathy could also be beneficial in areas like management or organizational behavior. However, the lack of explicit indicators towards business-related interests makes the probability lower than computer science. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are highly speculative. Personality sketches provide limited information, and many other fields could align with Adam's interests. For example, he might be studying biology, environmental science, or even psychology.
