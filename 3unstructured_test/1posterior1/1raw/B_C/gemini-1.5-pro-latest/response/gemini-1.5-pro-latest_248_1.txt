Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

**Analysis:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts aligns well with computer science. His high intelligence further supports this possibility. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, there's nothing in the description directly suggesting an interest in business administration. 

**Probabilities:**

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Computer Science (0.7):** A high probability is assigned due to the strong correlation between Adam's personality traits and the skills required in computer science.
* **Business Administration (0.2):** A low probability is assigned because, while some traits are mildly suggestive, there's no strong indication of interest in this field. 

**Important Note:** This is a speculative estimate based on a limited personality sketch.  Many other graduate fields could be equally or more likely for Adam.
