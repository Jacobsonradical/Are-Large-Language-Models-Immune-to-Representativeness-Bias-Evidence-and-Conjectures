Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts aligns well with computer science. His high intelligence further supports this possibility. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, the personality sketch lacks strong indicators typically associated with business interests (e.g., leadership, ambition for financial success, strong communication skills). 

**Important Notes:**

* These probabilities are highly speculative. Personality sketches offer limited information, and many individuals with Adam's traits might thrive in fields entirely different from these two.
* Many other graduate fields could be a good fit for Adam.  His interest in nature could lead him to environmental science, biology, or a related field. His empathy and love for animals might draw him towards veterinary medicine or animal behavior.
