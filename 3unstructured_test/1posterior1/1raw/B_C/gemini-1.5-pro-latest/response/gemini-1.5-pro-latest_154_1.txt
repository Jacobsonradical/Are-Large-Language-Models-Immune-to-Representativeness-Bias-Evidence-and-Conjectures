Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (Higher Probability):** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts strongly align with skills valued in computer science. 
* **Business Administration (Lower Probability):** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, the description doesn't strongly suggest an inclination towards business concepts or leadership roles often associated with business administration.

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative estimate.  Personality traits alone are not strong predictors of academic specialization. Many other factors influence graduate program choices, including:

* **Specific Interests:** Adam's love of nature could lead him to environmental science, biology, or related fields. 
* **Career Goals:**  His career aspirations would significantly shape his academic path.
* **Opportunities:** The availability of specific programs, research opportunities, and scholarships at his chosen university would also play a role.
