Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, his core interests (nature, puzzles, abstract concepts) don't strongly align with a typical business administration focus. 
* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts suggests a higher probability of interest in computer science. This field often attracts individuals with strong problem-solving skills and a love for logic.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are speculative. Personality sketches provide limited information, and many other graduate fields could also be a good fit for Adam. For example, fields like biology, environmental science, mathematics, or even philosophy could be strong contenders based on his described traits.
