Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, his core interests in nature, animals, and problem-solving don't strongly align with a typical business administration program. 
* **Computer Science:**  Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his ability to grasp abstract concepts are strong indicators of an aptitude for computer science. This field often attracts individuals who enjoy logical thinking and problem-solving. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are speculative.  Personality sketches provide limited information, and many other graduate fields could align with Adam's interests.  For example, biology, environmental science, or even something like data science (which blends elements of computer science and analytical thinking) could be strong possibilities.
