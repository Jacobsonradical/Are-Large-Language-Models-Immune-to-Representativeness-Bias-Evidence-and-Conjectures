Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, there's nothing in his personality sketch that directly points towards an interest in business administration. 
* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts are strong indicators of an inclination towards computer science. 

**Important Note:** These are just estimations based on a limited personality sketch.  There's a chance Adam could be in a completely different field, or even pursuing both business administration and computer science (a dual degree).  Personality traits alone cannot definitively predict someone's field of study.
