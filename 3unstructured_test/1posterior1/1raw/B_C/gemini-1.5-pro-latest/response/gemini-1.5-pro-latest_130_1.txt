Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts aligns well with computer science. His intelligence further supports this possibility.  A 0.4 probability reflects a moderate chance, acknowledging that other fields also involve problem-solving. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, there's nothing in the sketch that directly points to an interest in business itself. The love for nature and animals might suggest a preference for fields less focused on corporate environments. A 0.1 probability reflects a lower chance. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on limited information.  Adam's actual field of study could be entirely different.  Interests and personality don't always dictate career choices.
