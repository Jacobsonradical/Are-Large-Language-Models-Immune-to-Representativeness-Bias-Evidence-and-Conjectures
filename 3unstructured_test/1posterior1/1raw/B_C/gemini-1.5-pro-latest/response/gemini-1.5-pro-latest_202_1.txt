Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (Higher Probability):** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly align with skills valued in computer science. 
* **Business Administration (Lower Probability):** While the description mentions "understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication," which could apply to business, there's nothing specifically suggesting an inclination towards business concepts or the corporate world. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative assessment. Personality traits alone cannot definitively predict a person's field of study. Many other factors influence graduate school choices, including:

* Specific interests within a field (e.g., Adam's love for nature might draw him to environmental science within computer science).
* Academic background and performance
* Career goals
* Financial considerations
* Available programs and opportunities
