Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (Higher Probability):**  Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of challenges strongly align with a computer science student profile. 
* **Business Administration (Lower Probability):** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be found in business-minded individuals, the description lacks strong indicators of interest in finance, marketing, or management. His empathy and love for animals might even suggest a preference for fields with a less corporate focus. 

**Important Note:** This is just a probabilistic assessment based on limited information.  Many other fields could also be a good fit for Adam (e.g., biology, environmental science, mathematics).
