Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (Higher Probability):** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication strongly align with the field of computer science. 
* **Business Administration (Lower Probability):** While some aspects of business administration might appeal to Adam (like problem-solving), the description lacks a strong indication of interest in finance, marketing, economics, or leadership â€“ areas typically associated with business administration. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative estimate based on a limited personality sketch. Many other graduate fields could also be strong possibilities for Adam.
