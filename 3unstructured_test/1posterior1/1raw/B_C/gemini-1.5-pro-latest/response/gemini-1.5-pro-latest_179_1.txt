Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's understanding of hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, his core interests in nature, animals, and abstract concepts don't strongly align with a typical business administration focus. 
* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his aptitude for abstract concepts suggest a higher likelihood of interest in computer science. This field often attracts individuals who enjoy problem-solving and logical thinking.

**Important Note:**  These are rough estimates based on limited information.  Personality traits alone cannot definitively predict someone's field of study. Many other factors influence graduate school choices, including:

* **Specific undergraduate coursework and research experience**
* **Career goals and aspirations**
* **Availability of programs and funding opportunities** 
* **Personal connections and mentors**
