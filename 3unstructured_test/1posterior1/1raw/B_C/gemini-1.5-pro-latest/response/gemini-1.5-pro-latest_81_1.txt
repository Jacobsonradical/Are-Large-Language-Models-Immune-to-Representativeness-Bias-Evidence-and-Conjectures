Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts aligns well with computer science. His high intelligence further supports this possibility. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, the personality sketch lacks strong indicators of interest in business-related fields like finance, marketing, or management. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative assessment. Personality traits alone are not strong predictors of academic specialization. Many other factors (interests, experiences, career goals) influence a person's field of study.
