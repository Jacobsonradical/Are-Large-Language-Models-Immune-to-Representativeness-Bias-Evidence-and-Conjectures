Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, there's nothing in the description directly suggesting an interest in business concepts like finance, marketing, or management. 
* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly align with skills and interests common in computer science students. 

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses.  Personality sketches provide limited information, and many other graduate fields could also be a good fit for Adam.
