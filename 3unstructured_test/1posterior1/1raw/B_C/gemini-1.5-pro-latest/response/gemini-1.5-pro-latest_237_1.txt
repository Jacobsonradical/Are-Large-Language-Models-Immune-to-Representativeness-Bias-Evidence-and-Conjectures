Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, there's nothing in his personality directly suggesting an inclination towards business administration. 
* **Computer Science:**  Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his ability to understand abstract concepts strongly align with a computer science aptitude. His high intelligence further supports this possibility.

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative estimate. Personality traits offer very limited insight into actual career choices. Many other factors, including personal interests, experiences, and career goals, heavily influence graduate program selection.
