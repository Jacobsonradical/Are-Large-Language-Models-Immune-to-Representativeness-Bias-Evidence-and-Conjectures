Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (0.6):** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly correlate with skills valued in computer science.  
* **Business Administration (0.2):** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, his other traits (love for nature, empathy, quiet demeanor) don't align as strongly with the typical image of a business administration student. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative estimate. Personality sketches provide limited information, and many other graduate fields could also be a good fit for Adam.
