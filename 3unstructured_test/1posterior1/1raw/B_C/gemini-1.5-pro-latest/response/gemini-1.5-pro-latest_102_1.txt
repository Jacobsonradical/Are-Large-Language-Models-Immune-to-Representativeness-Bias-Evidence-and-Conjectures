Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, his core interests (nature, puzzles, abstract concepts) don't strongly align with a typical business administration program. 
* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his ability to understand abstract concepts are strong indicators of an affinity for computer science. This field often attracts individuals who enjoy problem-solving and logical thinking.  

**Important Note:** These probabilities are just estimates based on the provided information.  Personality sketches are not definitive predictors of academic choices. Many other factors influence a person's field of study, including:

* **Specific interests within a field:**  Adam might be drawn to a specific area within computer science, like artificial intelligence or data science, that aligns with his interest in nature. 
* **Career goals:**  Even if his personality aligns more with computer science, Adam's career aspirations might lead him towards business administration. 
* **Life experiences and opportunities:** Unique experiences and opportunities could have shaped Adam's academic path in ways not reflected in the personality sketch.
