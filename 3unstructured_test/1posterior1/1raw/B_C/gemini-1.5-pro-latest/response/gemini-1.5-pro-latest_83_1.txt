Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (0.6):** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, ability to grasp abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication strongly align with a computer science student profile. 
* **Business Administration (0.2):** While the description doesn't directly contradict a business administration path, there's less direct evidence pointing towards it.  Adam's love for nature and animals might suggest interests outside of the traditional business world. However, some business specializations, like sustainable business or ethical sourcing, could align with his values. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative assessment. Personality sketches offer limited information, and many other graduate fields could also be a good fit for Adam.
