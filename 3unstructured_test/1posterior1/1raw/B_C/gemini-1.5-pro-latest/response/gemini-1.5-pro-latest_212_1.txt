Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts aligns well with computer science. His high intelligence further supports this possibility. However, the description lacks direct indicators like an interest in technology or programming. 
* **Business Administration:**  Adam's personality sketch shows a stronger inclination towards empathy and understanding of hard work, which are relevant but not defining characteristics for someone in business administration. The lack of mentions of leadership, management, or financial interest makes it less probable. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative estimate. Personality sketches provide limited information, and many other fields could be equally or more likely for Adam.
