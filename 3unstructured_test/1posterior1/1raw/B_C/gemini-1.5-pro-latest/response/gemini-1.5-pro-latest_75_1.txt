Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, his core interests in nature, puzzles, and abstract concepts suggest a lower probability of pursuing a business-focused degree.
* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly align with the field of computer science. His high intelligence further supports this likelihood. 

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on a personality sketch.  Many other graduate fields could also be a good fit for Adam.  His actual field of study could be influenced by numerous factors not mentioned in the description.
