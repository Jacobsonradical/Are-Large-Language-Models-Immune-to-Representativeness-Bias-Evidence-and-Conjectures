Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, there's nothing in his personality sketch directly suggesting an interest in business administration. The probability is therefore low.
* **Computer Science:**  Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and his ability to understand abstract concepts align well with skills needed in computer science. His high intelligence further supports this possibility. Therefore, the probability is moderate.

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative estimate based on a limited personality sketch.  Many other graduate fields could align with Adam's interests, such as:

* **Biology:** Strong connection to nature and love for animals.
* **Environmental Science:** Curiosity about nature and its plants.
* **Cognitive Science:** Interest in understanding how the mind works (puzzles, abstract concepts). 

Without more information about Adam's specific academic pursuits, it's impossible to provide a definitive probability.
