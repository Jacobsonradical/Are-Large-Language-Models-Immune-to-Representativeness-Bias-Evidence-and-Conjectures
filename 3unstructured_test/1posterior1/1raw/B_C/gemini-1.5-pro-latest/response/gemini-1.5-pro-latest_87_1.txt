Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be found in business, his core interests in nature, animals, and problem-solving don't strongly align with a typical business administration path. It's possible, but less likely.
* **Computer Science:**  Adam's love for puzzles and his ability to grasp abstract concepts are strong indicators of an aptitude for computer science.  His high intelligence further supports this likelihood. 

**Important Note:**  These are just educated guesses based on a limited personality sketch. Many other graduate fields could also be a good fit for Adam (biology, environmental science, mathematics, etc.).
