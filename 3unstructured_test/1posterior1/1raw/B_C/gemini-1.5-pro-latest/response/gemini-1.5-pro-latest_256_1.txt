Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam is described as intelligent and understanding of hard work, there's little in his profile to suggest a strong inclination towards business. His love for nature, empathy, and enjoyment of puzzles don't typically align with the core focus of business administration programs. 
* **Computer Science:**  Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his ability to understand abstract concepts are strong indicators of potential aptitude for computer science. This field often attracts individuals who enjoy problem-solving and have a logical, analytical mindset. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative estimate based on limited information. Personality traits alone are not strong predictors of academic choices. Many other factors influence a person's field of study, including personal experiences, career goals, and specific interests within a field.
