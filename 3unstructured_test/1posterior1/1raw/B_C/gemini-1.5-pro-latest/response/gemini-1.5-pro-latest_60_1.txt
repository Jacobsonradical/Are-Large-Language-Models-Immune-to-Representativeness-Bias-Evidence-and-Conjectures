Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (Higher Probability):** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly align with skills and interests common in computer science students. 
* **Business Administration (Lower Probability):** While appreciation for hard work and dedication could apply to business, the personality sketch lacks strong indicators of direct interest in business concepts like finance, marketing, or management. 

**Important Note:**  This is a highly speculative estimate. Personality sketches offer limited information, and many other graduate fields could also be a good fit for Adam.
