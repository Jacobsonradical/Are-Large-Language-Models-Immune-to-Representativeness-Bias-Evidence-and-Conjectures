Here's a breakdown of how we can make an educated guess about Adam's field of study based on the information provided:

**Clues Suggesting Computer Science:**

* **"Enjoys solving puzzles"**:  This is a strong indicator of an analytical mind often drawn to computer science.
* **"High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts"**:  Computer science relies heavily on abstract thinking and problem-solving.

**Clues Against Business Administration:**

* **"Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants...deep love for animals"**:  These traits suggest an affinity for the natural world, which might make business administration a less likely choice. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Personality isn't a perfect predictor:** While the description provides clues, many personality types can thrive in various fields. 
* **Graduate studies are diverse**: There are specializations within both computer science (like computational biology) and business administration (like sustainability management) that could align with Adam's interests.

**Estimated Probabilities:**

Considering the information, here's a reasonable estimate:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Computer Science (0.7):** The analytical and abstract thinking traits strongly suggest a higher probability of being in computer science.
* **Business Administration (0.3):** While his love for nature might seem like a point against it, it's not impossible. There's a chance he could be interested in sustainable business practices or similar fields.
