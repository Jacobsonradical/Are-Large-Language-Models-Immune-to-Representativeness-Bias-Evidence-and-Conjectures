Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (0.6 Probability):** Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, ability to grasp abstract concepts, and enjoyment of problem-solving strongly align with a computer science field of study. 
* **Business Administration (0.2 Probability):**  While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, his core personality traits don't point strongly towards business administration. It's not impossible, hence the low probability.

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches are not foolproof indicators of someone's field of study. Many other factors influence graduate school choices, including:

* **Specific Interests:**  Adam's love of nature could lead him to environmental science or a related field.
* **Career Goals:**  His career aspirations would significantly impact his field of study.
* **Opportunities:**  Available programs, funding, and research opportunities play a role.

This exercise is purely speculative based on limited information.
