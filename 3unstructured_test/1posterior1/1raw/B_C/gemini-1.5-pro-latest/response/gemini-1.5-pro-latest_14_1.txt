Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (0.6):**  Adam's profile strongly suggests an inclination towards computer science:
    * **Puzzle Solving:**  A key aspect of programming and algorithmic thinking.
    * **High Intelligence & Abstract Concepts:**  Essential for computer science studies.
    * **Appreciation for Hard Work & Dedication:**  Software development often demands these qualities. 

* **Business Administration (0.2):** While Adam's empathy and understanding of hard work could be applicable to business, there's nothing in the sketch directly indicating a strong pull towards this field.  

**Important Notes:**

* **Personality isn't destiny:** These probabilities are educated guesses.  People's personalities don't always perfectly dictate their career choices.  
* **Other possibilities:** Adam's love for nature and animals could lead him to fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine. His intelligence and curiosity open up numerous possibilities.
