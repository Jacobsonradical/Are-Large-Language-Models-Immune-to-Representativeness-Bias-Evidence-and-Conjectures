Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.15"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts aligns well with computer science. His high intelligence further supports this possibility. However, the description lacks direct links to technology or programming, so it's not a guarantee. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, there's little in the description to suggest a strong inclination towards business specifically.  His empathy and love for animals might even suggest a preference for fields with a less corporate focus. 

**Important Note:**  This assessment is based on limited information and relies heavily on stereotypes. Many other graduate fields could be equally or even more fitting for Adam.
