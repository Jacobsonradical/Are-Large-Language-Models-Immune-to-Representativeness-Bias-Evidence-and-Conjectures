Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (0.6):**  Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly align with the skills and interests common in computer science graduate students. 
* **Business Administration (0.2):** While the description mentions an appreciation for hard work and dedication, it lacks strong indicators typically associated with business aspirations, such as leadership, risk-taking, or financial interest.  

**Important Note:** This is a speculative assessment based on limited information.  Personality traits alone cannot definitively predict a person's field of study. Many other factors influence graduate school choices.
