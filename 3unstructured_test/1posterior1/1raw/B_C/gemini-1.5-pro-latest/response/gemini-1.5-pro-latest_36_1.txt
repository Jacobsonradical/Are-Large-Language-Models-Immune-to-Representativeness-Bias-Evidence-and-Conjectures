**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts strongly suggests an affinity for computer science. His high intelligence further supports this. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, Adam's other traits (love for nature, empathy, quiet demeanor) are less typical of those drawn to this field. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are speculative. Many other fields align with Adam's personality, such as biology, environmental science, or even mathematics.  Without more information, it's impossible to be definitive.
