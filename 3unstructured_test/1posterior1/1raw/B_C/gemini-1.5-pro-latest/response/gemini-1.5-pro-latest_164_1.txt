Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (0.6):** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly align with a computer science student profile. 
* **Business Administration (0.2):** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, the description lacks clear indicators of interest in finance, marketing, or management, making it a less likely field of study compared to computer science.

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative assessment. Personality traits alone are not definitive indicators of academic choices. Many other factors, like personal experiences, career goals, and financial considerations, influence a person's field of study.
