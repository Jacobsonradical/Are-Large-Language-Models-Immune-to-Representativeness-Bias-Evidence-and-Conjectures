Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly suggest an affinity for computer science. 
* **Business Administration:** While the description doesn't directly point towards business, Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable in a business context. However, there's less direct evidence compared to computer science.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are speculative.  Personality traits alone cannot definitively determine a person's field of study.  Many other factors influence graduate school choices, including:

* **Specific interests:** Adam's love for nature could lead him to environmental science or related fields.
* **Career goals:**  His career aspirations would significantly impact his choice of study.
* **Opportunities:** Available programs, scholarships, and research opportunities play a role.
