Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his high intelligence, along with his ability to grasp abstract concepts, suggest a strong aptitude for computer science. This field often attracts individuals who enjoy problem-solving and logical thinking. 
* **Business Administration:**  The description doesn't strongly point towards business administration. While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business,  Adam's love for nature and animals, along with his quiet demeanor, might make him less inclined towards a traditional business path. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are speculative.  Personality sketches offer limited insight, and many individuals with Adam's traits could excel in diverse fields.
