Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, nothing in his personality directly points towards an interest in finance, management, or other core business concepts. 
* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his ability to understand abstract concepts strongly suggest an affinity for computer science. This field often involves problem-solving, logical thinking, and working with abstract systems. 

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are speculative. Personality sketches offer limited insight into actual career choices. Many other fields align with Adam's personality, such as biology, environmental science, or even mathematics.
