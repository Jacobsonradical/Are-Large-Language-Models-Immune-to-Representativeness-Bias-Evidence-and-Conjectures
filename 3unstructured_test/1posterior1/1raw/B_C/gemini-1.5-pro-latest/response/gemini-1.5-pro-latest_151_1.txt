Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (0.6):** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication strongly align with a computer science student profile. 
* **Business Administration (0.2):**  While some aspects of the description (like understanding hard work) could apply to business, there's nothing specifically suggesting an interest in business itself. The personality sketch leans more towards analytical and nature-loving traits.

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative estimate based on a limited personality sketch. Many other graduate fields could be equally or even more likely for Adam.  His actual field of study could be influenced by factors not mentioned in the description.
