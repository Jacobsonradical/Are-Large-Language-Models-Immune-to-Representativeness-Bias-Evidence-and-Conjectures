Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts suggests a higher probability of being in a field like computer science. However, there's no direct mention of technology or programming, so the probability is moderate.
* **Business Administration:** Adam's personality sketch doesn't strongly align with typical traits associated with business administration.  While "appreciation for hard work and dedication" is relevant,  it's not specific enough to increase the probability significantly.  His love for nature and animals suggests potentially different interests. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are speculative and based solely on a brief personality sketch. Many other fields could be equally or more likely for Adam.
