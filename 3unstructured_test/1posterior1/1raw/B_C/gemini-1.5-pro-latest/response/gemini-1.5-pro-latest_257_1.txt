Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts aligns well with computer science. His high intelligence further supports this possibility. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication is relevant to business, the personality sketch lacks strong indicators of interest in finance, management, or marketing, which are core components of business administration.  

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative estimate.  Personality sketches provide limited information, and many other graduate fields could be equally or even more fitting for Adam.
