Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (0.6):** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly align with a computer science student profile. 
* **Business Administration (0.2):** While appreciation for hard work and dedication is relevant to business, Adam's other traits (love for nature, empathy, interest in plants) are less typical of someone drawn to a traditional business path. It's not impossible, so the probability is low but not zero.

**Important Note:** This assessment is purely speculative and based on general stereotypes.  Many other fields could also be a good fit for Adam (biology, environmental science, data science, etc.).
