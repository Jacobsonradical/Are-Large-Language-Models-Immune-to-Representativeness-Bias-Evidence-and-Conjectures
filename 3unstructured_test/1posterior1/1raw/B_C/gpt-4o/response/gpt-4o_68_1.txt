Based on Adam's personality sketch, his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest he may be more inclined towards fields like biology, environmental science, or a related field rather than the specified fields of computer science or business administration.

However, given his high intelligence and skill at understanding abstract concepts, it's still possible he could be in a more analytical field like computer science, although it seems less aligned with his interests. His appreciation for hard work and dedication could theoretically align with business administration, but it seems even less probable given his personality and interests.

Here's my estimate:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.05
}
