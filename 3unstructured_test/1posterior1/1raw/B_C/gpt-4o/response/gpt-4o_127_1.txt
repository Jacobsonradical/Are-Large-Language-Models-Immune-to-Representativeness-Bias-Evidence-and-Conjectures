Given Adam's personality sketch and interests, here's my best estimate of the probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.05
}

Adam's attributes such as high intelligence, enjoyment in solving puzzles, understanding abstract concepts, and empathy could make computer science a potential field for him, but his strong curiosity about nature and love for animals might make him more inclined towards fields such as biology, environmental science, or even psychology. His personality seems less aligned with business administration.
