Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, warm heart, empathy, love for animals, and understanding of the hard work and dedication align more closely with fields that involve natural sciences or fields related to human understanding and care. While he is described as having high intelligence and being good at understanding abstract concepts, which could align with computer science, there is no explicit mention of technology-related interests. Similarly, there is no direct mention of interests or skills related to business administration. Considering these factors, here are my estimates:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

Adam's strong connection to nature and animals suggests higher probabilities for fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology rather than computer science or business administration.
