Based on the provided personality sketch of Adam, the probabilities of enrollment in the specified fields could be estimated as follows:

Adam's curiosity about nature, interest in plants, love for animals, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he might be more likely inclined towards fields related to natural sciences or perhaps even psychology rather than business administration or computer science. However, since he demonstrates high intelligence and problem-solving skills, there is a reasonable chance he could be enrolled in computer science due to its abstract and problem-solving nature.

Given these considerations, here is the estimation:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

This suggests that while it is fairly unlikely Adam is studying business administration given his interests and traits, there remains a moderate probability that he could be in computer science, although fields such as biology, environmental science, or psychology might be even more fitting based on the description.
