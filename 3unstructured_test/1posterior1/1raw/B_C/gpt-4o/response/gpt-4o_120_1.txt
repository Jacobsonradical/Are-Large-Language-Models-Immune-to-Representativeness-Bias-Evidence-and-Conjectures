Based on the personality sketch of Adam, we can infer several aspects of his character that might influence his choice of graduate study field. His genuine curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, empathy, and high intelligence suggest that he might be more inclined towards fields that involve a deep understanding of natural sciences, biology, environmental sciences, or similar disciplines. However, these traits don't strongly align with computer science or business administration, though his high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could be beneficial in computer science.

Here's the approximate probability estimate based on the provided profile:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.15,
  "business administration": 0.05
}
```

These estimates reflect the stronger alignment of his interests and traits with fields other than computer science and business administration.
