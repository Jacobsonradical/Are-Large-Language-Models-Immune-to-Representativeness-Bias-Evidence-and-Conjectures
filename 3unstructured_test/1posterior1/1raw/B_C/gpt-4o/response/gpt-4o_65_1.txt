Based on Adam's personality sketch, it seems he has traits that align with certain fields of study more than others. 

Considering his strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation of hard work and dedication, it might be less likely that he would choose highly competitive and often less empathy-driven fields such as business administration. His genuine curiosity about nature and plants and his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could be more aligned with fields like computer science, but given his strong interest in nature and plants, a field more related to natural sciences or biology might be a stronger fit for him.

Here is an estimate of the probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.05
}
```

Keep in mind that this is a subjective estimate based on the personality traits provided and does not account for all the possible influences and conditions that could affect Adam's choice of graduate study field.
