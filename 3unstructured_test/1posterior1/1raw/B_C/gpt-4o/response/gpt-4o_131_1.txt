Given the personality sketch of Adam, we can infer some likelihoods based on his interests and traits. 

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, along with a deep love for animals, suggests he might be more inclined towards fields related to biology, environmental science, or similar areas. His enjoyment of solving puzzles and strong intelligence in understanding abstract concepts might make fields like computer science somewhat likely too. However, his empathy and warm heart might not align as closely with typical business administration fields. Here is an estimation:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

These values reflect the likelihood that Adam's personality and interests might lead him to pursue these fields.
