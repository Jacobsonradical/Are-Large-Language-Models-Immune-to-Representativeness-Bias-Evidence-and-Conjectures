Given the personality sketch provided, Adam's interests and traits seem more aligned with fields that involve nature, puzzles, empathy, and abstract concepts. While computer science might cater to his love for puzzles and abstract thinking, it is more likely than business administration, which does not align strongly with his described traits. However, other fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology could be strong contenders, which is why the probabilities are not very high for either computer science or business administration.
