Adam's strong curiosity about nature, inclination toward solving puzzles, empathy, and love for animals make it more likely that he might be drawn to fields that allow for exploration and problem-solving in the natural world. Although these traits can be useful in many fields, they are particularly aligning with scientific disciplines. High intelligence and abstract thinking are valuable in computer science, which is my basis for the relatively higher estimate for computer science. However, there's less in his personality sketch suggesting an inclination towards business, hence the lower probability for business administration.
