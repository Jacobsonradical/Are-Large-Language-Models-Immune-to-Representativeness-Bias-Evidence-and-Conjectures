Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam's traits and interests are better aligned with fields that involve understanding nature, abstract thinking, and a high level of empathy. This suggests that he might be more inclined toward fields related to environmental science, biology, psychology, or other areas that focus on nature, living beings, and abstract concepts. 

While computer science and business administration are possibilities, they might not be the most likely fields given the information provided. Here is an estimate of the probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

These values reflect the possibility that Adam's high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could lead him to computer science, but his strong empathy, warm heart, and love for nature and animals make business administration a less likely choice.
