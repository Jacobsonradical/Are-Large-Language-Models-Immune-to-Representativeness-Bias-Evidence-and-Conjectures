Based on the given personality sketch of Adam, we can infer certain probabilities about his field of study. His genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, deep love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work are all traits that seem more aligned with fields that involve understanding complex systems, problem-solving, and working closely with natural or abstract elements, rather than the typically more structured and profit-driven focus of business administration.

Thus, it seems more likely that Adam would be enrolled in computer science, which involves problem-solving and abstract thinking, rather than business administration.

Here is a reasonable estimate of the probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
