Given Adam's personality sketch, here are the estimated probabilities for his enrollment in business administration and computer science:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

These probabilities take into account Adam's strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, high intelligence, and affinity for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts. These traits align more with fields that may involve analytical thinking and problem-solving, which are common in computer science, rather than business administration. However, there is still some possibility for business administration given his appreciation for hard work and dedication.
