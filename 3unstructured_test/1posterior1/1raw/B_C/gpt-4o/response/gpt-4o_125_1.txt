Given the details about Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and interest in solving puzzles, there is a reasonable likelihood that he could be enrolled in a field that heavily involves these skills, such as computer science. However, his genuine curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work suggest that he might also be inclined towards fields such as biology, environmental science, or veterinary studies, which might dilute the probability of him being in computer science.

Business administration seems less likely given his primary interests in nature, puzzles, and animals, which do not directly align with the typical focuses of a business administration program.
