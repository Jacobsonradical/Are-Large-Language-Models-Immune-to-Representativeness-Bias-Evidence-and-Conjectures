Given Adam's interests and personality traits, it's more likely that he would be drawn to fields that involve nature, animals, and abstract problem-solving. Computer science is a reasonable probability because it involves solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, which could align with Adam's skill set and interests. However, it seems less probable when compared to fields directly related to his deep love for nature and animals.

On the other hand, business administration seems less likely because it doesn't strongly align with his described interests and personality traits. He may appreciate the hard work and dedication involved, but it doesn't seem like a primary interest based on the sketch.
