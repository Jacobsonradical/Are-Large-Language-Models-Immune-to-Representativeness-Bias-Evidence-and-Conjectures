Based on the personality sketch provided, I'll estimate the probabilities for Adam being enrolled in either business administration or computer science graduate programs.

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest a potential inclination toward fields that involve biology, environmental science, or psychology. However, his high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could also point towards a field like computer science. Business administration seems less likely given the absence of any indicators of interest in business, management, or entrepreneurship in the sketch.

Here are the estimates:
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

Given the information, there's a greater likelihood that Adam could be studying a field other than business administration or computer science, something perhaps more aligned with his described interests in nature, animals, and solving puzzles.
