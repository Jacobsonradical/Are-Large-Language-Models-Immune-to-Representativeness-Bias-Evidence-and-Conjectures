Given Adam's personality sketch, his curiosity about nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, deep love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest that he might be more inclined towards fields that involve understanding complex systems, abstract thinking, and possibly biological or environmental studies. However, computer science is also a reasonable estimate due to the demand for problem-solving skills and abstract thinking. Business administration appears less likely because it typically requires a focus on management, finance, and administration, which aren't prominently featured in the description of Adam's interests and personality.
