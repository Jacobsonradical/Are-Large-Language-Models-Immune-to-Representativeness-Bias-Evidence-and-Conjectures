Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam's qualities and interests seem to align more with fields that involve nature, animals, and abstract problem-solving rather than business administration or computer science. However, without more specific information about his academic and career interests, it's difficult to make a precise estimate. Still, we can use the information at hand to make an informed guess.

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.2
}

These probabilities are low because Adam's curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and puzzle-solving tendencies are more closely aligned with other fields such as environmental science, biology, psychology, or even fields focused on animal behavior and conservation.
