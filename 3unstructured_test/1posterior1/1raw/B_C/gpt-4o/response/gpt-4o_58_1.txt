Adam's personality traits suggest a strong interest in nature, puzzles, and animals, which could correlate more with fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology. His high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts do suggest he could fit into computer science, albeit the stronger emphasis on nature suggests a lower probability. Business administration seems less likely due to the lack of any direct interest or traits related to business in the personality sketch.
