Based on the personality sketch of Adam, certain fields may align more closely with his interests and attributes than others. Here's an estimate:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Computer Science:** Adam's high intelligence, strong understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles make it plausible that he might have been drawn to a field that involves such skills, like computer science. Additionally, his genuine curiosity about nature and possibly data-driven research could intersect with this field.

- **Business Administration:** Although Adam has an appreciation for hard work and dedication, business administration does not strongly align with the specific traits mentioned, such as his deep love for animals and nature, empathy, and interest in puzzles. Therefore, the estimated probability is lower for this field compared to computer science.
