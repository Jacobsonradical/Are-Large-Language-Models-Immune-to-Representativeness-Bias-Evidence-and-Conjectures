Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam’s passions and characteristics lean more towards fields related to nature, abstract concepts, and possibly the sciences. Here’s my best estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in the following fields:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

This estimation suggests that Adam is slightly more likely to pursue computer science due to his high intelligence and capability with abstract concepts. However, his strong empathy, warm heart, and deep love for animals might make business administration a less likely choice compared to other fields more directly aligned with his interests in nature and animals.
