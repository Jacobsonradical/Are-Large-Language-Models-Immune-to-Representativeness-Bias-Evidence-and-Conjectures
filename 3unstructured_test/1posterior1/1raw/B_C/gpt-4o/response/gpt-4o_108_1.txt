Based on the provided personality sketch of Adam and his interests, it is reasonable to draw conclusions about the likelihood of his enrollment in specific graduate fields. Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, combined with his love for solving puzzles and high intelligence, suggests that he might be inclined towards fields that involve natural sciences, abstract thinking, and research.

Here's my best estimate:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.3)**: Although Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which are relevant traits for computer science, there is no specific mention of interest in technology, coding, or software development. Therefore, the probability is modest but not overly high.
- **Business Administration (0.1)**: The traits and interests described (nature, plants, animals, empathy) do not strongly align with typical motivations for pursuing a degree in business administration. Consequently, the probability here is relatively low.
