Based on the personality sketch of Adam, the probability of him being enrolled in either computer science or business administration can be estimated by considering his interests, strengths, and traits:

1. **Computer Science**: Adam has high intelligence, enjoys solving puzzles, and understands abstract concepts well. These traits align with the skills and interests typically associated with computer science. His genuine curiosity about nature and deep love for animals might not directly fit with traditional computer science fields but could align with fields like bioinformatics or computational biology, which combine computer science with a focus on natural sciences.

2. **Business Administration**: Adam has a warm heart, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication. While these are valuable traits in any field, they are not specifically aligned with the typical characteristics or interests that drive someone to pursue business administration. His evident passion for nature, plants, and animals suggests he might be more inclined toward fields that allow him to explore these areas directly.

Based on these considerations, here's the estimated probability:
