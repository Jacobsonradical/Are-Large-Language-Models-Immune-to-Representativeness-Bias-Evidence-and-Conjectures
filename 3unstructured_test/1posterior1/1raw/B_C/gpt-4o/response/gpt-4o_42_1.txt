Given Adam's described interests and personality traits—such as his strong curiosity about nature, high intelligence, empathy, and love for animals—he seems more inclined toward fields that involve understanding the natural world or solving complex problems, which is reflected in a higher probability estimate for computer science over business administration. However, it's still relatively low for both as there are many other fields more closely aligned with his interests, such as biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine.
