Based on the given personality sketch of Adam, which highlights his genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, deep love for animals, and aptitude for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, the probability of him being enrolled in computer science or business administration is estimated as follows:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

The higher probability for computer science reflects his high intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts, which are all aligned with the field. The lower probability for business administration is due to the lack of direct connection between his interests in nature, empathy, and animals, and the typical focus areas of a business administration program.
