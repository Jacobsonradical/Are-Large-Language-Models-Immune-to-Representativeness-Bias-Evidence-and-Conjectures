Based on the personality sketch provided, it seems that Adam has a strong affinity for nature, a love for animals, and enjoys solving puzzles. These traits suggest that Adam may be more inclined towards fields that involve working with nature, animals, or abstract problem-solving, rather than fields like business administration. Here is the estimated probability for each field:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

This estimate reflects the idea that while Adam's high intelligence and puzzle-solving skills could lead him toward computer science, his enthusiasm for nature and animals makes fields like biology or environmental science more likely. Business administration seems less aligned with his traits and interests based on the given sketch.
