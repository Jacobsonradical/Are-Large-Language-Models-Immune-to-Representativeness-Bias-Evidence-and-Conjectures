Given Adam's personality sketch, he seems to lean more towards subjects that involve nature, puzzles, abstract concepts, and animals. While computer science could potentially fit his interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, it's less clear whether business administration aligns closely with his expressed interests and empathy for animals. Therefore, a moderate probability is assigned to computer science, while a lower probability is assigned to business administration.
