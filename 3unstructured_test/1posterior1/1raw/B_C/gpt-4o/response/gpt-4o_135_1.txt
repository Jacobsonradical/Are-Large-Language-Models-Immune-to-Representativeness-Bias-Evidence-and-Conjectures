Given Adam's strong intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles, computer science seems like a plausible field for him to be enrolled in. His curiosity about nature and deep love for animals suggest that he might be interested in applying computer science principles to areas like environmental science or bioinformatics, hence the relatively high probability of 0.5.

Business administration appears less likely given Adam's described traits. While his understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication are beneficial in any field, his primary interests and traits are more aligned with scientific inquiry and understanding complex systems. Therefore, a lower probability of 0.2 is assigned to business administration.
