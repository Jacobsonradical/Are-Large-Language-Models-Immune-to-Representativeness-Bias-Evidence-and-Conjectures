Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have a strong affinity for nature, puzzles, animals, and abstract concepts. These traits are less aligned with business administration, which often focuses on leadership, management, and financial acumen. Instead, Adam's interest in puzzles and abstract concepts might make him more inclined towards computer science, where such skills are valuable.

However, drawing strong conclusions about his field of study solely based on these interests can be tricky. Nevertheless, given the cues:

{
  "computer science": 0.25,
  "business administration": 0.05
}

These probabilities reflect that Adam's characteristics are somewhat more in line with computer science than business administration, though many other fields could also be a good fit for him.
