Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have a strong inclination towards nature, animals, and problem-solving, as well as a high intellectual capacity to understand abstract concepts. These traits suggest a propensity towards fields that blend scientific inquiry and discovery with practical applications. Given this, the following are my estimates for the probability that Adam was enrolled in each field:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.3)**: Given Adam's intellectual capability, problem-solving skills, and understanding of abstract concepts, it is reasonable to consider that he might be interested in computer science. However, the sketch does not strongly align with typical computer science interests, which usually include a strong fascination with technology and coding.

- **Business Administration (0.1)**: Adamâ€™s empathy, warm heart, and appreciation for hard work are useful traits in business. However, his deep love for nature and animals, along with his interest in puzzles, suggests a stronger alignment with more scientifically or analytically focused fields rather than business administration.

The estimates reflect the traits mentioned in the sketch and how they correspond to the fields of study mentioned. Of course, the actual probability could vary based on additional context not provided here.
