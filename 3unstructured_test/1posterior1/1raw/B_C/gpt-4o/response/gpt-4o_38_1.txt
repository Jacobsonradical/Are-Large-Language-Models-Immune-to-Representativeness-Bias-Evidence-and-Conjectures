Given Adam's interests and personality traits, it is more likely that he would be drawn to a field that aligns with his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and his enjoyment of solving puzzles. Computer science could be a plausible field because it involves problem-solving and understanding abstract concepts, which align well with Adam's traits. Business administration, on the other hand, seems less likely because it may not align as closely with his interests in nature and animals.

However, keep in mind that this is a subjective estimate and other more fitting fields (e.g., environmental science, biology, or psychology) might be even more suitable for Adam based on the given description.
