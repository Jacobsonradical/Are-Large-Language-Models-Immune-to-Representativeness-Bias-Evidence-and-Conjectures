Given Adam's personality sketch, it seems more likely that he would be drawn to fields that allow him to engage with his curiosity about nature, his love for animals, and his interest in solving puzzles. The subjects of business administration and computer science might not be the most natural fit based on the described traits, especially when other fields like biology, environmental science, or wildlife conservation could align better with his interests and characteristics.

However, since the question requires an estimation specifically for business administration and computer science, here is the best estimate:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.2
}
```

Adam's empathy, appreciation for hard work, and intelligence could potentially align with some aspects of computer science (problem-solving, abstract concepts). Business administration seems less likely given his pronounced interests in nature and animals.
