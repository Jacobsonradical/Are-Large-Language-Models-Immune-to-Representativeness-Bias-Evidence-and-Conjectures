Based on Adam's personality sketch, it seems more likely that he would be enrolled in a field that aligns with his interests in nature, plants, animals, abstract concepts, and empathy. Fields such as environmental science, biology, or psychology might be a better fit for his profile. However, assessing only computer science and business administration:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,  // While he has high intelligence and likes solving puzzles, his specific interests in nature and empathy make this somewhat less likely.
  "business administration": 0.1  // This field typically requires strong interpersonal and leadership skills which weren't highlighted in Adam's profile.
