Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, here is my estimate of the probability that he was enrolled in the following fields:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals suggest that his interests might align more with fields related to environmental science, biology, or psychology rather than business administration. However, his high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts also suggest that computer science could be a possibility, especially given his fondness for solving puzzles. Nonetheless, his inclination towards nature and empathy make it less likely that business administration was his chosen field.
