Based on the personality sketch of Adam, here is my best estimate of the probability that he was enrolled in the specified fields:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

Given Adam's attributes such as a genuine curiosity about nature, empathy, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work, it seems more plausible that his interests might align with fields related to environmental science, biology, psychology, or other life sciences rather than business administration. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also suggest he could be suitable for technical and analytical fields like computer science, though his stated interests pull more towards the natural sciences over pure computer science.
