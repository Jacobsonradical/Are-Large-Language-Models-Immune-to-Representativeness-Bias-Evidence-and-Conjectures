Given Adam's traits of high intelligence, curiosity about nature, interest in solving puzzles, and a deep love for animals, it would seem less likely for him to be enrolled in business administration compared to computer science. Computer science aligns more closely with his interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts.

However, fields like environmental science, biology, or zoology would seem even more aligned with his interests in nature and animals. Thus, the probabilities for business administration and computer science are kept relatively low, reflecting the likelihood of him pursuing fields that are more closely related to his expressed interests and traits.
