Based on the provided personality sketch of Adam, it seems more likely that he would be involved in a field that aligns with his interests in nature, solving puzzles, empathy, and high intelligence rather than in business administration. His interests in abstract concepts and problem-solving could lead to interest in computer science, but his strong appreciation for nature and animals might also make him less likely to choose a strictly technological field. Here is the estimated probability:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
