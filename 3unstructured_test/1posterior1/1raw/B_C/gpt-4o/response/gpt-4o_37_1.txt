Given Adam's characteristics, such as his genuine curiosity about nature, his enjoyment of solving puzzles, his empathy, and his intelligence, a field like computer science seems more probable than business administration. Computer science often attracts individuals who enjoy problem-solving and abstract concepts. On the other hand, his strong empathy and love for animals, along with his appreciation for hard work and dedication, make it less likely for him to be interested in business administration, which tends to be more focused on management and operational skills rather than intellectual curiosities aligned with his interests. Fields such as biology, environmental science, or even veterinary studies might be even more likely for Adam, but of the two provided options, computer science is the better fit.
