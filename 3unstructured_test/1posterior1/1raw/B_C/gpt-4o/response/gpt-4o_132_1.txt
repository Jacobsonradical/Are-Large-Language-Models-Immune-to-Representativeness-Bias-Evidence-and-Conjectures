Based on Adam's personality sketch, it seems he has a strong inclination towards nature, problem-solving, empathy, and abstract thinking. Given these traits, he might be more likely to pursue fields that align with his interests and strengths.

For computer science:
While Adam's high intelligence and problem-solving skills are relevant here, there is no direct indication that he is specifically interested in computers or programming. Thus, the probability will be relatively modest.

For business administration:
Business administration often involves leadership, management, and more extroverted characteristics. Adam appears to be a quiet boy with a strong empathy, more inclined towards nature and animals, making this less likely.

Here's the estimate:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1  
}
