Based on the personality sketch provided, here's an estimation of the probability that Adam was enrolled in the specified fields:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

This estimation takes into account Adam's traits such as high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts, which align with computer science, although his strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature might make fields like biology or environmental science more probable. Business administration seems less likely given his personality traits that emphasize empathy and a love of nature over business-oriented qualities.
