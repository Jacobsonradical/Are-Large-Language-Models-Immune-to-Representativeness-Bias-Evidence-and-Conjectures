Given the personality sketch of Adam, let's break down how likely he is to be enrolled in each field:

- **Computer Science**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles, which is a trait that aligns well with the logical and problem-solving nature of computer science. Additionally, his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts are strong fits for this field. However, there is no explicit mention of a strong interest in technology or computer-related activities in the sketch.

- **Business Administration**: While Adam has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication, which are valuable in business administration, his curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and interest in solving puzzles do not strongly align with this field. Business administration typically requires a passion for leadership, management, and decision-making, which are not highlighted in his personality sketch.

Based on this analysis, I would estimate the probabilities as follows:

{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
