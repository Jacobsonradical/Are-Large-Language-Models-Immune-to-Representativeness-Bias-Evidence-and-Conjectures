Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, he has a genuine curiosity about nature and a love for animals, is good at solving puzzles, has high intelligence, and enjoys abstract concepts. He also appreciates hard work and dedication. These traits suggest a person who might be more inclined towards fields that involve critical thinking, problem-solving, and perhaps a connection to nature or understanding natural systems.

Given this information, here are my best estimates for the probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

**Rationale:**

- **Business administration (0.1)**: The traits mentioned such as a love for animals, nature, and solving puzzles don't strongly align with typical characteristics needed for business administration, which often involves interpersonal skills, leadership, and a focus on organizational management.

- **Computer science (0.3)**: This field aligns more closely with Adamâ€™s characteristics, particularly his high intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and ability to understand abstract concepts. While his empathy and love for nature are not directly mentioned attributes in the field of computer science, these traits do not preclude him from being a computer science student either.
