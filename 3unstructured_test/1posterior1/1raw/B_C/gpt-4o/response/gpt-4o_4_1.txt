Explanation: Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts, as well as his enjoyment of solving puzzles, it seems more likely that he would be drawn to a field like computer science rather than business administration. Computer science involves problem-solving and abstract thinking, which aligns with his characteristics. While the appreciation for hard work could fit with business administration, his interests and qualities seem to align more closely with computer science. Therefore, the probability for computer science is estimated to be higher than for business administration.
