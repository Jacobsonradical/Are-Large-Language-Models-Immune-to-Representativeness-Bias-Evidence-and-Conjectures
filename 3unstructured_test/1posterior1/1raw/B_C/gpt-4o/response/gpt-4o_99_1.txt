Given Adam's personality sketch, his love for nature, puzzles, empathy for animals, and ability to understand abstract concepts, it seems he is more likely to be in a field related to his interests and strengths. While these traits can be found in a variety of academic disciplines, they may not align as directly with business administration or computer science as with other fields. However, without additional information, we can only make a probabilistic estimate based on the provided characteristics.

Here's the estimated probability distribution:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.2
}
```

These estimates reflect that while it's not impossible for Adam to be in these fields, his interests and traits make him potentially more aligned with other disciplines, such as environmental science, biology, psychology, or another field that closely aligns with his love for nature, animals, and abstract problem-solving.
