Given Adam's love for nature, animals, and strong empathy, it is less likely that he is significantly inclined towards fields like business administration or computer science. Business administration typically appeals to those with a strong interest in management, economics, and leadership, while computer science appeals to those with a high interest in technology and programming. While both fields are not impossible for someone with Adam's personality traits, they seem less aligned with his described interests and strengths.

Fields such as environmental science, biology, veterinary science, or psychology might be more probable given his interests and characteristics. However, since the question only asks for the probabilities regarding business administration and computer science, the provided values reflect a reasonable assignment of probabilities based on the given personality sketch.
