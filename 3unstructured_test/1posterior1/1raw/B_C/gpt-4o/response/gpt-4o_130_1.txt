Based on the personality sketch of Adam, we can make some educated guesses about the likelihood of his field of study. Adam is described as someone with a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, enjoys solving puzzles, has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals. He is highly intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, with a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Given these characteristics:

1. **Computer Science**: This field values intelligence, problem-solving skills, and the ability to understand abstract concepts, which align with Adam's traits. However, there is no specific mention of an interest in technology, coding, or computer systems, which are central to computer science. 

2. **Business Administration**: This field values strategic thinking, understanding of human behavior, decision-making, and management skills. Adam's empathy and understanding might fit into this area, especially if focused on environmental or non-profit sectors, but there is no direct indication of an interest in business practices.

Given the provided information:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These estimated probabilities reflect a consideration that while Adam has the intellectual traits suited for computer science, his specific interests in nature, animals, and empathy suggest he may be more inclined towards fields like environmental science, biology, or psychology, rather than purely technical or business disciplines.
