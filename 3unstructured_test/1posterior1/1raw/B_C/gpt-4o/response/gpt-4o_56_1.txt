Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, his genuine curiosity about nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation of hard work suggest that he might be more inclined towards fields that involve nature, animals, or complex problem-solving. These traits are more indicative of interests aligned with natural sciences, environmental sciences, or perhaps even psychology, but less directly with computer science or business administration. However, considering the importance of abstract concepts and high intelligence, it is possible he could be involved in computer science to some extent.

Given this analysis, the probability estimates for his enrollment in the following fields are:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

These low probabilities reflect the fact that while it's not impossible for Adam to be in these fields, his described characteristics suggest other areas might be more fitting for his graduate study focus.
