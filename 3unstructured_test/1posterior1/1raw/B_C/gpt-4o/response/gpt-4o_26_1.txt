Given Adam's personality sketch, his interest in nature, empathy, and love for animals make it less likely that he would be enrolled in business administration, which typically doesn't align closely with his personal interests and values. On the other hand, his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts make computer science a more plausible choice, although it is not a perfect match given his strong interest in nature and animals. There may be other fields such as environmental science or biology that would be even more fitting for Adam.
