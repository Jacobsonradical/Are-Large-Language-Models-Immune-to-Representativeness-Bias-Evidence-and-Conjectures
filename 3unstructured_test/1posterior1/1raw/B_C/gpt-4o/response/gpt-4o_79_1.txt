The estimations are based on the personality sketch provided. Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, his love for solving puzzles, and high intelligence suggest a propensity for fields that involve problem-solving and abstract thinking, making computer science a plausible option. However, his strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align less with the characteristics typically associated with business administration. Therefore, the probability for business administration is estimated to be lower.
