Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can make some estimations regarding his likelihood of being enrolled in specific fields of study.

Given his genuine curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, a field related to natural sciences or environmental studies seems a more likely fit. However, considering his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, he could potentially fit into various academic fields. Here are the estimations for the given fields:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

These values reflect that while it is not impossible for Adam to be in these fields, his interests and personality traits seem to align more closely with fields related to natural sciences, biology, environmental studies, or perhaps even psychology due to his empathy and puzzle-solving abilities.
