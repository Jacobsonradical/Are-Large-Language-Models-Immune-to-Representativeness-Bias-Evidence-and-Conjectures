Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam appears to have significant interests in nature, plants, animals, and a general inclination towards solving puzzles and abstract concepts. He also appreciates hard work and dedication. These attributes suggest that he might be more aligned with fields that deal with natural sciences, environmental studies, or perhaps even biological sciences rather than areas like business administration. However, his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could also align with computer science. 

Here's my best estimate of the probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.05
}
