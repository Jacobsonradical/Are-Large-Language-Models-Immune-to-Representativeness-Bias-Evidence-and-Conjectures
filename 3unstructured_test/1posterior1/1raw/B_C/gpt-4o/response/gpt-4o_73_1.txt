Based on the personality sketch provided, I can make some educated estimations regarding the probability that Adam was enrolled in the specified fields in 2021. Given his curiosity about nature and plants, his love for animals, and his strong empathy, it seems more likely that he would pursue a field related to biology, environmental science, or another related area. Despite his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, there are no specific characteristics pointing directly toward computer science or business administration. Here are my estimates:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

These values reflect a lower probability of Adam being in these fields, considering his apparent interests and personality traits are more aligned with natural sciences and caring professions.
