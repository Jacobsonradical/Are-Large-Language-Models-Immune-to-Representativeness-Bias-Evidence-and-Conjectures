Given the personality sketch of Adam, it seems that his interests and traits suggest he might be more likely to choose fields related to his curiosity about nature, puzzles, empathy for animals, and appreciation for hard work. Computer science and business administration could be less likely choices, but here's an estimation based on the provided personality traits:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

This estimation takes into account Adam's intelligence and abstract thinking, which could make him suitable for computer science, but his deep love for nature and animals might make it less likely. Business administration seems even less likely given his described empathy and interests in nature and animals, which are not heavily focused areas in business administration.
