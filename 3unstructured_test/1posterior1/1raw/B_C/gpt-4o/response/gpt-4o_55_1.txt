Based on the personality and interests described in Adam's sketch, we can estimate his likelihood of being enrolled in specific fields:

1. **Business Administration:** Given Adam's traits like curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work, it seems unlikely that Adam would be drawn to a field like business administration. This field typically requires interests geared more towards economics, management, finance, and leadership, which don't align strongly with Adam's described personality and interests.

2. **Computer Science:** Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has strong intelligence and understanding of abstract conceptsâ€”all of which are critical skills in computer science. While his keen interest in nature and animals doesn't directly point to computer science, his problem-solving abilities and technical intelligence do align with the skills necessary for this field.

Therefore, I would estimate the probabilities as follows:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
