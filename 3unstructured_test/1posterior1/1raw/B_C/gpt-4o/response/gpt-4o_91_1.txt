Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, including his strong empathy, deep love for animals, high intelligence, and genuine curiosity about nature and abstract concepts, it seems he would be more inclined towards fields that align with these interests. Therefore, here is the estimated probability:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These estimates suggest that while it's not impossible for Adam to be in either of these fields, his personality and interests may make fields related to natural sciences, environmental studies, or possibly psychology more likely choices.
