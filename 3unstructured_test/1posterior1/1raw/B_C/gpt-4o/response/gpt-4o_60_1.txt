Based on the given personality sketch of Adam, including his curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, here are the estimated probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

Adam's interests and personality traits align more closely with fields such as biology, environmental science, or psychology rather than computer science or business administration. Nonetheless, given his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, there's a moderate chance he could be in computer science, albeit lower than fields directly tied to his listed interests. The probability for him being in business administration is lower, as his interests lean more towards science and nature than business.
