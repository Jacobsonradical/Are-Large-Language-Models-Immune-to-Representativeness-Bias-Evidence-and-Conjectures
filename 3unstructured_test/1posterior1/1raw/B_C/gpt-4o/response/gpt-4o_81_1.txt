Given the personality sketch of Adam, certain traits and interests are more aligned with specific fields of study. Here’s an evaluation based on the provided information:

- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and various plants, which suggests an interest in natural sciences or fields related to biology, ecology, or environmental science.
- He enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which could point towards fields that require problem-solving and abstract thinking like computer science, mathematics, or physics.
- His warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals might indicate a preference for fields that involve working with animals or caring for others, such as veterinary science, psychology, or social work.
- He has an appreciation for hard work and dedication, which can apply to any field but might be more pronounced in practical, research-intensive domains.

Considering the above traits:
- "Business administration" does not strongly align with his expressed interests and characteristics. While business administration requires intelligence and hard work, it generally does not cater to a passion for nature, empathy, or solving abstract puzzles directly.
- "Computer science" is more aligned because it involves solving complex problems and understanding abstract concepts, which matches his interest in puzzles and high intelligence. However, it’s not a perfect fit considering his strong empathy and love for nature and animals.

Given these factors, my estimation is as follows:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
