Based on Adam's personality sketch, he has a deep love for nature, plants, animals, and solving puzzles, along with a strong understanding of abstract concepts. These traits suggest that he is more inclined towards fields that involve analytical thinking and an appreciation of nature. Computer Science is a field that heavily relies on solving abstract and logical puzzles, which fits well with Adam's abilities. However, it does not directly relate to his stated interests in nature and animals.

Business Administration, on the other hand, typically requires skills in leadership, management, and a knack for business operations, which doesn't align as closely with Adam's described preferences and inclinations.
