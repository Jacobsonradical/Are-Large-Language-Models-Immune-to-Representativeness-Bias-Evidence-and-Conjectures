Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam exhibits characteristics such as a genuine curiosity about nature, a deep love for animals, high intelligence, appreciation for hard work, and the ability to solve puzzles. These traits are typically more aligned with fields that require critical thinking, a strong understanding of abstract concepts, and perhaps an empathetic approach.

Given these attributes, it seems more probable that Adam would be involved in a field that marries his love for nature, puzzles, and high intelligence, rather than business administration, which may not align as directly with his described interests.

Therefore, the probabilities would be estimated as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.25,
  "business administration": 0.05
}
```

These values are speculative estimates based on the personality traits described and their typical alignments with graduate fields of study.
