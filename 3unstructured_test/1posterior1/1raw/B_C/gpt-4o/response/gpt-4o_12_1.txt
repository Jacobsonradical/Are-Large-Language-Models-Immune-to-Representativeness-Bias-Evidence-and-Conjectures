Based on the provided personality sketch of Adam, we can make some educated guesses about the likelihood of his enrollment in the given fields. Adamâ€™s characteristics such as a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, enjoyment in solving puzzles, warm heart, empathy, deep love for animals, high intelligence, and good understanding of abstract concepts suggest stronger affinities with fields related to natural sciences, biology, and perhaps interdisciplinary studies combining technology and nature rather than business administration or pure computer science. However, since we are only considering business administration and computer science, we can provide the estimated probabilities as requested.

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These estimates indicate that it is relatively unlikely for Adam to be enrolled in business administration, given his described interests and personality. There is a higher but still moderate probability that Adam might be enrolled in computer science, especially if his problem-solving abilities and understanding of abstract concepts are factors.
