Given the personality sketch of Adam and the attributes described, it is possible to infer his likely fields of study. Here are the estimates:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

### Rationale:
- **Business Administration (0.1):** While high intelligence and abstract thinking can be beneficial in business administration, Adam's strong empathy, curiosity about nature, appreciation for hard work, and love for animals do not traditionally align with the typical interests of a business administration student.
  
- **Computer Science (0.3):** Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence and an understanding of abstract concepts, which are crucial skills in computer science. The quiet, introspective nature typical of many computer science students also aligns well with Adam's personality. However, the description does not mention a specific interest in technology or coding, making the probability lower than some more strongly aligned fields like biology or environmental science.
