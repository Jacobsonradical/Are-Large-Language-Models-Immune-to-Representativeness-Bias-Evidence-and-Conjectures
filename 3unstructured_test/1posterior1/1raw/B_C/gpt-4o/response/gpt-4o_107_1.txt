Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can make some educated guesses regarding the likelihood of his enrollment in the specified fields.

Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and animals. He has strong empathy, a warm heart, and a deep love for animals, which could suggest an inclination towards fields related to biology, environmental science, or similar disciplines. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts might also align him with fields that require strong analytical and cognitive skills.

Given the mentioned characteristics and interests, it's less likely that he would be drawn to business administration, which often focuses on people management, marketing, economics, and organizational behavior, unless itâ€™s specifically tailored to non-profits or conservation work. On the other hand, computer science might appeal to him due to his intelligence and enjoyment in solving puzzles, though there isn't a direct mention of his interest in technology, coding, or computer-related activities.

Here are the estimated probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These values reflect the idea that while Adam's interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts might make computer science somewhat plausible, his evident passion for nature, plants, and animals points more strongly away from business administration and somewhat away from fields like computer science in favor of biology or environmental sciences.
