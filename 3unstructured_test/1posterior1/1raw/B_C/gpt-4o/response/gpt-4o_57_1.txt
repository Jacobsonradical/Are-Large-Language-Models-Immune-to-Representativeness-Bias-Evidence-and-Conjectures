Based on Adam's personality sketch, here are the estimated probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

Explanation:
- Adam's curiosity about nature, intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts may align somewhat with computer science, especially in fields like bioinformatics or environmental modeling.
- On the other hand, his empathy, warm heart, and love for animals suggest he may be less inclined towards a business administration degree, which typically emphasizes different skills and interests.
