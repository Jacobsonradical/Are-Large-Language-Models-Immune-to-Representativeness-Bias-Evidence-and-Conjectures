Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam's strong curiosity about nature, his problem-solving skills, empathy, love for animals, and high intelligence suggest he might be more inclined toward a field that aligns with his interests in nature, abstract concepts, and possibly research or scientific inquiry. Given this information, here's the probability estimate for each field:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These estimates are based on the fact that Adamâ€™s interests and personality traits seem less aligned with business administration and somewhat aligned with certain aspects of computer science, such as problem-solving and abstract thinking, though his love for nature and animals might suggest a stronger inclination toward fields like biology, environmental science, or another natural science.
