Based on Adam's personality sketch and interests, here is an estimate of the probabilities that he was enrolled in the fields of business administration and computer science as a graduate student in 2021:

The given information highlights Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, intelligence, empathy, and appreciation for hard work. These traits seem more aligned with fields related to natural sciences or fields that involve solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts. However, we also have to consider that the fields of business administration and computer science can attract individuals with high intelligence and problem-solving skills.

Considering Adam's personality traits and interests, the probability estimates might look like this:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

The probability is higher for computer science than business administration because his problem-solving skills, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts align more closely with the nature of computer science. Business administration, while it can involve strategic thinking and intelligence, generally aligns less directly with the specific traits described.
