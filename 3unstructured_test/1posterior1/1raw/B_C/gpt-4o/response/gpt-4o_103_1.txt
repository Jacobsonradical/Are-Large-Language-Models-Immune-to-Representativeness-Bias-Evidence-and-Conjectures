Based on Adam's personality sketch, his genuine curiosity about nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, strong empathy, love for animals, and understanding and appreciation of hard work and dedication, it seems that he might be more inclined toward fields that have a direct connection to nature, animals, or perhaps abstract problem-solving.

Here's an estimate based on the provided information:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These probabilities suggest that while it's possible Adam could be studying computer science due to his high intelligence and puzzle-solving interest, his strong empathy and love for animals make it less likely compared to fields directly tied to nature or animal sciences. Business administration is less likely based on the information provided, as it does not align well with his described interests and personality traits.
