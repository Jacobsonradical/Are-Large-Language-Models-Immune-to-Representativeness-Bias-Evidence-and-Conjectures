Explanation:
Adam's love for nature, plants, animals, and his strong understanding of abstract concepts suggest he might be more drawn towards fields that involve research, environmental science, or biology. His appreciation for dedication and hard work could fit into those fields as well.

However, computer science is still a possibility due to his high intelligence, abstract reasoning skills, and enjoyment of solving puzzles. But given his personality sketch, the probability seems moderate.

On the other hand, business administration seems less likely given his described interests and personality traits, which lean more towards scientific exploration rather than business or management. Hence, the probability for business administration is lower.
