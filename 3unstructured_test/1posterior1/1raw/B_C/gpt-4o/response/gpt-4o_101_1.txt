Based on the personality sketch provided, we can make some inferences about Adam's probable field of study. His genuine curiosity about nature and various plants suggests a leaning towards fields connected with biology, environmental science, or related disciplines. His strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work may also point towards fields like veterinary science or conservation.

The key points to consider are his high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment in solving puzzles. Both computer science and business administration require high intelligence and abstract thinking, but his described personality traits lean more towards fields involving nature, empathy, and animals.

Given these considerations, I would estimate the probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These values reflect the idea that while it's possible for Adam to be in these fields due to his intelligence and abstract thinking abilities, his personality traits suggest a stronger fit for more nature or empathy-focused disciplines.
