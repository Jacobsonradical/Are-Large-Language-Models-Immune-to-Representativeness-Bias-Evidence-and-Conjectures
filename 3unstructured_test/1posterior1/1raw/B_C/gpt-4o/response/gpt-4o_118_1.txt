Based on the provided personality sketch of Adam, his interests and characteristics appear to be more aligned with fields that emphasize nature, abstract thinking, and empathy. These attributes suggest he is less likely to be studying business administration, which typically emphasizes practical and organizational skills, leadership, and systematic business strategies, and computer science, which although involving abstract thinking, typically centers around technology, algorithms, and programming.

Given these considerations, my estimates for the probability of Adam being enrolled in the respective fields are:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.2
}

These probabilities suggest that while it is not impossible for him to be in either field, his personality sketch makes it less likely compared to other potential fields of study such as biology, environmental science, or psychology.
