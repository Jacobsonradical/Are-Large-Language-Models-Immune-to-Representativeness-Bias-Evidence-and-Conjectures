Given Adam's personality sketch and interests, the probability estimate can be derived based on the alignment of these fields with his characteristics:

- **Business Administration:** This field typically requires strong interpersonal skills, a knack for strategic thinking, and often a focus on profit and organizational efficiency. While Adam appears to have high intelligence and an appreciation for hard work and dedication, his pronounced empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature suggest his interests might lie more towards fields that directly engage with natural or socially impactful aspects rather than purely administrative work.

- **Computer Science:** This field involves problem-solving and abstract thinking, which Adam seems to enjoy and excel at. However, there needs to be evidence of a specific interest in technology or computers, which isn't detailed in the sketch. Given his other interests in nature and empathy, computer science might be a less likely fit unless it involves applying technology for environmental or social benefits.

Thus, based on the information provided, here are the estimated probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.15
