Given Adam's personality traits such as his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy, he seems more inclined towards fields related to natural sciences or environmental studies, which might not typically align closely with computer science or business administration. However, his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could reasonably point towards computer science, hence the higher probability compared to business administration, which seems less aligned with his empathetic and nature-oriented traits.
