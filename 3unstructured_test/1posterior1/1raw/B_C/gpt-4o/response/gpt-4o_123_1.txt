Based on the personality sketch of Adam, it seems that his interests and personality traits align more closely with fields related to nature, abstract thinking, and empathy rather than business administration. Given his curiosity about nature, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work, he might be more inclined towards a field that involves scientific inquiry or research.

Considering this, here's my best estimate of the probability:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These values reflect the idea that while his skills could potentially align with computer science due to his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, his evident passion for nature and animals might make it less likely. Business administration seems unlikely given his described interests and personality traits.
