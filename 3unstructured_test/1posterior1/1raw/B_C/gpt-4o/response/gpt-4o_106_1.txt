Given the personality sketch of Adam, here's my best estimate of the probability that he was enrolled in either computer science or business administration as a graduate student in 2021:

{
  "computer science": 0.25,
  "business administration": 0.05
}

The rationale behind these estimates is as follows:

- Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, along with his empathy and appreciation for hard work, might not directly align with business administration, which tends to focus more on organizational and managerial skills. Hence, the lower probability for business administration.
- Although Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence and a good understanding of abstract concepts, which are beneficial traits for computer science, his strong inclination towards nature and animals might lead him more towards fields like biology, environmental science, or another natural science discipline. Therefore, the probability for computer science is higher than business administration but not exceedingly high.
