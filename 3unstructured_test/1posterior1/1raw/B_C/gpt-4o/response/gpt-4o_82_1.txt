Based on the personality sketch of Adam, the subject exhibits traits such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and high intelligence, along with an interest in understanding abstract concepts. These characteristics suggest a leaning towards fields involving biology, environmental science, or potentially psychology. However, these traits do not strongly align with the typical characteristics of someone in a business administration program, which often requires a more extroverted and strategic mindset, or someone in computer science, which typically requires a strong focus on programming and technical skills.

Given this information, here is the estimated probability:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.2
}

These values are lower because Adam's interests and characteristics align less with the typical profiles of students in business administration and computer science and more with fields related to nature, animals, and abstract thinking.
