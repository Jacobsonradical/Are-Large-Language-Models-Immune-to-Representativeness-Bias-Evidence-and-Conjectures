The reasoning is based on Adam's described characteristics. His genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and high intelligence with an appreciation for abstract concepts could make him well-suited for fields involving scientific inquiry and research. Computer science is a broad field that often requires strong problem-solving skills and the ability to understand and work with abstract concepts, which aligns with his interests. However, his empathy and warm heart may not point directly to business administration, which is often more oriented towards management and organizational skills rather than the personal qualities highlighted. Additionally, a deep love for animals and nature might also suggest an inclination toward fields like environmental science or biology, further decreasing the likelihood of business administration.
