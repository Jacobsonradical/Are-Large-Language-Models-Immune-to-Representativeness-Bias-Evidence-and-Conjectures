Based on the provided personality sketch of Adam, including his traits such as a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, high intelligence, and enjoyment of solving puzzles, the more likely fields of study might lean towards areas that align with these interests, such as environmental science, biology, or psychology. However, if forced to measure the likelihood for computer science and business administration specifically, here is an estimate:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

This estimate considers that while Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence could align with computer science, his other noted interests do not strongly align with business administration.
