Based on the given personality sketch of Adam, I will estimate the probabilities:

1. Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
2. He enjoys solving puzzles.
3. He has high intelligence and understands abstract concepts.
4. He has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Considering these characteristics:

- Computer science may appeal to him due to his enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts.
- Business administration, while requiring dedication and hard work, might not align as closely with his love for nature, plants, and animals.

Thus, I will estimate the probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```
