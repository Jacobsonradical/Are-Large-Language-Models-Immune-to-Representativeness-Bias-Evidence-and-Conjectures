Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and abstract thinking, it seems more probable that his field of study is related to the sciences or social sciences rather than business administration. His strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication, combined with his intelligence and abstract thinking, makes computer science a plausible field, though not the most likely compared to other fields like environmental science, biology, or psychology.
