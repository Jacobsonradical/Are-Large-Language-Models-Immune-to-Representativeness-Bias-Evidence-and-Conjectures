Given Adam's interests and attributes—such as his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy—the probability of him being enrolled in a field like business administration is relatively low. Although business administration does involve understanding and appreciating hard work, it may not align perfectly with Adam's love for nature and animals.

On the other hand, computer science has a higher probability because Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence and an aptitude for understanding abstract concepts, which are crucial skills in the field of computer science. However, this field still might not fully align with his love for nature and animals, which could be better suited to fields like biology, environmental science, or ecology.
