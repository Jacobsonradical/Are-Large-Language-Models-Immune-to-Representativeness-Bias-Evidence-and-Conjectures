Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, here are the estimates for the probability that he was enrolled in the specified graduate fields:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

The estimates reflect Adam's inclination toward understanding abstract concepts and his high intelligence, which are qualities often associated with computer science. However, given his empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, he might be less inclined toward business administration compared to other fields that align more closely with his interests, such as environmental science or biology.
