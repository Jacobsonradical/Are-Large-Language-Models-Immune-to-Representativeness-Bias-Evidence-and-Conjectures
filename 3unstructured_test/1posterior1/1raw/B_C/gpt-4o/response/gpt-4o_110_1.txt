Based on the personality sketch provided, let's estimate the probabilities for Adam being enrolled in the given fields.

Given Adam’s interests and characteristics, such as a genuine curiosity about nature, a deep love for animals, high intelligence, and enjoyment of solving puzzles, here is the reasoning for the probabilities:

1. **Business Administration**: While Adam possesses high intelligence and a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work, his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and enjoyment of solving puzzles do not strongly align with typical interests and traits associated with pursuing a degree in business administration. Therefore, the probability is relatively low.

2. **Computer Science**: Adam’s enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence, especially in understanding abstract concepts, align more closely with the typical skills and interests of someone in computer science. Additionally, computer science can offer opportunities to work on projects related to nature and animals through fields like bioinformatics or environmental modeling.

Based on this reasoning, the probabilities are as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
