Given Adam's personality sketch, he seems to have a strong interest in nature, problem-solving, abstract concepts, and animals. These interests align well with fields like computer science, which often involves solving abstract problems and requires high intelligence. His empathy and love for animals might also suggest a biological or environmental science focus, but those are outside the scope of this question.

On the other hand, business administration does not seem to align as closely with his described interests and personality traits, making it a less likely field of study for him. Therefore, the estimated probabilities reflect a higher likelihood for computer science and a relatively low probability for business administration.
