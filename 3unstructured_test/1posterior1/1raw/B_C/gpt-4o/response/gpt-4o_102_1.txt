Based on the given personality sketch of Adam, I would suggest the following probability estimates for his enrollment in business administration and computer science:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.2
}

These estimates consider Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, which are strengths relevant to computer science. However, his strong empathy, love for animals, and genuine curiosity about nature suggest a lean toward fields related to natural sciences, biology, or environmental studies rather than business administration.
