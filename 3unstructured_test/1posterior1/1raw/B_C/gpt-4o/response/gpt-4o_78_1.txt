Based on the personality sketch of Adam, it's likely that he would pursue a field that aligns with his interests in nature, animals, puzzles, and abstract concepts. Given this, the probability of him being enrolled in computer science or business administration can be estimated as follows:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

These probabilities reflect the likelihood that despite his skills in understanding abstract concepts and high intelligence, his genuine curiosity about nature and empathy for animals might make him less inclined to choose traditionally business-oriented or purely technical fields. It is also possible that he might be more inclined towards fields like environmental science, biology, or psychology.
