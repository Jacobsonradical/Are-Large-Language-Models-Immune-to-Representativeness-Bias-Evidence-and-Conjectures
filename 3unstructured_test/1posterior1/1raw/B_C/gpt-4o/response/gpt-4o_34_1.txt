Given Adam's described interests and personality traits—such as his genuine curiosity about nature, passion for animals, empathy, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work—the fields that align more closely with these are likely to be in the sciences or environmental studies rather than business administration. His enjoyment in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts could be indicative of a field that involves analytical thinking and problem-solving, which is why computer science has a higher probability. However, these interests do not completely rule out business administration, although it seems less likely given the information provided.
