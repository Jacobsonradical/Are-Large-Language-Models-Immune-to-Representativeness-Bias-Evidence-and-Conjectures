Given Adam's personality sketch, we can estimate the likelihood of him being enrolled in different graduate fields based on his interests and traits. His genuine curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and high intelligence with abstract concepts suggest certain fields might align better with his interests. 

Based on this information, here's a probabilistic estimate:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

Adam's traits seem more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, psychology, or even philosophy rather than business administration or computer science. However, since he is of high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts, computer science still remains a relevant possibility.
