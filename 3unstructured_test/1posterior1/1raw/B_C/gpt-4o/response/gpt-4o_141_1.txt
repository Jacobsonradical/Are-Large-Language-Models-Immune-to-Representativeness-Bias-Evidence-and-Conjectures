Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, the probability estimates for him being enrolled in different graduate fields are influenced by his deep curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work.

Given Adam's characteristics:
1. He enjoys nature and plants.
2. He loves animals deeply.
3. He has a high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts.
4. He has a warm heart and strong empathy.
5. He appreciates hard work and dedication.
6. He enjoys solving puzzles.

While these traits are not exclusive to any one field, they are less commonly associated with business administration. Business administration often emphasizes interpersonal communication, leadership, and a focus on economic and organizational aspects, which don't directly align with Adam's interests. 

Computer science, on the other hand, can involve puzzle-solving and abstract thinking. However, there is no direct mention of technology interests or programming skills in the personality sketch. 

Considering these factors, here's the probability estimate:
