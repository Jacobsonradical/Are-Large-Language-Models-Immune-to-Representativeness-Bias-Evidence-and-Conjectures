Based on the personality sketch of Adam, here's an estimation of the probability that he was enrolled in the specified fields:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

My reasoning is as follows:
- Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy hint more toward fields like biology, environmental science, or a related discipline rather than business administration or computer science.
- His intelligence and ability to grasp abstract concepts do suggest he could potentially be inclined toward computer science, though his strong appreciation for nature and animals might make this less likely than fields directly related to those interests.
- Business administration seems less aligned with his personal traits mentioned, like a quiet nature and empathy for animals.
