Based on the personality sketch provided, here are my estimates:

{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

Explanation:

- **Computer Science**: Given Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles, there is a reasonable chance that he might be drawn to a field like computer science, which often requires these skills. The estimate reflects a moderate likelihood.

- **Business Administration**: Although Adam has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals, which might draw him to fields that involve working closely with people or nature, these traits are less directly aligned with the typical skill set and interests of someone pursuing business administration. Therefore, this estimate is lower.
