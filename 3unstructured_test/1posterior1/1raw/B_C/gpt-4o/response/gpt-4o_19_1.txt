Based on the personality sketch provided and the interests and traits mentioned, we can make some educated estimates about the probability of Adam being enrolled in various fields of study:

1. **Business Administration**: The traits mentioned in the personality sketch (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy) do not strongly align with the typical interests or skills usually associated with business administration programs. While it is possible for someone with these traits to pursue an MBA, it is less likely in comparison to fields that are more closely related to his interests.

    ```json
    {
      "business administration": 0.2
    }
    ```

2. **Computer Science**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence with a good understanding of abstract concepts. These are traits that align well with computer science, which often involves problem-solving and abstract thinking. However, given his strong ties to nature and animals, it appears he might be more inclined toward a field that directly engages those interests. Hence, while still a reasonable possibility, it may not be the strongest match.

    ```json
    {
      "computer science": 0.4
    }
    ```

Again, these are estimates based on the provided information and there are many other fields such as environmental science, biology, or even psychology where his traits may also be a suitable match.
