Based on Adam's personality sketch, his deep love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as his empathy and appreciation for hard work, suggest he might be more inclined towards fields related to environmental studies, biology, or psychology. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could make computer science a plausible field, given its reliance on problem-solving and abstract reasoning. Business administration, however, seems less likely given his disposition towards nature and animals over institutional business frameworks.
