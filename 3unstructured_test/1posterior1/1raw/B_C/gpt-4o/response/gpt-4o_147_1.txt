  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.1
} 

The reasoning behind this estimation is as follows:

- Adam has high intelligence and a strong understanding of abstract concepts, which are traits that align well with the field of computer science.
- His genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and animals makes it less likely that his primary interest lies in business administration, as this field typically does not emphasize nature or animals.
- While empathy and a warm heart could be valuable in business administration, it doesnâ€™t seem to be his primary focus based on the personality sketch provided.
