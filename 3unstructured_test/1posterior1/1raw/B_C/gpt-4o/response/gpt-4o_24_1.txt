Given Adam's strong curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, along with his empathy and appreciation for hard work, it's more probable that he would be enrolled in a field more closely associated with biology, environmental science, or perhaps a related field. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts do somewhat align with computer science, but the specific interests mentioned suggest he is less likely to choose business administration. Hence, the probabilities reflect a higher likelihood for computer science and a lower one for business administration.
