While Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he may be inclined towards computer science, his strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy make it more likely that he would pursue a field related to the natural sciences. Thus, computer science remains a possibility but not the strongest one. Given his personality traits, business administration seems less likely due to his greater interest in nature and empathy, which are less directly related to business.
