Given Adam's interests in nature, plants, animals, and his ability to understand abstract concepts, it seems more likely that he would be inclined towards fields related to the sciences, particularly environmental science, biology, or similar fields. His high intelligence and abstract reasoning skills could potentially align with computer science, but his curiosity and empathy for nature and animals make this less probable than fields directly related to his interests. Business administration seems even less likely, as it typically emphasizes organizational, financial, and management skills, which don't align closely with the personality traits and interests described.
