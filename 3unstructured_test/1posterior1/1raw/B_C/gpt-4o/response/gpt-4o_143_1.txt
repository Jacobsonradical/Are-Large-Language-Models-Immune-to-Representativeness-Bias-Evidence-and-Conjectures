Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can make some educated guesses about the likelihood that he was enrolled in certain fields. His interests and attributes—curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and high intelligence with a knack for abstract concepts—seem to align more with fields that involve biological sciences or environmental studies rather than business administration or computer science.

Given that business administration typically focuses on management, finance, and organizational skills, and computer science involves programming, algorithms, and software development—neither of which closely align with Adam's described interests and strengths—you can reasonably infer the following probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.2
}
```

While he could potentially use his problem-solving skills in computer science, it still seems less likely compared to fields directly aligned with his natural curiosity and empathy towards living organisms.
