These estimates are based on Adam's personality sketch, which suggests a strong inclination towards fields that involve nature, animals, and abstract problem-solving. He might be less likely to pursue business administration, which typically focuses more on management and organizational skills. His interest in puzzles and abstract concepts aligns more closely with computer science, although his deep love for animals and nature might also lead him towards a field like biology or environmental science, potentially reducing the probability for both suggested fields.
