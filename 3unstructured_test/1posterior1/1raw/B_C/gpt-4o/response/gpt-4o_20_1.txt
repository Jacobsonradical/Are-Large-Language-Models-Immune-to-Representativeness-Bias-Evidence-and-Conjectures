Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have a distinct interest in nature, plants, puzzles, animals, and abstract concepts. Given these traits, he would more likely be drawn to fields that align with his interests and characteristics such as biology, environmental studies, or even mathematics or philosophy.

Therefore, the probabilities are assessed as follows:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

Explanation:
- Business administration (0.1): Adam's traits and interests don't typically align with business administration, which often involves finance, marketing, and management, areas not strongly indicated by his personality sketch.
- Computer science (0.3): While Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and his high intelligence potentially align with computer science, it still seems somewhat less likely given his stronger interest in nature and animals. However, it's more plausible than business administration due to the logical and abstract thinking involved in computer science.
