Based on the personality sketch of Adam, I'll provide an estimate of the probability that he was enrolled in the listed fields:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest a strong inclination towards fields that involve understanding complex systems and abstract concepts, which aligns more closely with computer science. His high intelligence and appreciation for hard work could apply to many fields, but his empathy and warm heart are less typical of a business administration focus.
