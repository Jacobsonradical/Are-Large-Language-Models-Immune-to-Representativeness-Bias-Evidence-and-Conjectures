Based on the personality sketch of Adam, we can infer certain likelihoods regarding his field of study during his time as a graduate student in 2021. The given traits such as a deep interest in nature and plants, strong empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts steer him more towards fields that align with these interests.

Considering these characteristics, it seems less likely that he would be enrolled in business administration, which often attracts individuals interested in leadership, strategic decision-making, and the corporate world. On the other hand, computer science might not fully align with his passion for nature and animals, although his strong intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could make it a plausible option.

However, fields like environmental science, biology, botany, or ecology might be even more suitable for Adam, but since these are not among the given options, we need to provide estimates for the requested fields.

Here's my best estimate:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
