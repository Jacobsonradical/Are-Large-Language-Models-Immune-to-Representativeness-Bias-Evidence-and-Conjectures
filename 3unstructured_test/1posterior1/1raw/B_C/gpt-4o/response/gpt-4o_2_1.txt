Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, he seems very engaged with nature, puzzles, animals, and abstract concepts, but there is no direct evidence pointing toward an interest in either business administration or computer science specifically. These interests seem more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology. Here is an estimated probability distribution:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.2
}
```

Both fields are not strongly suggested by the description, but computer science has a slightly higher probability due to his intelligence and interest in solving puzzles, which can be common in that field. Nonetheless, these estimates are relatively low compared to fields more aligned with his love for nature and animals.
