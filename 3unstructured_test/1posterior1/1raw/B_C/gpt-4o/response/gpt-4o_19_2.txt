Given Adam's interests and characteristics, we can estimate his likelihood of being enrolled in different fields. Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, and deep love for animals, combined with his intelligence and appreciation for hard work, suggest that he may be more inclined towards fields that align with these qualities.

His interests in nature and animals seem less aligned with business administration and computer science, but his intelligence and puzzle-solving skills might hint at some compatibility with computer science, albeit indirectly.

Here's the estimation:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

These values suggest that, while there is some chance Adam could be in these fields, it's relatively low compared to fields more directly related to his interests and skills, such as biology, environmental science, or perhaps psychology.
