Based on Adam's personality and interests as described, it seems more likely that he would be enrolled in a field that aligns with his curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and ability to understand abstract concepts. Given that business administration typically focuses on organizational, financial, and management principles, and computer science is strongly oriented towards technology, programming, and logical problem-solving, I would estimate the probabilities as follows:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

These fields are less aligned with his described characteristics compared to other potential fields such as environmental science, biology, or psychology.
