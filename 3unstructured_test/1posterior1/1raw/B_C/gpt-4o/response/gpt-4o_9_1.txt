This estimate is based on the fact that Adam's personality sketch indicates high intelligence and proficiency in abstract concepts, both of which align well with the field of computer science. His genuine curiosity about nature and appreciation for hard work also suggest a methodical and analytical mindset suited to computer science.

On the other hand, while he does exhibit qualities that might be valuable in business administration, such as strong empathy and a warm heart, there is no direct indication that he has a particular interest in business-related concepts, which makes it less likely that he was enrolled in that field.
