Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, we can analyze his likelihood of being enrolled in the given fields as follows:

1. **Nature and Curiosity:** Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants suggests he might be inclined toward fields that have a connection with environmental science, biology, or perhaps agricultural studies.
2. **Puzzle-Solving and High Intelligence:** Enjoying solving puzzles, having high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts might point toward fields that are highly analytical and problem-solving in nature.
3. **Empathy and Love for Animals:** His strong empathy and love for animals might make fields related to veterinary sciences, zoology, or even some branches of psychology appealing.
4. **Understanding and Appreciation for Hard Work:** This trait is quite universal and can be applied across many fields but indicates a diligence and perseverance in his chosen area of study.

### Business Administration
- While Adam's appreciation for hard work could align with business administration, the personality traits described (curiosity about nature, empathy for animals, enjoying puzzles) do not strongly indicate an inclination toward a field primarily focused on business operations, management, or finance.

### Computer Science
- Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts are strong indicators that align well with computer science, which heavily relies on logical thinking, problem-solving, and abstract reasoning. However, his strong empathy and love for animals are not typical traits specifically highlighted for computer science professionals.

Given these considerations, here is the estimated probability:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

While his characteristics are more aligned with sciences that involve problem-solving and analytical thinking, they are less in tune with business-oriented skills and mindsets.
