To estimate the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science or business administration, we can consider his described personality traits, interests, and skills. 

Adam's curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work may point towards fields that align more closely with those attributes rather than fields like business administration which typically involves more people management and less focus on natural sciences or abstract concepts.

Given these considerations, here is the estimated probability:

{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

Computer science aligns more with Adam's intelligence and capability to handle abstract concepts and puzzles. It's not maximum because there are many other fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology that could suit him better given his love for nature, animals, and empathy. Business administration has a lower probability because it typically does not align as closely with Adam's stated interests and personality traits.
