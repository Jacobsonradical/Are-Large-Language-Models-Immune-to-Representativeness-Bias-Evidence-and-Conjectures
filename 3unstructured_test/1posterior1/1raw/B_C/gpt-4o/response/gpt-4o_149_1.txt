Based on the personality sketch provided, which highlights Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, empathy, love for animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication, the likelihoods of him being enrolled in computer science or business administration can be estimated as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3, // Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts may incline him toward computer science, though his love for nature and animals suggests he might prefer a field more directly related to those interests.
  "business administration": 0.1 // Adam's traits such as empathy and appreciation for hard work could suit business administration, but his strong interest in nature and animals makes it less likely.
}
```

These estimates consider Adam's traits and interests as potentially more aligned with fields connected to nature, animals, or scientific research, rather than traditional paths like computer science or business administration.
