Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam's interests and traits suggest a higher likelihood of him being enrolled in a field that aligns more closely with his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy. Here are my estimates:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

These estimates are based on the reasoning that his interests and characteristics seem to resonate less with fields typically associated with computer science and business administration. Instead, he might be more inclined towards fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology.
