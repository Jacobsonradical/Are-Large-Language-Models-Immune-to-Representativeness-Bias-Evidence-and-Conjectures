  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4
}

These estimations are based on the traits described:

- His high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work also align well with the rigorous analytical nature required in computer science.
- While people with a love for puzzles and abstract thinking can excel in business administration, given the nature-oriented and empathetic traits, such an enrollment appears less likely compared to computer science.
