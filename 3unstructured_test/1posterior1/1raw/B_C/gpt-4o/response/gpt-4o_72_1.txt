Given Adam's interests and personality traits, he seems less likely to be drawn to business administration, which may not align as closely with his passion for nature, animals, and abstract problem-solving. His high intelligence and problem-solving skills make computer science a more plausible field, as it often involves puzzles and abstract thinking. However, the fit is still not perfect, hence a moderate probability.
