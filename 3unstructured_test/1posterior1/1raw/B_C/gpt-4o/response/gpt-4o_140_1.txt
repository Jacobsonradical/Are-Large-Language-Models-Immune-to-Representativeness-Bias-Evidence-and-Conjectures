Considering Adam's interests in nature, a love for plants and animals, and a strong empathy, he seems less likely to be pursuing a field like business administration. However, his high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align more closely with computer science. Therefore, the probability of Adam being in computer science is higher than in business administration. Other fields such as biology or environmental science are also plausible, but these estimates focus specifically on the two fields mentioned.
