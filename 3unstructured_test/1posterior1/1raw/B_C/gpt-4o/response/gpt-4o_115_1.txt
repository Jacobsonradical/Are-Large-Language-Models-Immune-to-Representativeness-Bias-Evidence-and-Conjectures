Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, along with his empathetic and kind personality, it seems more likely that he would be drawn to fields related to biology, environmental sciences, or perhaps psychology over business administrationâ€”hence the lower probability for the latter. His intelligence and strength in understanding abstract concepts do raise the possibility of a field like computer science, but his specific interests in solving puzzles and nature suggest a possible leaning towards other sciences. Therefore, the probability provided reflects these considerations.
