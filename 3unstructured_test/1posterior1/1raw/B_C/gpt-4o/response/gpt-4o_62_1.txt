Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, it seems that he has a strong inclination towards nature, animals, abstract thinking, and problem-solving. He does not seem to exhibit characteristics or interests that align strongly with business administration. His appreciation for nature, problem-solving skills, and understanding of abstract concepts point more towards science-related fields.

Given this information, here is the estimated probability:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These estimates are based on Adam's traits indicating a greater fit for scientific and analytical fields rather than business administration. However, it's important to note that other fields such as biology, environmental science, or even psychology could also be strong fits for him based on his love for nature and animals as well as his empathy and analytical skills.
