Given Adam's deep curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and appreciation for animals, he might be more inclined toward fields like environmental science, biology, or psychology. However, considering his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, computer science is still a possible field for him, albeit less likely than the ones directly aligned with his interests. Business administration, on the other hand, seems less probable given the lack of particular indications that he is inclined toward business or management.
