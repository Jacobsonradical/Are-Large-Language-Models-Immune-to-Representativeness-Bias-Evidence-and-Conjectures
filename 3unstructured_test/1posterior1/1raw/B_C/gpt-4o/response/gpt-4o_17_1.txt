Given the characteristics and interests described in Adam's personality sketch, it's likely he would be drawn to fields that align more closely with his love for nature, animals, and abstract concepts. Business administration and computer science do not seem to align perfectly with these interests. However, it's still possible for him to be enrolled in these fields, especially considering his intelligence and complexity in abstract thinking.

Here's my best estimate for the probability:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.15,
  "computer science": 0.20
}
```

These probabilities are relatively low compared to fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology, which might be a better fit for his personality and interests. However, given his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, a slightly higher probability for computer science makes sense.
