Based on the personality sketch of Adam, here are my estimates of the probabilities that he was enrolled in the specified fields:

{
  "computer science": 0.30,
  "business administration": 0.10
}

These estimates take into account Adam's strong intellectual abilities and appreciation for understanding abstract concepts, which align well with computer science. However, his deep love for nature, empathy, and animals, alongside his appreciation for hard work, suggest that his interests may be more aligned with fields related to biology, environmental science, or similar disciplines rather than business administration.
