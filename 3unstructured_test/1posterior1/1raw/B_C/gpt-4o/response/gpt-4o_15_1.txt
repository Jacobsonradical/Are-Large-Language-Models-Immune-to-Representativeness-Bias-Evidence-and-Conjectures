Based on the personality sketch of Adam, it seems less likely that his interests and traits align with business administration. His deep curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work do not strongly correlate with the typical focus areas or motivations for pursuing business administration. 

On the other hand, his high intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, strong understanding of abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work are traits that can strongly align with computer science. Computer science often involves abstract thinking, logical problem-solving, and can include areas related to nature and biological systems, such as bioinformatics.

Taking these considerations into account:
