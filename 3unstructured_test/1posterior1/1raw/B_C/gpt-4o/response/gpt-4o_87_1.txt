Given Adam's characteristics—curiosity about nature, love for animals, and interest in abstract concepts—he seems more aligned with fields related to science or nature rather than business. Computer Science has been chosen with a bit higher probability because it aligns with his intelligence, abstract thinking, and puzzle-solving skills. However, the probability for business administration is lower as Adam's profile does not strongly suggest an inclination towards this field.
