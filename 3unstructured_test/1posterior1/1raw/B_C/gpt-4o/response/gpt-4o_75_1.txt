Based on the personality sketch provided, certain inferences about Adam's probability of enrollment in various fields can be made:

- Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and interest in plants suggest a strong inclination toward life sciences or environmental studies rather than business-oriented fields.
- His enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he might be inclined towards fields that require strong analytical and problem-solving skills, which could include computer science among other scientific disciplines.
- The mention of empathy and a warm heart suggests a potential interest in fields where social impact or interaction with living beings is important.

Given these points, here are the estimated probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.30
}
```

These estimates consider that while Adam's characteristics don't align strongly with typical business administration profiles, his analytical abilities and abstract thinking could make computer science a plausible field of study.
