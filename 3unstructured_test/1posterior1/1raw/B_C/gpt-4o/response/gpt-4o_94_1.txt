Based on the provided personality sketch, we can make some informed estimates. Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and love for animals align more closely with fields such as biology, environmental science, or even some areas of psychology rather than computer science or business administration. His enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence could be pertinent but perhaps secondary considerations for these two fields in the context provided. Strong empathy and appreciation for hard work further suggest fields that are more directly connected to life sciences or social sciences.

With these considerations in mind, here are the estimates:
