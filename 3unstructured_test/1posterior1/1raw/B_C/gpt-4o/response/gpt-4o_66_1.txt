Given Adam's interests and traits, he is more likely to be in fields closely related to nature, animals, and possibly biological sciences, rather than business administration or computer science. However, given his high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts, computer science remains a plausible option, albeit less likely compared to fields directly related to his interests in nature and animals. Hence, the values reflect that, while possible, these fields are not the most fitting given the provided personality sketch.
