Given Adam's personality traits and interests, he seems less likely to be enrolled in Business Administration, as his curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, and empathy do not strongly align with the typical focuses of that field. However, his traits suggest a higher probability of being in Computer Science due to his intelligence, enjoyment of puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts. Even so, it is still not overwhelmingly likely, as his interests in nature and animals could lead him to other fields such as biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine.
