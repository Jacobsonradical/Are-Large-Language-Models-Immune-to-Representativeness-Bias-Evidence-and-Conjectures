Based on the provided personality sketch of Adam, my best estimate for the probability of him being enrolled in the specified fields in 2021 is as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These estimates take into account Adam's interests and characteristics. His genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy suggest a tendency towards fields more closely aligned with these interests, such as environmental science, biology, or psychology, rather than computer science or business administration. However, his high intelligence and capability to understand abstract concepts do provide some probability for computer science. Business administration seems less likely given his non-commercial interests and personality traits.
