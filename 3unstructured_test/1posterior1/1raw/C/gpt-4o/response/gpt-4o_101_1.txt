  "computer science": 0.2

Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, love for animals, and deep appreciation for hard work, it seems more likely that his interests align with fields such as biology, environmental science, or related areas. While he is intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts (both valuable traits in computer science), his stated passions lean more toward natural sciences. Therefore, while there's a possibility that Adam could be in computer science, it is less probable compared to other fields aligned with his interests, hence the estimate of 0.2.
