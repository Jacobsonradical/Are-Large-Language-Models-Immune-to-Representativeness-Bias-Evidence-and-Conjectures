Given the information provided, Adam's characteristics suggest he could be attracted to fields that involve solving complex problems, understanding abstract concepts, and possibly working with data. While his keen interest in nature, animals, and empathy might point more directly to fields such as biology, environmental science, or even psychology, his intelligence and puzzle-solving ability are also highly valued in computer science. Thus, there's a reasonable probability, but not the highest, that he would be in that field.
