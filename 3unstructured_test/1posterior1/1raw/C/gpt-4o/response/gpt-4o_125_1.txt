Explanation: Given Adam's strong intelligence and aptitude for abstract concepts, he might find computer science appealing. However, considering his deep curiosity about nature, appreciation for hard work, empathy, and love for animals, it's more likely that he would be drawn to fields like biology, environmental science, or even veterinary studies. Therefore, the probability that he is enrolled in computer science is moderate.
