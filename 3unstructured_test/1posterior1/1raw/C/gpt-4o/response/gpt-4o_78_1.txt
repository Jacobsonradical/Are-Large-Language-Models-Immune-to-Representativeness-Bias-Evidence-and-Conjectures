Given Adam's strong intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, he could certainly be interested in a field like computer science. However, his deep love for nature, plants, and animals suggests he might be more inclined toward fields like biology, environmental science, or perhaps even veterinary science. Therefore, while there's a reasonable probability he could be in computer science, it's not the most likely based on the information provided about his interests and personality.
