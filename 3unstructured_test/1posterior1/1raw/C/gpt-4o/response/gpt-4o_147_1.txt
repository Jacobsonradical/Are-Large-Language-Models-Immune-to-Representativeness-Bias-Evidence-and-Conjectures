  "computer science": 0.1
}

Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, his love for animals, and his enjoyment of solving puzzles, he seems more likely to be drawn to fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine. However, his strong intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could still make computer science a viable option, albeit less likely than other fields more directly connected to his interests. Hence, an estimate of 0.1 seems reasonable.
