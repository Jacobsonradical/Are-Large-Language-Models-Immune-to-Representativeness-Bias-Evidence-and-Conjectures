Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, and strong appreciation for hard work and dedication, it is likely he might gravitate towards fields more directly related to the natural sciences, life sciences, or even fields like environmental science or biology. However, his high intelligence, aptitude for solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts also make him a good candidate for computer science. The probability is not very high, but it's plausible that he could be involved in interdisciplinary research that combines computer science with his interests in nature and animals (e.g., computational biology or bioinformatics). Hence, I've assigned a probability of 0.2.
