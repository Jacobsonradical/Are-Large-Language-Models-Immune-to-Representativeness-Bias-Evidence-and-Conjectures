Given Adam's qualities and interests—such as a genuine curiosity about nature, empathy, a love for animals, and a deep understanding of abstract concepts—it's reasonable to conclude that he may be inclined toward fields closely related to these traits, such as biology, environmental science, or perhaps even psychology. However, computer science is a broad and interdisciplinary field that often attracts individuals with strong problem-solving skills and high intelligence, so there's still a notable probability that Adam could be pursuing a graduate degree in this area despite his stronger inclination toward the natural world.
