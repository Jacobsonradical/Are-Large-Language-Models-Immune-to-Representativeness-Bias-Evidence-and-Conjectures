Given Adam's interests and characteristics, particularly his love for nature, animals, and his empathy, it might seem that a field like biology, environmental science, or a similar discipline may be more aligned with his passions. However, his high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts still make it plausible that he could be interested in computer science, though possibly with a focus on applications related to his other interests, such as computational biology or data analysis in environmental studies.
