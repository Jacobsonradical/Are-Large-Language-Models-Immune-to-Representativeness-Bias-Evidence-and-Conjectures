  "computer science": 0.25

Given Adam's personality sketch, his traits suggest a strong inclination towards natural sciences, biology, or environmental sciences due to his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and high empathy. However, his high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts also make computer science a plausible field. Taking these aspects into account, I estimate a probability of 0.25 that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
