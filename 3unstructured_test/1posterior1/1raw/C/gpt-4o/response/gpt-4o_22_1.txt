Given Adam's strong intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, he could potentially excel in computer science. However, his deep love for nature, plants, animals, and puzzles suggests he might be more inclined towards fields like biology, environmental science, or a related interdisciplinary area. Therefore, while there is a possibility that Adam was enrolled in computer science as a graduate student in 2021, it seems less probable compared to other fields that align more closely with his interests and personality traits.
