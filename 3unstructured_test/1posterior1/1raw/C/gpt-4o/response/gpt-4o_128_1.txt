  "computer science": 0.2
}

Given the information provided, Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, and has a warm heart with strong empathy, which suggests a potential interest in fields related to biology, environmental science, or perhaps psychology. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts do align with fields like computer science, but they also fit well with several other disciplines. While it's possible Adam could be studying computer science due to its abstract nature and problem-solving aspects, the context suggests he may be more inclined towards fields directly related to his love for nature and animals. Consequently, I estimate a probability of 0.2 for computer science.
