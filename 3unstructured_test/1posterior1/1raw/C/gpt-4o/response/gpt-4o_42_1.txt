Adam's personality sketch suggests a strong leaning towards nature, animals, and solving puzzles. While computer science does involve problem-solving and abstract thinking, Adam's profile doesn't overwhelmingly point towards a field primarily focused on computers and software. However, given his high intelligence and interest in solving puzzles, it's plausible that he could have enrolled in computer science, though fields like biology, environmental science, or even psychology seem more aligned with his described interests.
