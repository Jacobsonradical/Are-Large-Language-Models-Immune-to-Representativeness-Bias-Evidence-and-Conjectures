Here is the probability estimate:

{
  "computer science": 0.2
}

Given Adam's personality sketch, his genuine curiosity about nature, and love for animals, coupled with his strong empathy and appreciation for hard work, it seems slightly less likely that he would enroll in a field like computer science. Instead, his interests and qualities might align more closely with fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine. However, because he is noted to be highly intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, there's still a significant probability that he might have chosen to pursue computer science, hence the estimate of 0.2.
