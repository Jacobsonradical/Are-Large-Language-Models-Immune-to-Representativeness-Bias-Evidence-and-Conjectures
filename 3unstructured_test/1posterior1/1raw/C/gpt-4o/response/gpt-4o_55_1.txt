  "computer science": 0.1

Given Adam's strong curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals, it seems more likely that he would be enrolled in a field closer to environmental science, biology, animal behavior, or a related discipline. However, his high intelligence and capability with abstract concepts mean there's still a non-zero chance he might choose a field like computer science, perhaps with an interest in bioinformatics or using computational tools to study natural phenomena. Therefore, I estimated the probability at 0.1.
