Given the description, Adam's strong empathy, love for nature and animals, and interest in solving puzzles suggest he might lean towards fields related to biology, environmental science, or psychology. His high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could point towards fields that require complex problem-solving skills, like computer science; however, the characteristics described make it somewhat unlikely that computer science is his primary focus.
