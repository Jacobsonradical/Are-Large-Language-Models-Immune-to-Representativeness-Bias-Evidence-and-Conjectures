{
  "computer science": 0.1
}

Given Adam's strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy, it seems more likely that he would be drawn to fields such as biology, environmental science, or perhaps a specialized area in veterinary medicine. While his high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could certainly enable him to excel in computer science, his interests and personal qualities seem to align more closely with fields focused on nature and living beings. Therefore, I estimate a lower probability of 0.1 for computer science.
