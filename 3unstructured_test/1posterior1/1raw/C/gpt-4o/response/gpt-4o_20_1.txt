This estimate considers Adam's high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts, which can be associated with fields like computer science. However, his interests and empathy towards nature, plants, and animals might steer him towards fields more directly related to those topics, such as biology, environmental science, or related disciplines, which makes the probability just moderate.
