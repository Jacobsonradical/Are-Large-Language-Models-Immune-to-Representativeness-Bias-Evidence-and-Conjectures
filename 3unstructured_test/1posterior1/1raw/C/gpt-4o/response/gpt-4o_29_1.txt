Based on the personality traits and interests described in the sketch of Adam, the following estimation is provided:

{
  "computer science": 0.2
}

Adam's high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts suggest that he could excel in computer science. However, his deep love for nature, plants, and animals implies that he might be more inclined towards fields that align directly with these interests, such as biology, environmental science, or botany. Therefore, while it's possible for Adam to be enrolled in computer science, the probability is estimated to be relatively low compared to fields that are more directly related to his interests and empathy for nature.
