  "computer science": 0.25
}

Given Adam's described interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy, he appears to have inclinations that align more closely with fields such as biology, environmental science, psychology, or veterinary science. However, his high intelligence and proficiency with abstract concepts alongside an interest in problem-solving and puzzles do align somewhat with the skills often found in computer science. So, while it is possible that he could be in computer science, his other interests suggest it might be less likely compared to these more directly aligned fields. Therefore, an estimated probability of 0.25 seems reasonable.
