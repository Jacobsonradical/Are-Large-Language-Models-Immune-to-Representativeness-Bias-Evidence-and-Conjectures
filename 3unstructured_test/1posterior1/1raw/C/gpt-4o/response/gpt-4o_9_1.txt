Given Adam's interests and personality traits, it appears that he might lean more towards fields such as biology, environmental science, or perhaps psychology, where his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy could play a significant role. However, considering his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, there is still a reasonable likelihood that he could be enrolled in a field like computer science, albeit less probable compared to the aforementioned fields.
