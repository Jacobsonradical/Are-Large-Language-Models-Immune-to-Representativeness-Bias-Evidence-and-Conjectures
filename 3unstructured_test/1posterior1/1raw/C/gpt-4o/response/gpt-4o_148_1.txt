  "computer science": 0.2
}

Given Adam's interests and characteristics, while it is possible for him to be in computer science due to his puzzle-solving skills and high intelligence, his strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for nature suggest he might be more inclined towards fields like environmental science, biology, or even psychology. Hence, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.2 for him being enrolled in computer science.
