Given Adam's interests in nature, plants, and animals, he seems more inclined towards fields like biology, environmental science, or perhaps even psychology. While his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could make him suitable for computer science, the probability seems lower than for fields directly related to his stated interests. Nonetheless, a solid grounding in abstract thinking and problem-solving abilities does suggest a non-negligible chance that he might choose computer science.
