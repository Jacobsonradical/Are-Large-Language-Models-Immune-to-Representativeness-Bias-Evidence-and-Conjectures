Based on the provided personality sketch, Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for plants and animals, and strong empathy suggest a stronger inclination toward fields related to nature, biology, or environmental science rather than computer science. Additionally, while he is described as highly intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts—qualities that are beneficial in computer science—these traits alone are not sufficient to make computer science the most probable field of study given the complete profile.

Thus, while it is not impossible that Adam is enrolled in computer science, it seems less likely given his pronounced interests and empathy toward nature and living organisms.
