  "computer science": 0.2

Given Adam's interests and traits—such as a genuine curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals—it seems more likely that he would pursue fields related to environmental science, biology, or other life sciences. However, his high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could still make computer science a plausible field, just not the most probable one. Hence, a probability of 0.2 reflects this consideration.
