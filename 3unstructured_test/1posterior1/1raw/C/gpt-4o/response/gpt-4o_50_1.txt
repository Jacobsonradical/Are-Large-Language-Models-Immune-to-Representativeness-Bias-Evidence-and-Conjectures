Adam's strong intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could make him a good candidate for a field like computer science. However, given his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and focus on plants, it's likely that his interests lean more towards biological or environmental sciences. Therefore, while there's a possibility he could be in computer science, it's not the most probable field based on his described interests and characteristics.
