  "computer science": 0.2
}

Given Adam's personality sketch, his interest in nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication might suggest that he could be inclined towards fields like environmental science, biology, or a related discipline. However, his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts make computer science a reasonable possibility as well, though perhaps not the most probable based on the provided description. Thus, an estimate of 0.2 seems appropriate for his enrollment in computer science.
