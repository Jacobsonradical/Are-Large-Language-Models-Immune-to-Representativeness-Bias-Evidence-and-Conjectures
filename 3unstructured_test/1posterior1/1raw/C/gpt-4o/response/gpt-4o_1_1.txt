Explanation:
Given Adam's personality sketch, he seems to have a strong affinity for nature, empathy for animals, and an appreciation for hard work. While these characteristics do not directly align with stereotypical traits of computer science students, his high intelligence and aptitude for solving puzzles suggest he might enjoy the intellectual challenges posed by computer science. However, his more pronounced interest in natural elements and empathy might lead him to fields like biology, environmental science, or even psychology. Thus, while it's plausible that Adam could be studying computer science, it might not be the most likely field given his broader interests.
