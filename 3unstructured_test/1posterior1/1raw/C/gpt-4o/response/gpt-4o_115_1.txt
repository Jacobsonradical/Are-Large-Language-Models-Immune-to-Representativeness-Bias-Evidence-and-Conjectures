Given Adam's described characteristics, he exhibits traits that align well with disciplines such as biology, environmental science, psychology, or veterinary science. The strong empathy and love for animals could be indicative of fields focusing on living organisms. However, his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also make computer science a plausible field. Therefore, I estimate a 20% probability for computer science, acknowledging that it is one of many possible fields he could be enrolled in.
