Given Adam's characteristics—his curiosity about nature and plants, deep love for animals, empathy, and understanding of hard work—it seems more likely he would be drawn to fields like biology, environmental science, or perhaps even psychology. However, given his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, there remains a reasonable probability (0.2) that he could be enrolled in computer science, especially considering the variety of interdisciplinary applications of CS in fields such as bioinformatics or environmental modeling.
