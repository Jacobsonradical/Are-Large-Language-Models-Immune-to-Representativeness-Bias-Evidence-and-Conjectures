Given Adam's interests and personality traits, it's relatively less likely but still moderately possible that he is enrolled in computer science. His strong intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts align with the requirements of the field, but his empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature suggest he may be more inclined towards fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine. Most of his traits point towards a science-related field, but not necessarily one that is as detached from immediate interaction with the natural world as computer science tends to be.
