Adam's personality sketch suggests he has strong empathy, a deep love for nature and animals, and an appreciation for hard work. While these traits don't rule out enrollment in computer science, they are more strongly aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology. His interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, along with his high intelligence, does suggest some compatibility with computer science, but given the stronger indications towards other fields mentioned, the probability is moderate rather than high.
