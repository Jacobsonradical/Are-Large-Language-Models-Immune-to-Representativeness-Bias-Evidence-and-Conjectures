Explanation: While Adam has a high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts, which are beneficial in the field of computer science, his deep love for nature, plants, and animals suggests a strong interest in fields related to biology, environmental science, or possibly agricultural studies. Therefore, while there is a chance he might be enrolled in computer science, it's more probable he's pursuing a degree in a field more closely aligned with his interests in nature and animals.
