  "computer science": 0.2
}

Considering Adam's personality traits, such as his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work, along with his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, it's possible he is enrolled in fields like biology, ecology, environmental science, or psychology. However, given his interest in solving puzzles, computer science could still be a possibility, though it might be less likely compared to other fields more directly aligned with his interests in nature and empathy. Hence, a probability of 0.2 seems reasonable.
