Based on the provided personality sketch of Adam, here's an estimate of the probability that he was enrolled in computer science:

{
  "computer science": 0.2
}

This estimate accounts for Adam's high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts, which are relevant to computer science. However, Adam has a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, which might suggest a higher likelihood of his enrollment in fields like biology, environmental science, or related disciplines. Thus, while computer science is a possibility, it is not the most probable field based on his interests and personality traits.
