Given Adam's personality sketch, his curiosity about nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and high intelligence suggest he could be in a variety of fields. While computer science relates to abstract thinking and problem-solving, which align with his qualities, it is less directly connected to his love for nature and animals. Fields like biology, environmental science, or animal behavior might be more likely, but computer science remains a possibility, albeit with lower probability.
