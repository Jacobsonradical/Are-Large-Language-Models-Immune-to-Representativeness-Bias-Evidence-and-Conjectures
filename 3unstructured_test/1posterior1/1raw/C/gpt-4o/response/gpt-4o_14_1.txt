Given Adam's high intelligence and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts, it's plausible that he could be pursuing a degree in computer science. However, his strong empathy, deep love for animals, and genuine curiosity about nature and plants might indicate he is more likely to be in a field related to biology, environmental science, or a similar discipline. Therefore, while it's possible he is studying computer science, it might not be the most probable field based on the provided personality sketch.
