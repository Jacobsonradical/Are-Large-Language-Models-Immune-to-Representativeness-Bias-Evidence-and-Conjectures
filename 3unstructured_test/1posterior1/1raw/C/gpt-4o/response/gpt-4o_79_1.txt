Given Adam's personality sketch, his strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy suggest that he might be more inclined toward biological sciences, environmental studies, or fields related to natural sciences. While his high intelligence and capability to understand abstract concepts could suit computer science, his deep appreciation for nature-related topics makes it less likely compared to other fields. Hence, the probability is estimated to be around 0.15.
