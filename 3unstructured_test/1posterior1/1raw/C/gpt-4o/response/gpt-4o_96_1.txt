Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam has a diverse range of interests and strengths, particularly centered around nature, animals, empathy, and solving puzzles. While his high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could align with a technical field like computer science, his specific interests lean more toward fields connected with natural sciences and empathy-driven disciplines.

Here's my best estimate for the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2
}
```

This estimate reflects the alignment of Adam's abstract problem-solving abilities with computer science, while also considering his strong inclination towards nature, plants, animals, and empathetic understanding, which may suggest a higher likelihood of being drawn to fields such as biology, environmental science, or psychology.
