Given Adam's keen interest in nature, plants, animals, and his empathy, he seems to be more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, or even psychology. While his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could make him suitable for computer science, the other aspects of his personality and interests suggest that computer science might not be his primary field. Thus, the probability that he was enrolled in computer science is relatively low, but not negligible.
