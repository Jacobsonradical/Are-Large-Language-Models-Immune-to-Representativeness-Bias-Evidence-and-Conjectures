  "computer science": 0.2

Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, it's possible that he could be enrolled in a field like biology, environmental science, or psychology. However, his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, as well as interest in puzzles, also align with traits found in computer science students. Therefore, assigning a probability of 0.2 reflects that while computer science is a possibility, it is not the most likely field compared to more directly nature or empathy-related fields.
