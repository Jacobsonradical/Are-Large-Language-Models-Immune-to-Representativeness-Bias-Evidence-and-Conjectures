  "computer science": 0.2
}

Given Adam's described personality and interests, it seems more plausible that he could be studying a field like biology, environmental science, or psychology due to his curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, as well as his strong empathy. However, his high intelligence and abstract problem-solving skills also make computer science a feasible option, though possibly not as strong as the aforementioned fields. Hence, 0.2 seems like a reasonable estimate.
