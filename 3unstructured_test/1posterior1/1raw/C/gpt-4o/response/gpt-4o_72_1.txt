  "computer science": 0.2

Given Adam's personality sketch, his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy suggest he might be more inclined towards fields like biology, environmental science, or animal science. However, his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also make fields like computer science a possibility, albeit less likely than the others mentioned. Therefore, a probability of 0.2 seems reasonable for computer science.
