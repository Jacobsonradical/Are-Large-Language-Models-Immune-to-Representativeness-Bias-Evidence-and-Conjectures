Based on the information provided about Adam, his interests and personality traits suggest he may be more inclined towards fields related to nature, biology, or environmental science. However, his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also make him a suitable candidate for fields like computer science. Given his characteristics, I would estimate the probability as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

This estimation considers both his intellectual capabilities and his more pronounced interests in nature and empathy, which might lead him towards other scientific or environmental studies.
