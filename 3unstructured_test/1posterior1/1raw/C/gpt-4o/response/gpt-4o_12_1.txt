This estimate is based on the following reasoning: While Adam shows intelligence and the ability to understand abstract concepts (which are important in computer science), his strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest that he might be more inclined towards fields like biology, environmental science, or zoology. However, interests in puzzles and abstract thinking do align with some aspects of computer science, leading to a moderate probability.
