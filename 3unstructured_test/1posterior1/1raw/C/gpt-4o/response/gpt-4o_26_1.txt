This estimate is based on the fact that Adam has a high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts, which are traits beneficial for computer science. However, his strong connection with nature, plants, animals, and puzzles suggests that he might also be interested in fields such as biology, environmental science, or a discipline related to animal studies or ecology. The probability reflects the balance between his aptitude for abstract thinking and his passion for natural and environmental sciences.
