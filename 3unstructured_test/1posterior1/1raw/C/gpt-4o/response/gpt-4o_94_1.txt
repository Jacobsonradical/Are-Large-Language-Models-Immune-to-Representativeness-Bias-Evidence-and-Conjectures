Given the information, Adam shows a deep interest in nature, plants, solving puzzles, empathy, and a love for animals. These traits are strong indicators of a field related to biology, environmental science, or psychology. Although his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts do align with fields like computer science, the contextual clues provided in the personality sketch suggest that his academic interests might lean more towards life and environmental sciences.
