  "computer science": 0.3

Given Adam's strong intelligence, curiosity about nature and understanding of abstract concepts, it is feasible that he could be studying computer science, especially since it requires problem-solving skills and an analytical mindset. However, his deep love for animals, empathy, and warm heart suggests he might be more inclined toward life sciences, biology, environmental studies, or a related field. Therefore, my best estimate for the probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science is 0.3.
