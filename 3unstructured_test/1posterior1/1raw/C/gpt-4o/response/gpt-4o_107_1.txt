  "computer science": 0.2

Considering Adam's personality traits—such as his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work—it's reasonable to assume that while he could potentially be interested in computer science (especially given his high intelligence and abstract thinking skills), it's more probable that he would be drawn to fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology. However, since computer science is a versatile field that intersects with many areas, it's possible he could also find a niche within it that aligns with his interests, hence the estimated probability of 0.2.
