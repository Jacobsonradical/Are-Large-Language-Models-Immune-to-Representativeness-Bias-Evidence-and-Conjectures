Given Adam's profile, his genuine curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, and empathy suggest he might be more inclined toward fields like biology, environmental science, or related disciplines. While his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could make him a good candidate for computer science, the specific interests mentioned point more strongly toward fields related to nature and life sciences. Hence, the probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science is estimated to be relatively low.
