  "computer science": 0.3
}

Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, and his warm-hearted, empathetic nature, as well as his problem-solving skills, it's plausible that his chosen field of study intersects with these areas. High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts can be relevant to many graduate fields, including computer science, but his specific interest in nature might lead him toward disciplines such as environmental science, biology, or ecology. However, given the intersection of computer science with many fields, it's conceivable he could be involved in computational biology or environmental modeling. Thus, assigning a probability of 0.3 to computer science seems reasonable, leaning more towards direct applicability to his interests.
