Based on the provided personality sketch of Adam, it seems that his interests lie more heavily in understanding nature, plants, animals, and abstract concepts. He also has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals. These traits are indicative of someone who might be more inclined toward life sciences or fields that involve significant interaction with nature and animals.

Computer science typically involves more technical and abstract problem-solving, which Adam could certainly be good at given his high intelligence and interest in puzzles. However, his strong empathetic nature and love for animals suggest he might prefer fields where he can be more closely connected to living organisms and their ecosystems.

Considering these factors, I estimate the probability of Adam being enrolled in a computer science field to be moderate but not the highest.
