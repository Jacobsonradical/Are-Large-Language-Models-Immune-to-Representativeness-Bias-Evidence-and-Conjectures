Given Adam's described interests and personality traits, while he might possess the intellectual capacity and abstract thinking skills beneficial for computer science, his strong curiosity about nature, plants, and animals suggests he may be more inclined towards fields like biology, environmental science, or perhaps cognitive science. Thus, while not impossible, the likelihood is somewhat lower for computer science in comparison to these other fields.
