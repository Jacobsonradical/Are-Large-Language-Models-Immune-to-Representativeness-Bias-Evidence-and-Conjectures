Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, where he is described as having a high intelligence, enjoying solving puzzles, and being good at understanding abstract concepts, there is a plausible alignment with characteristics often found in students who pursue computer science. Computer science often requires strong problem-solving skills, abstract reasoning, and intellectual curiosity, which aligns with Adam's traits.

However, since Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, and a strong empathy and love for animals, fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary studies might also be highly relevant to his interests. Yet, the absence of any specific mention of computers or technology in his personality sketch means we should be cautious in assuming a high probability of him being enrolled in computer science solely based on his problem-solving skills and intelligence.

Considering the comprehensive analysis, the probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science could be estimated, yet reflect a moderate probability since other fields also seem very relevant based on his interests in nature and animals.
