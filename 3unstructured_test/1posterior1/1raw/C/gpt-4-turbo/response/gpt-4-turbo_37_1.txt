Given the description of Adam, which emphasizes his quiet nature, strong empathy, love for animals, and high intelligence particularly in understanding abstract concepts, a field aligning with technology and theoretical problem-solving like computer science could indeed interest him. However, his deep connection with nature and animals may suggest a potential leaning towards more life science-related fields or environmental studies. Nonetheless, computer science does involve solving complex problems and understanding abstract concepts which suits Adam's profile. Hence, based on the information provided and considering a broad spectrum of interests but with a tendency towards fields requiring analytical and abstract thinking, my estimate would be:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
