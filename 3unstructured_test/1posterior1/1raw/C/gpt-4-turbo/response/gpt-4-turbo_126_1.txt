Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, it describes traits like high intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoyment in solving puzzles. These traits are often correlated with success in fields that involve logical thinking, problem-solving, and complex theoretical frameworks, such as computer science. However, his interest in nature and animals could also imply an inclination towards biological or environmental sciences rather than solely technical fields.

Considering these factors, while Adam may have the intellectual capability for computer science, his passions might lead him to other fields. Therefore, I would estimate the probability as follows, recognising that this is a broad assessment with limited direct information connecting Adam specifically to computer science:
