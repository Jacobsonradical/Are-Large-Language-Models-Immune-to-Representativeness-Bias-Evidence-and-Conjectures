Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam's traits such as high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles could align with a field like computer science. However, his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy might suggest a stronger inclination towards fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary science. Therefore, I would estimate the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

This estimate takes into account that while Adam has some traits that could suit computer science, his interests and empathetic nature might lean more towards other fields.
