  "computer science": 0.4
}

Explanation: While Adam's strong intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving skills could indicate a potential fit for computer science, his deep interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as his strong empathy, might suggest a better fit with fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine. Thus, a probability of 0.4 is estimated for computer science.
