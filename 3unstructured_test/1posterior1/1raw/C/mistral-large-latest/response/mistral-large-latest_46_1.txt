Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and aptitude for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts suggest he might be interested in computer science. However, his deep love for nature, plants, and animals could also indicate a strong interest in fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary science. Given these factors, I would estimate the probability as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

This estimate takes into account Adam's analytical skills and intelligence, which are relevant to computer science, while also considering his strong affinity for nature and animals, which might draw him to other fields.
