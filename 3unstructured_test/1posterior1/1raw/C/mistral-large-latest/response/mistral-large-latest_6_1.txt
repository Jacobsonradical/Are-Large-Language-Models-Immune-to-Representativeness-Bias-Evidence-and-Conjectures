Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts suggest he might be inclined towards fields that require analytical and problem-solving skills. However, his strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for nature might also draw him towards fields related to biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine.

Given this, while there is a possibility that Adam could be interested in computer science, it is not the only or most obvious fit. Therefore, I would estimate the probability as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

This estimate takes into account Adam's analytical skills and intelligence, which are valuable in computer science, but also considers his strong inclination towards nature and animals, which might lead him to other fields.
