Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and aptitude for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts suggest he might be well-suited for computer science. However, his strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for nature and hard work also indicate interests that could lead him to other fields, such as biology, environmental science, or a related discipline.

Given these factors, I would estimate the probability as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

This estimate reflects a moderate to high likelihood that Adam was enrolled in computer science, considering his problem-solving skills and intellectual abilities, while also acknowledging his other interests that could point to different fields of study.
