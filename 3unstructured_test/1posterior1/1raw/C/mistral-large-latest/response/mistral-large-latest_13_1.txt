Explanation: While Adam's problem-solving skills, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts could indicate a potential fit for computer science, his strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as his empathetic nature, might suggest a better fit in fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine. Therefore, the probability is estimated to be relatively moderate at 0.4.
