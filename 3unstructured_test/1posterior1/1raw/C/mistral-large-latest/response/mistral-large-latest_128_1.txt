  "computer science": 0.4
}

Explanation: While Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and puzzle-solving skills could be indicative of a computer science student, his deep love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as his strong empathy, might suggest a higher probability of him studying a life science or environmental field. Therefore, a probability of 0.4 is a reasonable estimate for computer science.
