  "computer science": 0.4

Explanation: While Adam's problem-solving skills, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts could make him a good fit for computer science, his personality sketch emphasizes his love for nature, animals, and empathy, which might make him more inclined towards fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary science. Therefore, I estimate the probability of him being enrolled in computer science at 0.4.
