  "computer science": 0.4
}

Explanation: While Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts could make him a good fit for computer science, his interests in nature, plants, and animals, as well as his empathetic nature, might lean more towards fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine. Thus, a probability of 0.4 is a reasonable estimate for computer science.
