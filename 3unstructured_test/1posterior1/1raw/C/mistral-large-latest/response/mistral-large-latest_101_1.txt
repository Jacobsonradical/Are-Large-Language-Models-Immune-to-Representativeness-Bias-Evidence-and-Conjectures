Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts suggest he might be interested in a field like computer science. However, his strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for nature and plants also indicate a possible inclination towards fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary science. Given these factors, I would estimate the probability as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

This estimate takes into account Adam's analytical skills and intelligence, which are valuable in computer science, while also considering his strong interests in nature and animals, which might pull him towards other fields.
