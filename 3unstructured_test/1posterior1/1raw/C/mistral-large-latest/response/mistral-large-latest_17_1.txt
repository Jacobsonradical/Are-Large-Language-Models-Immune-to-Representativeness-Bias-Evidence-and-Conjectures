Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and aptitude for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts suggest he might be inclined towards fields that require analytical and problem-solving skills. However, his deep love for nature, plants, and animals also suggests a strong affinity for biological or environmental sciences.

Given these factors, while it's possible that Adam could be interested in computer science, the emphasis on nature and animals might make it less likely compared to fields more directly related to those interests.

Therefore, my estimate for the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science is:
