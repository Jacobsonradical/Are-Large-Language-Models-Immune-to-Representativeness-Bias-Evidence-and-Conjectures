Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and aptitude for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts suggest he might be interested in computer science. However, his deep love for nature, plants, and animals could also indicate a strong interest in fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary science. Given these factors, I would estimate the probability as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

This estimate reflects that while Adam's traits are compatible with computer science, his strong affinity for nature and animals suggests that other fields might be equally or more likely.
