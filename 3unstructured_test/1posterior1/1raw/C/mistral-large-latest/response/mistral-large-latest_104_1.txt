Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam's strong analytical skills, high intelligence, and appreciation for abstract concepts suggest that he might be well-suited for a field like computer science. However, his deep love for nature, plants, and animals might also suggest a strong interest in fields related to biology or environmental science. Considering these factors, I would estimate the probability as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

This estimate reflects a moderate to high likelihood that Adam was enrolled in computer science, given his analytical and abstract reasoning skills, but also acknowledges the possibility of his interest in other fields related to nature and animals.
