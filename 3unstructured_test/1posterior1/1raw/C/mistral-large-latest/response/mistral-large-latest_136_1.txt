Explanation: While Adam's personality traits such as high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be beneficial in computer science, his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and enjoyment of puzzles might lean more towards fields like biology, environmental science, or even veterinary medicine. Therefore, the probability is estimated to be relatively low for computer science.
