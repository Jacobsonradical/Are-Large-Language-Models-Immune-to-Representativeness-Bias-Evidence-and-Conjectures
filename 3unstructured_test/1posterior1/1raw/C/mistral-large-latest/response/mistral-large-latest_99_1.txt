Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and aptitude for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts suggest he might be interested in computer science. However, his deep love for nature, plants, and animals could also indicate a strong interest in fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine. Given these factors, I would estimate the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

This estimate takes into account Adam's analytical skills and intelligence, which are well-suited for computer science, while also considering his strong affinity for nature and animals, which might draw him towards other fields.
