Explanation: While Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and puzzle-solving skills could be indicative of a computer science student, his deep love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as his strong empathy, might suggest a greater inclination towards fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine. Thus, a probability of 0.4 is estimated for computer science.
