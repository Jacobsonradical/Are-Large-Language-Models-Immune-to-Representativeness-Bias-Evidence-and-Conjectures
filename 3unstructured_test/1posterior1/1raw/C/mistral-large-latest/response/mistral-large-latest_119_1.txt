Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and aptitude for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts suggest he might be interested in a field like computer science. However, his strong love for nature, plants, and animals also suggests he could be drawn to fields related to biology, environmental science, or veterinary science. Given these factors, I would estimate the probability as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

This estimate takes into account Adam's analytical skills and intelligence, which are well-suited for computer science, while also considering his strong affinity for nature and animals, which might draw him towards other fields.
