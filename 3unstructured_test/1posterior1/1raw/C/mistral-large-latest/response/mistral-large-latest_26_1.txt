Based on the personality sketch provided, here's my estimated probability:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

Explanation: While Adam's problem-solving skills, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts could indicate a potential fit for computer science, his strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as his empathy, might suggest a better fit with fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary science. Therefore, I've estimated a moderate probability of 0.4 for computer science.
