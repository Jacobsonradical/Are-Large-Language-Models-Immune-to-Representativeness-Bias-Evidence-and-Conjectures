Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam's strong analytical skills, high intelligence, and appreciation for abstract concepts suggest he might be well-suited for a field like computer science. However, his deep love for nature, plants, and animals could also indicate a strong interest in fields related to biology or environmental science. Given these factors, I would estimate the probability as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

This estimate takes into account Adam's analytical and problem-solving skills while also considering his strong affinity for nature and animals, which might pull him towards other fields.
