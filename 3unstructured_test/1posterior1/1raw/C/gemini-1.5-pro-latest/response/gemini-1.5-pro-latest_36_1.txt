{
  "computer science": "0.4" 
}

**Explanation:**

While the description highlights traits often found in computer science students (intelligence, problem-solving skills, abstract thinking), it also strongly leans towards interests more aligned with biological sciences or potentially even humanities:

* **"Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants"** and **"deep love for animals"** are strong indicators of an affinity for biology or environmental science.
* **"Warm heart, strong empathy"**  while not exclusive to any field, could suggest an interest in fields involving human interaction or social impact.

Therefore, a 0.4 probability for computer science acknowledges the presence of relevant traits but balances it with the strong possibility of other fields being a better fit.
