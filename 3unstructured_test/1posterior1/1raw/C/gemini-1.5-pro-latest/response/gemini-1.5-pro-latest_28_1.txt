{
  "computer science": "0.3" 
} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description points towards someone analytical and intelligent, which are traits often found in computer science students, there's no direct mention of technology, programming, or related interests. 

Here's why the probability isn't higher:

* **Strong nature affinity:** The emphasis on nature and animals might suggest fields like biology, ecology, or veterinary science as more likely options. 
* **No tech indicators:** The absence of keywords like technology, computers, coding, or even a preference for logic-based puzzles leaves it ambiguous.
* **Humanities are possible:**  A love for animals and strong empathy could also point towards fields like psychology or social work. 

**Therefore, a probability of 0.3 (30%) acknowledges the possibility of Adam being in computer science due to his intelligence and problem-solving skills, but doesn't consider it the most likely scenario given the other information.**
