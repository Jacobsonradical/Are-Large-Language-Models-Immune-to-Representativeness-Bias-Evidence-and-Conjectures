**Explanation:**

While Adam's personality sketch aligns with certain aspects of a computer science student (problem-solving, abstract thinking, high intelligence), it lacks strong indicators typically associated with the field.  

* **Missing indicators:** There's no mention of interest in technology, programming, software, or hardware. These are strong indicators for a computer science student. 
* **Possible fit:** His enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts could translate to coding and algorithmic thinking, but it's not a strong enough connection on its own. 
* **Other fields:** His love for nature and animals, combined with his other traits, might point towards fields like biology, environmental science, or even veterinary medicine. 

**Therefore, the probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science is estimated to be moderate at 0.3. This reflects the potential fit but acknowledges the lack of strong, direct indicators.**
