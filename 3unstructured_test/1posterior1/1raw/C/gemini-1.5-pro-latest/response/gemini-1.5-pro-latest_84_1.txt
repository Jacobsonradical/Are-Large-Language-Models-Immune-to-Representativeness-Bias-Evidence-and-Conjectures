{
  "computer science": "0.3" 
} 

**Explanation:**

While Adam's personality sketch suggests several fields he might be drawn to, here's why I believe there's a moderate probability (0.3) for computer science:

* **Puzzle Solving:** Enjoying puzzles aligns strongly with computational thinking and problem-solving, core elements of computer science.
* **High Intelligence and Abstract Concepts:**  Computer science often involves abstract thinking and complex problem-solving, areas where Adam excels. 

**Why not higher?**

* **Nature and Animals:** His love for nature and animals suggests potential interests in biology, ecology, veterinary medicine, or related fields. This might outweigh his affinity for puzzles.
* **Lack of Direct Indicators:** The sketch lacks direct mentions of technology, programming, or computer-related interests, which would strengthen the probability. 

**Therefore, while Adam's affinity for puzzles and abstract thought makes computer science plausible, his other traits suggest a diverse range of potential academic paths.**
