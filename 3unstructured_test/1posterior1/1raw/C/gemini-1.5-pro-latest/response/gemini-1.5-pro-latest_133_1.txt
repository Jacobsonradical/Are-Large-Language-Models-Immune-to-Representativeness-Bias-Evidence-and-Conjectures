**Reasoning:**

While Adam's personality exhibits traits often found in computer science students (intelligence, problem-solving skills, abstract thinking), the information provided leans more heavily towards interests in nature, animals, and potentially biology or related fields. 

* **Strong indicators against computer science:**  His love for nature and animals suggests interests outside of the typical computer science domain. 
* **Neutral indicators:**  Intelligence, puzzle-solving abilities, and understanding abstract concepts are valuable in computer science but also apply to many other fields. 

**Probability Estimate:**  A 0.3 probability (30%) acknowledges the possibility of Adam being in computer science due to his intelligence and problem-solving skills. However, it leans towards a lower probability because his stated interests point more strongly towards life sciences or related areas.
