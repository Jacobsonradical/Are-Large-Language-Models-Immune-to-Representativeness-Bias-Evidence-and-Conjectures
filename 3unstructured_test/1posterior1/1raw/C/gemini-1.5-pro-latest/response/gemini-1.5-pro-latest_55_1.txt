**Reasoning:**

While Adam's personality sketch aligns with traits often found in computer science students (intelligence, problem-solving skills, abstract thinking), it also overlaps significantly with other fields:

* **Curiosity about nature and love for animals:**  Suggests possible interests in biology, ecology, veterinary medicine.
* **Warm heart and strong empathy:**  Could indicate an inclination towards fields involving social interaction and helping others. 

Therefore, a moderate probability of 0.3 (30%) is assigned to computer science. Adam's profile doesn't provide strong enough evidence to favor computer science over other fields that also align with his characteristics.
