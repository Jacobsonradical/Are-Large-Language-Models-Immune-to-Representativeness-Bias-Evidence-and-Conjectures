{
  "computer science": "0.3" 
} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description points towards someone who might enjoy the problem-solving aspects of computer science, the strong emphasis on nature, empathy, and animals suggests a stronger pull towards fields like biology, ecology, or veterinary science.  

Here's why I chose 0.3 (30% probability):

* **Supporting Factors:** 
    * "Enjoys solving puzzles" and "high intelligence" are consistent with computer science aptitude.
    * Graduate studies in the US implies an interest in potentially technical fields. 

* **Against Factors:**
    * Strong emphasis on nature, animals, and empathy suggests a greater likelihood of life sciences.
    * No mention of technology, programming, or related interests.

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative estimate.  Personality sketches offer limited information, and many other fields could also fit Adam's description.
