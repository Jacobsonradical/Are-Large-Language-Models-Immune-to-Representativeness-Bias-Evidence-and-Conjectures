**Reasoning:**

While Adam's personality sketch suggests several possible career paths, the connection to computer science is not particularly strong. 

Here's why the probability is moderate and not very high or low:

* **Supporting Arguments:**
    * **High Intelligence and Abstract Thinking:**  Computer science often attracts individuals with these traits, making this a point in favor of the probability.
    * **Puzzle Solving:**  Enjoying puzzles aligns with the problem-solving nature of computer science.

* **Neutral or Weak Arguments:**
    * **Nature and Animals:**  While some might transition from biology or related fields to computational biology or bioinformatics, this connection is not inherently strong.
    * **Empathy and Warm Heart:**  These traits are not specific to computer science and can be found in various professions.

* **Lack of Information:** The sketch doesn't mention any direct interest in technology, programming, or related areas, making it difficult to make a stronger assessment. 

**Therefore, a probability of 0.3 (30%) reflects a moderate chance that Adam was enrolled in computer science.  His traits make it a possibility, but the lack of direct links to the field prevents a higher estimation.**
