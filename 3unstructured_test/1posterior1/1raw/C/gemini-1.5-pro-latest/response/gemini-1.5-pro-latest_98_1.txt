While the description highlights traits often found in computer science students (problem-solving, abstract thinking, intelligence), it also strongly emphasizes a love for nature and animals. This suggests a reasonable chance Adam might be pursuing a biologically-oriented field. 

* **Factors Favoring Computer Science:** Problem-solving skills, abstract thinking, high intelligence.
* **Factors Against Computer Science:** Strong emphasis on nature and animals, which could point towards fields like biology, ecology, or veterinary science.

**0.3 represents a moderate probability** acknowledging the presence of factors supporting both possibilities.  It's crucial to understand this is an educated guess based on limited information.
