  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Explanation:**

While the description points towards a scientifically inclined mind, there's no direct indication Adam is specifically interested in computer science. 

Here's why the probability is set at 0.4 (moderate):

* **Positive Factors:**
    * **High intelligence and abstract thinking:**  These are traits often associated with successful computer scientists.
    * **Puzzle solving:**  This aligns well with computational thinking and problem-solving skills needed in computer science.
* **Neutral Factors:**
    * **Love for nature and animals, empathy:** These traits are not exclusive to or against an interest in computer science. 
* **Missing Information:**  The description lacks crucial information:
     * **Undergraduate major/focus:**  Did Adam study something related to computer science before?
     * **Hobbies/interests beyond nature:**  Does he engage in coding, technology, or software development in his free time?

**Therefore, a 0.4 probability represents the uncertainty. There's a decent chance, but not a strong indication without further information.**
