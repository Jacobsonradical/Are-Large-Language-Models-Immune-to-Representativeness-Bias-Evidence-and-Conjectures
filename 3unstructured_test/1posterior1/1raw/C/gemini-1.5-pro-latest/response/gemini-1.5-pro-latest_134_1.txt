  "computer science": "0.3" 
} 

**Reasoning:**

While Adam's personality sketch exhibits several traits often associated with computer science students (e.g., problem-solving, abstract thinking, high intelligence), the information provided doesn't strongly point towards it. 

Here's why:

* **Strong nature affinity:**  His love for nature and plants might suggest an inclination towards biology, environmental science, or related fields.
* **No direct tech indicators:** The sketch lacks any mention of interest in technology, programming, or computers.

**Therefore, a moderate probability of 0.3 (30%) seems reasonable. ** 

**Important Note:** Personality sketches offer limited insight into career choices. Many other factors influence graduate program decisions.
