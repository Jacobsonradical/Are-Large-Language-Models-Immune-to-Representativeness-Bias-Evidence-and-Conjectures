**Reasoning:**

While the description points towards intellectually curious and analytical, several aspects make it difficult to give a strong probability for computer science:

* **Strong nature connection:**  The emphasis on nature and animals could suggest interests in biology, ecology, or even veterinary science. 
* **No direct technical indicators:** There's no mention of coding, technology, or specific affinity for computers.
* **"Understanding hard work" is broad:**  This applies to many demanding fields, not just computer science.

**Why 0.4?**

* **High intelligence and abstract thinking:**  These are valuable in computer science, making it plausible but not guaranteed.
* **Puzzle solving:** This hints at a logical mind, which is relevant to the field.

**Overall:** Adam's profile fits several fields well.  While computer science is possible, it's not a strong prediction without more specific information.
