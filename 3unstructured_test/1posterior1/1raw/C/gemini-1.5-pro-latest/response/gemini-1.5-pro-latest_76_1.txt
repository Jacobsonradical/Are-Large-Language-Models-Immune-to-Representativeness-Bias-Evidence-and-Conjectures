  "computer science": "0.4"

**Explanation:**

While the description points towards someone who enjoys intellectual pursuits and problem-solving, common in computer science, it also heavily emphasizes a connection to nature, empathy, and a love for animals. These traits are not mutually exclusive with computer science, but they suggest alternative fields might be more likely.

Here's why 0.4 is a reasonable estimate:

* **Positive Factors:**
    * "Enjoys solving puzzles" and "high intelligence" are common traits among computer science students.
    * "Understanding abstract concepts" is crucial for computer science. 
* **Neutral Factors:**
    *  Being a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021 provides no strong indication towards or against computer science.
* **Factors Lowering Probability:**
    *  Strong emphasis on nature, empathy, and love for animals suggests fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine could be a better fit. 

**Important Note:** This assessment is based on limited information and relies on probabilities. It's impossible to determine Adam's field of study with certainty.
