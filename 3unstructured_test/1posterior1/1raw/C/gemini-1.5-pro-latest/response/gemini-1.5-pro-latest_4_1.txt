{
  "computer science": "0.3" 
} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description points towards someone analytical and intelligent, which are traits common in computer science students, it leans heavily towards interests in nature and animals.  Here's why I chose 0.3 (a moderate probability, but not high):

* **Supporting Arguments:**
    *  "Enjoys solving puzzles" and "good at understanding abstract concepts" are consistent with the problem-solving nature of computer science.
    * High intelligence is common in the field.
* **Against Arguments:**
    * Strong emphasis on "curiosity about nature," "love for animals," and appreciation for "hard work and dedication" points towards fields like biology, ecology, veterinary medicine, or even animal care.  These seem more likely given the description.

**Important Note:** This is just an educated guess based on limited information. There's not enough evidence to definitively say what Adam studied.
