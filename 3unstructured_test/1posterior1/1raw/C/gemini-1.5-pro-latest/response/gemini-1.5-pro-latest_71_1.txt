{
  "computer science": "0.3" 
} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description points towards an analytical and intelligent individual, it leans heavily towards interests compatible with biological sciences or even humanities. 

* **Curiosity about nature and plants:** This strongly suggests an interest in biology, botany, environmental science, or related fields.
* **Love for animals:**  Further strengthens the likelihood of interest in biology, zoology, or veterinary science. 
* **Quiet, enjoys puzzles, understanding abstract concepts:** While these traits can be found in computer science students, they are not unique to the field and fit many others as well.

**Therefore, a moderate probability (0.3) is assigned to computer science. While Adam's intelligence and problem-solving skills could lend themselves to the field, his core interests point more strongly towards life sciences.**
