**Explanation:**

While the description of Adam suggests a bright and curious individual who enjoys problem-solving, which are traits often found in computer science students, there's no direct indication of his interest in technology or programming. 

Here's why the probability is not very high:

* **Strong nature connection:** His love for nature and plants might indicate a preference for fields like biology, ecology, or environmental science.
* **No mention of technology:**  The description lacks any mention of computers, technology, or programming, which are central to computer science.

**However, it's not impossible:**

* **Puzzle-solving:**  His enjoyment of puzzles could translate to an interest in the logical and problem-solving aspects of computer science.
* **Abstract thinking:** His ability to grasp abstract concepts is beneficial in computer science.

**Therefore, a probability of 0.3 (30%) seems reasonable.** It acknowledges the possibility while recognizing the lack of direct evidence pointing towards computer science.
