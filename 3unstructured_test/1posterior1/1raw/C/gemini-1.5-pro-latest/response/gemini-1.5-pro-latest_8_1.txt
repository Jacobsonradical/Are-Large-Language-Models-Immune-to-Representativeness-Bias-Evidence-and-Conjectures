  "computer science": "0.3" 
} 

**Reasoning:**

While Adam's personality sketch aligns with some aspects of a computer science student (intelligence, puzzle-solving ability, abstract thinking), it lacks strong indicators typically associated with the field:

* **Direct Interest:**  There's no mention of computers, technology, programming, or related fields. His interests seem more nature-oriented.
* **Problem-Solving Style:** While puzzles are mentioned, computer science often involves a specific type of logical and computational problem-solving not explicitly highlighted.

**Factors Contributing to the 0.3 Probability:**

* **High Intelligence:** This is common in many fields, including computer science.
* **Abstract Thinking:**  Also relevant to computer science concepts. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative estimate. Personality sketches are insufficient to accurately predict someone's field of study. Many other fields could align with Adam's description, such as biology, environmental science, or even mathematics.
