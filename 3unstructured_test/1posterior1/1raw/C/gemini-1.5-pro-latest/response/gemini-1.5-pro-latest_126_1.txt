{
  "computer science": "0.3" 
} 

**Explanation:**

While the description points towards a thoughtful and analytical mind, common traits in computer science fields,  it also heavily leans towards interests in nature, animals, and potentially biology. 

Here's why the probability isn't higher:

* **Strong nature focus:** The emphasis on "genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants" and "deep love for animals" suggests potential fields like biology, ecology, or environmental science as stronger contenders. 
* **No direct tech indicators:**  The description lacks typical markers associated with computer science interests, such as a passion for technology, coding, or problem-solving using computers.

**A 0.3 probability (30%)** acknowledges the analytical aspect of Adam's personality, which could lend itself to computer science, but recognizes that the overall picture points more strongly towards life sciences.
