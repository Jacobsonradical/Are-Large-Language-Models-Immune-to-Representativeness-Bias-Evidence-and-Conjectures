**Reasoning:**

While the description paints a picture of Adam as intelligent and capable of abstract thought, which are traits often found in computer science students, it leans more heavily towards interests aligning with biology, ecology, or potentially veterinary science. 

* **Strong indicators against computer science:** "genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants," "deep love for animals."
* **Neutral indicators:** "quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles," "high intelligence," "good at understanding abstract concepts." 

Therefore, the probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science is not high, but it's not impossible.  A 0.3 probability (30%) reflects this balance, acknowledging the possibility while leaning towards alternative fields.
