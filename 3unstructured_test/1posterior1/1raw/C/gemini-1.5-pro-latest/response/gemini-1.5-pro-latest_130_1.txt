{
  "computer science": "0.3" 
}

**Explanation:**

While the description points to traits often found in computer science students (intelligence, abstract thinking, puzzle-solving), it also strongly suggests alternative fields:

* **Strong connection to nature and animals:**  This leans heavily towards biology, ecology, environmental science, or even veterinary medicine.
* **Empathy and appreciation for hard work:** These are broad traits, applicable to many fields.

**Why 0.3?**

* It's plausible Adam's interest in nature overlaps with computational biology, bioinformatics, or data science applied to environmental fields. 
*  His intelligence makes a computer science background possible, even if not the most likely scenario.

**Important Note:** This is a subjective estimate based on limited information. A more accurate prediction would require additional details about Adam's interests, experiences, and goals.
