**Explanation:**

While the description points towards an analytical and intelligent individual with an affinity for problem-solving – traits often associated with computer science students – there's a strong emphasis on nature, empathy, and animals.  

Here's why the probability is not higher:

* **Strong nature theme:** The repeated mention of nature and animals suggests fields like biology, ecology, zoology, or even veterinary medicine might be more likely. 
* **Lack of direct indicators:**  There are no explicit mentions of technology, programming, or related interests that would more strongly suggest computer science. 

**Therefore, a probability of 0.4 reflects a moderate chance of Adam being in computer science, acknowledging his analytical skills but also considering the strong pull towards natural sciences.**
