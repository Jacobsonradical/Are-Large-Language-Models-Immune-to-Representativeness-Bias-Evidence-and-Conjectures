**Reasoning:**

While the description paints a picture of Adam as intelligent and capable of abstract thought, which are common traits in computer science students, there's no direct link to the field. 

Here's why the probability is moderate, not high:

* **Missing Tech Indicators:** The description lacks typical indicators of strong computer science interest, such as programming hobbies, fascination with technology, or involvement in robotics/coding clubs. 
* **Nature Focus:**  His love for nature and plants suggests potential interests in fields like biology, environmental science, or even botany.
* **Empathy and Animals:**  The emphasis on empathy and love for animals could indicate a pull towards fields involving animal care or welfare. 

**Therefore, a 0.3 probability (30%) for computer science acknowledges the potential based on intelligence but balances it with the lack of direct evidence and the presence of other possible interests.**
