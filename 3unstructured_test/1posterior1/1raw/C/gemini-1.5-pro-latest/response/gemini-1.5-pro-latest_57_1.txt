**Explanation:**

While Adam's personality traits like high intelligence, puzzle-solving abilities, and understanding of abstract concepts could indicate an inclination towards computer science, the information provided leans more towards an affinity for nature and empathy for living beings. 

Here's why the probability is set at 0.3 (a moderate chance):

* **Supporting Arguments:**
    * **Intelligence and Problem Solving:** These are valuable traits in computer science.
    * **Abstract Thinking:**  Key for programming and understanding algorithms. 

* **Counter Arguments:**
    * **Strong Nature Affinity:**  This points towards fields like biology, ecology, environmental science, etc.
    * **Empathy and Love for Animals:**  Could suggest interests in veterinary science, zoology, or related fields.
    * **No Direct Mention of Technology:** The description lacks any indication of interest in computers, technology, or programming.

**Conclusion:**

Given the mixed signals, the probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science is not very high. The information provided suggests other fields aligning better with his personality. However, it's not impossible, as his intelligence and problem-solving skills could have led him down that path.
