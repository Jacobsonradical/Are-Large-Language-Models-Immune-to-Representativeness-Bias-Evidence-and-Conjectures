{
  "computer science": "0.3"
} 

**Explanation:**

While the description highlights traits often found in computer science students (intelligence, problem-solving skills, understanding abstract concepts), it lacks specific indicators strongly associated with the field, such as:

* **Explicit interest in technology:**  There's no mention of computers, programming, or software. 
* **Quantitative aptitude:** While intelligence is noted, there's no mention of a specific inclination towards mathematics or logic, which are fundamental to computer science. 

The description leans heavily towards an affinity for nature and animals. This suggests alternative fields like biology, zoology, or environmental science might be equally or even more probable. 

**Therefore, a probability of 0.3 (30%) for computer science reflects a moderate possibility, acknowledging the presence of some relevant traits but the absence of strong, specific indicators.**
