**Reasoning:**

While the description highlights traits often found in computer science students (intelligence, problem-solving skills, abstract thinking), it also heavily emphasizes a love for nature and animals. This suggests a strong possibility of interest in biological sciences or even veterinary medicine. 

Here's a breakdown:

* **Factors favoring computer science:** High intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, understanding of abstract concepts.
* **Factors against computer science:** Strong affinity for nature and animals, which might indicate a preference for fields like biology, ecology, or veterinary science. 

Therefore, the probability is not overwhelmingly high for computer science, but it's still significant enough to warrant a moderate probability.
