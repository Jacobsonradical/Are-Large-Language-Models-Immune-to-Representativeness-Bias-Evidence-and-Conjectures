  "computer science": "0.4"
} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description suggests someone drawn to analytical thinking and problem-solving, which aligns with computer science, there's a strong emphasis on nature and empathy. This points to potential interests in biology, environmental science, or even veterinary medicine. 

A computer science student in 2021 isn't uncommon, but the personality leans slightly more towards fields directly interacting with living things. Therefore, 0.4 represents a moderate probability, acknowledging the analytical skills while recognizing the strong affinity for the natural world.
