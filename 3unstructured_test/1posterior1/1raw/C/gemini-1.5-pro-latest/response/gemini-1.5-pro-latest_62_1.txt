**Reasoning:**

While the description points towards a thoughtful and analytical mind that could excel in computer science, several factors make it difficult to give a high probability:

* **Strong nature connection:** The emphasis on plants and animals might suggest interests more aligned with biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine. 
* **No direct technical indicators:**  The description lacks mentions of typical computer science interests like programming, technology, or problem-solving involving algorithms.
* **Warmth and empathy:**  While these traits are found in computer scientists, they are highlighted prominently, suggesting they are central to Adam's personality. This could indicate fields involving more direct interaction and helping, such as healthcare or social work. 

**Overall:** Adam's profile aligns with a scientifically inclined individual, but without more information, a 40% probability for computer science seems reasonable.  His other interests leave open a significant chance of pursuing different fields.
