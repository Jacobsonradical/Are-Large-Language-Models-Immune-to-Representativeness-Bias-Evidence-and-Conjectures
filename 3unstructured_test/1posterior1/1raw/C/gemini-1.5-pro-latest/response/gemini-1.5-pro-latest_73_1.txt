{
  "computer science": "0.3"
} 

**Explanation:**

While Adam's personality sketch doesn't directly indicate a computer science background, several factors suggest a moderate probability:

* **High intelligence and abstract thinking:** These are strong indicators for success in computer science.
* **Puzzle-solving enjoyment:** This aligns with the problem-solving nature of computer science.
* **Graduate student in the US:** The US has many prestigious computer science programs, making it a plausible field of study.

However, the lack of explicit interest in technology or programming makes it difficult to assign a higher probability. His love for nature and animals could suggest alternative interests like biology or environmental science. 

**Therefore, a probability of 0.3 represents a balanced assessment considering both the suggestive and missing information.**
