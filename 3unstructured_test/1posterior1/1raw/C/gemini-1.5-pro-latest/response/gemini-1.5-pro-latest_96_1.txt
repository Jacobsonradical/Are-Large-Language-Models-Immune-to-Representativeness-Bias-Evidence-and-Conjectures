**Explanation:**

While Adam's personality sketch suggests intelligence and an affinity for problem-solving, which are traits often found in computer science students, the information provided doesn't strongly point to that field. 

Here's why:

* **Strong nature connection:** The emphasis on nature, plants, and animals might suggest a stronger inclination towards biology, environmental science, or a related field. 
* **No tech indicators:**  There's no mention of interests like technology, programming, or computers. 
* **Abstract thinking:** While important in computer science, abstract thinking is valuable in many fields, including mathematics, physics, and philosophy.

**Probability estimate:** A 0.3 probability (30%) for computer science acknowledges the possibility, given his intelligence and problem-solving skills, but leans towards a lower likelihood due to the strong nature theme and lack of direct tech connections.
