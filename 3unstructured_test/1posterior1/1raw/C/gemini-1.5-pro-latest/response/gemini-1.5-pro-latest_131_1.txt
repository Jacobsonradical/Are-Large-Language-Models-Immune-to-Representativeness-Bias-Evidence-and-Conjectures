**Reasoning:**

While the description paints a picture of someone intelligent and capable of abstract thought, which are traits often found in computer science students, it leans heavily towards interests in nature, animals, and empathy.  

Here's why the probability isn't higher:

* **Strong nature theme:** The emphasis on nature, plants, and animals suggests interests more aligned with biology, ecology, veterinary sciences, or related fields. 
* **No direct tech indicators:** There's no mention of technology, programming, or other common computer science interests.
* **"Puzzles" can be broad:** While "enjoying puzzles" could indicate a logical mind suitable for computer science, it could also apply to many fields, including mathematics, engineering, or even artistic pursuits.

**A 40% probability acknowledges the potential for Adam to be in computer science based on his intelligence and problem-solving skills. However, the lack of direct indicators and the strong nature theme make it less likely.**
