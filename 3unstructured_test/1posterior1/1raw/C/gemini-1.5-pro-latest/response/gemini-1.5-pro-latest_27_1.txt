{
  "computer science": "0.3" 
} 

**Reasoning:**

While Adam's personality exhibits traits often associated with computer science students (intelligence, problem-solving skills, abstract thinking), the sketch leans heavily towards interests more aligned with biological sciences or veterinary medicine (love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants). 

Here's why I chose a moderate probability:

* **Intelligence and Problem-Solving:** These traits are found in many fields, not just computer science.
* **Abstract Thinking:** While important in computer science, it's also crucial in fields like biology, physics, and mathematics.
* **Lack of Strong Indicators:**  The sketch lacks specific mentions of technology, programming, or interest in computers, which would increase the probability of a computer science focus.

Therefore, a probability of 0.3 acknowledges the possibility of Adam being in computer science due to his general intellectual capabilities, but it also reflects the stronger hints towards fields related to natural sciences.
