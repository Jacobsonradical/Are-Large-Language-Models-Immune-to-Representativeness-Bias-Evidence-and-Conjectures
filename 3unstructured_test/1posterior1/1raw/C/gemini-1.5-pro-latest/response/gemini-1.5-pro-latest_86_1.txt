**Explanation:**

While the description points to several traits often found in computer science students (intelligence, problem-solving skills, abstract thinking), it also highlights a strong affinity for nature and animals. This suggests a possibility of Adam being in a field related to biology, ecology, or even veterinary science. 

Therefore, the probability of Adam being in computer science is not very high, but not negligible either. A value of **0.3** represents a moderate chance, acknowledging the possibility while considering other likely fields based on the provided information.
