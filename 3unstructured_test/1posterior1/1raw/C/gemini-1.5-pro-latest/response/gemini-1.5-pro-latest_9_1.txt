**Reasoning:**

While Adam's personality sketch suggests several potential career paths, here's why I believe there's a moderate probability of him being in computer science:

* **Puzzle Solving:**  Enjoying puzzles is a strong indicator of an analytical mind, which is crucial for computer science.
* **High Intelligence and Abstract Concepts:** Computer science often deals with complex algorithms and abstract problem-solving.
* **Appreciation for Hard Work and Dedication:**  Computer science, especially at a graduate level, requires significant dedication and effort.

**Why not higher?**

* **Nature and Animals:** The sketch highlights a strong affinity for nature and animals, suggesting potential interests in biology, ecology, or veterinary science. 

**Important Note:** This is just an educated guess based on a limited personality sketch. Many other fields could be equally or even more likely for Adam.
