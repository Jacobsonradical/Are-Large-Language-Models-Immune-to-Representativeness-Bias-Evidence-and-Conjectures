  "computer science": "0.3"

**Reasoning:**

While Adam's profile aligns with some aspects of a computer science student (intelligence, problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts), there's no direct indication of an interest in technology or programming. 

Here's why the probability isn't higher:

* **Strong nature focus:** His passion for nature and animals might suggest a stronger inclination toward biology, environmental science, or a related field.
* **Empathy and warm heart:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, are often associated with more people-oriented professions.

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative estimate.  Personality sketches provide limited information, and many other fields could also fit Adam's profile.
