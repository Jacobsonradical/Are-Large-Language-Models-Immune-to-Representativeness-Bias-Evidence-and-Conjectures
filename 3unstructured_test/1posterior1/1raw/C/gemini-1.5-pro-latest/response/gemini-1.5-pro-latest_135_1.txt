**Explanation:**

While the description highlights intelligence, problem-solving skills, and an affinity for abstract concepts, which are relevant to computer science, it leans more heavily towards interests often associated with biological sciences or related fields. 

* **Curiosity about nature and plants:** This points directly towards fields like botany, ecology, or environmental science. 
* **Love for animals:** This could suggest an interest in zoology, veterinary medicine, or animal behavior. 

**Why not a higher probability?**

The description lacks specific indicators commonly associated with computer science interests, such as:

*  Interest in technology, programming, or software.
*  Mention of building or creating things, particularly in a digital context. 

**Therefore, a probability of 0.3 (30%) for computer science seems reasonable. This acknowledges the potential, given his intelligence and problem-solving aptitude, while recognizing the stronger indicators pointing towards life sciences.**
