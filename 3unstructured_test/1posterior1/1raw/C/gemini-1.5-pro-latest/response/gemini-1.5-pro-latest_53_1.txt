**Explanation:**

While Adam's personality traits like high intelligence, puzzle-solving ability, and understanding of abstract concepts suggest a predisposition towards computer science, the information provided leans towards interests in nature and animals.  

Here's why the probability isn't higher:

* **Strong nature affinity:** The description emphasizes his curiosity about nature and love for animals. This suggests potential fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine.
* **No direct tech indicators:**  There's no mention of interest in technology, programming, or computers. 
* **Graduate student demographics:** While many computer science students exist, other fields also have significant graduate student populations.

**Therefore, a probability of 0.3 reflects a moderate chance of Adam being in computer science, acknowledging the possibility but not favoring it heavily based on the provided information.**
