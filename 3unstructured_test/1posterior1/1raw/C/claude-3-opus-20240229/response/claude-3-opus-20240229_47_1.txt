Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

While Adam has traits that could be compatible with studying computer science, such as high intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and ability to understand abstract concepts, the sketch focuses more on his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. These traits seem more aligned with fields such as biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine. Therefore, I estimate a 30% probability that he was enrolled specifically in computer science. More details about his undergraduate major and academic interests would help refine this estimate.
