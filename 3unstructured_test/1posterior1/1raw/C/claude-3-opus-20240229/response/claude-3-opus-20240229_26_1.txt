Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have interests and traits more aligned with fields like biology, zoology, or perhaps psychology rather than computer science. His curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and empathy suggest he may be drawn to life sciences. The mention of enjoying puzzles and understanding abstract concepts could fit with computer science to some degree. However, overall the details provided don't strongly point to computer science as the most likely field, so I estimate a relatively low 20% probability that he was enrolled in that particular graduate program.
