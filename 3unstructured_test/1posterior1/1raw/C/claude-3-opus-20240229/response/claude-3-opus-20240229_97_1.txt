Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature, enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts could align well with studying computer science. However, the description also mentions empathy, love for animals, and appreciation of hard work, which could point to other fields as well. Without more specific information about Adam's interests and aptitudes, I estimate a 60% probability that he was a computer science graduate student, leaving a 40% chance he was studying a different field.
