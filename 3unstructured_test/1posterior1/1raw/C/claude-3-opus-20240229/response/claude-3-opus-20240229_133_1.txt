Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have interests and traits that could align with various fields of graduate study. His curiosity about nature and plants, love of animals, and empathy suggest possible interest in fields like biology, ecology, veterinary medicine, or psychology. His intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of puzzles could point to fields like mathematics, physics, or philosophy.

The description doesn't provide strong evidence that computer science is Adam's most likely field of study. While computer science does involve problem-solving and abstract thinking, which could appeal to Adam, his primary interests seem to lie elsewhere. However, I wouldn't rule it out entirely.

Of course, this is a very rough estimate based on limited information. Many additional factors would influence Adam's choice of graduate program that aren't captured in this brief personality sketch.
