Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Given his interests in nature, plants, animals, and abstract concepts, along with no mention of technology or math, I estimate there is only a moderate probability that Adam was studying computer science specifically. His intelligence and puzzle-solving skills are compatible with computer science, but his other traits point more toward fields like biology, environmental science, or perhaps psychology. Of course, this is only a rough estimate based on limited information about his personality and interests.
