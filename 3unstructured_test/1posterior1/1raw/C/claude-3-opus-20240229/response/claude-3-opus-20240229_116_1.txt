Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

While Adam's high intelligence and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts could lend themselves well to computer science, the personality sketch focuses more on his curiosity about nature, love of animals, and empathy. These traits seem to point more towards fields like biology, zoology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine rather than computer science. However, there is still some possibility he could be studying computer science. My rough estimate is a 20% probability, but there is considerable uncertainty based on the limited information provided.
