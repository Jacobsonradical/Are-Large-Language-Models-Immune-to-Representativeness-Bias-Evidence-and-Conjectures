Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has traits and interests that could be compatible with various fields of graduate study, such as biology, ecology, psychology, mathematics, or computer science. His curiosity about nature and love of animals might point towards biology or ecology. His aptitude for puzzles and abstract concepts could fit well with mathematics, computer science, or certain areas of psychology. However, the description does not provide strong, direct evidence that he was specifically studying computer science. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.3 that computer science was his field of graduate study, based solely on the information provided. More details about his specific academic background and technical skills would be needed to assign a higher probability to computer science in particular.
