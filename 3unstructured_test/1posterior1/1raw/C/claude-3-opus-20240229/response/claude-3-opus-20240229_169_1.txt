Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have interests and traits that could align with various fields of graduate study. His curiosity about nature and plants, along with his warm heart and empathy, could point to fields like biology, ecology, or environmental science. His enjoyment of solving puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts suggests he has strong analytical and problem-solving skills which could lend themselves to quantitative fields. However, the description does not provide any definitive information indicating computer science specifically.

Without more details about his academic background, research interests, or stated career goals, I do not have enough evidence to assign more than a 30% probability to him studying computer science. Many other graduate fields remain strong possibilities based on the limited information given.
