Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests Adam has interests and traits that could align with various fields of graduate study, such as biology, zoology, psychology, or mathematics. His curiosity about nature and love of animals could point to life sciences. Being good at understanding abstract concepts and solving puzzles could fit with math, computer science, or other technical fields. However, computer science is not directly implied, so I estimate a 30% probability based on the limited information provided. More details about his specific academic interests and undergraduate background would help narrow down the probability further.
