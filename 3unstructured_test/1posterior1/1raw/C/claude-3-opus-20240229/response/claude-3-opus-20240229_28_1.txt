Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has traits and interests that could be compatible with various fields of graduate study, such as biology, psychology, veterinary medicine, or animal behavior. His curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and empathy point more towards life sciences or animal-related fields.

While his intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could suit computer science, the sketch does not provide strong direct evidence of specific interest or skills in that area. Problem-solving skills are applicable across many domains.

Therefore, while it's certainly possible Adam studied computer science, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.2 based solely on the information provided. More details about his specific technical interests and abilities would be needed to assign a higher likelihood to computer science.
