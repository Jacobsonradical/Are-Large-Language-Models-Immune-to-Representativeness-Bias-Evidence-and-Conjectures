Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have interests and traits that could align with various fields of graduate study, including but not limited to computer science. His curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving skills and ability to grasp abstract concepts suggest an aptitude for STEM fields in general. However, his strong empathy, love of nature and animals could also point to studies in life sciences, environmental science, veterinary medicine, psychology or other areas. The information given is not definitive enough to conclude he was likely a computer science student. Therefore, I estimate a 30% probability that computer science was his specific field of graduate study in 2021.
