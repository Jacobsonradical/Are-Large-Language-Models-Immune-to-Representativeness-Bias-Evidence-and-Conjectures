Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have interests and traits that could align with various fields of graduate study. His curiosity about nature and plants, love of animals, and empathy suggest possible interest in biology, ecology, veterinary medicine, or environmental science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could lend themselves to math, physics, or philosophy. His appreciation of hard work and dedication is a positive trait for graduate school in general.

While it's certainly possible Adam studied computer science, I don't see strong direct evidence pointing to that field based solely on the given description. Computer science could relate to his interest in puzzle-solving and abstract concepts. However, the bio seems to emphasize his curiosity about the natural world more than technology.

Without more specific information about Adam's undergraduate background or other interests, I estimate only a 20% chance he was a computer science grad student based on the details provided. Many other fields seem similarly or more probable given his profile. But this is a rough guess without much certainty. More academic and career-related details about Adam would help narrow down the possibilities.
