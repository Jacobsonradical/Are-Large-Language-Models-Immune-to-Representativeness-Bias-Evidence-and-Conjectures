Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021 as a graduate student in the U.S., based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits that could be compatible with various fields of graduate study, such as biology, zoology, psychology, or even certain areas of computer science. However, the description does not provide strong direct evidence that computer science is his chosen field. His curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and empathy point more towards life sciences or psychology. Problem solving skills and understanding of abstract concepts are applicable across many disciplines. Therefore, while it's certainly possible Adam studies computer science, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.2 based solely on the given information.
