Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"

While Adam's high intelligence, aptitude for understanding abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles could lend themselves well to studying computer science, his deep interest in nature, plants and animals makes me think he is more likely to have pursued a field related to the natural sciences or biology. However, I cannot rule out computer science entirely based on the information provided, so I estimate a 30% chance he was enrolled in that field.
