Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have interests and traits that could align with various fields of graduate study, including but not limited to computer science. His curiosity, intelligence, and aptitude for abstract concepts and problem-solving could lend themselves well to computer science. However, his strong interests in nature, animals, empathy and appreciation for hard work and dedication could also point to fields like biology, zoology, psychology, or even humanities and social sciences. Without more specific information about his undergraduate background and stated interests, it's difficult to assign a high probability to any one field. Therefore, I estimate a 30% chance that he was enrolled in computer science specifically, allowing for the significant possibility that he was in a different graduate program.
