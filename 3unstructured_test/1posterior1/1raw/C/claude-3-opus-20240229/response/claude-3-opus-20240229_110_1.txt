Here is my estimate:

{
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have interests and strengths more aligned with fields like biology, zoology, or veterinary science given his curiosity about nature and plants, love of animals, and empathy. Computer science is certainly a possibility for an intelligent person good at abstract thinking and problem-solving, but the bio indicates other fields may be a better fit for his specific interests. Without more information about his academic background or stated interests, I'd estimate only a modest 20% chance he was studying computer science specifically as a graduate student in 2021.
