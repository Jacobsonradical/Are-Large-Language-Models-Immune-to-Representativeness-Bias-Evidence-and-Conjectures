Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have interests and traits that could align with various fields of graduate study, such as biology, ecology, psychology, mathematics, or philosophy. While an interest in abstract concepts and problem-solving could suggest computer science as a possibility, the sketch emphasizes more his curiosity about nature, plants, animals and his empathetic personality, which I think make natural sciences a more likely area of study for him. However, without more specific information about his academic background and research interests, it's difficult to estimate the probability of him being in computer science with high confidence. So I assign a relatively low probability of 0.2 based on the limited information provided.
