Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has traits and interests that could align with various fields of graduate study, such as biology, environmental science, psychology, veterinary medicine, or even philosophy. While his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could lend themselves to computer science, the sketch does not provide strong direct evidence of a specific interest or aptitude for that particular field. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.2 that he was enrolled in computer science based solely on the information provided.
