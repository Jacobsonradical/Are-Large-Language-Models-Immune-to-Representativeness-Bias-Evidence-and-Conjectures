Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have interests and traits that could align with various fields of graduate study, including but not limited to computer science. His curiosity, problem-solving skills, intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he could do well in a technical field like CS. However, his love of nature, animals, and puzzles point to potential interest in other areas as well, such as biology, ecology, veterinary medicine, or mathematics. The information provided does not strongly indicate computer science over other possible fields. Therefore, without more specific information about his academic background and interests, I estimate a 30% probability that he was enrolled in a computer science graduate program in 2021.
