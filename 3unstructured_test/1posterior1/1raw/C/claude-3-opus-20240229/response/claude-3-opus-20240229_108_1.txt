Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has strong interests in nature, animals, and abstract concepts. It also mentions he is intelligent and has an appreciation for hard work. However, it does not specifically indicate a strong interest or aptitude for computer science. Therefore, while it's certainly possible he could have been studying computer science, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.2 based solely on the information provided. Additional details about his specific academic interests and abilities would help refine this estimate.
