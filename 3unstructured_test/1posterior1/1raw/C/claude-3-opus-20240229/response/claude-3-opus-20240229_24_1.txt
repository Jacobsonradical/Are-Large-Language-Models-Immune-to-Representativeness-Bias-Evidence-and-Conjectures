Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Given his high intelligence, aptitude for understanding abstract concepts, and interest in problem-solving, there is a fairly good chance Adam may have pursued graduate studies in computer science. However, without more specific information about his academic background and interests, I cannot say definitively. His love of nature and animals suggests he could have also been drawn to fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine. So while computer science seems like a reasonable possibility, I estimate the probability at 0.6 rather than higher.
