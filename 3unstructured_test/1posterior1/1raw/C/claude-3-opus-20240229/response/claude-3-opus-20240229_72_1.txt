Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts, could potentially fit with many different fields of graduate study. While an interest in puzzles and abstraction could relate to computer science, the strong emphasis on curiosity about plants and animals leads me to believe fields like biology, environmental science, or zoology could be more likely. Therefore, I estimate a 30% probability of computer science based solely on the limited information provided, but I think other fields are more probable given Adam's described interests and traits.
