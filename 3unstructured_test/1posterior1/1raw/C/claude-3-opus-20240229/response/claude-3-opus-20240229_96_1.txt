Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021 given the personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.15"
}

Based on the description, Adam seems to have interests and traits that could align with a variety of fields including biology, zoology, veterinary medicine, psychology, philosophy, or certain areas of computer science. His curiosity about nature and love of animals suggests possible biological fields of study. Problem solving skills and abstract thinking abilities could point to computer science, math, or certain sciences. However, the sketch does not mention any specific technical or programming interests that would strongly indicate computer science. Therefore, while it's possible Adam studied CS, I estimate a relatively low 15% probability based solely on the given information. More details about his specific academic interests and skills would help narrow down the field of study with greater confidence.
