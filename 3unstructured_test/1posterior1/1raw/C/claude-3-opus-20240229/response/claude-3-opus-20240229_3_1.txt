Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch does not provide strong evidence that Adam was likely to be enrolled in computer science specifically. While it indicates he is intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, which could align with computer science, his main interests seem to be nature, plants, puzzles, and animals. The sketch does not mention anything directly related to computers, programming, math or other traits that would strongly suggest computer science. Therefore, while it's certainly possible he studied computer science, I estimate only a 20% probability based solely on the information provided.
