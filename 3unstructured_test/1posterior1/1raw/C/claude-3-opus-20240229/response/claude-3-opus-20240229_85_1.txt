Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, problem-solving, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts could align with studying computer science. However, the strong interest in nature, plants, animals and empathy are less directly related. Given the limited information, I estimate a 40% probability that computer science was his field of graduate study, but there is substantial uncertainty around this estimate. More details about his specific academic interests and aptitudes would be needed for a more definitive assessment.
