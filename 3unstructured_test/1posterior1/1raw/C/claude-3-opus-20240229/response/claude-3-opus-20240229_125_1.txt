Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

The sketch does not mention any specific interest or aptitude for computers, programming, or technology. While computer science can involve abstract problem-solving which may appeal to Adam, his primary interests seem to be nature, plants, animals, and hard work. This suggests a relatively low probability of around 0.2 that he was studying computer science. Of course, without more specific information about his academic pursuits, this is only a rough estimate.
