Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has traits and interests that could be compatible with studying computer science, such as high intelligence, aptitude for understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles. However, the sketch also prominently mentions Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, as well as his love for animals. This suggests he may have been more inclined to study a field related to the natural sciences or biology. Of course, it's possible to have strong interests in both nature and computer science.

Without more specific information about Adam's academic background, skills, and stated interests, it's difficult to estimate with high confidence. Based on the limited information provided, I estimate a 30% probability that Adam was a graduate student in computer science in 2021.
