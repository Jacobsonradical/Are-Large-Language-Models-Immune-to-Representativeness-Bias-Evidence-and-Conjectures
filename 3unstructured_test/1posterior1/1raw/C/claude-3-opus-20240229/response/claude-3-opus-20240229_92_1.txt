Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

While Adam has qualities that could align with studying computer science, such as high intelligence, being good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles, the sketch also emphasizes his love of nature, animals, empathy and appreciation for hard work. These latter traits seem less directly relevant to computer science. Therefore, while it's certainly possible Adam studied CS, I don't see the personality description as providing especially strong evidence to suggest a high probability of that particular field of study.
