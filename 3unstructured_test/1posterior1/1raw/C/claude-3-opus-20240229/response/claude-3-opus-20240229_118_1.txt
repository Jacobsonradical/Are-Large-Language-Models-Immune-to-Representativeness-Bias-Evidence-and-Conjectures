Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

While Adam has traits that could align with computer science such as enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts, the sketch focuses more on his interest in nature, animals, and his empathetic personality rather than technical or mathematical aspects. Therefore, I estimate a 30% probability of him studying computer science based solely on the information provided, but there is significant uncertainty without more details about his specific academic interests and strengths.
