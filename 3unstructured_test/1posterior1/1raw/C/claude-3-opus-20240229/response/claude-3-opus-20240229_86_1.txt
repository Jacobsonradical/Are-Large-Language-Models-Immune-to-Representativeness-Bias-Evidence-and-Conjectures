Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts, could align with a variety of fields. While they could fit with computer science to some degree, there are no strong indications that specifically point to computer science over other possible graduate fields like biology, mathematics, psychology, or various others. Therefore, I estimate a 30% probability but there is considerable uncertainty based on the limited information provided.
