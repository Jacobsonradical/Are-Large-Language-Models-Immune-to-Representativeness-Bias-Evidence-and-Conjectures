Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science as a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, enjoyment of puzzles, empathy, and intelligence, could fit a variety of fields. While an aptitude for understanding abstract concepts could relate to computer science, the strong interest in nature, plants and animals seems to point more toward fields like biology, environmental science, zoology, etc. The description doesn't provide any clear indication of an interest or skill set specific to computer science. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low 20% probability that computer science was his field of graduate study based solely on the information provided.
