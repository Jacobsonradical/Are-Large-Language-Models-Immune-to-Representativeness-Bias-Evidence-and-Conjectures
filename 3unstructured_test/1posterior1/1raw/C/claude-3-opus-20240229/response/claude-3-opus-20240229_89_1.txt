Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

While Adam's high intelligence and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts could suit a computer science field, his strong interests in nature, plants, animals, and puzzles seem more aligned with other fields such as biology, ecology, zoology, or perhaps mathematics. The personality sketch does not provide any direct indication of an interest in or aptitude for computer science specifically. Therefore, I estimate a 30% probability that he was enrolled in a computer science graduate program.
