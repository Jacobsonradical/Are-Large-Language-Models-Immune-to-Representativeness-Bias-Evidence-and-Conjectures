Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits that could align with various fields of graduate study, such as biology, psychology, veterinary medicine, or even philosophy. While it's possible he studied computer science, as the field can involve abstract concepts and problem-solving, the description doesn't provide strong evidence to suggest computer science is the most likely field. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.2 that he was enrolled in a computer science graduate program.
