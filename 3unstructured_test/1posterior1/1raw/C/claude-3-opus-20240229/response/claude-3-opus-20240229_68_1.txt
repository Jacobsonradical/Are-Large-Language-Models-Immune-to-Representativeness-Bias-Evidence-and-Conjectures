Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and abstract thinking, do not strongly indicate enrollment in computer science specifically. While computer science can involve abstract concepts, the other traits point more towards fields like biology, zoology, environmental science, or psychology. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low 20% probability that Adam was a computer science graduate student based solely on the information provided.
