Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

While Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles could potentially align with studying computer science, the sketch focuses more on his interest in nature, plants, animals, and his empathetic personality. These traits seem less directly correlated with computer science compared to some other possible fields. Therefore, I estimate a probability of 0.3 that he was enrolled in computer science specifically, based solely on the information provided.
