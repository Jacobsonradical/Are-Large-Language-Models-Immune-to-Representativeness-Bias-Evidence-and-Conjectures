Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.25"
}

Given Adam's personality traits of curiosity, empathy, love of nature and animals, and ability to grasp abstract concepts, there are many graduate fields he could have been drawn to, such as biology, environmental science, veterinary medicine, mathematics, or various humanities in addition to computer science. While an aptitude for puzzles and abstract thinking could lend itself well to computer science, the other details point to a fairly broad range of potential interests. Without more specific information about his undergraduate background or stated career interests, I estimate a modest 25% probability that he specifically chose computer science for graduate study.
