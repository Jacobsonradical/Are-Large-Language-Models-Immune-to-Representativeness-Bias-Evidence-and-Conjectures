Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits that could be suitable for various fields of graduate study, such as biology, psychology, mathematics, or even animal science. While his intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could lend themselves well to computer science, the sketch does not provide strong direct evidence that points to computer science as his most likely field of study. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.2 that he was enrolled in computer science specifically.
