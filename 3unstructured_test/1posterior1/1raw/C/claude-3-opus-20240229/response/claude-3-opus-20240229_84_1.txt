Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

While Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could align with studying computer science, his strong interests in nature, plants, animals and puzzles don't necessarily point to that specific field. Computer science is certainly a possibility but the information provided doesn't strongly indicate it over other potential fields. More details about his specific academic interests and strengths would help narrow down the probability further.
