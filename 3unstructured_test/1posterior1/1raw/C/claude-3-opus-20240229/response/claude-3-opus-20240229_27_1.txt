Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts, could fit with many different fields of graduate study. While an interest in puzzles and abstract concepts could potentially align with computer science, the strong emphasis on curiosity about nature, plants, animals, and empathy suggests fields in the natural sciences or possibly psychology may be more likely. Without more specific information indicating an interest in computing or technology, computer science seems possible but not the most probable field given the details provided. Therefore, I estimate a 30% probability of computer science based on the limited information available in the personality sketch.
