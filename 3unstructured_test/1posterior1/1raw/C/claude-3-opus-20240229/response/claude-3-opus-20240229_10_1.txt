Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests Adam has interests and traits that could be suitable for various fields, such as biology, psychology, veterinary medicine, or animal science. His curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and empathy point more towards those domains.

While he is described as highly intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, which could be applicable to computer science, the sketch does not specifically mention an interest or aptitude for programming, technology, or mathematics. Therefore, based solely on the given information, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.3 that he was enrolled in computer science.
