Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have interests and traits that could align with a variety of fields, including life sciences, psychology, veterinary medicine, or even more abstract disciplines like mathematics or philosophy. While computer science is certainly a possibility given his intelligence and aptitude for puzzles and abstract concepts, the information provided does not strongly point to that specific field over others. Therefore, I estimate a 30% probability that he was enrolled in computer science, acknowledging the significant uncertainty based on the limited information available.
