Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits that could be compatible with various fields of graduate study, such as biology, psychology, mathematics, or even certain humanities or social science disciplines. While an aptitude for understanding abstract concepts could lend itself well to computer science, the sketch does not provide strong specific evidence that points to computer science over other possibilities. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.2 that he was enrolled in a computer science graduate program.
