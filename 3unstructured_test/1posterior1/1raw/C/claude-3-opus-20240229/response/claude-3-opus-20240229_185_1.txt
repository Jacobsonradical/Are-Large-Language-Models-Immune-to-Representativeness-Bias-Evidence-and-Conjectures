Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests Adam has interests and traits that could be suited for various fields, such as biology, psychology, veterinary science, or mathematics. His curiosity about nature and plants, along with his love for animals, may point more towards biology or veterinary science. His empathy and warm heart could fit with psychology or similar fields. Problem solving skills and understanding of abstract concepts could indicate an aptitude for math, computer science, or other STEM fields. 

However, computer science is not directly implied by the description. It's certainly possible Adam studied CS, but I don't see it as the most likely field given his apparent interests in nature, plants, animals, and abstract thinking. Therefore, I estimate a 30% probability that he specifically studied computer science in graduate school in 2021 based solely on the personality sketch provided. More information about his undergraduate degree, technical skills, and career goals would help refine the estimate.
