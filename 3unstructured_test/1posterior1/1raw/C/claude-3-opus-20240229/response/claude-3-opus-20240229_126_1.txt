Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, problem-solving, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts could lend themselves well to graduate studies in computer science. However, the strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy are less directly related. So while computer science seems like a reasonably probable field of study given Adam's profile, I don't have extremely high confidence in that specific guess, hence the probability estimate of 0.6.
