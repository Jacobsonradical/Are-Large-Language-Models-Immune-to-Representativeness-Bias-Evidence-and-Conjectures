Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021 based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests Adam has interests and traits that could align with various fields of graduate study, including biology, psychology, veterinary medicine, or computer science. His curiosity about nature and love of animals might point more towards biology or veterinary studies. However, his intelligence, abstract thinking skills, and enjoyment of puzzles could lend themselves well to computer science.

Without more specific information about his undergraduate background or stated career interests, it's difficult to assign a high probability to any particular field. Computer science seems a reasonable possibility based on the limited information provided, but many other fields could also be likely. Therefore, I've estimated a 30% probability of computer science, allowing for the significant possibility of other fields as well.
