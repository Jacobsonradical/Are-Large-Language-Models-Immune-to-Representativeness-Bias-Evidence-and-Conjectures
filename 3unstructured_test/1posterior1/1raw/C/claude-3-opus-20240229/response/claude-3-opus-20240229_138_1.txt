Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have interests and traits that could align with a variety of fields, including biology, psychology, veterinary science, or other sciences. His curiosity about nature and love of animals suggests possible interests in life sciences or zoology. The mention of his ability to understand abstract concepts and solve puzzles could point to fields like mathematics or physics as well. 

While computer science is certainly a possibility given his high intelligence, the sketch does not provide any specific indication of skills or interests directly related to CS, such as programming, algorithms, software engineering, etc. Therefore, without more information to go on, I estimate a 30% probability that computer science was his chosen field of graduate study.
