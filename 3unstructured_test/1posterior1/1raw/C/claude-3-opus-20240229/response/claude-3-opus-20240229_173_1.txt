Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

While Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles could align with studying computer science, the sketch emphasizes more his curiosity about nature, plants and animals. This suggests to me he may have been more likely to study a field like biology, ecology, or zoology rather than computer science. However, the information provided is limited, so I have estimated a 30% probability that he studied computer science.
