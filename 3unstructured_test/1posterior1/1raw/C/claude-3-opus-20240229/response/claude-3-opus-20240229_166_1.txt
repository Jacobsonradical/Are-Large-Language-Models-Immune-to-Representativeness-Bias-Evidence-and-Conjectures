Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have interests and traits that could align with various fields of graduate study. His curiosity about nature and plants, as well as his love for animals, could point to studies in biology, ecology, environmental science, or related fields. His skills in puzzles and abstract thinking could lend themselves to math, physics, engineering, or computer science. And his empathy and appreciation for hard work could fit with humanities and social science fields.

Given the information provided, I estimate a 30% chance he studied computer science specifically. While it's certainly possible, I don't see anything that clearly points to CS over other potential fields. More details about his specific academic interests, undergraduate major, career goals, etc. would help narrow down the probability further.
