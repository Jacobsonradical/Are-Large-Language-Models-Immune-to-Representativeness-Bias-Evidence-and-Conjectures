Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have interests and traits that could align with various fields of graduate study. His curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and empathy suggest possible interest in biology, ecology, veterinary medicine, or environmental science. His intelligence, aptitude for abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving point to potential fit with math, physics, engineering, or computer science. 

However, the description does not provide any definitive indication that computer science is his field. The 0.3 probability I estimated reflects that while his traits are potentially compatible with computer science, there are also many other graduate fields that could be a good match based on the information given. More details about his specific academic background, skills, and stated interests would help narrow down the field probabilities further.
