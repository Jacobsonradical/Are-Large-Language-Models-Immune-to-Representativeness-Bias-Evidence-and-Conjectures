Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science as a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch indicates that Adam has high intelligence, is good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoys solving puzzles. These traits could align well with studying computer science. However, the sketch also emphasizes Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, his love for animals, and his empathy, which could suggest an interest in fields like biology, ecology, or veterinary medicine. Given the limited information provided, I estimate a 60% probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science, but there is considerable uncertainty around this estimate.
