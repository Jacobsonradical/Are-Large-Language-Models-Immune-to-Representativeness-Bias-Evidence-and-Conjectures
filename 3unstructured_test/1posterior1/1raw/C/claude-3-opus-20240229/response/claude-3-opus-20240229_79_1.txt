Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, problem-solving ability, intelligence, and facility with abstract concepts are quite consistent with studying computer science. However, the strong interest in nature and animals hints at possible other fields of study like biology. Without more specifics on his academic background and interests, I estimate a 60% probability that computer science was his field of graduate study.
