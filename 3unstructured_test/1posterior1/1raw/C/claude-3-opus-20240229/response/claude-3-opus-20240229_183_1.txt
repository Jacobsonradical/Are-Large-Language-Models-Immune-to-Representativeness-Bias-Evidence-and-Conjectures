Here is my estimate for the probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and empathy suggest fields more aligned with life sciences or zoology rather than computer science. Problem solving and understanding abstract concepts could fit with computer science to some degree. However, overall the description does not strongly indicate computer science as the most likely graduate field compared to other possibilities. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low 20% probability that computer science was his field of graduate study in 2021 based solely on the personality sketch provided.
