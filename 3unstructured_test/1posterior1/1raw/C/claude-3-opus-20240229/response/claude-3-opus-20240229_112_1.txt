Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts, could fit with many different fields of graduate study. While they could apply to computer science, there are no specific indicators that point strongly to that field over others. Love of animals and nature could suggest fields like biology, zoology, botany, or environmental science. Strong empathy often fits with fields like psychology, sociology, or medicine. Dedication and hard work are general positive traits for graduate students across disciplines. Without more specific information tying Adam's interests directly to computers or technology, computer science doesn't stand out as a highly probable choice based solely on the given description. So I estimate a 30% chance, acknowledging it's a possibility but far from a certainty given the limited information provided.
