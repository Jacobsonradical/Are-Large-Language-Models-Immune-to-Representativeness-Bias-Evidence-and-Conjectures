Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"

Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have interests and aptitudes that could suit a variety of fields, including but not limited to computer science. His curiosity, intelligence, and puzzle-solving interest suggest he may enjoy a STEM field, but his love for nature, animals, and abstract concepts could draw him to other areas as well. Without more specific information about his academic background and career goals, I estimate a modest 30% probability that he studied computer science specifically, allowing for the significant possibility that he pursued graduate studies in another discipline.
