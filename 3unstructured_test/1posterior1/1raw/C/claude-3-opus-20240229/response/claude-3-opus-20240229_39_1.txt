Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have interests and traits that could align with various fields of graduate study, including but not limited to computer science. His curiosity, problem-solving skills, intelligence and ability to grasp abstract concepts suggest an aptitude for STEM fields. However, his strong empathy, love of nature and animals could also point to studies in life sciences, environmental science, veterinary medicine, psychology or other fields. The information provided is not definitive enough to say computer science is the most likely field with high confidence. A probability estimate of 0.3 reflects that computer science is a reasonable possibility given his profile, but far from certain without additional information about his specific interests and undergraduate background.
