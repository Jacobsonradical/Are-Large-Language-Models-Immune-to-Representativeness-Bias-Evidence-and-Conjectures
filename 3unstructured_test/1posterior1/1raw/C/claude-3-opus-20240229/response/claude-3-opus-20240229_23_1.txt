Based on the personality sketch provided, here is my estimate:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

While Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could be applicable to computer science, his interests seem to align more with fields related to nature, plants, and animals. His quiet demeanor and love for solving puzzles also do not strongly indicate a preference for computer science. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.3 that Adam was enrolled in computer science as a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021.
