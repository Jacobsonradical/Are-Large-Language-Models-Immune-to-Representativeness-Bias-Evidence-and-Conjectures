Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.35"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity, problem-solving, intelligence and understanding abstract concepts, could align with studying computer science. However, the strong interest in nature, plants, animals and empathy are not as directly relevant to computer science. Therefore, while it's certainly possible Adam studied CS, I don't assess a greater than 50% probability based solely on the information provided. My rough estimate is that there is a 35% chance he was a CS grad student.
