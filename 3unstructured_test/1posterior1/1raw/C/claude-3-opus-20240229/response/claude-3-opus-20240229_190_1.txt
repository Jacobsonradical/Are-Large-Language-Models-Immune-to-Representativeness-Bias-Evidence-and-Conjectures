Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"

While Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could lend themselves well to computer science, his primary interests seem to lie more in the natural world, biology, and perhaps fields like zoology, botany, ecology or environmental science. The personality sketch emphasizes his curiosity about nature and plants, as well as his love for animals, more so than an interest in computing or technology. However, there is still some possibility he could have pursued computer science given his intellectual capabilities.
