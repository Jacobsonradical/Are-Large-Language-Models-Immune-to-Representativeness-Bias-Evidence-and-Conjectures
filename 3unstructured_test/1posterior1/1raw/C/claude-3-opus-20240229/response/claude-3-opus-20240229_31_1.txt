Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love of animals, and appreciation for hard work, do not strongly indicate enrollment in computer science specifically. While computer science requires intelligence and abstract thinking skills which Adam possesses, the other details point more towards potential interests in fields like biology, psychology, or veterinary medicine. Of course, it's certainly possible Adam could be a computer science student, but based solely on the limited information provided, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.3.
