Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have qualities and interests that could align with various fields of graduate study. His curiosity about nature and plants, as well as his love for animals, could suggest studies in biology, ecology, botany, or zoology. His aptitude for understanding abstract concepts and solving puzzles could point to mathematics, physics, or even philosophy. 

While computer science is certainly a possibility given his high intelligence, the sketch does not provide strong direct evidence of specific interest or skills in that particular field. Computer science could allow him to apply his intelligence and problem-solving in a technical domain, but the other details provided point me more towards estimating he is likely in a science field related to nature and living things. 

Of course, with the limited information provided, it's difficult to assess with much certainty. He very well could be a computer science student. But if I had to estimate a probability based solely on the personality sketch, I'd put it around 30%, with academic fields related to natural science being somewhat more likely.
