Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have interests and traits that could align with various fields of graduate study, such as biology, psychology, veterinary science, or mathematics. While his intelligence and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts could lend themselves to computer science, the sketch does not provide strong direct evidence that points to computer science specifically. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.3 that he was a computer science graduate student.
