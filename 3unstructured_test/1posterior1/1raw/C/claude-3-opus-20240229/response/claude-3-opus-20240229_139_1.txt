Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

While Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles could align well with studying computer science, the personality sketch focuses more on his love of nature, animals, empathy and appreciation for hard work. It does not provide strong direct evidence that he was likely enrolled specifically in computer science as a graduate student. Therefore, I estimate a 30% probability based on the limited information provided.
