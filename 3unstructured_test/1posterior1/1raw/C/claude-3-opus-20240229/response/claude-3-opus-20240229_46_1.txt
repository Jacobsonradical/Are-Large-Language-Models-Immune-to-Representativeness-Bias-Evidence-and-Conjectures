Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts, could align with a variety of fields. While they could fit with computer science to some degree, there are no strong indicators that specifically point to that field of study. The sketch mentions more of an affinity for nature, animals, and hard work rather than technology or programming. Therefore, I estimate a 30% probability that Adam was studying computer science based solely on the information provided.
