Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has traits and interests that could align with various fields of graduate study, such as biology, zoology, psychology, or even philosophy. While his intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could lend themselves to computer science, the sketch does not provide strong direct evidence of a specific interest or aptitude in that particular field. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.3 that he was enrolled in computer science, allowing for the significant possibility that he was studying in another area that aligns with his curiosity about nature, love of animals, and puzzle-solving skills.
