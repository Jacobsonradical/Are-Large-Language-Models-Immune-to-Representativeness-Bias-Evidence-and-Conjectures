Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests Adam has traits and interests that could align with various fields of graduate study, such as biology, psychology, mathematics, or veterinary medicine. While an aptitude for understanding abstract concepts could lend itself well to computer science, the sketch does not provide strong direct evidence that points to computer science specifically. Therefore, I estimate a modest 30% probability that computer science was his chosen field of graduate study.
