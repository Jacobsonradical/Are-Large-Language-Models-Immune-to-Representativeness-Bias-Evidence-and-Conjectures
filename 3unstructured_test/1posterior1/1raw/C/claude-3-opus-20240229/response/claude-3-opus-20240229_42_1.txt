Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

While Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could suggest an aptitude for computer science, the information provided focuses more on his curiosity about nature, love of animals, and appreciation for hard work. The personality sketch does not give any strong indication of specific interest or skills related to computer science. Therefore, based solely on the limited information given, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.2 that Adam was enrolled in computer science as a graduate student in 2021.
