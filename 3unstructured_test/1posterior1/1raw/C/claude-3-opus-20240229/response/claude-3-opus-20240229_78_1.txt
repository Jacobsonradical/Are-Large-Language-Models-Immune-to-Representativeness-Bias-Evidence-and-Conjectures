Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have interests and traits that could align with various fields of graduate study. His curiosity about nature and plants, love of animals, and empathy suggest possible interest in biology, ecology, veterinary science, or environmental science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could lend themselves to a wide range of quantitative and scientific disciplines. 

While it's certainly possible Adam studied computer science, as it involves problem-solving, abstract thinking and dedication, the sketch doesn't provide strong direct evidence of specific interest in or aptitude for computer science and technology. Therefore, without more information, I estimate a 30% chance that computer science was his chosen field of graduate study in 2021. But there are many other possibilities that also seem plausible given his profile.
