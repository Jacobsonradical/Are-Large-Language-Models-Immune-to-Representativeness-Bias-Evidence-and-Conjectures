Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.15"
}

Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have interests and traits more aligned with fields like biology, zoology, or perhaps psychology rather than computer science. His love of nature, animals, and abstract thinking suggest he would be drawn to natural sciences over computer science. However, computer science does involve problem solving which the sketch mentions, so I didn't assign a very low probability. Overall though, the details provided point more towards other fields of graduate study for Adam.
