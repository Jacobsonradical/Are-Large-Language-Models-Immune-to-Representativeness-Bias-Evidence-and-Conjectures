Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have interests and traits more aligned with fields like biology, zoology, veterinary medicine, or perhaps psychology. His curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and empathy suggest a leaning towards life sciences. While he is described as highly intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, which could lend itself to computer science, the sketch overall points more towards other fields of graduate study. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low 20% probability that Adam was studying computer science specifically in 2021.
