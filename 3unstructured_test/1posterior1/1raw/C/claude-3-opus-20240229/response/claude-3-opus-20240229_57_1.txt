Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits that could be suitable for various fields, such as biology, psychology, or veterinary medicine. While his intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could lend themselves well to computer science, his strong interest in nature, plants, and animals suggests that he may be more likely to pursue a field related to the natural world. However, without more specific information about his academic background and career aspirations, it is difficult to assign a high probability to any particular field.
