Here is my estimate for the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science as a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has traits that could align with various fields of graduate study, such as biology, psychology, veterinary medicine, or computer science. His curiosity about nature and plants, along with his love for animals, suggests possible interests in the life sciences. His empathy and warm heart point to fields focused on understanding and helping others. Adam's intelligence, aptitude for abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving skills could indicate suitability for a technical field like computer science. However, the sketch does not provide clear evidence that computer science is his most likely area of study. Therefore, I estimate a 30% probability that he was a computer science graduate student, acknowledging that his profile is also compatible with several other fields.
