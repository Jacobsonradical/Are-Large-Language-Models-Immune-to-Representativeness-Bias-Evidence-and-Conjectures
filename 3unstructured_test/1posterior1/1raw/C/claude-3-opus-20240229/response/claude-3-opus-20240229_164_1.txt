Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.25"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have interests and traits more aligned with fields like biology, zoology, or perhaps psychology or philosophy. His curiosity about nature and plants, love of animals, and ability to understand abstract concepts point more towards those areas rather than computer science specifically. However, computer science does involve problem-solving and abstract thinking, so there is some possibility he could be drawn to that field. Overall though, I estimate only about a 25% chance that computer science was his chosen area of graduate study given the details provided.
