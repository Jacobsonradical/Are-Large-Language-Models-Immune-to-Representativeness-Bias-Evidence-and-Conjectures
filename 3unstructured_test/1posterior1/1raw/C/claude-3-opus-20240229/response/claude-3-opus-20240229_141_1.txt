Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits described, such as a curiosity about nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts, could align well with studying computer science. However, the sketch does not definitively state his field of study, so there is still some uncertainty. A probability estimate of 0.6 reflects that computer science seems like a reasonably likely fit given his traits and interests, but it is not a near-certainty without more specific information about his academic pursuits.
