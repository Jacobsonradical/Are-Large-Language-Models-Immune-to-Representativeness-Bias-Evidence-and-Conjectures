Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have interests and traits that could potentially align with studying computer science, such as enjoying solving puzzles, being of high intelligence, and having a good understanding of abstract concepts. However, the description also emphasizes his love of nature, plants, animals and his strong empathy, which are not traits typically associated with computer science.

Without more specific information about his academic background or stated interests, I estimate a 30% probability that he was enrolled in computer science. The sketch suggests he could plausibly be studying that field, but there isn't enough strong evidence to assign a higher probability. He may be more likely to be in a field related to natural sciences, environmental studies, or similar, given the interests described.
