Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

The personality traits mentioned, such as curiosity about nature, enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts, could fit with many different fields of graduate study. While they could apply to computer science, there is no specific indication that points strongly to that field over others. The sketch suggests a possible leaning more towards natural sciences and fields involving plants, animals or nature. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.2 that computer science was his specific area of graduate study based solely on the information provided.
