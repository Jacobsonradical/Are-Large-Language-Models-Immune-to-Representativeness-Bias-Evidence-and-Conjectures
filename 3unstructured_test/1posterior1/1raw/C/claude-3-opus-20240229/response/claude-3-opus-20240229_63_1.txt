Based on the given personality sketch, here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science as a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, problem-solving skills, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts could align well with studying computer science. However, the strong interest in nature, plants, and animals suggests that biology, ecology, or a related life science field could also be a possibility. Without more specific information about Adam's academic background and interests, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.6 that he was a computer science graduate student.
