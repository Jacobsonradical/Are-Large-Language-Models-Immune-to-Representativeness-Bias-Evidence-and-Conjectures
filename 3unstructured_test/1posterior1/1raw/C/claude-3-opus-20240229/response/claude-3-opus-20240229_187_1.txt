Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science as a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has qualities like curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and an ability to understand abstract concepts. While these traits could be applicable to many fields, including computer science, the sketch also emphasizes Adam's love for nature, plants, animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication. These latter qualities seem less directly relevant to computer science.

Therefore, while it's certainly possible Adam studied computer science, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.2 based solely on the information provided. More details about his specific interests, skills and undergraduate background would help refine this estimate.
