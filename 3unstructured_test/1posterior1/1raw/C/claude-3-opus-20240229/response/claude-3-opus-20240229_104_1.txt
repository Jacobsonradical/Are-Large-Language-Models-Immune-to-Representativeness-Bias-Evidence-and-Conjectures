Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.25"

Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have interests and traits that could align with various fields of graduate study. His curiosity about nature and plants, along with his love for animals and strong empathy, could point towards fields like biology, ecology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine. His enjoyment of solving puzzles and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts suggests he may also be drawn to fields like mathematics, physics, or certain areas of computer science. However, the description does not provide any definitive indication that computer science is his chosen field. Without more specific information about his academic background and stated interests, I estimate a modest 25% probability that he was enrolled in a computer science graduate program in 2021, acknowledging that he very well could have pursued graduate studies in other fields that also align with the traits and interests described.
