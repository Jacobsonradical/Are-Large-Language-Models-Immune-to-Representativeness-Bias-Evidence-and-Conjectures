Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have interests and traits that could align with various fields of graduate study, such as biology, environmental science, psychology, or other sciences. His curiosity about nature and plants, as well as his empathy and love for animals, suggest possible interest in life sciences or environmental fields. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit well with math, physics, computer science, or other technical fields. However, the description does not provide strong direct evidence of a specific interest in computer science. Given the limited information, I estimate a 30% probability that he was a computer science graduate student, with the remaining probability spread across other potential fields. More details about his specific academic interests and background would help narrow down the estimate further.
