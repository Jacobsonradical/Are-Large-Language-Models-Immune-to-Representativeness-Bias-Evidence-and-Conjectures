Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts could align well with studying computer science. However, the strong interest in nature, plants, and animals suggests other possible fields of study as well, such as biology or environmental science. Therefore, while computer science seems a reasonable possibility, I don't think it can be assumed with a very high degree of confidence based solely on the personality description provided.
