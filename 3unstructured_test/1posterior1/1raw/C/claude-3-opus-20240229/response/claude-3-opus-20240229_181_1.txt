Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have traits and interests that could align with various fields of graduate study, including but not limited to computer science. His curiosity, intelligence, and aptitude for abstract concepts and problem-solving could lend themselves well to computer science. However, his strong interest in nature, plants, animals and empathy also suggest possible alignment with fields like biology, ecology, veterinary medicine, or psychology. Without more specific information about his undergraduate background and stated graduate school interests, I estimate a 30% probability that he was enrolled specifically in computer science, with the remaining probability spread across other potential fields. But this is a very rough estimate given the limited information available in the brief personality sketch.
