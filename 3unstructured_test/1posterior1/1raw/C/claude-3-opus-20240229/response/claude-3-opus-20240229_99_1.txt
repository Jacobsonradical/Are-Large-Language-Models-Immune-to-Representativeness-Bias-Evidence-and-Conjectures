Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have an interest in nature, animals, and abstract concepts. He is intelligent and appreciates hard work. However, the description does not specifically mention an interest or aptitude for computer science or technology. While it's certainly possible he could be studying computer science, the given information suggests his interests may align more with fields like biology, zoology, psychology, or philosophy. Without more specific details pointing to computer science, I estimate the probability is around 30% that this was his field of graduate study in 2021.
