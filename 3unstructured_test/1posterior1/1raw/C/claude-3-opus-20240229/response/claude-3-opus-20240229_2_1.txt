Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.25"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have interests and traits that could align with various fields of graduate study, such as biology, environmental science, psychology, mathematics, or computer science. His curiosity about nature and plants, as well as his love for animals, suggest possible interest in biology or environmental fields. His enjoyment of puzzles and ability to understand abstract concepts could point to mathematics, computer science, or certain areas of psychology. However, the description does not provide definitive evidence that computer science is his chosen field. Without more specific information about his academic background and stated interests, computer science seems to have a reasonable but not overwhelming likelihood, which I estimate at around 25%.
