Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has traits and interests that could be compatible with studying computer science, such as high intelligence, being good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles. However, the sketch also prominently mentions Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, as well as his love for animals, which might suggest interests more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, or zoology. The information provided does not conclusively point to computer science as his field of graduate study. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.4 that Adam was a computer science graduate student in 2021.
