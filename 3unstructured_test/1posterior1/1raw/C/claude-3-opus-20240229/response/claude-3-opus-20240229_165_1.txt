Based on the given personality sketch, here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

While Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could lend themselves well to computer science, his strong interests in nature, plants, animals, and puzzles suggest he may be more likely to pursue fields such as biology, environmental science, veterinary medicine, or perhaps mathematics or physics. However, without more specific information about his academic background and interests, it's difficult to assign a high probability to any particular field.
