Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests Adam has traits and interests that could align with various fields of graduate study, such as biology, psychology, mathematics, or veterinary medicine. While an interest in puzzles and aptitude for abstract concepts could point to computer science, the overall description doesn't provide strong specific evidence for that field over others. Therefore, I estimate a moderate 30% probability that computer science was his area of graduate study based solely on the information provided.
