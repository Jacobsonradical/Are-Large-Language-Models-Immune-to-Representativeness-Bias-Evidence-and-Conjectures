Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, which could lend itself well to computer science. However, his strong interests in nature, animals, and puzzles don't necessarily point to computer science in particular. Without more information about his specific academic interests and background, I'd estimate a moderate probability of around 40% that he was studying computer science. But there are many other graduate fields he could have pursued given the traits described.
