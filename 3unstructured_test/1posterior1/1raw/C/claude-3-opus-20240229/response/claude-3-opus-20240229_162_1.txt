Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have interests and traits that could align with various fields of graduate study, including biology, psychology, veterinary medicine, and others in addition to computer science. His curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and empathy suggest possible interests outside of computer science. However, his intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could lend themselves well to graduate studies in computer science. Without more specific information about his academic background and technical skills, I estimate a 30% probability that he was a computer science grad student in 2021, with the recognition that he very well could have been studying in another field based on the description provided.
