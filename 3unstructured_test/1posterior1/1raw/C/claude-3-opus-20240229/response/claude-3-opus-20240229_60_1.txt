Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality traits mentioned, such as curiosity about nature, enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts, could align with many different fields of graduate study. While they could potentially fit with computer science, there is no strong, direct indication that computer science is the most likely field. The mention of a deep love for animals and nature might suggest a slight leaning toward the life sciences or a field involving nature. However, the information provided is quite limited to make a confident estimate. Therefore, I assign a probability of 0.3 to computer science, acknowledging the possibility based on the traits listed, but not a strong likelihood without more specific evidence pointing to that field.
