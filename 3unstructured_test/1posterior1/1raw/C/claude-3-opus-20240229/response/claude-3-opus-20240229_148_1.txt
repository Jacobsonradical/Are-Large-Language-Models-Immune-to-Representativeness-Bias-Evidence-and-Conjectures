Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

While Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles could lend themselves well to studying computer science, the information provided emphasizes more his curiosity about nature, love for plants and animals, and appreciation of hard work and dedication. These latter qualities seem to point more towards fields in the natural sciences or possibly agriculture. However, since the information is quite limited, there is still a reasonable chance he could have been studying computer science. Therefore, I estimate a probability of 0.4.
