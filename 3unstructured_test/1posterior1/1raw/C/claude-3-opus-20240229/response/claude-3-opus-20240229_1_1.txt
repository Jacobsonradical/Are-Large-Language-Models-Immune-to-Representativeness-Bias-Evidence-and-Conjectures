Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have interests and traits that could align with various fields of graduate study. His curiosity about nature and plants, love of animals, and empathy suggest he may be drawn to fields like biology, ecology, veterinary medicine, or psychology. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could suit fields like mathematics, physics, or philosophy. While computer science is certainly a possibility given his strong intellect, the sketch does not provide any specific indication of an interest or aptitude in that particular area. Without more information directly related to his technical skills or stated interest in computing, I estimate a relatively modest 30% probability that computer science was his graduate field of study in 2021. Of course, more details about his undergraduate background and specific career ambitions would help refine this estimate.
