Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have strong interests in nature, animals, and abstract concepts. He is intelligent and appreciates hard work. However, the description does not provide any specific indicators that he was likely studying computer science. While it's certainly possible given his intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, computer science is not directly related to his primary interests mentioned (nature, plants, animals, puzzles). Without more specific information suggesting an interest or aptitude for computer science, I estimate a 30% probability that this was his field of graduate study in 2021.
