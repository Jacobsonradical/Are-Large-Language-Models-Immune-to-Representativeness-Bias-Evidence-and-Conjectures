Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

While Adam's high intelligence, abstract thinking ability, and enjoyment of solving puzzles could be compatible with studying computer science, his strong interests in nature, plants, animals, and empathy are not stereotypically associated with that field of study. Of course, an individual can have diverse interests spanning both technology and the natural world. But without more information specifically suggesting an inclination toward computers or programming, I estimate a 30% probability that he was a computer science graduate student based solely on the description provided.
