Based on the given personality sketch of Adam, here is my estimate of the probability that he was enrolled in computer science as a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

While Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals might suggest a field related to biology or environmental science, his enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts could indicate an aptitude for computer science. However, without more specific information about his academic background or career interests, it is difficult to say with certainty. The provided probability is a reasonable estimate given the limited information available.
