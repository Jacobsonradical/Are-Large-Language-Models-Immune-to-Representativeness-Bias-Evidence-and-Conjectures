Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has traits and interests that could be compatible with studying computer science, such as high intelligence, being good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles. However, the sketch also emphasizes Adam's love of nature, plants, and animals, as well as his empathy, which are less directly related to computer science.

Without more specific information about Adam's academic background, skills, and stated interests, it's difficult to assign a high probability to him studying computer science in particular. The probability I provided is my best estimate based on the limited information available in the personality sketch.
