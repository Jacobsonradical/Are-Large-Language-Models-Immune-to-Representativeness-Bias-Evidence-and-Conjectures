Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, love of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts, could be compatible with studying computer science. However, the sketch also emphasizes Adam's interest in plants and animals, as well as empathy and appreciation for hard work, which seem less directly relevant to computer science. Without more specific information about Adam's academic interests and aptitudes, I estimate a moderate 30% probability that he was enrolled in computer science specifically, as opposed to other potential fields.
