Based on the given personality sketch, here is my estimate for the probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science as a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits mentioned, such as curiosity about nature, enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts, could align with a variety of fields. However, the combination of strong problem-solving skills, grasping abstract concepts, and high intelligence suggests a slightly higher likelihood of being in a field like computer science compared to some other graduate programs. That said, without more specific information about Adam's academic background and interests, it's difficult to assign a high probability to any particular field. The 0.6 estimate reflects a moderate likelihood based on the limited information provided.
