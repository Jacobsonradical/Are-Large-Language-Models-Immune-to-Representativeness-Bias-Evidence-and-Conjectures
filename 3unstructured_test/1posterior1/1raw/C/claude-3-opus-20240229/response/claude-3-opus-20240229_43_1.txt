Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, problem-solving skills, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts are quite consistent with studying computer science. However, the strong interest in nature and love for animals suggest other possible fields of study as well, such as biology or environmental science. Therefore, while computer science seems like a reasonable possibility given Adam's attributes, I wouldn't assign it an extremely high probability without additional information about his specific interests and academic background. A probability estimate of 0.6 reflects that it's more likely than not based on the limited information provided, but far from certain.
