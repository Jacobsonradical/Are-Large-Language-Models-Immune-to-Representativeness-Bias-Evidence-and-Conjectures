Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have interests and traits that could align with a variety of fields, including life sciences, psychology, mathematics, and others in addition to computer science. While he is described as intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, which could lend itself well to computer science, his strongest interests seem to be nature, plants, animals and puzzles. Therefore, while it's certainly possible he studied computer science, I do not think it is the most probable field given the information provided. My rough estimate is that there is a 30% chance he was a computer science graduate student in 2021.
