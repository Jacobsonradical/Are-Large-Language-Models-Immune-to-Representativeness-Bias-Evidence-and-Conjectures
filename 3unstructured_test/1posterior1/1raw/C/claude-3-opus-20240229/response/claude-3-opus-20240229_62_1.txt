Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits described - curiosity, problem-solving skills, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts - are qualities that could lend themselves well to studying computer science. However, the description also emphasizes an interest in nature and animals, as well as empathy, which could point to other potential fields of study like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine. Without more specific information about Adam's academic interests and background, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.6 that he was a computer science graduate student based solely on the personality sketch provided.
