Here is my estimate for the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have an analytical and abstract mind which could lend itself to computer science. His interest in puzzles and problem-solving also aligns somewhat with the field. However, his deep interest in nature, plants and animals suggests his passions may lie more in the natural sciences and biology rather than computer science. The description doesn't give any direct indication that he was studying or inclined towards computer science. So while it's certainly possible he was enrolled in that field, I'd estimate the probability is only around 40% based on the limited information provided about his personality and interests.
