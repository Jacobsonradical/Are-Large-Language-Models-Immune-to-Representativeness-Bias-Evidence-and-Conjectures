Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have traits and interests that could align with various fields of graduate study, including computer science. His intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest an aptitude for a technical field like computer science. However, his strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy imply he may have been drawn to other areas as well, such as biology, ecology, veterinary medicine, or psychology. Without more specific information about his undergraduate background and stated graduate school interests, I estimate a moderate 40% probability that he was enrolled in a computer science graduate program in 2021, with the remaining probability spread across other potential fields.
