Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have interests and traits that could align with various fields of graduate study, such as biology, zoology, mathematics, or psychology. While his intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could lend itself to computer science, the sketch does not provide strong direct evidence of a specific interest in that field. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.3 that he was enrolled in computer science, allowing for the significant possibility that he was in a different graduate program more directly related to his noted interests.
