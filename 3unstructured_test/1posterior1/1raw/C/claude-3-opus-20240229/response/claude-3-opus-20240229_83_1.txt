Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has traits and interests that could align well with studying computer science, such as being intelligent, good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles. However, the sketch also mentions some traits less directly related to computer science, like his curiosity about nature and love for animals. Therefore, while computer science seems like a reasonable possibility given his profile, I don't have enough specific information to assign a very high probability. My estimate of a 60% chance reflects that it's a realistic option given his characteristics, but far from certain without more details about his specific academic interests and background.
