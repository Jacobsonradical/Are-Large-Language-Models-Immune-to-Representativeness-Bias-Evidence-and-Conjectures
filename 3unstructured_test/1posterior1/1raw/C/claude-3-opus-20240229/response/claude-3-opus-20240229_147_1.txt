Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality description suggests Adam has strong interests in nature, animals, puzzles, and abstract concepts. While these traits could fit with computer science to some degree, the sketch overall seems more aligned with fields like biology, zoology, veterinary medicine, or perhaps mathematics. The mention of curiosity about plants in particular makes me think a life science field may be more likely than computer science for Adam. However, the information is limited, so I estimate a 30% chance that he was studying computer science.
