Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has traits and interests that could be compatible with studying computer science, such as enjoying solving puzzles, being of high intelligence, and having a strong grasp of abstract concepts. However, the sketch also indicates other interests like nature, plants, animals, and empathy that seem less directly related to computer science.

Without more specific information about Adam's academic background, skills, and stated interests, I don't feel there is enough evidence to assign a probability higher than 30% that he was specifically enrolled in computer science in graduate school in 2021. The details provided leave open a wide range of other possible fields he may have studied.
