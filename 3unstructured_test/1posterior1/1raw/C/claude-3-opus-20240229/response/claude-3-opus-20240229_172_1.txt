Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits that could be compatible with studying computer science, such as enjoying solving puzzles, being of high intelligence, and having a good understanding of abstract concepts. However, the sketch also emphasizes Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, his love for animals, and his strong empathy, which are not as directly related to computer science.

Without more specific information about Adam's academic background, skills, and stated interests, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.3 that he was enrolled in a computer science graduate program in 2021 based on the given personality description.
