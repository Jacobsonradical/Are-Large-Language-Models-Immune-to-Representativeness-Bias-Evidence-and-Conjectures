Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love of animals, and understanding of abstract concepts, do not strongly indicate a high likelihood of Adam being a computer science graduate student. While computer science can involve abstract concepts, the other mentioned traits are not as directly relevant. However, the puzzle-solving interest and high intelligence suggest some possibility. Given the limited information, I estimate a 30% probability but there is significant uncertainty around this estimate.
