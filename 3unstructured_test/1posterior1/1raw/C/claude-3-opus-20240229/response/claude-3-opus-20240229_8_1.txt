Based on the given personality sketch, here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

While the subject has traits that could be suitable for various fields, the combination of high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggests an inclination towards computer science. However, the strong interest in nature and animals also points to possible fields like biology or environmental science. Therefore, I estimate a probability of 0.6 for computer science, acknowledging the possibility of other fields as well.
