Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests Adam has an interest in nature, animals, puzzles and abstract concepts. It also notes his intelligence and work ethic. However, it does not specifically mention anything directly related to computer science or technology. 

Some aspects like his intelligence, puzzle-solving skills and ability to grasp abstractions could lend themselves well to computer science. But overall, based solely on the limited information provided, I estimate only a moderate 30% probability that computer science was his specific field of graduate study. Of course, without more details about his specific interests and background, this is a very rough estimate.
