Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, problem-solving, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts are often associated with computer science. However, the strong interest in nature, plants, animals and empathy are less commonly associated with computer science, so I don't believe the probability is extremely high. Based on the information provided, I estimate a 60% chance that Adam was a graduate student in computer science.
