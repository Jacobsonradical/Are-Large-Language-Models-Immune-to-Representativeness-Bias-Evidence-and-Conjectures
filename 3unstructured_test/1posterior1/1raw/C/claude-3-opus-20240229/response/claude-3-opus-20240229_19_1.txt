Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have interests and traits that could align with various fields of graduate study. His curiosity about nature and plants, as well as his love for animals, could point to studies in biology, ecology, or environmental science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit well with mathematics, physics, or philosophy. Problem solving skills are valuable in many STEM fields.

While computer science is certainly a possibility given his intelligence and problem solving ability, the sketch does not provide any specific indication of interest or skills in that area. Computer science is a bit of a leap without more direct evidence. Therefore, I estimate a 30% chance he was studying computer science specifically, with the remaining probability distributed among other potential fields. More details about Adam's specific interests, undergraduate background, and technical skills would help narrow down the probabilities further.
