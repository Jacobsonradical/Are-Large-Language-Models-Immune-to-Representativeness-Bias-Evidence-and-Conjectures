Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality traits mentioned, such as curiosity about nature, enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts, could fit with many different fields of graduate study. While they could apply to computer science, there isn't anything that specifically points to that field over others. The sketch suggests an appreciation for the natural world and biological sciences. Without more information about Adam's specific interests and undergraduate background, computer science seems possible but far from certain based only on the provided description.
