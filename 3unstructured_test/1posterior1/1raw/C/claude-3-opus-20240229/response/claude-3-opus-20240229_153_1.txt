Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and appreciation of hard work, do not strongly indicate a computer science specialization, though the puzzle-solving and abstract thinking abilities could fit. Without more specific information about his academic interests and abilities, I estimate only a 20% probability that Adam was a computer science graduate student based solely on the personality description provided.
