Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have interests and traits that could suit a variety of fields, including biology, zoology, psychology, philosophy, or animal science. His curiosity about nature and love of animals suggests he may be more drawn to natural sciences than computer science. Problem solving skills and abstract thinking abilities could lend themselves to many disciplines. The description doesn't provide strong evidence that computer science is his likely field of graduate study. Of course, additional information about his specific academic background, skills and career goals would help narrow down the possibilities with more confidence.
