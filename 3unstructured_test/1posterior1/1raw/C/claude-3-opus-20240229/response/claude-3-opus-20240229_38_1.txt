Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

While Adam is described as highly intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, which could fit well with studying computer science, the other details provided suggest he may be more likely to pursue a field related to his strong interests in nature, plants, animals, and puzzles. So while there is some probability he studied computer science, I estimate it is more likely he was enrolled in a different graduate field that aligns more closely with the personality traits described.
