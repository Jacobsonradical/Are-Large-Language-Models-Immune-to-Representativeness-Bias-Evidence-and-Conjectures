Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of being intelligent, good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles could align well with studying computer science. However, the strong interest in nature and plants, as well as empathy and love for animals, could also point to other fields like biology or veterinary medicine. Without more specific information about Adam's academic interests and aptitudes, I estimate the probability of him being enrolled in computer science specifically to be around 60%.
