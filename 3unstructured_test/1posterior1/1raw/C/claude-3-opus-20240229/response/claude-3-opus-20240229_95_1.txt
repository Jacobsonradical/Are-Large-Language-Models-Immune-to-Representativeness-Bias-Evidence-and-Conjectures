Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts, could potentially be a good fit for many fields of graduate study, including but not limited to computer science. Without more specific information about Adam's academic background, skills, and interests, it's difficult to assign a high probability to any particular field. Computer science is certainly a possibility given the traits mentioned, but many other fields could also align with that profile.
