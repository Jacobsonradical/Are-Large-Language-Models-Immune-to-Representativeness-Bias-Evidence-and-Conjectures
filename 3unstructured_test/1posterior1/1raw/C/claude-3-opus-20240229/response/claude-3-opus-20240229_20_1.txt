Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has traits and interests that could align with various fields of graduate study, such as biology, zoology, psychology, or even philosophy. While an interest in puzzles and aptitude for abstract concepts could point to computer science, the sketch more strongly emphasizes Adam's curiosity about nature, love of animals, and sense of empathy. Therefore, I estimate a 30% probability that he was studying computer science specifically, with the remaining probability distributed among other potential fields.
