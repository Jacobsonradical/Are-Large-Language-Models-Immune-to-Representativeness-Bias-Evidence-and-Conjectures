Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits that could be suitable for various fields of graduate study, such as biology, psychology, veterinary science, or animal behavior. His curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and empathy point towards life sciences or animal-related fields.

While his intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving skills could make him a good fit for computer science, the sketch does not provide strong direct evidence of a specific interest or aptitude in that area. 

Therefore, based on the limited information provided, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.3 that Adam was enrolled in a computer science graduate program in 2021. More details about his undergraduate background, technical skills, and stated interests would help refine this estimate.
