Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

While the personality traits mentioned don't directly imply a computer science focus, his strong intelligence, aptitude for abstract concepts and problem solving, and diligence are all qualities that could lend themselves well to graduate studies in computer science. However, without more specific information about his academic interests and background, there is still significant uncertainty, so I estimate the probability at 0.6 rather than higher.
