Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described suggest someone who is highly intelligent, analytical, and likes solving abstract problems, which could fit well with studying computer science. However, the strong interests in nature, plants, animals and empathy are less directly related to computer science. So while it's certainly possible Adam studied CS, I don't think it's the most probable field given his profile. Something in the life sciences or a helping profession seem more likely to me based on the description. But computer science is still a realistic possibility.
