Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests Adam has interests and traits that could be compatible with studying computer science, such as enjoying puzzles, being of high intelligence, and having an understanding of abstract concepts. However, the sketch focuses more on his curiosity about nature, love of animals, and empathetic personality, which seem to point more toward fields like biology, environmental science, psychology, or veterinary medicine. Therefore, while it's certainly possible Adam studied computer science, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.2 based solely on the information provided.
