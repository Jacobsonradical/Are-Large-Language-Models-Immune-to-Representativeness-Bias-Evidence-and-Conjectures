Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

While Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could lend themselves well to computer science, the sketch focuses more on his curiosity about nature, love of animals, and appreciation for hard work. It does not provide strong direct evidence that he was likely to be studying computer science specifically. Therefore, I estimate a moderate 30% probability based on the limited information provided.
