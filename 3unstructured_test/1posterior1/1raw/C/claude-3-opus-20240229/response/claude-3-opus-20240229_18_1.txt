Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests Adam has traits and interests that could be compatible with various fields of graduate study, such as biology, psychology, veterinary medicine, or even philosophy. While an aptitude for understanding abstract concepts could lend itself to computer science, the sketch does not provide strong direct evidence of specific technical interests or skills that would make computer science a particularly likely choice compared to other possibilities. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.3 that he was enrolled in computer science specifically.
