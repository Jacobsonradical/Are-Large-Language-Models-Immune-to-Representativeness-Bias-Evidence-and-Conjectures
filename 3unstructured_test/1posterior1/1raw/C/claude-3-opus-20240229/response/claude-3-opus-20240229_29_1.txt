Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits described, such as enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and being good at understanding abstract concepts, could fit well with studying computer science. However, the strong interest in nature and plants, along with empathy and love for animals, also leaves open the possibility of other fields like biology or veterinary medicine. Without more specific information directly related to Adam's academic interests, I estimate the probability of computer science to be around 0.6, but there is certainly some uncertainty there.
