Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits that could be suited for various fields, such as biology, veterinary science, psychology, or even philosophy. While he is described as having high intelligence and being good at understanding abstract concepts, which could lend itself to computer science, the sketch does not provide any direct indication of an interest or aptitude in that specific field. Therefore, based on the limited information provided, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.2 that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
