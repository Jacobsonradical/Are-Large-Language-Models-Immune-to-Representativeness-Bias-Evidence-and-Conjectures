Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science as a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam is highly intelligent, good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoys solving puzzles. These traits are commonly found in people who pursue computer science. However, the sketch also emphasizes Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy, which are less directly related to computer science. Therefore, while there is a reasonable probability that Adam was enrolled in a computer science graduate program, it is not a certainty based on the information provided.
