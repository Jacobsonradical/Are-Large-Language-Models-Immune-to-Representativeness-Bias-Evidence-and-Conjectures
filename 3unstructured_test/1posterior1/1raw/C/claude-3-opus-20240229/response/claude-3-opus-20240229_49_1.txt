Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests Adam has interests and traits that could align with various fields of graduate study, such as biology, psychology, mathematics, or veterinary medicine. While an aptitude for puzzles and abstract concepts could point to computer science, the sketch emphasizes more his curiosity about nature, love of animals, and empathetic personality. Therefore, I estimate only a 20% probability that computer science was his specific field of graduate study based solely on the information provided.
