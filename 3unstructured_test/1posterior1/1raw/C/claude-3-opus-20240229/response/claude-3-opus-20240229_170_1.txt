Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021 based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

While Adam has traits that could be suitable for computer science such as high intelligence, aptitude for understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles, the sketch also highlights several characteristics more closely associated with other fields. His genuine curiosity about nature and plants, deep love for animals, and strong empathy suggest he may have been more likely to pursue studies in natural sciences, environmental science, veterinary medicine, or psychology. Of course, it's possible to have those interests and still study computer science. But based solely on the given description, I estimate a 30% probability he was enrolled in computer science specifically in 2021.
