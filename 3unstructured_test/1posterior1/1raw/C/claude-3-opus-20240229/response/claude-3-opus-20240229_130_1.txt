Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have interests and traits that could align with various fields of graduate study, including biology, environmental science, psychology, veterinary medicine, or other scientific disciplines. While his intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could lend themselves to computer science, the sketch doesn't provide strong direct evidence of a specific interest in that field. Therefore, without more information to go on, I estimate a relatively low 20% probability that computer science was his chosen area of graduate study.
