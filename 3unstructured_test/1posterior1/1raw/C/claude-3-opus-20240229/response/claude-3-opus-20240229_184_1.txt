Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has an interest in nature, abstract concepts, and problem solving. While these traits could be applicable to computer science, they don't strongly point to that specific field. His empathy, love of animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could fit with a variety of fields. Without more information directly related to his academic interests and aptitudes, I estimate a 30% probability that he was studying computer science, with the remaining probability spread across other potential fields. More specific details about his undergraduate major, technical skills, or stated graduate school interests would help refine the estimate further.
