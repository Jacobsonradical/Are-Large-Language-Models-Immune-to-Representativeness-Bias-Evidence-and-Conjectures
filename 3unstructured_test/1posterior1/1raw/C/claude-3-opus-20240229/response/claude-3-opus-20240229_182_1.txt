Based on the given personality sketch, here is my estimate for the probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

While the description suggests Adam has traits and interests that could align with various fields, his high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles make computer science a reasonable possibility. However, without more specific information about his academic background or stated interests, there remains some uncertainty.
