Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love of animals, and empathy suggest he may be more drawn to fields like biology, ecology, or zoology. However, his intelligence, aptitude for abstract concepts and problem solving could lend themselves well to computer science. Without more specific information about his academic interests and skills, I estimate a moderate 40% probability that he was a computer science graduate student based on the details provided.
