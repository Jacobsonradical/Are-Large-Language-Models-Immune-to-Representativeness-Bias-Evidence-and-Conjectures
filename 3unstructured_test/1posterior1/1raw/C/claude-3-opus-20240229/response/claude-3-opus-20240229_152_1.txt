Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

While Adam's high intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts could lend themselves well to computer science, the personality sketch emphasizes more his curiosity about nature, plants, empathy, and love for animals. These traits seem to point more toward fields like biology, zoology, ecology, or environmental science rather than computer science specifically. So while it's certainly possible Adam studied computer science, I estimate a lower probability of around 0.3 based solely on the given information.
