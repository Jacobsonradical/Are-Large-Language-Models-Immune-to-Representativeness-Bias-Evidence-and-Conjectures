Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation of hard work, do not strongly indicate a high probability of studying computer science specifically. While the sketch does mention Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, which could be applicable to many fields including computer science, there are no direct mentions of specific interests or skills related to computers, programming, math, or technology. Therefore, based solely on the limited information provided, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.3 that Adam was enrolled in a computer science graduate program.
