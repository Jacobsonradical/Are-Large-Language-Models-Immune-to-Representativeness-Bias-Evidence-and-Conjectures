Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests Adam has interests and traits that could align with various fields of graduate study, such as biology, psychology, veterinary science, or abstract disciplines like mathematics or physics. While an interest in puzzles and strong abstract reasoning skills could point to computer science, the overall description doesn't provide strong specific evidence for that field compared to other possibilities. Therefore, I estimate a 30% probability that computer science was his chosen area of graduate study based solely on the provided information.
