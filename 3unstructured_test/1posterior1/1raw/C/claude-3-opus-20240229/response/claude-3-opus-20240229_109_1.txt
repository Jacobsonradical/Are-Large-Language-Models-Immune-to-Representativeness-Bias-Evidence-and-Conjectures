Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests Adam has traits and interests that could be compatible with studying computer science, such as high intelligence, enjoying solving puzzles, and being good at understanding abstract concepts. However, the sketch also mentions a strong interest in nature and animals which seems less directly related to computer science. Given the limited information provided, I estimate a 30% probability that Adam was a computer science graduate student in 2021, but there is significant uncertainty around this estimate. More details about his specific academic interests and coursework would help refine the probability.
