Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have an interest in nature, animals, puzzles, and abstract concepts. This could align with a variety of fields including biology, zoology, psychology, or mathematics. 

While an interest in puzzles and abstract concepts could point to computer science, the sketch does not mention any specific technical or programming interests that would strongly suggest computer science. The humanities or "soft" sciences seem to be a better fit given the emphasis on empathy, nature, and animals.

Therefore, while it's certainly possible Adam studied computer science, I estimate the probability is only around 30% based on the limited information provided. Of course, this is just my best guess given the personality profile. More specific academic details would be needed to make a confident assessment.
