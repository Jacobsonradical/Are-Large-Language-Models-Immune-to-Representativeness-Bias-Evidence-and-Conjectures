Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have interests and traits that could align with various fields of graduate study. His curiosity about nature and plants, as well as his love for animals, could suggest studies in biology, ecology, environmental science, or a related field. His skills in abstract thinking and puzzle-solving could lend themselves to math, engineering, or computer science. However, the description does not provide clear evidence that computer science is his most likely area of study. Without more specific information about his academic background and research interests, computer science seems to have a modest but far from certain probability, which I estimate at 0.3.
