Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, intelligence, abstract thinking, puzzle-solving, and appreciation for hard work and dedication are all consistent with someone who may be drawn to studying computer science. However, the strong interest in nature, plants, and animals suggests other possible fields of study as well, such as biology or environmental science. Therefore, while computer science seems like a reasonably probable fit given the traits described, I don't think the probability is extremely high. A value of 0.6 reflects a moderate-to-high probability while allowing for some uncertainty and the possibility of other fields.
