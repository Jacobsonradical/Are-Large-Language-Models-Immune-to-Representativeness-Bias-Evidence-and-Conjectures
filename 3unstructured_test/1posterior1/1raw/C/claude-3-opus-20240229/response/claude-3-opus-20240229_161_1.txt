Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch suggests Adam has qualities and interests that could be suitable for various fields of graduate study, including but not limited to computer science. His curiosity, problem-solving skills, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts are traits that could lend themselves well to computer science. However, the sketch also highlights his love of nature, plants, animals, and appreciation for hard work, which could indicate aptitude and interest in other fields like biology, ecology, veterinary medicine, agriculture, etc. Without more specific information about his academic background and stated interests, computer science seems a reasonable possibility but not a certainty based solely on the personality sketch provided. Therefore, I estimate a 40% probability that he was enrolled in computer science specifically in 2021.
