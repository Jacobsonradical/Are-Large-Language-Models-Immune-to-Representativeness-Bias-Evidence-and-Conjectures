Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality traits mentioned, such as curiosity about nature, enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts, could fit with a variety of fields. While they could apply to computer science, there isn't anything that specifically points to that field over others. The love of animals and nature might suggest a slight leaning away from computer science and more towards biological sciences. Therefore, I estimate a 30% probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science based solely on the limited information provided. More details about his specific interests and skills would be needed to assign a higher probability to that particular field.
