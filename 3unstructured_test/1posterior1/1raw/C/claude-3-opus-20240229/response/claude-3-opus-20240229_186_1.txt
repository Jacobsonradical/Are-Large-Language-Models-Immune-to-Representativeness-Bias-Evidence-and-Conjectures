Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has traits and interests that could be suitable for various fields, such as biology, environmental science, psychology, or animal-related studies. While his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could make him a good fit for computer science, the sketch does not provide strong evidence that points specifically towards this field. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.3 that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021.
