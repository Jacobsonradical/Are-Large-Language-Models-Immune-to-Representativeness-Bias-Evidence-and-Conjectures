Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits that could be suitable for a variety of fields, such as biology, zoology, psychology, or computer science. His curiosity about nature and love for animals might point more towards a field like biology or zoology. His high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles could fit well with computer science, but could also apply to various other analytical fields. The information provided does not give a strong indication of computer science specifically.

Therefore, while it's certainly possible Adam studied computer science, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.2 based solely on the personality sketch. More specific information about his academic background, skills, and stated interests would be needed to make a more confident estimate.
