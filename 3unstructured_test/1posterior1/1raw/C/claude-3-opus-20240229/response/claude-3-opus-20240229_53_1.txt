Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science as a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have interests and traits that could align with various fields of graduate study. His curiosity about nature and plants, along with his love for animals and strong empathy, could point towards fields like biology, ecology, zoology, or environmental science. 

His enjoyment of solving puzzles and strong intelligence with an understanding of abstract concepts could lend itself to fields like mathematics, physics, philosophy, or certain areas of computer science and engineering.

While computer science is certainly a possibility given his problem-solving inclination and intellectual capacity, I don't see it as the most probable field based solely on the details provided, as the description emphasizes more of his interest in nature, animals and empathy. Therefore, I estimate a 30% probability of him being enrolled in a computer science graduate program.
