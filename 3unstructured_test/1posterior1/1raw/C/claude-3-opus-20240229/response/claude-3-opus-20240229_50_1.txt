Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science as a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest a reasonable likelihood that Adam could be drawn to a field like computer science. However, the sketch also emphasizes traits like empathy, love of animals and nature, and appreciation for hard work, which point to possible interest in other fields as well. Therefore, while computer science seems to align with several of his characteristics, I estimate the probability at 0.6 rather than a higher value. Additional information about his specific interests and undergraduate background would help refine this estimate further.
