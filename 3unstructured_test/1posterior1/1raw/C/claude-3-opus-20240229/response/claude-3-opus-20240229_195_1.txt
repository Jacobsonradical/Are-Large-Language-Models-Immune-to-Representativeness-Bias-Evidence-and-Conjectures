Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

The personality traits provided - curiosity about nature and plants, enjoying puzzles, empathy and love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work - do not strongly indicate enrollment in computer science specifically. While computer science requires intelligence, problem-solving skills, and hard work, the other traits mentioned are not as directly relevant. The sketch suggests interests more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low 20% probability that Adam was a computer science graduate student based solely on the information given.
