Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has qualities that could align with various fields of graduate study, such as biology, zoology, psychology, or even philosophy. His curiosity about nature and love for animals could point to fields like biology or zoology. His empathy and ability to understand abstract concepts could suit psychology or philosophy.

While his intelligence and puzzle-solving skills could potentially suit computer science, the sketch does not provide strong direct evidence of specific interest or aptitude in that field. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.3 that he was enrolled in computer science, acknowledging the possibility based on his general intellectual traits, but not ranking it as the most likely field given the other interests mentioned.
