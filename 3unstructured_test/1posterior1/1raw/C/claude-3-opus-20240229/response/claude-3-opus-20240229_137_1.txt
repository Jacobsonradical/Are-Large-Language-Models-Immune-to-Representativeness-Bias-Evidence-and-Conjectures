Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have interests and traits that could align with various fields of graduate study, such as biology, ecology, veterinary science, psychology, or abstract fields like mathematics or philosophy. While computer science is certainly a possibility for someone of high intelligence who enjoys solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, the sketch emphasizes more of an affinity for nature, animals, and empathy. This makes me think other fields are more likely. Of course, additional information about Adam's specific academic background, skills and career goals would help narrow down the probability further. But based solely on the personality overview, I estimate a relatively low 20% probability of computer science compared to other potential fields.
