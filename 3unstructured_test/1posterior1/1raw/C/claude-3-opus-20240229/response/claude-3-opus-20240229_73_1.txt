Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits that could be compatible with studying computer science, such as enjoying solving puzzles, having high intelligence, and being good at understanding abstract concepts. However, the sketch also emphasizes Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, his love for animals, and his empathy. These traits are less directly related to computer science.

Without more specific information about Adam's academic background, skills, and stated interests, it is difficult to assign a high probability to him being enrolled in computer science. The given information is not strongly predictive of this particular field of study. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.2.
