Based on the personality sketch provided, here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science as a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits described, such as enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and being good at understanding abstract concepts, could potentially align well with studying computer science. However, the strong interest in nature, plants, and animals suggests that biology, ecology, or other life sciences could also be strong possibilities. Without more specific information about Adam's academic background and interests, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.6 that he was a computer science graduate student.
