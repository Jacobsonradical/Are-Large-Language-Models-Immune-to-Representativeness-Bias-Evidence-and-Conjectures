Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Based on Adam's personality sketch, he seems to have interests and traits that could align with various fields of graduate study. His curiosity about nature and plants, along with his love for animals and strong empathy, could suggest studies in biology, ecology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine. His skill at understanding abstract concepts and high intelligence could fit well with mathematics, physics, philosophy, or theoretical fields.

While computer science is certainly a possibility given his intelligence and aptitude for puzzle-solving, the other details provided don't strongly point to that specific field over others. Therefore, without additional information about his specific technical interests and skills, I estimate a modest 30% probability that he was enrolled in a computer science graduate program.
