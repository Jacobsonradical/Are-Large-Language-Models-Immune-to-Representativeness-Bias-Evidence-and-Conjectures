Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has traits and interests that could be compatible with studying computer science, such as high intelligence, being good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles. However, the sketch also emphasizes Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, his love for animals, and his strong empathy, which are not as directly related to computer science.

While it's certainly possible that Adam was studying computer science, the given information does not provide strong evidence to suggest that it was his chosen field of study. Therefore, I estimate a probability of 0.3, indicating that there is a moderate possibility that Adam was enrolled in computer science, but it is not a highly confident prediction based on the available personality sketch.
