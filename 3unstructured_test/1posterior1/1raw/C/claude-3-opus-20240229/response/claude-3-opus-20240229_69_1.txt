Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.15"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have interests and strengths more aligned with fields like biology, veterinary science, psychology, or philosophy rather than computer science specifically. His curiosity about nature and plants, love of animals, empathy, and ability to understand abstract concepts point more towards those other domains. The sketch does not mention anything specific to programming, technology or mathematical problem-solving that would suggest a strong likelihood of studying computer science. However, given his high intelligence, there is still some possibility he chose to apply his abilities to computer science, so I estimated a 15% probability rather than ruling it out entirely. But I think it is more likely his graduate studies were in a different field based on the details provided about his personality and interests.
