Here is my estimate:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have interests and traits that could align with various fields of graduate study. His curiosity about nature and plants, love of animals, and empathy suggest he could be drawn to fields like biology, environmental science, ecology, or veterinary medicine. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could suit fields like mathematics, physics, or philosophy. His puzzle-solving skills could indicate an interest in fields like engineering or economics.

While computer science is certainly a possibility for a highly intelligent individual, the sketch does not provide any specific evidence of Adam's interest or skills in that particular field. Therefore, I estimate a 30% probability that he was enrolled in computer science, acknowledging the possibility but not considering it the most likely option based on the given information.
