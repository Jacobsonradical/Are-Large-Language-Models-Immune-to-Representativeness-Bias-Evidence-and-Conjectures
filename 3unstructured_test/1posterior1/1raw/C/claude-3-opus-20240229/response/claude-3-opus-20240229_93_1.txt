Based on the given personality sketch, here is my estimate:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as a warm and empathetic personality. While he is described as highly intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, which could be relevant to computer science, the description does not provide any direct indication of an interest or aptitude in this specific field. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.3 that Adam was enrolled in a computer science graduate program in 2021.
