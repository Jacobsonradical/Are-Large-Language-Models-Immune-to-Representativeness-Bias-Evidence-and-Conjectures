Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have interests and traits that could align with various fields of graduate study. His curiosity about nature and plants, love of animals, and empathy suggest possible interest in biology, ecology, veterinary medicine, or other life sciences. His aptitude for understanding abstract concepts and solving puzzles, along with high intelligence, could point to mathematics, physics, engineering, or quantitative fields.

Computer science is certainly a possibility given the problem-solving and abstract thinking mentioned. However, the sketch does not provide strong direct evidence of specific interest or experience in computer science or technology. Therefore, without more information to go on, I estimate a moderate 30% probability that computer science was his field of graduate study in 2021, relative to other possible fields. But more details about his specific interests, undergraduate background, and technical skills would be needed to assign a higher probability to computer science over other potential areas.
