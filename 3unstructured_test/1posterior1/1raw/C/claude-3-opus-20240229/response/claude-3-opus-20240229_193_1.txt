Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have traits and interests that could align with various fields of graduate study. His curiosity about nature and plants, love of animals, and empathy suggest possible interest in biological sciences, environmental studies, or veterinary medicine. However, his aptitude for abstract concepts, puzzle-solving, and intelligence could point towards more quantitative or analytical fields like computer science. 

Without more specific information about his undergraduate background or stated career interests, it's difficult to assign a high probability to any particular field. Computer science seems like a reasonable possibility given the limited information, but many other fields could also fit. Therefore, I've estimated a moderate probability of 0.4 that he was a computer science graduate student, to reflect that it's a viable option but far from certain based solely on the personality description provided.
