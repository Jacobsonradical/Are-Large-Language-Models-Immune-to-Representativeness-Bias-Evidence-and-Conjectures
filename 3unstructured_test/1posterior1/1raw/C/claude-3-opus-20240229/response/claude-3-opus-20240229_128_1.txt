Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have interests and traits that could align with various fields of graduate study. His curiosity about nature and plants, as well as his love for animals, could point to studies in biology, ecology, or animal science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could lend itself to fields like mathematics, physics, or philosophy. 

While computer science is certainly a possibility given his aptitude for problem-solving and abstract thinking, the sketch does not provide strong direct evidence that it would be his most likely field of study compared to the other possibilities. Therefore, I estimate a 30% probability that he was enrolled specifically in computer science, with the remaining probability distributed among other potential fields that also match his interests and strengths.
