Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

While Adam's high intelligence and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts could lend themselves well to computer science, the personality sketch emphasizes more his curiosity about nature, love of animals, and empathy. These traits seem to point more towards fields like biology, zoology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine rather than computer science. However, since he enjoys solving puzzles, there is still some possibility he could be drawn to the problem-solving aspects of computer science. Overall though, I estimate only a 20% chance that he was enrolled in computer science specifically in 2021 based on the information provided.
