Based on the given personality sketch, here is my estimate for the probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests related to nature, plants, and animals, as well as an appreciation for hard work and dedication. While he is described as highly intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, which could be relevant to computer science, the description does not provide any specific indication of an interest or aptitude in that field. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.3 for Adam being enrolled in computer science.
