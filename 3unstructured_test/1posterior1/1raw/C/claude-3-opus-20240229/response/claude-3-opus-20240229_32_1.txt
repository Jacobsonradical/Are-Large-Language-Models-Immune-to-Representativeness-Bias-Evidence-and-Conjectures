Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have interests and traits that could align with a variety of fields, such as biology, psychology, or even philosophy. While his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could lend themselves well to computer science, the sketch does not provide any strong direct indication of an interest or aptitude in that specific field. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.2 that he was enrolled in computer science, allowing for the possibility but not considering it the most likely field given the limited information provided.
