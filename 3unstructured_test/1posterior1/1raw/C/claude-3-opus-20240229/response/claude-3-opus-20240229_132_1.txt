Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits that could be compatible with various fields of graduate study, such as biology, psychology, veterinary medicine, or computer science. His curiosity about nature and plants, as well as his love for animals, might indicate a leaning towards biology or veterinary medicine. However, his enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts could also suggest an aptitude for computer science.

Without more specific information about Adam's academic background, skills, and expressed interests, it is difficult to assign a high probability to any particular field. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.3 for computer science, acknowledging that there could be other equally likely possibilities based on the given information.
