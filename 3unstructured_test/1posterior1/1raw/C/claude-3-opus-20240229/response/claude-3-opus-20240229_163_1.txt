Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests Adam has traits and interests that could align with various fields of graduate study, such as biology, environmental science, psychology, or computer science. His curiosity about nature and plants, along with his empathy and love for animals, could point to biology or environmental fields. His intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to grasp abstract concepts could fit well with computer science. However, the description does not provide definitive evidence that computer science is the most likely field, so I estimate a moderate probability of 0.3 that he was enrolled in computer science specifically. Other STEM fields seem similarly plausible based on the limited information provided.
