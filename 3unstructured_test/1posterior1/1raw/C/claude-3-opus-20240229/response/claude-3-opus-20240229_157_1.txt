Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, puzzle-solving ability, high intelligence, and aptitude for abstract concepts could align with studying computer science. However, the strong interest in nature, plants, animals and empathy are less directly related to typical computer science pursuits. Therefore, while it's certainly possible Adam studied computer science, I estimate the probability is only around 30% based on the information provided. Of course, more details about his specific interests and skills would help refine this estimate.
