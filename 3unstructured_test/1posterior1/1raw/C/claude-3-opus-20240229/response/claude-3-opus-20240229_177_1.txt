Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

While Adam's high intelligence, abstract thinking ability, and enjoyment of solving puzzles could align with a computer science field, the sketch emphasizes more his curiosity about nature, plants, animals and his empathetic personality. These traits seem more directly relevant to fields like biology, zoology, environmental science, etc. Computer science is certainly possible but the given information suggests other fields may be more likely. Of course, this is just an estimate based on limited information about his personality and interests.
