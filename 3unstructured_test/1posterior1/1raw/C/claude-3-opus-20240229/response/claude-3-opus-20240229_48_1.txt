Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have interests and traits that could align with various fields of graduate study, such as biology, psychology, veterinary medicine, or animal science. His curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, love of animals, and ability to grasp abstract concepts could suit different scientific disciplines.

The description does not provide strong evidence that computer science is his most likely field of study. Problem solving skills could indicate an aptitude for CS, but the other details point more to life sciences or psychology. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low 20% probability that he was a computer science grad student, with other fields seeming more probable given his profile. But more specific information would be needed to assess the likelihood with high confidence.
