Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have interests and traits that could align with various fields of graduate study, such as biology, environmental science, psychology, or even philosophy. While computer science is certainly a possibility given his intelligence and aptitude for abstract concepts, the sketch does not provide strong direct evidence that it would be his chosen field. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.2 that he was specifically enrolled in computer science. More information about his academic background, technical skills, and stated interests would help refine this estimate.
