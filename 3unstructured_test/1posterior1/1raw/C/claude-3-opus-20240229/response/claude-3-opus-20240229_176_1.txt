Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have interests and traits that could align with various fields of graduate study. His curiosity about nature and plants, as well as his love for animals, could point towards studies in biology, ecology, or environmental science. Problem solving skills and understanding of abstract concepts are valuable in many STEM fields including computer science, but also mathematics, physics, etc. And empathy and dedication are great general traits for any grad student.

Without more specific information about Adam's undergraduate background, technical skills, or stated career interests, it's hard to gauge the likelihood of him pursuing computer science specifically. Therefore, I estimate a 30% probability based on the limited information provided, while acknowledging he could have plausibly been studying a range of other subjects. More details about Adam would help refine the estimate.
