Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests Adam has interests and traits that could be well-suited for a variety of fields, such as biology, psychology, or veterinary medicine. His curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, and love of animals point more towards the life sciences than computer science. However, his intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts could lend themselves to computer science. Overall though, I estimate only a 20% probability that he was specifically in a computer science graduate program based on the information provided, as his profile seems to align better with other fields of study.
