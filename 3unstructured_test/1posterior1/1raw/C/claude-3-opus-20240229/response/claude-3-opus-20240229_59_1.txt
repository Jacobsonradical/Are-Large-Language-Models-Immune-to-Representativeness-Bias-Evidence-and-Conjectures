Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

While the personality sketch does not directly mention computer science or technology, it describes Adam as highly intelligent, good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles. These traits are common among those who excel in and are drawn to computer science. His curiosity and appreciation for hard work and dedication also align with the field. However, without more specific information about his interests and aptitudes, I cannot say with a very high degree of certainty that he was a computer science graduate student, hence my estimated probability of 0.6.
