Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has intellectual curiosity, strong analytical and problem-solving skills, and the ability to grasp abstract concepts. These qualities could align with studying computer science. However, his deep love of nature, plants and animals may point more towards fields like biology, ecology, or environmental science. The information provided doesn't strongly indicate computer science as the most likely field, so I estimate a 30% probability based on the limited details given. More information about his specific interests and aptitudes would help refine the estimate.
