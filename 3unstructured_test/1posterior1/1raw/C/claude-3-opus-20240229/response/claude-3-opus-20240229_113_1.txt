Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests Adam has interests and traits that could be suitable for various fields, such as biology, zoology, psychology, or certain areas of computer science. However, the description does not provide strong direct evidence that he was likely enrolled specifically in computer science. His curiosity about nature and love for animals may point more toward life sciences. While he is intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, which could fit well with computer science, those traits are also applicable to many other fields. Therefore, without more specific information indicating an interest or aptitude for computer science, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.2 that he was enrolled in that particular field.
