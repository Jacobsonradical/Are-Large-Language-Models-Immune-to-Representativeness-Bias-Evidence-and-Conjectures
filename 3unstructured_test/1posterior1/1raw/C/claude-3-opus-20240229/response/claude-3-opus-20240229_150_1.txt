Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

While Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles could align well with studying computer science, the personality sketch also emphasizes his curiosity about nature and plants, and his deep love for animals. This suggests he may have been more likely to study a field related to the natural sciences or biology. However, since computer science is a common field of graduate study, I still estimate a moderate probability of 0.4 that he may have been enrolled in a computer science program.
