Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The subject's genuine curiosity, enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts could potentially align with studying computer science. However, the sketch also emphasizes Adam's love of nature, plants, animals, and empathy, which seem less directly related to computer science. Therefore, while it's certainly possible Adam studied computer science, I estimate the probability to be around 30% based solely on the limited information provided about his personality and interests.
