Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Based on the provided personality sketch, Adam seems to have interests and traits that could align with various fields of graduate study. His curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and empathy suggest possible interest in biology, ecology, veterinary medicine, or related fields. 

His enjoyment of puzzles and strong abstract thinking abilities could point to mathematics, physics, philosophy, or certain branches of engineering in addition to computer science.

The description of Adam having high intelligence, dedication and hard work ethic could apply to graduate students across many challenging disciplines.

While computer science is certainly a possibility given Adam's problem solving and abstract reasoning skills, the sketch overall seems to more strongly hint at other potential areas of study. Therefore, I estimate a 30% probability of Adam being a computer science grad student based solely on the given information, with the true probability depending on additional relevant details about his specific interests and academic background.
