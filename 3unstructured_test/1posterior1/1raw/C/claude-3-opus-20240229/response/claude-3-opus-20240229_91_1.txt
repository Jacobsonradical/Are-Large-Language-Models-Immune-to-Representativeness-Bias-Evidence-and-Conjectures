Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has strong interests in nature, animals, abstract concepts, and problem solving. While an aptitude for abstract thinking and problem solving could lend itself well to computer science, the sketch does not provide any direct indication of an interest or background in that specific field. Adam's love of nature and animals may suggest he is more likely to pursue studies in natural sciences, biology, zoology, or similar fields. Therefore, based solely on the limited information provided, I estimate a relatively low 20% probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science specifically as a graduate student in 2021.
