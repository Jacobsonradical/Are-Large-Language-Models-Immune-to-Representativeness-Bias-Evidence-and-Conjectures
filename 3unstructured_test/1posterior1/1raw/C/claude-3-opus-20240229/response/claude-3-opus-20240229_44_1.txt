Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and strengths that could be applicable to various fields, such as biology, zoology, psychology, or engineering. However, it does not provide strong evidence that computer science was his chosen field of graduate study. While computer science involves problem-solving and understanding abstract concepts, which align with the description, the emphasis on curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy suggests a possible inclination towards other areas. Therefore, based on the limited information provided, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.2 that Adam was enrolled in a computer science graduate program in 2021.
