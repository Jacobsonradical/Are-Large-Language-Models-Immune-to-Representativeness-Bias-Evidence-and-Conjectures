Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature, enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts could potentially fit with studying computer science. However, the emphasis on empathy, love of animals, and appreciation of hard work and dedication don't seem especially indicative of computer science compared to other fields. Therefore, while it's certainly possible Adam studied computer science, I don't think the information strongly points to that, so I estimate a relatively low 20% probability based solely on the personality description provided.
