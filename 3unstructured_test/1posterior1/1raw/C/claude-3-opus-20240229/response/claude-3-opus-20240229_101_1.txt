Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has traits and interests that could align with various fields of graduate study, such as biology, veterinary science, psychology, or mathematics. His curiosity about nature and love for animals could point to fields like biology or veterinary science. His empathy and ability to understand abstract concepts could suit psychology or mathematics.

While computer science is certainly a possibility given his high intelligence and aptitude for problem-solving, the sketch does not provide strong direct evidence of a specific interest or background in that field. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.3 that he was enrolled in computer science, allowing for the significant possibility that he was in a different field more directly related to his mentioned interests and traits.
