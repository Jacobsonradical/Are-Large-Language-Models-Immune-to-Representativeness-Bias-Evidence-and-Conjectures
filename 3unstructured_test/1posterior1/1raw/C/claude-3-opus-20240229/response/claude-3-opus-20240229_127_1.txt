Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch mentions Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, his empathy and love of animals, and his ability to understand abstract concepts. While these traits could align with various fields of graduate study, they don't point strongly towards computer science specifically. Computer science is certainly a possibility given his high intelligence and puzzle-solving skills, but the bio focuses more on Adam's interest in the natural world. Therefore, I estimate a 30% probability that Adam was a computer science graduate student based solely on the information provided. Of course, more details about his specific academic interests and background would help refine this estimate.
