Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits described, including curiosity, puzzle-solving aptitude, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts, align well with an interest and aptitude for computer science. However, the sketch also mentions a love of nature, animals, and an appreciation for hard work, which could point to other fields as well. Therefore, I estimate a 60% probability that computer science was his field of graduate study.
