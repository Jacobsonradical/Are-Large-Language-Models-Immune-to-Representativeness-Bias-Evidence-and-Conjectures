Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.65"
}

Based on the given personality sketch, Adam seems to have traits and interests that align well with the field of computer science, such as enjoying solving puzzles, being of high intelligence, and having a strong grasp of abstract concepts. However, the description also mentions his curiosity about nature and plants, as well as his love for animals, which could point to interests in other fields like biology or environmental science. Without more specific information about his academic background or stated interests, I estimate a 65% probability that he was enrolled in computer science as a graduate student in 2021.
