Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts, could align with various fields of graduate study. While computer science is a possibility, the emphasis on plants, animals, and hard work could also point to fields like biology, zoology, veterinary science, or agricultural science. Without more specific information directly related to Adam's academic interests and pursuits, computer science seems to have a modest but not overwhelming likelihood based solely on the personality sketch provided.
