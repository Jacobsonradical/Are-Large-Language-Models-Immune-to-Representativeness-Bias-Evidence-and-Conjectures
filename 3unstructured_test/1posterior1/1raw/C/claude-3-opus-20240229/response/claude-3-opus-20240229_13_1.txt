Here is my estimated probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"

Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have interests and traits that could align with various fields of graduate study. His curiosity about nature and plants, as well as his love for animals, could point towards studies in biology, ecology, or environmental science. His skill at solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts could lend itself well to mathematics, physics, or certain branches of engineering. Computer science is certainly a possibility given the abstract thinking and problem solving involved, but the sketch does not provide strong direct evidence of a specific interest in that field compared to potential alternatives. Therefore, I estimate a 30% probability that computer science was his chosen area of graduate study in 2021, acknowledging the high degree of uncertainty based on the limited information provided.
