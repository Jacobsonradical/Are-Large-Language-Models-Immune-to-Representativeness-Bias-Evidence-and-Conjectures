Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have interests and traits that could align with a variety of fields, including biology, zoology, psychology, or mathematics. His curiosity about nature and love of animals could point to fields like biology or zoology. His empathy and quiet nature might fit with psychology. His intelligence and appreciation for abstract concepts could indicate an aptitude for math or quantitative fields.

While computer science is certainly a possibility given his problem-solving skills and intelligence, I don't see anything in the description that specifically points to a strong likelihood of that particular field compared to other potential areas of study. So I estimate a 30% chance that he was studying computer science.
