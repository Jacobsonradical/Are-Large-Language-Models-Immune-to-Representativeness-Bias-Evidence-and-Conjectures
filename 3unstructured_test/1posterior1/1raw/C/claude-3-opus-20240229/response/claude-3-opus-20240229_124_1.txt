Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests Adam has interests and traits that could fit with various fields of graduate study, such as biology, ecology, psychology, or veterinary science. While his intelligence and aptitude for abstract concepts could lend themselves to computer science, the sketch does not provide strong direct evidence that points to that specific field. Therefore, I estimate a moderate 30% probability that he was a computer science grad student based solely on the information provided.
