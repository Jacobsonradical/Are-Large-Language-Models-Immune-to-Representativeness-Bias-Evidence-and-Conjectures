Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits that could align with various fields of graduate study, such as biology, psychology, mathematics, or even fields like veterinary medicine. While an interest in puzzles and abstract concepts could point to computer science, the overall description does not provide strong specific evidence for that field over others. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.2 that he was specifically enrolled in computer science.
