Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have interests and traits that could align with various fields of graduate study. His curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and empathy suggest possible interest in biology, ecology, veterinary medicine, or environmental science. Being good at understanding abstract concepts and enjoying solving puzzles could point to mathematics, physics, computer science, or engineering. However, the description does not mention any specific technical skills or background that would clearly indicate computer science.

Given the limited information, I estimate a 30% probability that Adam was a computer science graduate student in 2021. Additional details about his undergraduate background, work experience, specific technical abilities and his stated career interests would help refine this estimate. But based solely on the personality overview provided, a variety of graduate fields seem plausible.
