Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.15"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have interests and traits that could align with a variety of fields, such as biology, environmental science, psychology, or animal science. His curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and empathy suggest he may be drawn to life sciences or fields involving nature.

While he is described as highly intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, which could suit computer science, the sketch does not mention any specific interest or aptitude for computers, programming, or technology. 

Therefore, while it's certainly possible he studied computer science, I estimate a relatively low probability of 15% based solely on the information provided about his personality and interests. More details about his specific skills, undergraduate degree, or career goals would help refine the estimate.
