Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits that could align with various fields of graduate study, such as biology, psychology, veterinary science, or even philosophy. While an aptitude for understanding abstract concepts could lend itself well to computer science, the sketch does not provide strong direct evidence of an interest in or inclination towards that specific field. Therefore, I estimate a 30% probability that Adam was a computer science graduate student, acknowledging the significant possibility that he was enrolled in a different field more directly related to his stated interests and strengths.
