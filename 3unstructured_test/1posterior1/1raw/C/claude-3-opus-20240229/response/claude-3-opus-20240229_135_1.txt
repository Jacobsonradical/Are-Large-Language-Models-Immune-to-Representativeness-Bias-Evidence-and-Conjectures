Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits described, such as enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and being good at understanding abstract concepts, could fit well with studying computer science. However, the strong interest in nature and plants, along with empathy and love for animals, also suggest possible interest in fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine. Given the limited information provided, I estimate a 60% probability that Adam was a computer science graduate student in 2021, with a 40% chance that he was studying in another field more directly related to his other mentioned interests and traits.
