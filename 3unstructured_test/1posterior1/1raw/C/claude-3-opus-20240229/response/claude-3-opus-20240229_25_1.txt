Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests Adam has traits and interests that could be compatible with studying computer science, such as high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles. However, the sketch also emphasizes Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, as well as his love for animals. This suggests he may have been more inclined to study a field related to the natural sciences or biology. Therefore, while it's certainly possible Adam studied computer science, I estimate a lower probability of 0.3 based on the information provided.
