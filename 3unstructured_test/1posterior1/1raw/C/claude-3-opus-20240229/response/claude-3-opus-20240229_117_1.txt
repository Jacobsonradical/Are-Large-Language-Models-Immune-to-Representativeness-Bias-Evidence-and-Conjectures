Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has traits and interests that could be compatible with various fields of graduate study, such as biology, psychology, veterinary science, or even philosophy. While his intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could lend themselves well to computer science, the sketch does not provide strong direct evidence that he was likely to be enrolled in that specific field. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.3 that he was a computer science graduate student.
