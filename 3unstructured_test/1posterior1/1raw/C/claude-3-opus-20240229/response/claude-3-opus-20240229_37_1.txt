Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts, could fit with many different fields of graduate study. While they could apply to computer science, they don't strongly indicate it specifically. The sketch mentions more of an affinity for nature, animals, and dedication, rather than technology or programming. Therefore, my rough estimate is that there is a 30% probability Adam studied computer science based solely on the limited information provided, but he very well may have studied something quite different.
