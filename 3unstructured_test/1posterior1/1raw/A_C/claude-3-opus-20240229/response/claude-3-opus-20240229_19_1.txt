Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Based on Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and his empathetic personality, I believe he has a higher probability of being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science. However, his high intelligence, aptitude for understanding abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles also suggest a reasonable likelihood of him being in a field like computer science. Of course, there are many other potential fields he could have been enrolled in as well.
