Here is my estimate of the probabilities for Adam's graduate field of study in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Based on Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and his empathy and love for animals, I believe there is a fairly high probability (around 60%) that he studied agricultural and veterinary science.

His intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he could also be well-suited for computer science. However, this seems less likely than agricultural and veterinary science given his other traits, so I estimate a 30% probability for computer science.

Of course, these are just estimates based on limited information in his personality profile. There are many other potential fields he could have studied as well.
