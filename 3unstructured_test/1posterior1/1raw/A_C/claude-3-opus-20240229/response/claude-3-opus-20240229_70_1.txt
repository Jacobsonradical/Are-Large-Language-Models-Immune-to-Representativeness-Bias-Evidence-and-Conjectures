Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, deep love for animals, and strong empathy suggest a higher likelihood of him pursuing agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science. However, his high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles also make computer science a possibility, albeit a lower one in my estimation.
