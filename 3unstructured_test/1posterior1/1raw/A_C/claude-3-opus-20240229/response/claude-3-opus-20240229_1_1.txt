Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

While Adam's intelligence and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts could lend itself well to computer science, his love of nature, animals, and empathy seem to point more strongly towards a field like agricultural and veterinary science. His curiosity about plants and dedication also align well with this field. However, there is still a reasonable chance he could have pursued computer science given his problem-solving skills.
