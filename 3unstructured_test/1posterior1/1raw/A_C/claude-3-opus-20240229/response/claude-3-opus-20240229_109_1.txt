Here is my estimate of the probabilities for Adam's graduate field of study in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Based on Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and his deep empathy, I believe there is a higher probability he was studying agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science. His curiosity, intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could lend themselves to either field. But his specific passions seem more aligned with agricultural and veterinary sciences. Computer science is certainly possible given his problem solving skills and intelligence, but I estimated it as a lower probability than agricultural and veterinary science based on the details provided about Adam's personality and interests.
