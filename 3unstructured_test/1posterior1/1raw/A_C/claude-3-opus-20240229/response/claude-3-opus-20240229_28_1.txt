Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.65",
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

Based on Adam's personality sketch, his curiosity about nature, love of animals, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest a higher likelihood of being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science. However, his intelligence and puzzle-solving interest mean computer science is also a possibility, just at a lower probability than agricultural and veterinary science given the other details provided.
