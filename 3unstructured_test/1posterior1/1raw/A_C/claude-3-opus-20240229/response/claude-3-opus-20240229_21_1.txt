Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in the given fields in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have a strong interest in and aptitude for subjects related to nature, plants, animals, and abstract concepts. This suggests a high probability that he was pursuing graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science.

While he is described as intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, which could lend itself to computer science, his specific interests seem more aligned with agricultural and veterinary fields. However, there is still a reasonable chance he could have been in computer science.
