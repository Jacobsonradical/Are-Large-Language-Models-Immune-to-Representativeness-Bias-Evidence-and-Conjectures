Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field given the personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Based on his strong interest in nature, plants and animals, as well as his empathy and love for animals, I believe there is a reasonably high probability Adam specialized in agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and abstract thinking abilities could lend themselves well to computer science, so I gave that a moderate probability, but the other details provided seem to point more strongly towards a life sciences field focused on plants, animals and nature.
