Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the specified graduate fields in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and hard work and dedication, I believe there is a high probability (around 0.7) that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science for graduate studies.

His high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles also suggest a reasonable probability (around 0.4) that he could have been studying computer science. However, I weighted this lower than agricultural and veterinary science based on the limited information provided that directly connects to typical computer science interests.
