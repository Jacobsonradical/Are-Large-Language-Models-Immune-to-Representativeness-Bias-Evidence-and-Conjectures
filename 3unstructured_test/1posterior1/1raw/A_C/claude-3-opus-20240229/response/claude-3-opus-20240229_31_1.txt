Here is my estimate of the probabilities for Adam's graduate field of study in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Based on Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and his deep empathy, I believe there is a higher probability he pursued graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could lend itself well to computer science too, but his personality sketch emphasizes more of an alignment with the life sciences and study of plants and animals. Therefore, I estimate a 60% chance of agricultural/veterinary studies and a 30% chance of computer science.
