Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Based on Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and his deep empathy, I believe there is a relatively high probability (around 0.7) that he pursued graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science.

While Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could lend itself well to computer science, his personality sketch suggests a stronger affinity for the natural world and life sciences. Therefore, I assign a lower probability (around 0.3) to him having pursued graduate studies in computer science.
