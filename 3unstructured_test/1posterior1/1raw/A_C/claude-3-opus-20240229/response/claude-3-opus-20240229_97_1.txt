Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in the given fields in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

While Adam's intelligence and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts could lend itself well to computer science, his love of nature, animals, and strong sense of empathy seem to point more strongly towards a field like agricultural and veterinary science. His curiosity about plants and dedication also align well with this field of study. However, there is certainly a possibility he could have pursued computer science or another field.
