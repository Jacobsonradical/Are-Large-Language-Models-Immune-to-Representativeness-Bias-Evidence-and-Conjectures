Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Based on Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and his deep empathy, I believe he has a higher probability of being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could lend themselves to either field, but his specific interests seem more aligned with agricultural and veterinary science. However, there is still a decent probability he could be in computer science given his intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles.
