Based on the given personality sketch, here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in the following graduate fields in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

While Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could suit a computer science field, his strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy suggest a higher likelihood of pursuing agricultural and veterinary science. However, there is still a reasonable probability he could have chosen computer science.
