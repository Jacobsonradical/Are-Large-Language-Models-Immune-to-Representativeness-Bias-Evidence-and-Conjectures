Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, as well as his deep love for animals, suggests a strong interest and potential aptitude for agricultural and veterinary science. His warm heart and strong empathy also align well with caring for animals in a veterinary setting.

While Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and skill at solving puzzles could suit him well for computer science, his primary interests seem more aligned with the natural world. Still, there is some probability he could have pursued computer science given his intellectual abilities.
