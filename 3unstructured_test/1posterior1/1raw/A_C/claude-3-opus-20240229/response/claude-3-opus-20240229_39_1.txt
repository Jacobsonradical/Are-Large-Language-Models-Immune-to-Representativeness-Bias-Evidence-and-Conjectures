Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.35",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have a strong interest and aptitude for studying nature, plants, and animals. His love for animals and curiosity about nature suggests a high probability that he pursued graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science.

While he is described as highly intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, which could lend itself well to computer science, his specific interests seem more aligned with agricultural and veterinary science. However, I still estimate a moderate probability that he studied computer science.
