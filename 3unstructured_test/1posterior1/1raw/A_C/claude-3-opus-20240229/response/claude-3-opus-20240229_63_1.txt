Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.35",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and his deep empathy, I believe he has a high probability of around 0.7 of being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. His skill at understanding abstract concepts and high intelligence also suggest he could be a good fit for computer science, but I estimate this probability to be lower at around 0.35 given his other interests that align more strongly with agricultural and veterinary fields. Of course, there are many other graduate fields he could have pursued as well.
