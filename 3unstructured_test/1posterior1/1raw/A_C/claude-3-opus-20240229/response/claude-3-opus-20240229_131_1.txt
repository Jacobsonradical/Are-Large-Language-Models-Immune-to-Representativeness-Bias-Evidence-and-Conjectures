Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love of animals, curiosity about nature and plants, along with his empathy and dedication suggest a higher probability that he specialized in agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science. However, his intelligence, aptitude for abstract concepts and enjoyment of solving puzzles also make computer science a reasonable possibility, though less likely than agricultural and veterinary science based on the personality description provided.
