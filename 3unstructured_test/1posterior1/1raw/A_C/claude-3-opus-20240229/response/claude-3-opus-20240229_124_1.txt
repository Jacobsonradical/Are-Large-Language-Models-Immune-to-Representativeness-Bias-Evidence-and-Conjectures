Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests Adam has a strong interest in and empathy for nature, animals and abstract concepts. The mention of his curiosity about plants and love for animals makes agricultural and veterinary science a likely choice, so I assigned a relatively high probability of 0.7.

His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could lend itself to computer science as well, but the sketch focuses more on his interest in the natural world. So I assigned a lower but non-trivial probability of 0.2 to computer science.
