Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has a strong interest in and empathy for animals, plants, and nature. This suggests a higher likelihood of him pursuing agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science.

His intelligence, problem-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts could lend themselves to computer science as well. However, the sketch emphasized more his curiosity about the natural world.

Of course, there are many other potential fields he could have studied. Without more specific information, these probability estimates are highly speculative. But the details provided hint more strongly at agricultural and veterinary science in my assessment.
