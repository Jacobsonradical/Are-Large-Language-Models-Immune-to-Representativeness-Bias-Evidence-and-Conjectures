Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals suggests a strong inclination towards agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could also suit him well for computer science. However, the personality sketch emphasizes more his interest in nature and animals, so I estimate a higher probability of 0.7 for agricultural and veterinary science compared to 0.3 for computer science.
