Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in the given fields in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have a strong interest and aptitude for subjects related to nature, plants, animals and abstract thinking. This suggests a higher likelihood that he was pursuing graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science.

While he enjoys puzzles and is highly intelligent, which could indicate an interest in computer science, the sketch emphasizes more his curiosity about nature and love for animals. So while computer science is certainly possible, I estimate the probability to be lower than agricultural and veterinary science given his described interests and traits.
