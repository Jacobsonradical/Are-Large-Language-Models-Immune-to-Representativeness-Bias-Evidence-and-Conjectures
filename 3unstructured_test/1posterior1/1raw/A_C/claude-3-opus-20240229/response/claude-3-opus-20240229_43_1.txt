Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

While Adam's intelligence and skill with abstract concepts could lend itself well to computer science, his deep love for animals, curiosity about plants, and strong empathy seem to align more closely with a specialization in agricultural and veterinary science.
