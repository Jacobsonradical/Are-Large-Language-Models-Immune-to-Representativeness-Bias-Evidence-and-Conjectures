Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of those fields in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Based on Adam's strong interest in nature, plants and animals, as well as his empathy and love for animals, I believe there is a relatively high probability (around 60%) that he was pursuing graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science.

His high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles also suggest a reasonable probability (around 30%) that he may have been studying computer science.

Of course, these are just estimates based on limited information. There are many other graduate fields he could have pursued as well. But those two seem to align most closely with the interests and traits described in his personality sketch.
