Here is my estimate of the probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.65",
  "computer science": "0.25"
}

Based on Adam's personality sketch, his curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest a high likelihood that he was pursuing graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. I estimate the probability at 0.65.

While Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could point to computer science as well, his specific interests seem more aligned with agricultural and veterinary fields. However, there is still a reasonable chance he could have been in computer science given his intellectual abilities, so I estimate that probability at 0.25.
