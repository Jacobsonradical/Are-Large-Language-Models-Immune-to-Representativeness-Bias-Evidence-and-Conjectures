Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the specified graduate fields in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6",
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

Based on Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as his empathy and love for animals, I believe there is a relatively high probability (around 60%) that he was pursuing graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science.

While Adam's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could lend themselves well to computer science, his personality sketch does not provide strong evidence of a specific interest in that field. Therefore, I estimate a lower probability (around 20%) for computer science.

Of course, these are just estimates based on the limited information provided, and there is certainly a chance Adam could have been pursuing graduate work in other fields not mentioned here.
