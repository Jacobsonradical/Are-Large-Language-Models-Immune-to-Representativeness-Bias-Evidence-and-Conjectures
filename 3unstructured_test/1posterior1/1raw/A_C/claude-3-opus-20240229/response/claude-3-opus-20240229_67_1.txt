Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as his strong empathy, suggest a higher probability that he was studying agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could lend themselves to computer science, but the personality sketch emphasizes more his connection with nature and animals. Of course, there is still a possibility he was studying computer science or another field altogether.
