Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals, combined with his strong empathy, suggest a high likelihood that he would be drawn to agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet nature and enjoyment of solving puzzles also fit well with this field.

While his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could lend themselves well to computer science, the personality sketch emphasizes more his connection with nature and animals. Thus, I estimate a lower (but still non-trivial) probability that he specialized in computer science.
