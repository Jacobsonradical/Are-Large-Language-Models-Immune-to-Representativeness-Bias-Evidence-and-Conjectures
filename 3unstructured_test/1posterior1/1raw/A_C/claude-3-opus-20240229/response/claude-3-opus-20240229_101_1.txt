Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Based on Adam's personality sketch, he seems to have a strong interest and aptitude for the life sciences, particularly related to plants and animals. His curiosity about nature, love for animals, and abstract thinking skills align well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. While he could certainly apply his intelligence to computer science, the sketch provides more direct evidence pointing to life science fields. So I estimate a 60% probability he specialized in agricultural and veterinary science.

That said, many intelligent people with an interest in abstract concepts and problem solving do go into computer science. So while the evidence for that is less direct, I still estimate a substantial 30% chance he may have pursued graduate studies in CS. Of course, there are many other possibilities as well, which is why the probabilities do not add to 1.
