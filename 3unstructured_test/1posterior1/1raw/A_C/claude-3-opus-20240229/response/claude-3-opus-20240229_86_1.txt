Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Based on Adam's personality sketch, he seems to have a strong interest and aptitude for subjects related to nature, animals, and abstract thinking. His curiosity about plants and love for animals suggests a higher probability of specializing in agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science. However, his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts means computer science is also a possibility, just at a lower probability than agricultural and veterinary science given the details provided.
