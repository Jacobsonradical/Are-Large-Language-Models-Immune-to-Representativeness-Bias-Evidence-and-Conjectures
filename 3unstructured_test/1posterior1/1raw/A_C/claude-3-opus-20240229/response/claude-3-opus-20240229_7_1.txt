Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Based on Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as his empathy and love for animals, I believe there is a relatively high probability (around 0.6) that he was enrolled in an agricultural and veterinary science graduate program.

His high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles also suggest he could be drawn to computer science. However, I estimate a lower probability (around 0.3) for this field, as his personality sketch emphasizes more his connection with nature and animals.
