Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch suggests Adam has a strong interest in and empathy for animals and plants, as well as an appreciation for hard work. This points to a higher likelihood of him pursuing agricultural or veterinary science compared to computer science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could lend themselves to either field. But overall, his curiosity about nature and love of animals are the strongest indicators, in my estimation, of a probable specialization in agricultural and veterinary science. Computer science remains a possibility but seems less likely given his specific interests as described.
