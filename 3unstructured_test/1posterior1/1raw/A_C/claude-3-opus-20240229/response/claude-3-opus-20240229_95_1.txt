Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as his dedication and hard work, suggest a higher probability of him being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science. However, his intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles also make computer science a possibility, albeit with a lower probability based on the information provided.
