Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals, combined with his strong empathy, suggest a high likelihood that he was studying agricultural and veterinary science. His ability to understand abstract concepts and high intelligence also fit well with this field.

While Adam's aptitude for understanding abstract concepts and solving puzzles could lend itself well to computer science, his other traits and interests seem more aligned with agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, I estimated a lower, but still substantial, probability for computer science.
