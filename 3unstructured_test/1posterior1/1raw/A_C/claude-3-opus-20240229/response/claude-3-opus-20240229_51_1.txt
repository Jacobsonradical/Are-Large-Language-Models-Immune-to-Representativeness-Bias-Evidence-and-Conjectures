Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

While Adam's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could suit him well for computer science, his love of nature, animals, and strong empathy seem to point more towards a field like agricultural and veterinary science. Of course, there are many other possible fields he could have pursued as well.
