Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the two graduate fields in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

While Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could suit him well for computer science, his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication lead me to believe he is more likely to have pursued graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. However, there is still a reasonable probability he may have specialized in computer science.
