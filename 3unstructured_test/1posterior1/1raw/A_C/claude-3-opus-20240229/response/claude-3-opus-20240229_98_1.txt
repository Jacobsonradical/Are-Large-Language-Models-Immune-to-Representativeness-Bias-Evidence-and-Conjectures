Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Based on Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as his deep empathy, I believe there is a relatively high probability (around 0.6) that he was pursuing graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science.

While Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and skill at solving puzzles could certainly lend themselves well to computer science, his specific interests seem more aligned with agricultural and veterinary science. However, I still estimate a moderate probability (around 0.3) that he could have been studying computer science.
