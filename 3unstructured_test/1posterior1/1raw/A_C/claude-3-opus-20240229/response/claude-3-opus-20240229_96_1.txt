Here is my estimate of the probabilities for Adam's graduate field of study in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.65",
  "computer science": "0.25"
}

Based on Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals, combined with his strong empathy, I estimate a relatively high 65% probability that he was studying agricultural and veterinary science.

His high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and aptitude for solving puzzles suggests he may have also been drawn to a field like computer science. However, the personality sketch emphasized more his interest in nature and animals. So I estimate a lower 25% probability of him specializing in computer science compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
