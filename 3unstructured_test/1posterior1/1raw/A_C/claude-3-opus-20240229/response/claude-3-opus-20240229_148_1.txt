Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.75",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The description suggests Adam has a strong interest in nature, plants and animals, as well as empathy and love for animals specifically. This points to a high likelihood of him pursuing agricultural or veterinary science.

His intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles also suggest he could be drawn to a field like computer science. However, the description focuses more on his affinity for nature and animals.

So while both are possibilities given his aptitudes, I estimate a substantially higher probability that he specialized in agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science, based on the details provided about his personality and interests.
