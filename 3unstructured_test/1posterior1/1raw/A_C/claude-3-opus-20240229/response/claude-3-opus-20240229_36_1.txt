Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields:

{
  "computer science": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have a strong interest and aptitude for subjects related to nature, plants, animals, and abstract concepts. This suggests a higher probability that he was pursuing graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science.

While he enjoys solving puzzles and is highly intelligent, which could fit well with computer science, his specific interests seem more aligned with agricultural and veterinary fields. Of course, there is still some probability he was studying computer science or another field altogether.
