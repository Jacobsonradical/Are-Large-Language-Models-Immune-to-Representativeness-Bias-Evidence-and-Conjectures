Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Based on Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals, I think there is a relatively high probability (around 0.6) that he was pursuing graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science.

Given his intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles, there is also a decent chance (around 0.3) that he may have been studying computer science.

Of course, there are many other possibilities given his skills and interests (biology, environmental science, etc.) But based solely on the fields provided, those are my best probability estimates given the personality sketch.
