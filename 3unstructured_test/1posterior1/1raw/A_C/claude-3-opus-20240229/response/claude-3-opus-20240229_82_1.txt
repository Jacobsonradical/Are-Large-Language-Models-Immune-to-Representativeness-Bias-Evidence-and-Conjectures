Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Based on Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, along with his empathy and love for animals, I believe there is a fairly high probability (around 60%) that he was studying agricultural and veterinary science.

His puzzle-solving skills, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he could also be suited for computer science. However, this seems less likely than agricultural and veterinary science given his specific interests. So I estimate a lower 30% probability for computer science.

Of course, there are many other graduate fields he could have been pursuing as well. These probabilities are just rough estimates based on the limited information provided in the personality sketch.
