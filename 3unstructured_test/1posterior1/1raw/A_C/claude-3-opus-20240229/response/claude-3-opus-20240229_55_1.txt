Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.65",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have a strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and abstract concepts, along with empathy and an appreciation for hard work. This makes agricultural and veterinary science seem like a good fit, so I assigned a fairly high probability of 0.65.

His intelligence and skill at understanding abstract concepts could also lend itself to computer science, so I gave that a probability of 0.3. However, the sketch focused more on his interest in nature and animals, so I weighted agricultural and veterinary science higher.

Of course, there are many other graduate fields he could have possibly been enrolled in based on his interests and skills. This is just my best estimate based solely on the brief personality description provided.
