Based on the personality sketch provided, here is my best estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in the mentioned fields in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

The reasoning behind these estimates:

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest a higher probability of him being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

His interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts indicates some likelihood of him pursuing computer science. However, the personality sketch emphasizes his connection with nature and animals more than his technical inclinations.

Please note that these are rough estimates based on limited information and should not be considered definitive.
