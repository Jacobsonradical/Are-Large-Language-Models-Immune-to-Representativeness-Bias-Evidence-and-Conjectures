Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

While Adam's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could suit him well for computer science, his love of nature, animals, and strong empathy suggest a higher likelihood of being drawn to agricultural and veterinary science. However, there is still a reasonable probability he could have pursued computer science.
