Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has a strong interest in and empathy for animals, as well as a curiosity about nature and plants. This aligns well with a specialization in agricultural and veterinary science.

While Adam is described as highly intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, which could suit a computer science field, his specific interests seem more focused on the natural world. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability for agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science.
