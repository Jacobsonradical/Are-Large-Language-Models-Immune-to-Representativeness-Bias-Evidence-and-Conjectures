Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.25",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch suggests Adam has a strong interest in and empathy for nature, plants and animals. His love of animals and curiosity about plants makes agricultural and veterinary science a likely choice. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could lend itself to computer science, but the sketch emphasizes more his caring personality and affinity for the natural world. So while computer science is a possibility, I estimate agricultural and veterinary science to be the more probable field of study for Adam based on the details provided.
