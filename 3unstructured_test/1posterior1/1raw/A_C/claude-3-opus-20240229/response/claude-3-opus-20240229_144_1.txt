Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.65",
  "computer science": "0.35"
}

Based on Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals, combined with his strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication, I believe there is a relatively high probability of around 65% that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science for his graduate studies.

Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles also suggest a reasonable probability of around 35% that he may have pursued graduate studies in computer science.

Of course, there are many other potential graduate fields he could have specialized in. But given the information provided, agricultural and veterinary science seems most likely, with computer science also being a realistic possibility.
