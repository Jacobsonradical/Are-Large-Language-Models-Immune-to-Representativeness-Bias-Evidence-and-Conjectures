Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Based on Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants and animals, as well as his strong empathy and deep love for animals, I believe there is a relatively high probability (around 60%) that he was studying agricultural and veterinary science.

His high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could also point to studying computer science. However, I estimate a somewhat lower probability of around 30% for this field given the other details that suggest a stronger interest in nature and animals.

Of course, these are just rough estimates based on limited information. There are many other graduate fields he could have potentially been enrolled in as well.
