Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

While Adam's intelligence and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts could lend itself well to computer science, his love of nature, animals, and strong empathy seem to be an even stronger fit for agricultural and veterinary science. His curiosity about plants and dedication also align well with those fields. Of course, there are many other potential graduate fields he could have pursued as well.
