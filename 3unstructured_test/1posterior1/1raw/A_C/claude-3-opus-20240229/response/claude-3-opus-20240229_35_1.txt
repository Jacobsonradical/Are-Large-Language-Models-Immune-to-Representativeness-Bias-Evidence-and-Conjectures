Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Based on Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and his deep empathy, I believe there is a higher probability that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts suggests he could also be suited for computer science, but the personality sketch emphasizes more his affinity for the natural world and animals, which points more strongly to agricultural and veterinary science as a likely field of graduate study for Adam.
