Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the specified graduate fields in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on Adam's strong curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, along with his deep love for animals, I believe there is a high probability (around 0.7) that he was enrolled in an agricultural and veterinary science graduate program.

While Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and skill at solving puzzles could point to a computer science specialization, I estimate a lower probability (around 0.4) for this field compared to agricultural and veterinary science, as his primary interests seem to align more strongly with the latter.
