Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Based on Adam's personality sketch, his curiosity about nature and plants, his deep love for animals, and his ability to understand abstract concepts suggest a higher probability that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science. However, his high intelligence and aptitude for solving puzzles also make computer science a possible field of study, though less likely given his specific interests mentioned in the description.
