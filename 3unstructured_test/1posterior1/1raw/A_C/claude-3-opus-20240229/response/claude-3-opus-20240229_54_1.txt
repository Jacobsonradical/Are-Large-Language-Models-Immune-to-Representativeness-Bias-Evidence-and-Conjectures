Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has a strong interest in and empathy for nature, plants, and animals. He also enjoys problem-solving. While this could align with computer science to some degree, I believe it aligns more strongly with agricultural and veterinary science.

His curiosity about plants and love for animals, combined with his intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication, seem to point more towards a field involving the study and care of living things. Agricultural and veterinary science would allow him to directly engage with nature, plants, and animals in his studies and work.

Computer science certainly involves problem-solving and abstract concepts, which could appeal to him, but the sketch overall paints a picture of someone more drawn to the natural world. So I estimate a higher probability for agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science, while acknowledging that both are possible based on his traits and interests.
