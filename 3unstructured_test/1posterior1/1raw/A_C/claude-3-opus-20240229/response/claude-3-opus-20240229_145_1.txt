Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Based on Adam's personality sketch, he seems to have a strong interest in and appreciation for nature, plants, and animals. His empathy and love for animals in particular suggest he may be drawn to veterinary science. His curiosity about nature and plants could also fit with studies in agriculture. So I estimate a relatively high 60% chance he specialized in agricultural or veterinary science.

His high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of puzzles suggests he could also be a fit for computer science. However, the sketch focuses more on his interest in the natural world than technology or mathematics. So while I think there is a decent chance he studied computer science, I estimate it as a lower 30% probability compared to agricultural and veterinary fields.

Of course, there are many other graduate fields he could have specialized in. But based solely on the given personality information, those are my best estimates of the relative probabilities of the two specified options.
