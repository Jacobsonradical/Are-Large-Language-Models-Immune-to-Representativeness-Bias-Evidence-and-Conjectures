Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has a strong interest in and appreciation for nature, plants, and animals, as well as a deep empathy. This aligns well with a specialization in agricultural and veterinary science.

While Adam is described as highly intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, which could fit with computer science, his specific interests seem more aligned with agricultural and veterinary science. Of course, there is still some probability that he studied computer science.
