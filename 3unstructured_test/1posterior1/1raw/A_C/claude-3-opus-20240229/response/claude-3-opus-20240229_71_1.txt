Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Based on Adam's strong interest in nature, plants and animals, as well as his warm heart and empathy, I believe it is more likely he chose to pursue graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could lend themselves to either field. But his specific curiosity about plants and deep love of animals makes me think he was more drawn to veterinary and agricultural studies. That said, computer science is a very popular graduate field, so I still assign a 30% chance he may have chosen that path.
