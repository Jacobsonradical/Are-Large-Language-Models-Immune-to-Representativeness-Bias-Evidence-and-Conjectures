Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Based on Adam's strong interest in nature, plants and animals, as well as his empathy and love for animals, I believe there is a fairly high probability (around 60%) that he was studying agricultural and veterinary science.

His intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and aptitude for problem-solving also suggest a reasonable probability (around 30%) that he could have been studying computer science. However, I weighted this lower than agricultural and veterinary science since his personality description emphasized more of an affinity for nature and animals.

Of course, these are just rough estimates based on limited information. There are many other graduate fields he could have specialized in as well.
