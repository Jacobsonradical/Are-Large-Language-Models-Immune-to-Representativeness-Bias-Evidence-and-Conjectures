Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Based on Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants and animals, as well as his strong empathy and love for animals, I believe there is a reasonably high probability (around 60%) that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

His high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles also suggest a moderate probability (around 30%) that he could have been enrolled in computer science.

Of course, there are many other graduate fields he could have specialized in given his traits. But those are my best estimates for the two fields specified based on the personality sketch provided.
