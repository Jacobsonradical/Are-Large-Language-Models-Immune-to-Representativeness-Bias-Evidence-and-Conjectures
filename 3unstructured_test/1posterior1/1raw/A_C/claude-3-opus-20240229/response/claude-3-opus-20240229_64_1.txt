Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love of nature, plants and animals along with his dedication and work ethic suggest a high probability that he would pursue agricultural or veterinary studies. His intelligence and skill with abstract concepts also make computer science a reasonable possibility, but the personality description overall seems to align more with agricultural/veterinary fields.
