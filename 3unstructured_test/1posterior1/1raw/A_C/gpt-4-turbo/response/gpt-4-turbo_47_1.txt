Based on the personality sketch provided, here is the estimation:

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and various plants, along with his deep love for animals, strongly correlates with interests typically nurtured in fields like agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts also complement the often complex, scientific aspects required in these areas. 

However, his enjoyment in solving puzzles and capability with abstract concepts could also align well with computer science, a field that highly values problem-solving skills and abstract reasoning. 

Considering these points, here are the estimated probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

These values reflect a more significant leaning towards agricultural and veterinary sciences due to his interests in nature and animals but still acknowledge a substantial possibility of Adam being involved in computer science due to his problem-solving abilities and intelligence.
