Estimating the probability of Adam's field of study based on his personality and interests involves considering various aspects mentioned in the sketch. His curiosity about nature and love for animals could indicate a higher likelihood of studying agricultural and veterinary science. His skill in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts could also suggest a fit for computer science, a field that often requires analytical and problem-solving skills. 

However, his specific mention of a warmth towards nature and animals might slightly tilt the likelihood towards a field directly related to these interests. Thus, my estimates would be:

{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

These values reflect a higher likelihood for agricultural and veterinary science based on Adam's characteristics and a significant but lesser likelihood for computer science, considering his abstract and analytical skills.
