Based on Adam's personality sketch where he demonstrates a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals, the likelihood is higher that he might be inclined toward fields related to biology, environmental science, agriculture, or veterinary studies. His traits such as high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts would also support his ability to perform well in any graduate study, including computer science, but his personal interests skew more towards nature and animal-related fields rather than the more analytical and technical nature of computer science.

Here's an estimated probability for Adam's enrollment based on the given description:

{
  "computer science": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
