Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, here are the estimated probabilities for his fields of enrollment:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field is closely aligned with Adam's curiosity about nature and various plants, as well as his love for animals. These interests are key characteristics of someone likely to be engaged in agricultural or veterinary studies, which involve extensive study of flora, fauna, and often the environment. Given these traits, there is a relatively high probability that Adam might have chosen this field.

2. **Computer Science**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is noted to be of high intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts. These attributes are beneficial for a field like computer science, which involves problem-solving, logic, and an understanding complex systems. Therefore, this field might also be a likely choice for him, albeit to a lesser but significant extent compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

Given this analysis, I estimate the probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
``` 

These values reflect that while both fields could appeal to Adam based on his interests and skills, his closer alignment with nature and animals suggests a stronger likelihood towards agricultural and veterinary science.
