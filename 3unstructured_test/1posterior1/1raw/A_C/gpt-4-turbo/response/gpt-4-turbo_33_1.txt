Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, who has a strong curiosity about nature and a deep love for animals, it seems more likely that he would pursue a field closely related to these interests. Agricultural and veterinary sciences are fields that align well with his love for plants and animals.

Additionally, you noted that Adam is good at solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, which could suggest aptitude for more analytical or technically challenging fields such as computer science. However, the mention of his specific interests in nature and animals appears more directly relevant to agricultural and veterinary sciences rather than computer science.

Using these insights, here's an estimate of the probability for Adam's field of study:

{
  "computer science": "0.30",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.70"
}

The values reflect a higher probability for agricultural and veterinary sciences due to the direct mention of his interests in nature and animals, whereas computer science, though feasible given his intellectual abilities, seems less directly aligned with his stated passions.
