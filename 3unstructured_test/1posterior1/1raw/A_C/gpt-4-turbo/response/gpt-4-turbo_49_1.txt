Based on the personality sketch of Adam highlighted in your query, here's an analysis for estimating the probability of his enrollment in specific graduate fields:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and its plants, along with his deep love for animals, suggests a strong alignment with the fields of agriculture and veterinary science. These subjects directly correspond to his interests and empathy for living beings, making it highly probable that he might be pursuing a graduate program in one of these areas. Thus, the estimated probability that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is higher.

2. **Computer Science**: While Adam enjoys solving puzzles, which can be somewhat related to problem-solving skills required in computer science, and he has high intelligence suitable for understanding abstract concepts common in computer science, the direct linkage to this specific field is less prominent compared to his interest in nature and animals. Accordingly, while plausible, his enrollment in computer science is likely but with a lower probability compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

Given these observations, the estimated probabilities are as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
``` 

These values reflect a reasoned estimate based on the personality traits and interests described, recognizing that actual probabilities could vary depending on other unmentioned factors or interests.
