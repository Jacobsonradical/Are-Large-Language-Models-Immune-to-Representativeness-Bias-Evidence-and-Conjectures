Based on the personality sketch of Adam, here's the estimation:

- Adam's interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with the analytical and problem-solving skills required in computer science.
- His deep love for animals, strong empathy, and curiosity about nature align closely with agricultural and veterinary science.

Based on these insights, estimated probabilities within the broad universe of graduate programs might be:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.4"
}
```

This estimation reflects the match between Adam's interests and the typical skills associated with each field, but does not sum to 1 as there are many other possible fields of study.
