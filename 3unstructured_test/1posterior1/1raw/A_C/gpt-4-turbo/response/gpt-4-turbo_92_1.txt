Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, here is my estimate of the probability of his enrollment in each specified field:

- Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals are traits that strongly align with interests typically found in students of agricultural and veterinary science. These subjects often attract individuals passionate about flora, fauna, and the environment, which matches Adam's interests.
  
- His enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence, along with an ability to understand abstract concepts, are indicative of qualities that are highly valuable in computer science. These traits synergize well with the logical and problem-solving aspects of the field.

Given this information, I would estimate the probabilities as follows:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.6"
} 

These values reflect my analysis based on the interests and capabilities as described, though it's important to note that there could be other fields he might be involved in as well, given the broad applicability of his traits.
