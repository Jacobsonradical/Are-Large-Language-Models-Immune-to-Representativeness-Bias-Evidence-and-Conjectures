Based on the information provided about Adam's interests and characteristics, I can make the following estimates:

- Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, as well as his deep love for animals, aligns more closely with fields related to biology or environmental science, specifically agricultural and veterinary science.
- While his qualities such as being good at solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts could be relevant to computer science, the direct link to his interests as stated appears weaker compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

Therefore, the approximate probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
