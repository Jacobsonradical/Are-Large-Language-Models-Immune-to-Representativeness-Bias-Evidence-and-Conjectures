Based on Adam's described interests and characteristics, here is an estimation of the probability that he was enrolled in each of the specified fields of study:

- His genuine curiosity about nature and various plants, along with a deep love for animals, strongly supports the possibility that he was involved in agricultural and veterinary science. This field directly aligns with his affinities and would likely be a strong fit for his interests.

- His enjoyment of solving puzzles and good understanding of abstract concepts may also align well with computer science, a field that often requires strong problem-solving skills and abstract thinking.

Considering these aspects, the probabilities are estimated as follows:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.6"
} 

These values reflect a higher likelihood for agricultural and veterinary science due to a clearer connection with his interests in nature and animals, and a significant yet slightly lower probability for computer science, considering his intellectual tendencies and problem-solving skills.
