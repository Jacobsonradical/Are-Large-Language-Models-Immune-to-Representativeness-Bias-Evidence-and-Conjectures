Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, including his interests and characteristics, I would estimate the following probabilities for his graduate fields of study:

{
  "computer science": "0.35",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.55"
}

These estimates consider Adam's interest in puzzles and abstract concepts, which align well with computer science, as well as his love for animals and nature, which is closely related to agricultural and veterinary science.
