Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam has a distinct curiosity about nature and a deep love for animals. This interest aligns strongly with fields that directly involve nature and animal studies, such as agricultural and veterinary science. His empathy and warm heart further support an inclination towards caring professions like veterinary medicine. 

On the other hand, his interest in solving puzzles and strong ability in understanding abstract concepts might also suggest a capability and interest in fields like computer science, which require logical reasoning and problem-solving skills.

Given these insights, the probabilities could be estimated as follows:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

These estimations reflect Adam's higher compatibility with agricultural and veterinary sciences, due to his love for nature and animals, and a significant, but slightly lower probability for computer science, recognizing his intellectual abilities and puzzle-solving interest.
