This estimation is based on Adam's traits and interests described in the sketch. His enjoyment of puzzles and high intelligence aligns well with the intellectual demands of computer science. However, his genuine curiosity about nature, plants, strong empathy, and deep love for animals might more strongly indicate a higher probability of studying agricultural and veterinary science. Thus, the estimation leans more towards agricultural and veterinary science than computer science.
