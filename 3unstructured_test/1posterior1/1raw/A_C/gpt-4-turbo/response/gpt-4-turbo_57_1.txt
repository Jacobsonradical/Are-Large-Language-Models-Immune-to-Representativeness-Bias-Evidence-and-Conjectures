Given the personality sketch provided, let's assess the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science or agricultural and veterinary science based on the interests and characteristics described.

1. **Computer Science**: Adam's interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence, attributes common in individuals who thrive in fields requiring analytical thinking and problem-solving like computer science. However, there is no direct mention of an affinity for technology, programming, or related activities. This detail slightly lowers the probability.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and various plants, alongside a deep love for animals, intuitively aligns more with a field like agricultural or veterinary science. This field directly involves studying plant and animal life, which seems to fit well with Adam's described interests.

Based on this analysis, here are the probabilities:
