Based on the personality sketch of Adam and his interests, here is the estimated probability of his enrollment in the specified fields:

{
  "computer science": "0.35",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.65"
}

Explanation:
- The higher probability for agricultural and veterinary science (0.65) is due to Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and various plants, along with his deep love for animals. These interests align closely with fields like botany, environmental science, or veterinary studies more than computer science.
- The probability for computer science (0.35) is assigned due to his enjoyment in solving puzzles and high intelligence, which can also be highly applicable in fields like computer science, especially in areas that lean towards problem-solving and abstract thinking such as theoretical computer science or algorithm design. However, this interest seems secondary to his naturalist inclinations.
