Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description heavily emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals. This, combined with his empathy and understanding of hard work (often associated with these fields), makes a strong case for a graduate degree in agricultural or veterinary science.
* **Computer Science:** While Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his high intelligence could point towards computer science, there's no direct mention of technology or programming.  His abstract thinking abilities are valuable in many fields, not just computer science. 

**Important Note:** This is a speculative assessment based on limited information.  Personality sketches provide clues but not definitive answers about someone's field of study.
