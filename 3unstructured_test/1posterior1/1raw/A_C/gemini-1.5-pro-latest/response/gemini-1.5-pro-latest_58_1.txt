Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly suggests this field.  Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, combined with his empathy, makes this a highly likely area of study. 
* **Computer Science:** While Adam's intelligence and problem-solving skills could point towards computer science, there's nothing specifically in the description to indicate a strong interest in technology or programming.  His love for nature makes fields directly related to it more probable. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are based on a brief personality sketch. Actual enrollment choices are influenced by a much wider range of factors.
