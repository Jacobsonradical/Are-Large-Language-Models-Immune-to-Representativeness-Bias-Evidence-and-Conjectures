Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication strongly suggests an affinity for fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary science. 
* **Computer Science:** While Adam's intelligence and ability with abstract concepts could point towards computer science, the description lacks strong indicators like a passion for technology, problem-solving using algorithms, or building systems. 

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches offer limited information.  Many other fields could also be a good fit for Adam. This assessment is purely probabilistic based on the provided text.
