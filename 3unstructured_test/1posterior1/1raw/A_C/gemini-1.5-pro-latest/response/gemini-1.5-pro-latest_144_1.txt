  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:** Adam's love for animals, interest in plants, and appreciation for hard work strongly suggest a high probability of being in this field. 
* **Computer science:** While Adam's intelligence and ability to grasp abstract concepts are consistent with computer science, his personality sketch lacks strong indicators typically associated with this field (e.g., interest in technology, programming, etc.). However, his puzzle-solving abilities could translate to an interest in the problem-solving aspects of computer science. Thus, the probability is moderate but lower than agricultural and veterinary science.
