Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):**  Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly suggests an affinity for fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary science.  His intelligence and ability to grasp abstract concepts are also valuable in these fields. 

* **Computer Science (0.4):** While Adam's puzzle-solving skills and intelligence could point towards computer science, the description lacks strong indicators typically associated with the field (e.g., interest in technology, programming, or systems).  However,  his ability to understand abstract concepts is valuable in computer science, hence a moderate probability.
