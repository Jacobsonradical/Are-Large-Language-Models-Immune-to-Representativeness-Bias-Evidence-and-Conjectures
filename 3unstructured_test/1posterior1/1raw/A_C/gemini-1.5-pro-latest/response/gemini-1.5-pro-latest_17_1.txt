Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's love for nature, animals, and his understanding of hard work and dedication strongly suggest an inclination towards fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary science. 
* **Computer Science:**  While Adam's puzzle-solving skills and intelligence could point towards computer science, the description lacks specific indicators like an interest in technology, programming, or problem-solving using computational methods. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are speculative and based solely on a brief personality sketch. Many other fields could also be a good fit for Adam.  His actual field of study could be influenced by a multitude of factors not mentioned in the description.
