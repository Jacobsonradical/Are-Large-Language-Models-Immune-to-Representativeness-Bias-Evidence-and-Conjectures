Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the description:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):**  Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals makes fields like botany, agriculture, or veterinary medicine highly probable. His intelligence and ability to grasp abstract concepts would also serve him well in these areas. 

* **Computer Science (0.4):**  While not as strong a match, Adam's puzzle-solving aptitude and intelligence could point to an interest in computer science. This field often attracts individuals who enjoy problem-solving and abstract thinking. However, the personality sketch lacks direct indicators like an interest in technology or programming.
