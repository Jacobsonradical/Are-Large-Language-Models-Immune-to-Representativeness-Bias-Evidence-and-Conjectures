Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the description of Adam:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:**  Adam's love for nature, animals, and his understanding of hard work and dedication strongly suggest an affinity for agricultural and veterinary sciences.  These fields align well with his core interests. 
* **Computer science:** While Adam's intelligence and ability to grasp abstract concepts could point towards computer science, the description lacks any direct indication of an interest in technology, programming, or related areas. 

**Important Note:** This is just a probabilistic estimate based on limited information.  Many other fields could also be a good fit for Adam. For example, he might be interested in environmental science, biology, or even something like philosophy (given his contemplative nature).
