Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):**  Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals strongly suggests an affinity for these fields. His empathy and warm heart further support this, aligning with careers focused on animal care or agricultural sustainability. 
* **Computer Science (0.4):** While Adam's puzzle-solving skills and intelligence could point towards computer science, the description lacks clear indicators of a passion for technology, programming, or computational thinking.  His abstract thinking ability is valuable in computer science, but not exclusive to it. 

**Important Note:** This assessment is based solely on a brief personality sketch.  Many other fields could be just as likely, and individual interests can be far more complex than a short description can capture.
