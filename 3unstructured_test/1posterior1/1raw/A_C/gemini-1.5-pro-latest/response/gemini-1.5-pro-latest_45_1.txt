**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's puzzle-solving ability and high intelligence correlate well with computer science. His understanding of abstract concepts further supports this possibility. 
* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's love for animals and curiosity about plants strongly suggest an affinity for agricultural and veterinary science. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are just estimates based on a brief personality sketch. Many other graduate fields could also be good fits for Adam. Without more information about his specific interests and experiences, it's impossible to provide more precise probabilities.
