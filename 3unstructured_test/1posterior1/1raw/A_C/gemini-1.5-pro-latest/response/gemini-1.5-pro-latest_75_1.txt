Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts aligns well with computer science. His high intelligence further supports this possibility. 
* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**  His love for nature, plants, and animals strongly suggests an affinity for agricultural and veterinary science.  

**Important Note:**  While the description leans slightly towards agricultural and veterinary science, it's crucial to remember that personality traits alone cannot definitively determine someone's field of study. Many other factors influence this choice, including personal experiences, career goals, and opportunities.
