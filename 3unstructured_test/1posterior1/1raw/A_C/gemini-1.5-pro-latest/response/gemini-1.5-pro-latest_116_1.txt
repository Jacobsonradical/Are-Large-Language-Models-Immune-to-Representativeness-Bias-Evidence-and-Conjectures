Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work strongly suggest an inclination towards fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary science. 
* **Computer Science:** While Adam's puzzle-solving ability and intelligence could point towards computer science, the description lacks strong indicators like an interest in technology, programming, or abstract systems. His empathy and warmth, while not exclusive from the field, are less commonly associated with it compared to life sciences.

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative assessment. Personality offers limited insight into academic choices. Many other factors influence a person's field of study, including:

* **Specific interests:**  A passion for specific animals, a fascination with algorithms, or a desire to develop new technologies would heavily influence his choice.
* **Career goals:** Aspiring to be a veterinarian, a data scientist, or a researcher would lead to different paths.
* **Opportunities and experiences:** Exposure to role models, internships, or specific courses can significantly shape academic decisions.
