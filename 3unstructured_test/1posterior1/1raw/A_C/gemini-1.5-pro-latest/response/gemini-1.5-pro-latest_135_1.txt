Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.75",
  "computer science": "0.35"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (High Probability):** The description heavily leans towards interests aligning with this field:
    * **"Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants"**:  Directly relates to agriculture and plant science.
    * **"Deep love for animals"**:  A strong indicator of potential interest in veterinary science. 
    * **"Warm heart, strong empathy"**:  Desirable traits for working with animals and understanding their needs.

* **Computer Science (Moderate Probability):** While not as strong a connection as with agricultural sciences, some aspects hint at a possible fit:
    * **"Enjoys solving puzzles"**:  Problem-solving is central to computer science.
    * **"High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts"**: These are valuable traits for computer science studies.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that personality is just one factor in choosing a field of study.  Other elements like specific skills, experiences, and career goals also play significant roles.
