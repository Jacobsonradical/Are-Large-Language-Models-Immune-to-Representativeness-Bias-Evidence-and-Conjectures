Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7 Probability):**  Adam's love for nature, animals, and his understanding of hard work strongly suggest an affinity for fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary medicine. These are common areas of study within agricultural and veterinary sciences. 
* **Computer Science (0.3 Probability):** While Adam's puzzle-solving skills and intelligence could point towards computer science, there's no direct mention of technology or programming interests. His empathy and love for nature seem to lean his profile more towards life sciences. 

**Important Note:** Personality sketches provide limited information.  Many other graduate fields could also be a good fit for Adam. The probabilities given are informed estimates based on the provided description.
