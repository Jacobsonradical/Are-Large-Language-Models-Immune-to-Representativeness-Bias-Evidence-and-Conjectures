Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly suggests an affinity for agricultural or veterinary fields. This makes it the more probable option.

* **Computer Science:** While Adam's puzzle-solving ability and intelligence could point towards computer science, the description lacks strong indicators like an interest in technology, programming, or problem-solving using computational methods. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on a limited personality sketch.  Many other fields could also be a good fit for Adam. For a more accurate assessment, we'd need more information about his interests, experiences, and goals.
