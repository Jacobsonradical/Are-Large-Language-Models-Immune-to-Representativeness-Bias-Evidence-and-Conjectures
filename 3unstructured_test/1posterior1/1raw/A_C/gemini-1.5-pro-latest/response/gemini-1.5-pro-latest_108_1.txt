Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly suggests this field.  Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, combined with his empathy, makes this a very likely area of study. 
* **Computer Science:** While not impossible, the description leans more towards natural sciences.  However, Adam's intelligence, puzzle-solving ability, and understanding of abstract concepts could point towards computer science.  

**Important Note:** Personality sketches offer limited information.  Many other graduate fields could also be a good fit for Adam.
