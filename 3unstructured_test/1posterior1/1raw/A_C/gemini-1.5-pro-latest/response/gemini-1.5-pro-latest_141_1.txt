**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** Adam's love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants, and appreciation for hard work strongly suggest a high probability of him pursuing agricultural or veterinary science. 
* **Computer Science (0.4):** While Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and ability to understand abstract concepts could point towards computer science, the personality sketch lacks clear indicators like an interest in technology or programming. His other traits align more strongly with fields focused on the natural world. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are simply educated guesses based on a limited personality sketch. There is a chance Adam could be in a completely different field, or even pursuing both.  Without more information, it's impossible to be definitive.
