Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly suggests an affinity for agricultural and veterinary fields. His intelligence and ability to grasp abstract concepts would also serve him well in these areas. 

* **Computer science:** While Adam's puzzle-solving skills and intelligence could point towards computer science, the description lacks clear indicators of a passion for technology, programming, or computational thinking.  

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches offer limited information.  These probabilities are simply educated guesses. Many other fields could also be a good fit for Adam.
