Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly suggests an affinity for agricultural or veterinary fields. 
* **Computer Science:** While Adam's puzzle-solving skills and intelligence could point towards computer science, his other traits (love for nature, empathy) are less typical for the field.  It's still possible, hence the 0.3 probability. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative estimate based on a brief personality sketch.  Many other fields could also be a good fit for Adam.  Personality traits alone are not a reliable predictor of academic choices.
