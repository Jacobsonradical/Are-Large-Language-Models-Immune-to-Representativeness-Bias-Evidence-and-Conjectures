Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly suggests an affinity for this field. His interest in plants further points towards this being a highly probable field of study. 
* **Computer Science:** While Adam's intelligence and ability with abstract concepts are aligned with computer science, his core personality traits don't strongly point towards this field. His love for nature and animals isn't directly related to computer science. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative estimate based on a limited personality sketch.  Many other fields could also be likely for Adam.  For example, biology, environmental science, or even something like philosophy (given his contemplative nature) are possibilities.
