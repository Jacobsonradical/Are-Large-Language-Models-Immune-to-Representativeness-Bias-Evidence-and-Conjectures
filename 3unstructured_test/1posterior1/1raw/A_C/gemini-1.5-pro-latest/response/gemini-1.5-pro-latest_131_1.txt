Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals strongly suggests an affinity for these fields.  His empathy and warm heart would also be valuable traits in careers focused on animal care or agricultural sustainability. 

* **Computer Science (0.4):** While Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and ability to grasp abstract concepts are consistent with computer science, the description doesn't offer strong indicators of a particular passion for technology or programming. His other traits suggest a more hands-on and nature-oriented disposition. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are speculative and based solely on a brief personality sketch.  Many other fields could also be a good fit for Adam.
