Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (Higher Probability):**  The description strongly suggests a natural affinity for this field:
    *  "Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants" 
    * "Deep love for animals"
* **Computer Science (Moderate Probability):** While not a perfect fit, some traits could apply:
    * "Quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles" - This hints at a problem-solving mindset often found in computer science students.
    * "High intelligence and... understanding abstract concepts" -  These are valuable skills in computer science. 

**Important Note:** Personality sketches offer limited information.  Many other graduate fields could align with Adam's traits. This assessment is simply based on the likelihood within the two provided options.
