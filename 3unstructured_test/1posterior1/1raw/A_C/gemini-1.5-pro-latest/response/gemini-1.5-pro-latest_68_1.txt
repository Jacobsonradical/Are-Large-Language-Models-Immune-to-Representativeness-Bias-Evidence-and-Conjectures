**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work strongly suggest a high probability of being in this field.
* **Computer Science:** While Adam's intelligence and ability with abstract concepts could point towards computer science, the description lacks specific indicators like an interest in technology, programming, or problem-solving related to computers. 

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on a limited personality sketch. Many other fields could also be likely for Adam.
