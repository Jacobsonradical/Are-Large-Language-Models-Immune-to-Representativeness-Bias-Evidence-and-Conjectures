Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication strongly suggest an affinity for agricultural and veterinary sciences. 
* **Computer Science:** While Adam's intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to grasp abstract concepts could point towards computer science, the description lacks specific indicators like an interest in technology, programming, or problem-solving using computational methods.  

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative assessment based on a limited personality sketch.  Many other fields could also be a good fit for Adam.
