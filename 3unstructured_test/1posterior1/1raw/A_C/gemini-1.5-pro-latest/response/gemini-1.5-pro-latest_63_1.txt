Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (higher probability):** Adam's love for animals, curiosity about plants, and appreciation for hard work strongly align with fields like veterinary medicine, animal science, or botany. 
* **Computer Science (moderate probability):** While the description doesn't directly point to computer science, Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his ability to grasp abstract concepts could suggest an aptitude for this field. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative assessment.  Personality traits alone are not reliable predictors of academic choices.  Many other factors influence a person's field of study.
