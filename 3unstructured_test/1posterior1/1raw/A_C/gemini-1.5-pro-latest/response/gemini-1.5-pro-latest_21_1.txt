**Reasoning:**

While the description points to characteristics found in both fields, Adam's love of nature, empathy (often associated with animal care), and appreciation for hard work (often found in hands-on professions) make a career in agricultural and veterinary science more likely. 

However, his intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and understanding of abstract concepts could make computer science a possibility.
