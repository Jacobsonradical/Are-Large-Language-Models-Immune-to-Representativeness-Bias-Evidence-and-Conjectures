Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly suggests a high probability of him being in this field. His intelligence and ability to grasp abstract concepts would also be beneficial.
* **Computer Science:** While Adam's puzzle-solving ability and intelligence could point towards computer science, the description lacks strong indicators typically associated with this field (e.g., interest in technology, programming, etc.).  However, it's not impossible, as abstract thinking is crucial in computer science.

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on a limited personality sketch. Many other fields could also be a good fit for Adam.
