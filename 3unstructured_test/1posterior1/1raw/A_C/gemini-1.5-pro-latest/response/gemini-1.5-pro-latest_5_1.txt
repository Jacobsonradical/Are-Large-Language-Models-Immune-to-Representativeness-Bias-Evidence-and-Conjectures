Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** Adam's love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work strongly suggest a potential interest in fields like veterinary medicine, animal science, or botany. These fields align well with his core personality traits. 

* **Computer Science (0.3):** While Adam's intelligence and ability to grasp abstract concepts could point towards computer science, the description lacks strong indicators typically associated with this field (e.g., interest in technology, programming, problem-solving using computers).  

**Important Notes:**

* **Personality isn't destiny:**  While the description provides clues, it's crucial to remember that personality is just one factor influencing career choice.  
* **Other possibilities:** Many other fields could also be a good fit for Adam (e.g., biology, environmental science). The provided probabilities are not exhaustive.
