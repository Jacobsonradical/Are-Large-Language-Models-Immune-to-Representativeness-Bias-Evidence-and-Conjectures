Here's a breakdown of how we can estimate the probabilities based on the description:

**Computer Science:**

* **Positive Signals:** High intelligence, enjoys solving puzzles, good at understanding abstract concepts. These are strong indicators of aptitude for computer science.
* **Neutral Signals:**  The description doesn't directly contradict a computer science inclination.
* **Overall:**  The personality traits suggest a reasonable likelihood of Adam being in computer science.

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

* **Positive Signals:** Genuine curiosity about nature and plants, deep love for animals. 
* **Neutral Signals:** Other traits like empathy and appreciation for hard work are applicable to many fields.
* **Overall:** The description points towards a strong possibility of Adam being in this field.

**Probability Estimation:**

While it's impossible to be exact, here's a reasonable estimate considering the information:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on limited information. Adam's actual field of study could be influenced by numerous other factors not mentioned in the description.
