**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:** Adam's love for animals, interest in plants, and empathy all point towards a high probability of him being in a field related to agriculture or veterinary science. 
* **Computer science:** While Adam's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts are aligned with computer science, his other traits (love for animals, interest in nature) are less common motivators for that field. However, it's still possible he's interested in areas like bioinformatics, which bridges biology and computer science. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are simply educated guesses based on limited information.  Personality traits alone cannot definitively determine a person's field of study.
