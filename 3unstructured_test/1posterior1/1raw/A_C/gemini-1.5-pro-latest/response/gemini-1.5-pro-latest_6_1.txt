Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's love for animals, curiosity about plants, and appreciation for hard work strongly suggest an affinity for fields related to agriculture or animal care. This makes a graduate program in this area quite likely.
* **Computer Science:** While Adam's intelligence and ability with abstract concepts could point towards computer science, the description lacks specific indicators like an interest in technology, programming, or problem-solving using computational methods.  Therefore, while possible, it's less probable than agricultural and veterinary science based solely on the information provided. 

**Important Notes:**

* These probabilities are subjective estimations based on limited information. 
* People's interests and career paths are complex. There's always a chance Adam could be pursuing something entirely different or a combination of fields.
