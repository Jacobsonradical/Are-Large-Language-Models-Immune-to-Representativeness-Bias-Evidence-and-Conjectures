Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication strongly suggest an affinity for agricultural and veterinary sciences. 
* **Computer science:** While Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and ability with abstract concepts could point towards computer science, the description lacks specific indicators like an interest in technology, programming, or problem-solving using computational methods. 

**Important Note:**  These are just probabilities based on a limited personality sketch.  Adam's actual field of study could be entirely different.  Interests and personality are just one factor in choosing a field of study.
