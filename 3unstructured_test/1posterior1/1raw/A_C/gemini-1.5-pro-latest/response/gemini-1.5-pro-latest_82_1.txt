Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work strongly suggest a high probability of him being in this field. 
* **Computer Science:** While Adam's intelligence and ability with abstract concepts are consistent with computer science, his other traits (love for animals, nature) make it less likely to be his primary field. However, it's not impossible, as he could be pursuing computational biology or a related interdisciplinary field. 

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are based on general personality tendencies and stereotypes. Individual interests are diverse, so it's crucial to remember that this is just an estimation.
