Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly suggests an affinity for this field. His intelligence and ability to grasp abstract concepts would also serve him well. 
* **Computer Science:** While Adam's puzzle-solving ability and intelligence could point towards computer science, the description lacks strong indicators like an interest in technology, programming, or problem-solving using computers. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative estimation. Personality traits alone cannot reliably predict a person's field of study. Many other factors like upbringing, opportunities, and specific interests play a significant role.
