Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on a personality sketch and not concrete data:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly suggest this field.  His intelligence and ability with abstract concepts would also be beneficial.
* **Computer Science:** While Adam's puzzle-solving skills and intelligence could point towards computer science, there's nothing in the sketch directly indicating an interest in technology or programming.  

**Important Note:** Personality sketches offer limited insight.  Many other fields could be equally or even more likely for Adam.  His actual field of study could be influenced by factors not mentioned in the description.
