Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7 Probability):** Adam's love for animals, curiosity about nature, and empathy strongly suggest an affinity for this field. His intelligence and ability to grasp abstract concepts would also be valuable in this area. 

* **Computer Science (0.3 Probability):** While not as strong a match, Adam's puzzle-solving skills and high intelligence could indicate an aptitude for computer science. It's possible he enjoys the problem-solving aspects of programming and technology. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are simply estimations based on a limited personality sketch. Many other graduate fields could also align with Adam's interests and skills.
