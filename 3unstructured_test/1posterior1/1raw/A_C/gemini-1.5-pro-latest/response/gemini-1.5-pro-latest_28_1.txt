Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly suggest an affinity for this field. His intelligence and ability to grasp abstract concepts would be valuable in areas like agricultural research or veterinary medicine. 
* **Computer Science:** While Adam's puzzle-solving skills and intelligence could point towards computer science, his personality sketch lacks strong indicators like a passion for technology or programming. However,  bioinformatics is a growing field that combines biology and computer science. His interest in nature could lead him to this intersection.

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on a personality sketch.  Many other graduate fields could be a good fit for Adam. Without more information about his specific interests and goals, it's impossible to be definitive.
