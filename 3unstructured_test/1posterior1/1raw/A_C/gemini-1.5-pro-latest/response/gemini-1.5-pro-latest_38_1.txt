Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):**  Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly suggest fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary medicine. His intelligence and ability to grasp abstract concepts would also be beneficial in these areas. 

* **Computer Science (0.4):**  While Adam's puzzle-solving skills and intelligence could point towards computer science, the description lacks strong indicators of a passion for technology, programming, or computational thinking. It's possible, but the other traits make agricultural and veterinary science more likely. 

**Important Note:** This is a subjective assessment based on limited information.  Many other fields could also be a good fit for Adam.
