Here's a breakdown of how the personality sketch relates to the fields and the estimated probabilities:

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

* **Positive Signals:** 
    * "Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants" strongly suggests an interest in agriculture or botany.
    * "Deep love for animals" is a clear indicator of potential interest in veterinary science. 

* **Neutral Signals:**
    *  The other traits (puzzle-solving, empathy, intelligence) could apply to many fields.

**Computer Science**

* **Positive Signals:**
    * "Enjoys solving puzzles" and "good at understanding abstract concepts" are common traits among those drawn to computer science.
    * "High intelligence" is often found in successful computer science students.

* **Neutral Signals:**
    *  The other traits (love of nature, empathy) don't strongly suggest or contradict an interest in computer science.

**Probabilities:**

Based on the above, here's my assessment:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Adam's affinity for nature and animals makes agricultural and veterinary science significantly more likely. While he possesses traits suitable for computer science, they are not as uniquely strong indicators as those pointing towards the natural sciences.
