Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):**  Adam's love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work strongly suggest an affinity for fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary science.  
* **Computer Science (0.4):** While Adam's puzzle-solving skills and intelligence could indicate an aptitude for computer science, the description lacks specific markers like an interest in technology, programming, or abstract systems. His other traits make fields related to nature seem more probable.
