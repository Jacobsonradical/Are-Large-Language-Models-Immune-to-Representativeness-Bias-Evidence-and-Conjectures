Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly suggests an affinity for these fields.  His intelligence and ability with abstract concepts would also be beneficial. 
* **Computer science:** While Adam's puzzle-solving ability and intelligence could point towards computer science, the description lacks strong indicators like an interest in technology, programming, or systems. However, it's not impossible, as his analytical skills could translate to this field. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are speculative and based solely on a brief personality sketch. Many other fields could be equally or even more likely for Adam.
