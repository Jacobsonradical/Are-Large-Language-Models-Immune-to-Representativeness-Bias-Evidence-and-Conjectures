Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work strongly suggest an affinity for fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary science. 
* **Computer Science:** While Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and high intelligence could point towards computer science, the description lacks strong indicators like an interest in technology, programming, or problem-solving using computational methods. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative estimate. Personality sketches provide limited information, and many other fields could also be a good fit for Adam.
