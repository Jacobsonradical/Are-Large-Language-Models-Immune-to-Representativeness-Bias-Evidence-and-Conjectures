Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly suggest an affinity for agricultural and veterinary fields. This combination makes it quite likely he might be in this field. 
* **Computer Science:** While Adam's intelligence and ability with abstract concepts could point towards computer science, the description lacks explicit markers like an interest in technology, programming, or problem-solving using computational methods. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are speculative.  Personality sketches offer limited information, and many individuals with Adam's traits might be found in other fields entirely (biology, environmental science, etc.).
