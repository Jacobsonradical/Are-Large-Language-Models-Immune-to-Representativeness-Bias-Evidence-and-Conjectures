Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals strongly suggests an affinity for this field. His empathy and warm heart further support this possibility.

* **Computer Science:** While Adam's intelligence and ability with abstract concepts could point towards computer science, the description lacks specific indicators like an interest in technology, programming, or problem-solving using computational methods. 

**Important Note:**  These are just probabilities based on limited information. Many other fields could also be a good fit for Adam.  His actual field of study could be influenced by factors not mentioned in the personality sketch.
