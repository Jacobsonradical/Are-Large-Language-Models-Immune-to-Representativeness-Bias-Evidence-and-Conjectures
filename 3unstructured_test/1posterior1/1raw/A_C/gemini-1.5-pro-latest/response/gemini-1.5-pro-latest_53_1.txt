Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's love for nature, animals, and his understanding of hard work strongly suggests an affinity for agricultural or veterinary sciences. These fields align well with his core interests.

* **Computer Science:** While Adam's intelligence and ability with abstract concepts could point towards computer science, the description lacks specific indicators like an interest in technology, programming, or problem-solving using computational methods. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on limited information.  Many other fields could also be a good fit for Adam. For example, biology, environmental science, or even fields like philosophy (given his appreciation for abstract concepts) could be possibilities.
