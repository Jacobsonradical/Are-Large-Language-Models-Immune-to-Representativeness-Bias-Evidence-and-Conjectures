Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Fit with Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication strongly suggest an affinity for agricultural and veterinary sciences.  His intelligence and ability with abstract concepts would also be valuable in these fields.
* **Possible Fit with Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and intelligence indicate a potential aptitude for computer science. However, the personality sketch lacks strong indicators like an interest in technology, programming, or problem-solving using computational methods.

**Important Note:** This assessment is based solely on a brief personality sketch. Actual probabilities could be influenced by a multitude of factors not mentioned in the description.
