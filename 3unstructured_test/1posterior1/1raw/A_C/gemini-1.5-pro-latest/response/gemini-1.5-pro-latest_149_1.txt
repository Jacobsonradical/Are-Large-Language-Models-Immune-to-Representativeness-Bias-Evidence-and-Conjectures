Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the description:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work (often associated with these fields) makes this a strong possibility. 
* **Computer Science:** While not directly mentioned, his enjoyment of puzzles and ability with abstract concepts could point towards an interest in computer science.  

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses.  Without more information about Adam's specific interests, skills, or career aspirations, it's impossible to be definitive.
