Here's a breakdown of how the personality sketch relates to the fields and the estimated probabilities:

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

* **Strong Fit:** "Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants," "deep love for animals,"  suggest a strong inclination towards these fields. 
* **Potentially Less Fitting:**  While intelligence and abstract thinking are valuable in these fields, the description emphasizes empathy and love for living things, which might point towards more hands-on specializations.

**Computer Science:**

* **Strong Fit:** "Quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles," "high intelligence," and "good at understanding abstract concepts" are all strong indicators of aptitude for computer science. 
* **Potential Lack of Fit:** There's no direct mention of an interest in technology or programming, which are central to computer science.

**Estimated Probabilities:**

Considering the analysis above:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Important Note:** These probabilities are based on a brief personality sketch.  Many other factors influence a person's field of study, including personal experiences, opportunities, and specific interests within a field.
