Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly suggests an inclination towards fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary science. 
* **Computer Science (0.4):** While Adam's puzzle-solving skills and intelligence could point towards computer science, the description lacks strong indicators like an interest in technology, programming, or abstract systems. However, it's still possible he finds computational challenges stimulating. 

**Important Note:**  These are just educated guesses based on a limited personality sketch.  Many other graduate fields could align with Adam's interests. For example, he might be studying environmental science, biology, psychology, or even something like data science applied to agriculture.
