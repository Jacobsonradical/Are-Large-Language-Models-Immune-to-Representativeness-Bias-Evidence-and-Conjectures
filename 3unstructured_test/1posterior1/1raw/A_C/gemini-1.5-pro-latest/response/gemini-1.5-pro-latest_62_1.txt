Here's a breakdown of how we can estimate the probabilities based on Adam's personality:

**Analysis**

* **Curiosity about nature and plants:** This points strongly towards agricultural and veterinary science. 
* **Quiet, puzzle-solver, good with abstract concepts:**  These traits are common in computer science students.
* **Warm heart, strong empathy, love for animals:** These could apply to either field, though they might be slightly more common in someone drawn to working with animals.

**Probability Estimation (It's important to remember these are educated guesses, not certainties)**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's personality suggests he *could* thrive in computer science, but there's no direct link to the field in his description.  Let's estimate a moderate probability.
* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**  The description directly mentions his interest in nature and plants, making this field significantly more likely.
