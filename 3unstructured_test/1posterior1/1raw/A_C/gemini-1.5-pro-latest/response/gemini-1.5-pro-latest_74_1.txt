Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication strongly suggest an affinity for fields like agriculture or veterinary science.  
* **Computer science:** While Adam's intelligence and ability with abstract concepts are consistent with computer science, the description lacks specific indicators like an interest in technology, programming, or problem-solving using computers. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative assessment based on a limited personality sketch.  Many other fields could also be a good fit for Adam.
