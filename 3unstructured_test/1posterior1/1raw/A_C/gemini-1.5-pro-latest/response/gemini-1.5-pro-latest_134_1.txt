Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the description:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**  Adam's love for nature, animals, and his understanding of hard work (often associated with these fields) strongly suggest a higher probability of him being in this area. 
* **Computer Science:** While his puzzle-solving skills and intelligence could indicate an aptitude for computer science, the description lacks specific markers like an interest in technology, programming, or abstract systems. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are speculative.  Personality sketches offer limited information. Many other fields could also be a good fit for Adam.
