Here's my best estimate of the probabilities based on the personality description:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.75",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (High Probability):**  The description strongly suggests this field. Adam's love for animals, curiosity about plants, and appreciation for hard work align well with careers in veterinary medicine, animal science, or agricultural research. 
* **Computer Science (Moderate Probability):** While Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and ability with abstract concepts could indicate an aptitude for computer science, the description lacks direct links to technology or programming.  His other traits suggest he might find more fulfillment in fields with a direct connection to nature and living things.

**Important Note:** Personality sketches provide limited information. Many other factors influence a person's field of study. These probabilities are just educated guesses based on the provided text.
