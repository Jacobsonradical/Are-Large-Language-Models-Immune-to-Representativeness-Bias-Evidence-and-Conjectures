Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7 Probability):**  Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals strongly suggests an affinity for this field. His empathy and warm heart further support this, indicating a potential interest in animal welfare or sustainable agriculture.

* **Computer Science (0.3 Probability):** While the description doesn't directly point to computer science, Adam's intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to grasp abstract concepts are all traits found in successful computer scientists. It's plausible he finds beauty in the logic and problem-solving aspects of the field.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are subjective estimations based on limited information. A person's chosen field of study is influenced by a complex interplay of factors beyond personality traits.
