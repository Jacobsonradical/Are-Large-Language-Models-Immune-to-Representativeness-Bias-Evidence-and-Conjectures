Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly suggests an affinity for this field. His intelligence and ability to grasp abstract concepts would serve him well in research or practical applications within this area.

* **Computer Science (0.3):** While the description doesn't directly point to computer science, Adam's puzzle-solving ability and intelligence mean it's still a possibility.  Some aspects of computer science, like bioinformatics or AI applications related to nature, could align with his interests. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative exercise. Personality sketches offer limited information, and many other graduate fields could be equally likely for Adam.
