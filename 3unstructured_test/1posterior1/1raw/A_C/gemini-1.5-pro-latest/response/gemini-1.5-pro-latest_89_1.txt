Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):**  The description heavily emphasizes Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals. This suggests a strong inclination towards a field related to these areas.  His empathy and warm heart further support this possibility.

* **Computer Science (0.3):** While the description doesn't directly point to computer science, Adam's intelligence, enjoyment of puzzles, and ability to grasp abstract concepts are traits often found in individuals drawn to this field. However, the lack of any specific mention of technology or computers makes it less likely than agricultural and veterinary science.
