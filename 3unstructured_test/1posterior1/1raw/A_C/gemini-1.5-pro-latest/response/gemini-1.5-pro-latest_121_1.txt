Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication strongly suggests an affinity for agricultural and veterinary sciences. 
* **Computer science:** While Adam's intelligence and ability with abstract concepts could point towards computer science, the description lacks specific indicators like an interest in technology, programming, or problem-solving using computational methods.  

**Important Note:** This is just a probabilistic estimation based on limited information.  Many other fields could also be a good fit for Adam. For a more accurate assessment, we would need additional information about his interests, skills, and aspirations.
