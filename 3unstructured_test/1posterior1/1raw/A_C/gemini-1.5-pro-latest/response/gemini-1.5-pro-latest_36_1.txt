Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication strongly suggest an affinity for this field. His intelligence and ability to grasp abstract concepts would also be beneficial. 
* **Computer science:** While Adam's puzzle-solving skills and intelligence could point towards computer science, the description lacks clear indicators of a strong interest in technology, programming, or computational thinking.  

**Important Note:** These probabilities are speculative and based solely on a brief personality sketch.  Many other fields could be equally fitting for Adam.
