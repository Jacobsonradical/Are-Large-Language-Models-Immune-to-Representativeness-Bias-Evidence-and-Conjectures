Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding plants strongly suggests an affinity for agricultural and veterinary science. This field aligns well with his core interests.
* **Computer Science:** While Adam's high intelligence and puzzle-solving abilities could point towards computer science, the description lacks any direct connection to technology, programming, or related fields.  His empathy and warmth, while not exclusive to any field, might be less typical of the stereotypical image of someone drawn to computer science.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are speculative. Personality sketches offer limited information, and many other fields could also be a good fit for Adam.
