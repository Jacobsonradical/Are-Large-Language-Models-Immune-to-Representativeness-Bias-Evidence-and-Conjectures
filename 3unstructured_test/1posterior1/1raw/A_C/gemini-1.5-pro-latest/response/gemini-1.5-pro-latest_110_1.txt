Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication strongly suggest an affinity for agricultural and veterinary sciences. This field aligns well with his core interests.

* **Computer Science:** While Adam's intelligence and ability to grasp abstract concepts are valuable traits in computer science, his personality sketch lacks clear indicators of a passion for technology, programming, or computational thinking.  It's possible his puzzle-solving skills could translate, so the probability isn't extremely low. 

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are speculative.  Personality sketches provide limited information, and many other fields could also be a good fit for Adam.
