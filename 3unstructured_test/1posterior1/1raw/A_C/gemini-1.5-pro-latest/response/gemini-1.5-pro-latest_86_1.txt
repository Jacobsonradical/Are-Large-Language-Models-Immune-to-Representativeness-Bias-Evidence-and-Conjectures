Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals strongly suggests an affinity for these fields. His empathy and warm heart further support this likelihood. 
* **Computer Science:** While Adam's intelligence and ability with abstract concepts are consistent with computer science, the description lacks direct indicators like an interest in technology, programming, or problem-solving using computational methods.  

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative exercise.  Personality sketches provide limited information, and people's interests and career choices are complex.  Many other fields could also be a good fit for Adam.
