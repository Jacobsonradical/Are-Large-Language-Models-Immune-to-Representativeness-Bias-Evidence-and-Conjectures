Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication strongly suggest a high probability of him being in this field. 
* **Computer Science:** While Adam's intelligence and ability to grasp abstract concepts are aligned with computer science, his other traits like empathy and love for nature don't directly point towards this field. It's still possible he chose this path, hence a moderate probability.

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on limited information. Adam's actual field of study could be influenced by various other factors not mentioned in the personality sketch.
