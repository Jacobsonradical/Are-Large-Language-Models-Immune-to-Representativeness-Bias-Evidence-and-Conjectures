Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants, and appreciation for hard work strongly suggest an inclination towards fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary science. 
* **Computer Science:**  While Adam's intelligence and ability with abstract concepts are compatible with computer science, the sketch lacks strong indicators like a passion for technology, programming, or problem-solving using computational methods. 

**Important Note:** This assessment is purely speculative and based on limited information.  Personality traits alone are not definitive indicators of a person's field of study. Many other factors, such as personal experiences, career goals, and opportunities, influence a person's academic choices.
