**Reasoning:**

While Adam's intelligence and puzzle-solving skills could point towards computer science, his deep love for animals and curiosity about nature make agricultural and veterinary science a more likely field of study. 

Here's why:

* **Stronger Fit:**  The description emphasizes his empathy for animals and interest in nature, aligning more strongly with careers in those fields. 
* **Open to Interpretation:** "Puzzles" isn't exclusive to computer science. Many scientific fields involve problem-solving and analytical thinking. 

Therefore, while computer science is possible, the personality sketch suggests a higher probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
