Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly suggests an affinity for this field. His intelligence and ability to grasp abstract concepts would also be beneficial.

* **Computer Science:** While Adam's puzzle-solving abilities and intelligence could point towards computer science, the description lacks strong indicators like a passion for technology, programming, or problem-solving using computers. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are purely speculative based on a limited personality sketch. Many other fields could also be strong possibilities for Adam.
