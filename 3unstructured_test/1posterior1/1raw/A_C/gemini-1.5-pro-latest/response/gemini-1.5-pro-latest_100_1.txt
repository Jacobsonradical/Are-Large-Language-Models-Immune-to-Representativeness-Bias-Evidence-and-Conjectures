Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly suggests an affinity for agricultural and veterinary sciences.  His quiet, empathetic nature would also be well-suited to working with animals. 
* **Computer Science:** While Adam's intelligence and ability with abstract concepts could point towards computer science, there's nothing directly in the description to suggest a passion for technology or programming. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are speculative.  Personality sketches offer limited insight, and many other fields could be a good fit for Adam.
