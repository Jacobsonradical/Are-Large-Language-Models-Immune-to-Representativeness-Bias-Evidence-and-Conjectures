Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly suggests a leaning towards fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary science. This makes a high probability (0.7) quite reasonable.
* **Computer Science:** While Adam's puzzle-solving ability and intelligence could point towards computer science, his other traits don't align as strongly with the field's typical characteristics. It's not impossible, hence a moderate probability (0.3).

**Important Note:** Personality sketches offer limited information.  Many other fields could also be a good fit for Adam.  These probabilities are simply educated guesses based on the provided description.
