Here's an estimated probability based on the provided description:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work strongly suggest an inclination towards agricultural and veterinary sciences. These fields often involve hands-on work, a connection to the natural world, and a dedication to animal well-being.

* **Computer Science:**  While Adam's intelligence and ability with abstract concepts could point towards computer science, there isn't a strong indicator pulling him directly to that field. His love for nature isn't typically a strong motivator for computer science careers. 

**Important Note:**  These are just estimates.  Personality traits alone can't definitively predict someone's field of study. Many other factors, like personal experiences, career goals, and specific academic interests, play a significant role.
