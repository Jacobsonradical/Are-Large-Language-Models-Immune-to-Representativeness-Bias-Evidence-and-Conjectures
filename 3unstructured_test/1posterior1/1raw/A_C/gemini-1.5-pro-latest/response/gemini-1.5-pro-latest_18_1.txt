Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly suggests an inclination towards agricultural and veterinary sciences. His curiosity about plants further strengthens this possibility. 
* **Computer science:** While Adam's intelligence and ability to grasp abstract concepts are aligned with computer science, the personality sketch lacks clear indicators like an interest in technology, programming, or problem-solving using computers.  

**Important Note:** These probabilities are speculative and based solely on a brief personality sketch. Many other fields could also be likely, and individual interests can vary greatly.
