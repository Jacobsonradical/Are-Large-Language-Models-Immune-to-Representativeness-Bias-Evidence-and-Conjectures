Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:** Adam's love for nature, animals, and his understanding of hard work and dedication strongly suggest an affinity for agricultural and veterinary sciences. This field aligns well with his core interests.
* **Computer Science:**  While Adam's intelligence and puzzle-solving abilities could point towards computer science, there's no direct mention of technology or programming in his description.  His empathetic nature might be less common in the stereotypical view of a computer science student.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are estimations based on limited information.  Personality sketches can offer clues, but many other factors influence a person's field of study.
