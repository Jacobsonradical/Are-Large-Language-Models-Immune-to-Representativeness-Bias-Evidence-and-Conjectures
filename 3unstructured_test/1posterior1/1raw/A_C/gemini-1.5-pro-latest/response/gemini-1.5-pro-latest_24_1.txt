Here's a breakdown of how we can estimate the probabilities based on Adam's personality sketch:

**Analysis**

* **Computer Science:**  While Adam's intelligence and puzzle-solving skills align with computer science, the description emphasizes nature, animals, and empathy. This doesn't rule out computer science, but it suggests other fields might be a stronger fit.
* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**  The description directly mentions "curiosity about nature and its various plants" and "a deep love for animals."  These are strong indicators of an affinity for fields related to agriculture and veterinary science.

**Probability Estimates**

Considering the above analysis, here's a reasonable estimation:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Important Note:** These are just estimates based on a personality sketch. Many other factors influence a person's choice of graduate study.  Adam's actual field of study could be entirely different.
