Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (higher probability):**  The description heavily emphasizes Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals. This strongly suggests a field related to agriculture, botany, zoology, or veterinary medicine.  

* **Computer Science (moderate probability):** While the description doesn't directly point to computer science, Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his high intelligence with abstract concepts could indicate an aptitude for programming and computational thinking. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Personality is not destiny:** While personality traits can offer clues about career choices, they are not definitive predictors. Many other factors influence graduate program selection.
* **Other possibilities:**  Fields like biology, environmental science, or even data science (combining his analytical skills with his love of nature) are also strong contenders.
