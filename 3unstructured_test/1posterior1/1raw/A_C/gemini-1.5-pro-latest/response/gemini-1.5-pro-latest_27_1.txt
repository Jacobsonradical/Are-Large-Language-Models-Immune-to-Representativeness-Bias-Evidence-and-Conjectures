Here's a breakdown of probabilities based on the description:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (High Probability):** Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals strongly suggests an affinity for these fields. His empathy further points towards a potential interest in animal care.
* **Computer Science (Moderate Probability):**  Adam's puzzle-solving skills and ability to grasp abstract concepts are valuable traits in computer science. However, the description lacks direct indicators of a passion for technology or programming, making it a possibility, but perhaps not the most likely.

**Important Note:** These are simply educated guesses based on a limited personality sketch.  Many other fields could also be a good fit for Adam.
