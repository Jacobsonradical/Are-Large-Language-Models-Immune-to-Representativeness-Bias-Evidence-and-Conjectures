Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly suggests an affinity for agricultural or veterinary fields. 
* **Computer Science:** While Adam's puzzle-solving skills and intelligence could point towards computer science, the description lacks strong indicators like an interest in technology, programming, or abstract systems. His empathy and warmth might be less common drivers in this field compared to a love for nature in agricultural pursuits.

**Important Note:**  These are just probabilities based on a brief personality sketch. There's not enough information for a definitive answer. Adam's actual field of study could be entirely different!
