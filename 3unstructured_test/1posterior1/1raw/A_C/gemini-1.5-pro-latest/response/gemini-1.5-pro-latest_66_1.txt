Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly suggests an inclination towards these fields. His intelligence and ability to grasp abstract concepts would also be beneficial. 
* **Computer science:** While Adam's puzzle-solving ability and intelligence could point towards computer science, the description lacks clear indicators of a passion for technology or programming. His empathy and love for nature don't typically align with the common perception of computer science fields.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are highly speculative.  Personality sketches offer limited insight into career choices. Many other factors influence a person's field of study, including personal experiences, opportunities, and specific interests within a broader field.
