Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly suggests an inclination towards fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary science. 
* **Computer Science:** While Adam's puzzle-solving skills and intelligence could point towards computer science, the description lacks clear indicators like an interest in technology, programming, or abstract systems. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on a brief personality sketch.  Many other fields could be equally likely, and it's impossible to determine Adam's field of study with certainty.  Factors like upbringing, specific interests within a field, and life experiences play a significant role.
