**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Fit for Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, combined with his empathy, strongly suggest an inclination towards fields like agriculture, botany, zoology, or veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to grasp abstract concepts are also valuable assets in these fields. 
* **Possible Fit for Computer Science:** While the description doesn't directly point to computer science, his puzzle-solving skills and high intelligence could translate well to this field. It's not uncommon for individuals interested in abstract concepts and problem-solving to excel in computer science.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are simply educated guesses based on a limited personality sketch.  Many other fields could also be a good fit for Adam.  His actual field of study would be influenced by a wide range of factors not mentioned in the description, such as personal experiences, career goals, and specific interests within broader fields.
