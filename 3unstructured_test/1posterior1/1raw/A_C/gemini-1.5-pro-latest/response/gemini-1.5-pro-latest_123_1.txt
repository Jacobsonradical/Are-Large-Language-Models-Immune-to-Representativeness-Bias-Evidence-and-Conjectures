**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Correlation with Agriculture/Veterinary Science:** Adam's love for animals, interest in plants, and appreciation for hard work strongly suggest a leaning towards agricultural and veterinary science. These fields directly involve interaction with animals and plants, and often require dedication and understanding of natural processes.

* **Possible Correlation with Computer Science:** Adam's puzzle-solving skills and ability to grasp abstract concepts are traits often associated with computer science. However, the personality sketch lacks direct indicators like interest in technology, programming, or software. 

**Note:** These probabilities are subjective estimations based on limited information. Adam's actual field of study could be entirely different.
