Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly suggests an affinity for agricultural or veterinary fields. This makes it the more likely option. 
* **Computer Science:** While Adam's intelligence and problem-solving skills could point towards computer science, the description lacks specific indicators like an interest in technology, programming, or logic puzzles. His empathy and love for nature might make fields directly interacting with the living world more appealing. 

**Important Note:** This is just a probabilistic estimate based on a limited personality sketch.  Many other fields could also be a good fit for Adam.
