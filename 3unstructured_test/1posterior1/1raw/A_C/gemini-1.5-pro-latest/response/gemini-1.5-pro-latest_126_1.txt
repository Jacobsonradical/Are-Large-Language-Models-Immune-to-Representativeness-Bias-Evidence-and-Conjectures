Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** The description strongly suggests this field. Adam's love for animals, curiosity about plants, empathy (important for veterinary work), and appreciation for hard work all align well with careers in this area.

* **Computer Science (0.3):** While not as strong a fit, Adam's intelligence, puzzle-solving ability, and understanding of abstract concepts could lend themselves to computer science. It's plausible he finds beauty in the logic and problem-solving aspects of the field.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are estimations based on limited information. Many other fields could also be likely for Adam.
