Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, combined with his empathy, strongly suggests an affinity for fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary medicine. 
* **Computer Science:** While Adam's intelligence and ability to grasp abstract concepts could point towards computer science, the description lacks specific indicators like an interest in technology, programming, or problem-solving using computational methods. 

**Important Note:** This assessment is based solely on a brief personality sketch.  Many other fields could also be likely for Adam, and the actual probabilities might differ significantly with more information about his interests, skills, and experiences.
