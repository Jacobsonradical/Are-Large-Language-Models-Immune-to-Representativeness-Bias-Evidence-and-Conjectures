Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):**  The description strongly suggests this field.  Adam's love for animals, interest in plants, empathy (important for veterinary work), and appreciation for hard work all align perfectly with these areas of study. 

* **Computer Science (0.4):** While Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and aptitude for abstract concepts could point towards computer science, the description lacks specific indicators commonly associated with the field (e.g., interest in technology, programming, software, etc.).  His other traits make a career focused on nature and animals more likely. 

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on limited information.  Personality offers some clues to a person's interests, but it's not a perfect predictor of their field of study.
