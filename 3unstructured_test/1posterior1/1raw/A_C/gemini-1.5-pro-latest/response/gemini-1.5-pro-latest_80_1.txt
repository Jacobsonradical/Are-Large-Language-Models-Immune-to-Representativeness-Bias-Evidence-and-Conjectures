Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding plants strongly suggests an inclination towards agricultural and veterinary sciences. His empathy further supports this possibility. 
* **Computer Science:** While Adam's puzzle-solving skills and intelligence could point towards computer science, the description lacks specific indicators like an interest in technology, programming, or abstract systems. 

**Important Note:** This assessment is purely speculative. Personality traits alone are not definitive predictors of academic choices. Many other factors influence a person's field of study.
