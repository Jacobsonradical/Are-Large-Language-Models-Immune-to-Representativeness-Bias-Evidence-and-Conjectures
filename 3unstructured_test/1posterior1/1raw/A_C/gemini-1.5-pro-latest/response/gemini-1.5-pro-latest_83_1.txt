Here's an estimated probability based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (Higher Probability):**  Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals strongly suggests an affinity for agricultural and veterinary sciences. His empathy and warm heart further support this direction.
* **Computer Science (Moderate Probability):** Adam's intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to grasp abstract concepts are consistent with a computer science student. However, the description lacks specific indicators like an interest in technology or programming. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative assessment based on a limited personality sketch.  Many other fields could also be a good fit for Adam.
