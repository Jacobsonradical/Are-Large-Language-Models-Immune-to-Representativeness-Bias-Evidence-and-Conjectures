**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.3):** Adam's love for animals and interest in plants strongly suggest a potential affinity for agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to grasp abstract concepts would also be beneficial in these fields.

* **Computer Science (0.15):** While Adam's puzzle-solving skills and intelligence could point towards computer science, the description doesn't offer strong evidence for a particular interest in technology or programming.  His empathetic and nature-loving side might make him less inclined toward a field often perceived as less directly connected to living things.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are simply educated guesses based on a limited personality sketch. There's a possibility Adam could be in a completely different field, or even in both. More information is needed for a more accurate assessment.
