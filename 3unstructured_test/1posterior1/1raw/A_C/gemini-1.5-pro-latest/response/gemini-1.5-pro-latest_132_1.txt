Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly suggests an inclination towards this field.  His intelligence and analytical skills would also be valuable. 
* **Computer science:** While Adam's puzzle-solving ability and intelligence could point towards computer science, there's no direct mention of technology or programming interest. However, his ability with abstract concepts could translate well to this field, making the probability non-zero. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are speculative. Personality sketches offer limited insight, and many other fields could align with Adam's traits.
