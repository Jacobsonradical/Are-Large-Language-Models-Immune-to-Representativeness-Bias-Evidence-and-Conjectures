Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the description of Adam:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication strongly suggest a high probability of him being in a field related to agriculture or veterinary science. 
* **Computer Science:** While Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and ability with abstract concepts could point towards computer science, his personality sketch lacks strong indicators typically associated with the field (e.g., interest in technology, programming, etc.).  

**Important Note:** These probabilities are based on limited information and rely on general personality trends.  There's a chance Adam could be in a completely different field, or even pursuing both computer science and agricultural/veterinary science in an interdisciplinary manner.
