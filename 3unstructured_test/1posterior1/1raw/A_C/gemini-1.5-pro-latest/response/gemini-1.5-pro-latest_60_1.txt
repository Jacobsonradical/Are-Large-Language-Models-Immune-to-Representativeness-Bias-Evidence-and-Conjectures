Here's an estimated probability based on the personality description:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** Adam's love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work strongly suggest a high probability of interest in fields like veterinary medicine, animal science, or botany. 
* **Computer Science (0.3):** While not as strong an indicator, Adam's puzzle-solving ability and aptitude for abstract concepts could point towards an interest in computer science.  Many individuals in computer science are drawn to the problem-solving aspects of the field. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on limited information. Adam's actual field of study could be influenced by numerous other factors not mentioned in the personality sketch.
