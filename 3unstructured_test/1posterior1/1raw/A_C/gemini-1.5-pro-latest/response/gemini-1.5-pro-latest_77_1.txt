**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication strongly suggest an affinity for agricultural and veterinary sciences. This field aligns well with his core interests.

* **Computer Science:** While Adam's intelligence and ability with abstract concepts could indicate an aptitude for computer science, the personality sketch lacks direct indicators like an interest in technology, programming, or problem-solving within a digital context. 

**Important Note:** This assessment is based solely on a brief and general personality sketch. Many other fields could also be a good fit for Adam.  Accurate probability estimates would require more information about his specific skills, experiences, and aspirations.
