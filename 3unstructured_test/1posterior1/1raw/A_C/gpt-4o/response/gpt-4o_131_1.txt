Explanation: Based on Adam's strong empathy for animals, genuine curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work, it seems more likely that he would be drawn to agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with both fields, but his specific interests in nature and animals make agricultural and veterinary science a more probable choice. However, his capability for solving puzzles and intelligence also make computer science a plausible but less likely option.
