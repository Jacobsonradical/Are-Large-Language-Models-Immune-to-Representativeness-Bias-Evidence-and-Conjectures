Based on the personality sketch of Adam, his genuine curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, deep love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest that he might be more inclined towards fields that involve working with nature and animals, as well as fields that require a significant amount of dedication and understanding of living organisms.

Here is my best estimate:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

While Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could correlate with a field like computer science, his specific interests and personal traits seem to align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability for agricultural and veterinary science than for computer science.
