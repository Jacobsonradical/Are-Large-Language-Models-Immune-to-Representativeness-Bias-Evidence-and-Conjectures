Based on the personality sketch of Adam, it seems that his interests and characteristics align more closely with fields related to nature, plants, animals, and empathy. Therefore, it is more likely that he might be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science rather than computer science.

Here is my estimate:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

While Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could make him suitable for computer science, his genuine curiosity about nature and love for animals strongly suggest a greater likelihood that he is pursuing a field related to agricultural and veterinary science.
