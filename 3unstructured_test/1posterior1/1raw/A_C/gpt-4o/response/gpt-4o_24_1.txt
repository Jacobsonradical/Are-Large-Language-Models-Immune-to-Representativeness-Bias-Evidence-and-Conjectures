Based on the provided personality sketch, Adam's characteristics and interests suggest a stronger inclination towards fields related to nature, plants, and animals. His high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts would serve him well in any field, but his empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work point more directly toward agricultural and veterinary science. 

On the other hand, while his problem-solving skills and high intelligence could also make him a good fit for computer science, there's less direct evidence in the personality sketch to suggest a specific interest in this field.

Here's an estimate:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
