Given Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, along with his empathy and appreciation for hard work, it seems more likely that he would be enrolled in a field closely related to his passions, such as agricultural and veterinary science. However, his high intelligence and aptitude for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts also make computer science a plausible choice, albeit less aligned with his stated interests.
