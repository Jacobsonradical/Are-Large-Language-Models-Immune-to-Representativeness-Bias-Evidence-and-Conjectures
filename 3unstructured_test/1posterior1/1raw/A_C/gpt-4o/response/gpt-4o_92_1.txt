Based on the personality sketch of Adam, his genuine curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, deep love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, there is a higher probability that he would be inclined towards fields related to nature, animals, and plants. While he is described as intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, which could be relevant to computer science, the specific traits mentioned lean more heavily towards agricultural and veterinary science.

Here is an estimate:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

These probabilities suggest a stronger likelihood that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, considering his affinity for nature and animals, compared to computer science.
