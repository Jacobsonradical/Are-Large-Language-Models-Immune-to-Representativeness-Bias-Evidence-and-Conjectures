Based on the personality sketch of Adam, here is my estimate of the probability that he was enrolled in the following fields:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

These probabilities are derived from Adam's strong appreciation for nature, plants, and animals, which align closely with agricultural and veterinary science. However, his high intelligence and interest in solving puzzles also leave room for the possibility of him being in a field like computer science, just to a lesser extent.
