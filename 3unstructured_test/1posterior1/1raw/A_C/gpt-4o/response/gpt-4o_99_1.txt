Based on the personality sketch provided, here is an estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in the following fields:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

The estimate leans towards agricultural and veterinary science, given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, and love for animals. These traits align more closely with the field of agricultural and veterinary science. However, his high intelligence and skill in understanding abstract concepts could also make computer science a possible field, hence the non-zero probability.
