Given Adam's interests in nature, plants, and animals, it is reasonable to assume a higher probability that he might be enrolled in a field related to agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and aptitude for solving puzzles and abstract concepts suggest some likelihood he could also be interested in computer science, albeit to a lesser degree. These fields also align somewhat with his characteristics.
