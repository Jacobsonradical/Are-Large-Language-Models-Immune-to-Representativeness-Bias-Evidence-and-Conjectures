Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, it seems more likely that he would be enrolled in a field that aligns with his interests and characteristics, such as his curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals. These traits are more closely related to agricultural and veterinary science rather than computer science. However, we can't completely rule out computer science, as his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could also apply to this field.

Given these considerations, here are the estimated probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
