Given Adam's personality sketch, let's analyze the likelihood of him being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science vs. computer science:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
   - He loves animals and has strong empathy.
   - He appreciates hard work and dedication.

   These traits strongly align with the field of agricultural and veterinary science, as this field involves hands-on work with plants and animals, a deep understanding of nature, and dedication to the well-being of living organisms.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles.
   - He is of high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.

   These traits align well with computer science, which often involves solving complex problems and working with abstract computational concepts.

Considering the provided information, here are the estimated probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.65,
  "computer science": 0.35
}
```

These estimates reflect the idea that while Adam has strong traits for both fields, his deep love for nature and animals slightly tilts the probability towards agricultural and veterinary science.
