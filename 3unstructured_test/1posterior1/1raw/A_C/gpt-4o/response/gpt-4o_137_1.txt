Based on Adam's personality sketch, his genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and his love for animals suggest a strong inclination towards agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts could fit with computer science as well, given that it's a field requiring strong analytical and problem-solving skills. However, his empathy and appreciation for nature make agricultural and veterinary science a more suitable fit. Here is my best estimate:
