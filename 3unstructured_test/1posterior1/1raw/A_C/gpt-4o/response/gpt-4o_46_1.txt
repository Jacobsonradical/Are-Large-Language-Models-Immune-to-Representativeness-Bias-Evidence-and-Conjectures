Based on the provided personality sketch of Adam and considering his strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and solving puzzles, I would estimate the probabilities as follows:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}

The higher probability for agricultural and veterinary science is due to Adam's deep love for animals, genuine curiosity about nature and plants, and empathy, which align well with this field. The interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence could still make computer science a possibility, although less likely compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
