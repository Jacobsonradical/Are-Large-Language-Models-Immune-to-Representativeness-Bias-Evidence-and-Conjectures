Based on Adam's personality sketch, here's my best estimate of the probability that he was enrolled in the specified fields:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "computer science": 0.25
}

This estimation is derived from Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, and deep love for animals, which align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science. However, his high intelligence and skill at understanding abstract concepts also make computer science a plausible field for him.
