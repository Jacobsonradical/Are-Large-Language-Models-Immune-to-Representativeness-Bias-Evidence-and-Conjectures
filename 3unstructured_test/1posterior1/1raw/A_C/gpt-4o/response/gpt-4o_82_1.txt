Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, an individual with a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, strong empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, here is the estimated probability for each field of study:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

Given Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, it is likely that he would be inclined towards agricultural and veterinary science. However, his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could potentially lead him towards computer science, albeit to a lesser extent.
