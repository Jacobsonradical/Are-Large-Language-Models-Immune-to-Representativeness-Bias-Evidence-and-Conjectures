Explanation: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest a higher likelihood of him being involved in agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts do offer some probability for computer science, but these traits are also valuable in agricultural and veterinary studies. Therefore, while it is possible he was enrolled in computer science, it seems more probable that his interests and personality align with agricultural and veterinary science.
