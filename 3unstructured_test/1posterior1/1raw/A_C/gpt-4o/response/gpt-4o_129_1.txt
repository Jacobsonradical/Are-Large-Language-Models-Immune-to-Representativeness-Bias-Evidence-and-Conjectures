Given Adam's love for nature and animals, combined with his strong empathy and interest in plants, it seems more likely that he would be enrolled in a field like agricultural and veterinary science. However, his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could also point towards the possibility of him being in computer science, hence the lower but not negligible probability for that field.
