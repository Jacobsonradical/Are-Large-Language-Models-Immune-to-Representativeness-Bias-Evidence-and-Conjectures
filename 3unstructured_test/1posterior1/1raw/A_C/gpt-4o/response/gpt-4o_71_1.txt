Sure, I can provide an estimate based on the given personality sketch of Adam.

  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.65,
  "computer science": 0.35

Given Adam's strong curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, and his appreciation for hard work and dedication, it seems more likely that he would be enrolled in a field related to agricultural and veterinary science. However, his high intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and good understanding of abstract concepts also align well with the characteristics typically found in computer science students, hence the considerable probability for that field as well.
