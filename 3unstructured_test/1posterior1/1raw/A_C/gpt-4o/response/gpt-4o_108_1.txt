Based on the given personality sketch of Adam, he appears to have a strong inclination towards natural sciences and animals, which aligns more closely with agricultural and veterinary science. Although his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could make him suitable for computer science, his specific interests and empathy for animals suggest a higher probability in the field related to nature.

Here is my best estimate:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

This estimation assumes that while Adam has the intellectual capability to pursue computer science, his interests and personal qualities make a career in agricultural and veterinary science more probable.
