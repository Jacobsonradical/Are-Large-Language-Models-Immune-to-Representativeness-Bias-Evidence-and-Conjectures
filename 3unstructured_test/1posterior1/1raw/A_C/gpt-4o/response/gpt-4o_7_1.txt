Based on Adam's personality sketch, here's an estimate of the probability that he was enrolled in the specified fields:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5,
  "computer science": 0.2
}

Explanation:
Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align well with fields like agricultural and veterinary science, making it a strong candidate for his field of study. On the other hand, his high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles make computer science a possible but less likely field of study, given the strong inclination toward nature and animals.
