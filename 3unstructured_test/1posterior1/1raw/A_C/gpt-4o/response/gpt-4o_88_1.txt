Given the personality sketch of Adam, we can infer that his interests and characteristics are more closely aligned with fields that involve nature, animals, empathy, and dedication. These traits are more indicative of someone in agricultural and veterinary science rather than computer science. Although his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could apply to computer science, the specific mention of his love for nature, plants, and animals makes it more likely for him to be in agricultural and veterinary science.

Here is the estimated probability based on this reasoning:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
