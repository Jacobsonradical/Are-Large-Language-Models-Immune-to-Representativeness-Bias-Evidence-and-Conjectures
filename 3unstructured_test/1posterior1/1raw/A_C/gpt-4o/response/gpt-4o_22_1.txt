Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, it seems more likely that his interests and skills align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science than with computer science. His genuine curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, and warm-hearted, empathetic nature are strong indicators for a field related to agricultural and veterinary science. 

However, given his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, it is also somewhat plausible that he could be involved in computer science, though these traits are not exclusive to that field.

Given this assessment, here is the probability estimate:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
