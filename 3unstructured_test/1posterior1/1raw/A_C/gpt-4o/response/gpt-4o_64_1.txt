Based on Adam's personality sketch, the probability estimates are:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

Adam shows a genuine curiosity about nature, a strong empathy, and a deep love for animals, which align closely with agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could also fit into computer science, but the sketch highlights a stronger connection with nature and animals, so the probability is higher for agricultural and veterinary science.
