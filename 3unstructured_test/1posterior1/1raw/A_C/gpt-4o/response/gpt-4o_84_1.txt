Based on the provided personality sketch of Adam, we can try to estimate his likelihood of being enrolled in the specified fields. Given his interests in nature, plants, and animals, along with his empathy and love for animals, agricultural and veterinary science appears more aligned with his passions. However, his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he could also fit into computer science. Here's my best estimate:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
```

These estimates reflect the stronger alignment of Adam's interests with agricultural and veterinary science, while also acknowledging that his intelligence and abstract thinking skills could lead him to pursue computer science.
