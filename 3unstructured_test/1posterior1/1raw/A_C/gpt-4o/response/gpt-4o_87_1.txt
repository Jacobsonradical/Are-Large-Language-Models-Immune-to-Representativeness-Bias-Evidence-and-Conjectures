Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam has a clear inclination toward nature, plants, animals, and empathy. These traits align more closely with fields that involve biological and environmental sciences rather than those that are typically more technical and oriented toward abstract computing concepts. Thus, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is likely higher than computer science. However, his high intelligence and aptitude for abstract concepts don't rule out the possibility of him being in computer science entirely.

Here is the estimated probability:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "computer science": 0.25
}
