Based on Adam's personality sketch, his deep love for nature, plants, animals, and empathy, as well as his understanding of hard work and dedication, it seems he would be more inclined towards fields related to natural sciences and veterinary care. While his intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts can certainly fit into computer science, it appears less aligned with his interests and passions.

Here's my estimate:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
