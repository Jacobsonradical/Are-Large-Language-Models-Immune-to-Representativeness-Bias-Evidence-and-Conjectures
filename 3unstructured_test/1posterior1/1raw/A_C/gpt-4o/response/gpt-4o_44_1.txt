Based on the personality sketch and the details provided, it seems Adam has a strong inclination towards nature, plants, animals, empathy, and abstract thinking. Given these traits, it is more likely that he could be enrolled in a field that involves a direct connection with nature and animals, rather than one that primarily involves technology and computing.

Here's my best estimate for the probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
