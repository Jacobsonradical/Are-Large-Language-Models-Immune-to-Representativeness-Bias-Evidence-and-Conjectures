Based on the personality sketch of Adam, which highlights his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy, it seems more likely that he would be inclined towards a field related to environmental studies or life sciences. Here is my best estimate for the probability of Adam being enrolled in either computer science or agricultural and veterinary science:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
