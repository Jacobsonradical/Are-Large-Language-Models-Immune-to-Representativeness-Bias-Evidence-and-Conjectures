Based on the personality sketch of Adam, the probability estimates for enrollment in the specified fields are as follows:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

These probabilities reflect Adam's strong affinity for nature, plants, animals, and empathy, which align well with agricultural and veterinary sciences. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also suggest a possibility, although somewhat lower, of him being in computer science, where these traits are beneficial.
