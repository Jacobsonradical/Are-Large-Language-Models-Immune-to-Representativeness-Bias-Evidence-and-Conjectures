Based on the personality sketch of Adam, here are the estimated probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy, there is a higher likelihood that he might be studying agricultural and veterinary science. However, his intelligence, enjoyment in solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts also make computer science a plausible field of study for him, albeit with a lower probability.
