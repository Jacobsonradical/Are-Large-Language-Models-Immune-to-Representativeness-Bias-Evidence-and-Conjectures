Given Adam's interests in nature, animals, empathy, and understanding hard work, it is more probable that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. His attributes, such as a strong appreciation for nature and a deep love for animals, align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science. However, his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts indicate that there is still a moderate chance he could be pursuing computer science, hence the slightly lower probability for that field.
