Given the personality sketch of Adam, including his genuine curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy and love for animals, and his appreciation of hard work and dedication, it seems more likely that he would be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science rather than computer science. While his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit with computer science, his specific interests and attributes align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science.

Here is my best estimate:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
