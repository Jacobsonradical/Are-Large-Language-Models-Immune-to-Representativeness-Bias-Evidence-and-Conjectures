Based on the personality sketch of Adam, the best estimate of the probability that he was enrolled in the following fields is:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

Given Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature and its various plants, it seems more likely that he would be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts, while potentially aligning with computer science, are also useful in fields like agricultural and veterinary science, where such skills can be applied to complex biological systems and innovative agricultural solutions. Therefore, I have weighted the probability higher for agricultural and veterinary science.
