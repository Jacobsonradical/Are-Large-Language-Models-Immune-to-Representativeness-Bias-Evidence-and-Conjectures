Based on the provided personality sketch of Adam, including his love for nature, plants, animals, and high intelligence with an understanding of abstract concepts, I can offer the following estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in the fields of agricultural and veterinary science or computer science:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.65,
  "computer science": 0.35
}

These estimates consider the combination of Adam's interests and characteristics. His love for nature, plants, and animals strongly aligns with agricultural and veterinary science. However, his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also suggest a potential fit for computer science, albeit to a lesser extent.
