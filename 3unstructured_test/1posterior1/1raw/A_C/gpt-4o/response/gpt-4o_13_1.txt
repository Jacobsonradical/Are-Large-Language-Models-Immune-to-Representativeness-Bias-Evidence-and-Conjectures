Based on Adam's interests and described traits, here is my estimate of the probability that he was enrolled in each of the specified fields:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.2
}
```

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, deep love for animals, and warm heart are strong indicators that he might be inclined towards agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts do suggest the potential for success in computer science, but his specific interests lean more towards the natural sciences.
