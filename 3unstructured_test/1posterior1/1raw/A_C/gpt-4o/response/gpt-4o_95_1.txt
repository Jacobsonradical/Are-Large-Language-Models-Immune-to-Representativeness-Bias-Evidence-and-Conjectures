Given Adam's deep love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants, and strong empathy, it seems highly probable that he would be drawn to a field like agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could apply to both fields, but the specific mention of his empathy and love for animals tips the balance toward agricultural and veterinary science. However, his intelligence and knack for solving puzzles do lend some probability to him studying computer science as well.
