Based on Adamâ€™s personality sketch, including his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, we can make some inferences about his probable field of study. Considering these factors:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

While Adam does possess traits such as high intelligence and the ability to understand abstract concepts, which are beneficial in computer science, his pronounced interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, the probability is higher for him being enrolled in the latter field.
