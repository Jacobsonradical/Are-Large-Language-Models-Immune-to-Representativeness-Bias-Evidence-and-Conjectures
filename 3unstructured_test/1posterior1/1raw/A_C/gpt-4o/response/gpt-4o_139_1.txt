Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and his deep love for animals, it seems more likely that he would be enrolled in a field closely related to these interests, such as agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts do suggest that he could pursue computer science, but these traits are not as directly aligned with his expressed interests in nature and animals. Therefore, the probability is adjusted accordingly.
