Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam's deep love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants, and strong empathy would make him more inclined towards agricultural and veterinary science. While his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts might suggest potential for a field like computer science, these traits are not as compelling or specific to computer science relative to his strong interest in the natural world and animals.

Therefore, my best estimates for the probabilities are as follows:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

These values reflect a stronger inclination towards agricultural and veterinary science over computer science based on the personality traits and interests described.
