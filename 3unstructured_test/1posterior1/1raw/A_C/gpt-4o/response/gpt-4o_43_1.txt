Based on the provided personality sketch of Adam, he seems to have a deep interest in nature, plants, animals, and solving puzzles. These characteristics might align more closely with a field such as agricultural and veterinary science over computer science, although it's not impossible for him to be in computer science, especially if he applies his problem-solving skills there. Here are my best estimates:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
```

These estimates reflect that while Adam's personality traits align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science, there is still a reasonable probability he might be in computer science, particularly if his interest in puzzles and high intelligence guide him towards that field.
