Based on Adam's described personality traits and interests, it seems far more likely that he would be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. His curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align closely with the typical interests and values of someone in that field. However, since he is also good at solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, there's still a reasonable possibility that he could be in a field like computer science where those skills are highly valued.
