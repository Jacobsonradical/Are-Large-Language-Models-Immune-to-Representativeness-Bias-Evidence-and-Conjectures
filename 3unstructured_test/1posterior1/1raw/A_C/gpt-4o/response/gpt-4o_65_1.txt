Based on the given personality sketch of Adam, let's break down factors that might influence his probability of being enrolled in the mentioned fields:

1. Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, various plants, and his deep love for animals strongly suggest an inclination towards agricultural and veterinary science.
2. His high intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication also fit well both with agricultural and veterinary science and potentially with computer science.
3. Interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts could be seen as aligning more with computer science.

Given these considerations, here's an estimated probability:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

This estimation accounts for Adam's deep interest in nature and animals, which aligns strongly with agricultural and veterinary science, while his intelligence and interest in solving puzzles and abstract thinking also provide a moderate likelihood of computer science.
