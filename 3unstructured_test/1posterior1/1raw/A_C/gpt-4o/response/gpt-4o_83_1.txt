Based on the personality sketch provided, here is the estimated probability that Adam was enrolled in the following fields:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}

These probabilities are based on Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, which aligns closely with the field of agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also slightly support an interest in computer science, though it is not as strong a fit as the former field.
