Based on the provided personality sketch of Adam, here is an estimate of the probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}

This estimation considers Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, his love for animals, and his appreciation for hard work, which align well with agricultural and veterinary sciences. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit well with computer science; however, the former field seems more strongly aligned with his interests and characteristics.
