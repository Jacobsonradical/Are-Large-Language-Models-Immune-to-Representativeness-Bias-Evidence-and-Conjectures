Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can make some educated estimates about the fields he might be enrolled in. Given his genuine curiosity about nature and plants, his love for animals, and his empathy, agricultural and veterinary science seems like a relevant fit. His intelligence and capability to understand abstract concepts could also be relevant to computer science, but the personality sketch does not explicitly lean towards this field as much.

Here's an estimation:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
