Given Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, combined with his warm heart, empathy, and appreciation for hard work, it seems more likely that he was enrolled in a field like agricultural and veterinary science. However, his high intelligence and aptitude for abstract concepts suggest that there is also a reasonable probability that he might have been enrolled in computer science, which would leverage these skills in a different way.
