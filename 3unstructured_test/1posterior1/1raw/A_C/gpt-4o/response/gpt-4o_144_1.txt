Given Adam's strong empathy, deep love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work, it seems more likely he would be enrolled in a field related to agricultural and veterinary science. However, his intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest there is still a notable possibility he could be interested in computer science, especially if it intersects with his interests, such as data analysis in biological studies or computational biology.
