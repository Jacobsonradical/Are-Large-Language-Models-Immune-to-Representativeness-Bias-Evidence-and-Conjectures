Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's fields of study:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.6)**: Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest a good fit for computer science. However, his personality sketch does not emphasize a strong interest in technology or programming specifically, which is why the probability is not higher.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7)**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication make him a strong candidate for agricultural and veterinary science. These traits align well with the field, leading to a higher probability.
