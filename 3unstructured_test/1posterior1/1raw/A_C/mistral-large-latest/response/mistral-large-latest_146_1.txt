Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's fields of study:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7)**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest a high likelihood of him being interested in agricultural and veterinary science.
- **Computer Science (0.5)**: Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence, particularly his ability to understand abstract concepts, make computer science a reasonable fit. However, the probability is slightly lower than agricultural and veterinary science because the personality sketch emphasizes his love for nature and animals more than technological or computational interests.
