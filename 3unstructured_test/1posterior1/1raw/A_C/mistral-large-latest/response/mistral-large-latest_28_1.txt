Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's fields of study:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7)**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest a high likelihood of him being interested in agricultural and veterinary science.
- **Computer Science (0.4)**: While Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which could indicate an aptitude for computer science, his personality sketch leans more heavily towards a nature-related field. However, there's still a reasonable probability that he could be involved in computer science, possibly in areas that intersect with his interests in nature and animals (e.g., bioinformatics or environmental modeling).
