Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's fields of study:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.6)**: Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with the skills required for computer science. However, his personality sketch does not explicitly mention an interest in technology or programming, which is why the probability is not higher.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7)**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication strongly suggest that he might be interested in agricultural and veterinary science. This field aligns well with his personal interests and values, hence the higher probability.
