Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7)**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest a high likelihood of him pursuing a field related to agricultural and veterinary science. His appreciation for hard work and dedication also aligns well with these fields.
- **Computer Science (0.5)**: Adam's intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles indicate a good fit for computer science. However, this field is less directly related to his love for nature and animals, hence the slightly lower probability.
