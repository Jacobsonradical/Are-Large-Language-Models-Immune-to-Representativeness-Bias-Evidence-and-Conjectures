Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's fields of study:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.6)**: Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest a good fit for computer science. However, his personality sketch does not explicitly mention an interest in technology or programming, which is why the probability is not higher.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7)**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication align well with agricultural and veterinary sciences. This field seems to be a strong match for his interests and personality, hence the higher probability.
