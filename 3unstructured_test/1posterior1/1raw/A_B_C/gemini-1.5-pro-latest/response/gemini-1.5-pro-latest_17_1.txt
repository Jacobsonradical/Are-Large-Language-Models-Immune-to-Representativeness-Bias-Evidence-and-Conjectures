Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly suggest an affinity for these fields. 
* **Business Administration (0.1):**  The description doesn't highlight typical business-oriented traits like ambition for leadership or financial success. While intelligence is useful in business, it's not a strong enough indicator alone.
* **Computer Science (0.3):** Adam's puzzle-solving skills and ability with abstract concepts could point towards computer science. However, his primary interests seem more aligned with the natural world. 

**Important Note:** This is a speculative assessment based on a personality sketch.  People's interests and career choices are complex and can't be definitively determined from a short description.
