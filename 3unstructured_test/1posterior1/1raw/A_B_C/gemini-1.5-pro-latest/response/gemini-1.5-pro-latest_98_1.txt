Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly suggests a high probability of interest in this field. 
* **Computer science:**  His puzzle-solving skills and ability with abstract concepts make computer science a possibility, though the description doesn't lean as heavily into this area.
* **Business administration:** While Adam is clearly intelligent, his personality profile doesn't align strongly with the typical traits associated with business administration. Empathy and a love for nature are less common drivers in this field. 

**Important Note:** These are just estimates based on a limited personality sketch. People are complex, and there's always a chance Adam's interests lie in a completely different field or a combination of these areas.
