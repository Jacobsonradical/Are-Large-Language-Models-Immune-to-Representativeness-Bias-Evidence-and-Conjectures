Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** Adam's love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work strongly suggest an inclination towards fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary science. 
* **Computer Science (0.3):** His enjoyment of puzzles and ability to grasp abstract concepts could point towards an interest in computer science.  
* **Business Administration (0.1):** While intelligence is useful in business, the description doesn't offer strong indicators of Adam being drawn to the core elements of business administration. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are speculative. Personalities are complex, and people's interests and career choices can be influenced by many factors not mentioned in the sketch.
