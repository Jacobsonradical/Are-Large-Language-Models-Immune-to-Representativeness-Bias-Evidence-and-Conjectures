Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals strongly suggests an affinity for this field. His empathy further points towards a caring profession like veterinary science. 
* **Business Administration (0.1):**  Nothing in the description points towards a strong interest in business. While intelligence and understanding hard work are valuable in business, they aren't specific indicators.
* **Computer Science (0.3):**  Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and ability with abstract concepts could suggest an aptitude for computer science. However, there's no direct mention of technology or programming interests. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are subjective estimations based on limited information.  Personality traits alone cannot definitively determine someone's field of study.
