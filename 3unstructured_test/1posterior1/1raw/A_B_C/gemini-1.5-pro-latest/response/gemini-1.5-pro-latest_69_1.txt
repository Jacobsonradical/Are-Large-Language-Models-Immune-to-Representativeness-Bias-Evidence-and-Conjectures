Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (High Probability):** Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals strongly suggests an affinity for these fields. His empathy and warm heart further support this likelihood. 
* **Business Administration (Low Probability):** The description doesn't align well with a typical business administration student. While intelligence and problem-solving are valuable in business, there's no mention of interests like finance, marketing, or management.
* **Computer Science (Moderate Probability):** Adam's puzzle-solving skills and ability to grasp abstract concepts could point towards computer science. However, this field is broad.  His other interests make a nature-focused field more probable. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative assessment. Personality traits alone can't definitively predict a person's field of study. There are many other factors at play, such as personal experiences, opportunities, and specific academic strengths.
