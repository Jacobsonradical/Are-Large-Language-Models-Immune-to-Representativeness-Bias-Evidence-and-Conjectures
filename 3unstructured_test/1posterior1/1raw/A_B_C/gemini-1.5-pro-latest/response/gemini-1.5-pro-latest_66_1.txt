Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.6):**  Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals strongly suggests an affinity for this field. This is given the highest probability. 
* **Computer Science (0.3):**  His puzzle-solving skills and ability to grasp abstract concepts point towards a potential interest in computer science. This field is plausible, hence a moderate probability.
* **Business Administration (0.1):** While Adam appreciates hard work and dedication, there's little in his description to suggest a strong inclination towards business administration. This receives the lowest probability.

**Important Note:** These are just estimations based on a limited personality sketch.  Many other fields could align with Adam's interests.  For example, he might be studying biology, environmental science, or even something like philosophy!
