Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly suggests a high probability of interest in this field. 
* **Business Administration (0.1):** The description doesn't highlight typical business-oriented traits. While intelligence and problem-solving are useful in business,  Adam's other passions point away from this field.
* **Computer Science (0.3):** Adam's puzzle-solving skills and ability to grasp abstract concepts could indicate an aptitude for computer science.  However, his core interests in nature and animals make this field less likely compared to agricultural and veterinary sciences. 

**Important Note:** This is just an estimation based on a brief personality sketch. Many other fields could also be a good fit for Adam.
