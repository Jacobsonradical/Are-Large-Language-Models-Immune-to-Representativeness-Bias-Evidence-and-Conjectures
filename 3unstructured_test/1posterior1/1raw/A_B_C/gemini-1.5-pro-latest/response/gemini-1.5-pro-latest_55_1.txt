**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science** has the highest probability. Adam's love for animals and curiosity about plants align strongly with these fields. 
* **Computer science** is also plausible. Adam's puzzle-solving ability and intelligence suggest an aptitude for this field.  
* **Business administration** is the least likely. While Adam's understanding of hard work is relevant, nothing in his personality sketch points specifically to business interests.
