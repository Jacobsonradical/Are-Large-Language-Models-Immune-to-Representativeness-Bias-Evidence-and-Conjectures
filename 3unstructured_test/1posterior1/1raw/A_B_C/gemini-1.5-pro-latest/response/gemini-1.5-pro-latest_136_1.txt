Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):**  Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals strongly suggests an affinity for this field. His empathy and warm heart further support this likelihood.
* **Business Administration (0.1):**  Nothing in the description points towards a strong interest in business. While intelligence and problem-solving are assets in business, they aren't specific enough to suggest this field as a primary choice for Adam. 
* **Computer Science (0.3):** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his ability to grasp abstract concepts could indicate an aptitude for computer science. However, there's no direct mention of technology or programming interests, making this a lower probability than agricultural and veterinary science.
