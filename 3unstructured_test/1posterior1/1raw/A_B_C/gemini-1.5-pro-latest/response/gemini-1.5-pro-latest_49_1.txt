Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science (0.7):** Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals strongly suggests an affinity for these fields. His empathy and warm heart further support this possibility. 
* **Business administration (0.1):**  The description doesn't offer strong indicators of an interest in business. While intelligence and problem-solving are valuable in business, they aren't exclusive to it. 
* **Computer science (0.3):**  Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his ability to grasp abstract concepts could point towards computer science. However, there's no direct mention of technology or programming interests. 

**Important Note:** This assessment relies heavily on personality traits and generalized assumptions. Many other fields could be a good fit for Adam.  A true probability assessment would require more information about his specific interests, skills, and experiences.
