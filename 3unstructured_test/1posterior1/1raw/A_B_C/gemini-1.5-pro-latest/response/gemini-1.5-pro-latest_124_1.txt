Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals strongly suggests an affinity for this field. His intelligence and enjoyment of problem-solving would also be valuable assets. 
* **Computer Science:**  While not as strong a match as agricultural sciences, Adam's intelligence and ability with abstract concepts could lead him to computer science.  Puzzle solving shares some similarities with computational thinking.
* **Business Administration:** This field seems the least likely. Adam's personality description emphasizes empathy, love for nature, and understanding of hard work â€“ traits not traditionally associated with a strong focus on business. 

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are simply estimations based on a brief personality sketch.  Many other fields could also be possibilities for Adam.
