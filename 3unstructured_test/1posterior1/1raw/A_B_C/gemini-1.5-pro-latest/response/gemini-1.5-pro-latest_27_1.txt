Here's a probabilistic breakdown based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.6):** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly suggests a high probability of interest in this field.
* **Computer Science (0.3):**  His puzzle-solving skills, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts make computer science a possibility, though not as strong as agricultural sciences.
* **Business Administration (0.1):** While intelligence and empathy are useful in business, the description lacks strong indicators of interest in finance, management, or marketing, leading to a low probability.

**Important Note:** This is a subjective assessment based on limited information.  Personality provides clues, but many other factors influence a person's field of study.
