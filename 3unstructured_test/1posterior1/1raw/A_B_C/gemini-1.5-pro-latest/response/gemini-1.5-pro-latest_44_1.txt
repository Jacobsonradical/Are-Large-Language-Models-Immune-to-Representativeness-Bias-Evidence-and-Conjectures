Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals strongly suggests an affinity for this field. His empathy and caring nature would make him well-suited for a career involving animals or the environment. 
* **Computer Science:** Adam's puzzle-solving skills and intelligence indicate an aptitude for computer science. This field often attracts individuals who enjoy abstract thinking and problem-solving.
* **Business Administration:** While Adam possesses traits like intelligence and an appreciation for hard work that could be beneficial in business, his personality profile doesn't strongly suggest a passion for this field. His interests seem to lie more in scientific or nature-related areas.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are subjective and based on a limited personality sketch. There's always a chance Adam could be pursuing a field not listed or one that doesn't perfectly align with these initial impressions.
