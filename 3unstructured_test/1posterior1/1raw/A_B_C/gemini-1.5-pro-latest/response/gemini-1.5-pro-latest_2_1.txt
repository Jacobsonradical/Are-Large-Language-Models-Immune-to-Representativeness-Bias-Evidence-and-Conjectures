Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals strongly suggests an inclination towards this field.  His empathy and warm heart further support this possibility. 
* **Business Administration (0.1):**  The description doesn't highlight typical business-oriented traits like ambition for leadership or financial success. While intelligence is useful in business, it's not the primary indicator.
* **Computer Science (0.3):** Adam's puzzle-solving ability and aptitude for abstract concepts point towards potential in computer science. However, his strong connection to nature makes fields directly related to it more likely. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are speculative and based solely on a brief personality sketch.  Many other fields could be a good fit for Adam.
