Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):**  Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly suggests a high probability of interest in this field. 
* **Computer Science (0.3):**  His puzzle-solving skills and intelligence make computer science a possibility, but the description lacks a strong indication of a passion for technology or programming.
* **Business Administration (0.1):** While intelligence is valuable in business,  Adam's empathy, love for nature, and lack of explicit interest in business concepts make this field the least likely. 

**Important Note:** This is a speculative assessment based on a limited personality sketch.  People's interests and career choices are complex and influenced by many factors not captured here.
