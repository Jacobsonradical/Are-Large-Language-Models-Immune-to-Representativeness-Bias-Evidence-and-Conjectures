Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly suggest an affinity for this field. This receives the highest probability.
* **Computer Science:** His puzzle-solving skills, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts point towards computer science as a likely field. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, Adam's other traits don't strongly align with this field compared to the other two. This receives the lowest probability.

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on a personality sketch.  People's actual academic pursuits are influenced by a wide range of factors not captured here.
