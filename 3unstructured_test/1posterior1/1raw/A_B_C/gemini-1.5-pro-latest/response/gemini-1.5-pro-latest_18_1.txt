Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):**  Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals strongly suggests an affinity for this field. His empathy and warm heart further support this possibility. 
* **Computer Science (0.3):**  While not as strong as the connection to agriculture, Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his high intelligence make computer science a plausible field. Abstract thinking is crucial in computer science.
* **Business Administration (0.1):** The description provides little evidence to suggest an interest in business administration. While understanding hard work and dedication are relevant, they are not unique to business and can be applied to many fields. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are speculative and based solely on a brief personality sketch. Many other fields could be a good fit for Adam.
