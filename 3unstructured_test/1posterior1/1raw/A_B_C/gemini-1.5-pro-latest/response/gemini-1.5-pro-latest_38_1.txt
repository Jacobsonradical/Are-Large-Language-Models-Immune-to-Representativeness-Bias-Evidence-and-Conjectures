Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.6):**  Adam's love for nature, animals, and his understanding of hard work and dedication strongly suggest this field. 
* **Computer Science (0.3):** His puzzle-solving skills and intelligence make computer science a possibility. Many areas within computer science require abstract thinking.
* **Business Administration (0.1):**  While Adam might be a compassionate and intelligent individual, the description doesn't particularly lend itself to a strong interest in business administration.  

**Important Note:** These probabilities are subjective estimations based on a brief personality sketch. Many other graduate fields could align with Adam's interests.
