Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly suggest a high probability of interest in agricultural or veterinary fields. 
* **Computer Science (0.3):**  His enjoyment of puzzles and ability with abstract concepts could point towards computer science. However, the personality description lacks a strong indication of typical interests in technology or programming often associated with this field.
* **Business Administration (0.1):** While intelligence is valuable in business, Adam's profile lacks clear indicators like an interest in leadership, management, or finance, making this the least likely field.

**Important Note:** This is a speculative assessment based on a limited personality sketch.  Many other fields could align with Adam's interests, and individual preferences can vary greatly.
