Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly suggests a high probability of interest in this field.
* **Business administration:** While Adam's intelligence could lend itself to business, his personality description lacks clear indicators of interest in the corporate world or financial management. 
* **Computer science:**  Adam's puzzle-solving skills and ability to grasp abstract concepts suggest a possible affinity for computer science. However,  his love for nature might make this field less likely than agricultural and veterinary sciences.
