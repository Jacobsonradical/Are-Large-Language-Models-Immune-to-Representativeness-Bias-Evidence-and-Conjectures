Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.6):** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly suggests a high probability of him pursuing a graduate degree in this field.
* **Computer Science (0.3):** His puzzle-solving skills, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts make computer science a plausible field of study. 
* **Business Administration (0.1):**  While intelligence is valuable in business, Adam's personality sketch doesn't exhibit strong indicators of interest in the core elements of business administration (finance, marketing, management). Therefore, the probability is relatively low.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are subjective estimations based on a limited personality profile. Other fields related to biology, environmental science, or animal behavior could also be strong contenders for Adam's graduate studies.
