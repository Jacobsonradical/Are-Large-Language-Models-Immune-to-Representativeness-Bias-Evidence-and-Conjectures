Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals strongly suggests an affinity for these fields. His empathy and warmth further support this likelihood.

* **Business Administration (0.1):** While Adam's intelligence could lend itself to business, his personality sketch doesn't highlight typical interests associated with this field, such as leadership, finance, or marketing. 

* **Computer Science (0.3):** Adam's puzzle-solving skills and ability to grasp abstract concepts indicate potential in computer science. However, his primary interests seem more aligned with the natural world.
