Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.5",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.5):** Adam's love for animals and curiosity about plants strongly suggest an affinity for this field. 
* **Computer Science (0.4):**  His puzzle-solving skills and ability to grasp abstract concepts are strong indicators of aptitude for computer science. 
* **Business Administration (0.1):** While Adam's empathy and understanding of hard work could be valuable in business, his other traits point more strongly towards fields focused on nature or analytical problem-solving. 

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on a limited personality profile.  Many other graduate fields could also be a good fit for Adam.
