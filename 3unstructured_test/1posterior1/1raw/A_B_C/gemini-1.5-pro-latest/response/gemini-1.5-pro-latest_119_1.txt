Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science (0.7):** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly suggests a high probability of interest in agricultural or veterinary fields. 
* **Business administration (0.1):**  The description doesn't highlight typical business-oriented traits like leadership, ambition for financial success, or strong interpersonal/persuasion skills. Thus, the probability is low. 
* **Computer science (0.3):**  While Adam's puzzle-solving skills and intelligence could point towards computer science, the lack of any mention of technology or programming makes it less likely than agricultural and veterinary sciences. However, his aptitude for abstract concepts keeps this a possibility, hence a moderate probability.
