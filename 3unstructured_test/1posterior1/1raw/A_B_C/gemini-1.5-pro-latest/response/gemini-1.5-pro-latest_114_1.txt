Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly suggests an affinity for these fields. His intelligence and analytical skills would also be valuable.
* **Business Administration (0.1):**  While Adam is intelligent and capable, his personality description lacks the typical drive for business, finance, or management often associated with MBA students.
* **Computer Science (0.3):**  Adam's puzzle-solving ability and aptitude for abstract concepts make computer science a possibility. However, his primary interests seem more aligned with the natural world. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are speculative and based solely on a brief personality sketch. Many other graduate fields could also be a good fit for Adam.
