**Explanation:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly suggest a high probability of being in this field. 
* **Computer science:**  While Adam's puzzle-solving skills and intelligence could point towards computer science, the personality sketch lacks strong indicators like a passion for technology or programming.
* **Business administration:**  Adam's profile doesn't align well with the typical traits associated with business administration, like ambition for leadership or interest in finance. 

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on a limited personality sketch.  Many other fields could be possibilities for Adam, and it's impossible to be certain without more information.
