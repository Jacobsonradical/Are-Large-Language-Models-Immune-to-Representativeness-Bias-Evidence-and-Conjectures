Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly suggest a high probability of interest in this field. 
* **Computer Science:**  His puzzle-solving skills and grasp of abstract concepts make computer science a possibility, though the description lacks a direct connection to technology. 
* **Business Administration:**  While intelligence is valuable in business, Adam's empathy, love for animals, and nature connection make this field less likely. 

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on a limited personality sketch.  Many other fields could also be a good fit for Adam.
