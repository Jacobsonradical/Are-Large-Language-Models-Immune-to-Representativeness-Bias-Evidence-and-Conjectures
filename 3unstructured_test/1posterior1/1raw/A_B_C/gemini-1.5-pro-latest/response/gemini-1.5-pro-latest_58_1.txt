Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** Adam's love for nature, animals, and plants strongly suggests an affinity for this field.  His curiosity about nature further supports this.
* **Computer Science (0.3):** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his high intelligence indicate an aptitude for problem-solving, a key aspect of computer science. His ability to understand abstract concepts is also relevant to this field. 
* **Business Administration (0.1):** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, there's little in the description to directly suggest an interest in this area. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are subjective estimations based on limited information.  A person's true academic pursuits are complex and influenced by many factors not captured in a short personality sketch.
