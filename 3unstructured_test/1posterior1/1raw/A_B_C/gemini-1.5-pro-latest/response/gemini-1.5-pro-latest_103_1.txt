**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.6):** This is the most likely field for Adam.  His love of nature, plants, and animals, along with his empathy, strongly suggests an interest in this area. 
* **Computer Science (0.3):** Adam's puzzle-solving skills and ability with abstract concepts make computer science a possibility.  Many areas within computer science, like AI or data science, also involve working with complex systems, which might appeal to him.
* **Business Administration (0.1):** While his understanding of "hard work and dedication" might be applicable to business, there's nothing else in the description to suggest a strong pull towards business administration.  It's therefore the least likely field for him.
