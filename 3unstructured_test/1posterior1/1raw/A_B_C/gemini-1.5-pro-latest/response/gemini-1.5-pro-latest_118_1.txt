Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.6):** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly suggests a high probability of interest in agricultural or veterinary fields. 
* **Computer Science (0.4):**  His puzzle-solving ability and aptitude for abstract concepts are good indicators of a potential interest in computer science. 
* **Business Administration (0.2):** While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, Adam's profile doesn't strongly suggest this path compared to the other two.  

**Important Note:** These probabilities are educated guesses based on personality traits.  Many other graduate fields could also be a good fit for Adam.
