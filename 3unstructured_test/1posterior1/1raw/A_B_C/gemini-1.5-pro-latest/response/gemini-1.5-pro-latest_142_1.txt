Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** This is the most likely field for Adam. His love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work (farming/animal care) strongly suggest this area.
* **Computer Science (0.4):** Adam's puzzle-solving skills and ability with abstract concepts make computer science a plausible field. While not directly mentioned, these traits are often found in CS students. 
* **Business Administration (0.1):**  This is the least likely option. Adam's personality profile doesn't align well with the typical traits associated with business administration, such as a strong focus on leadership, competition, or financial gain.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are subjective estimations based on a limited personality sketch. Many other graduate fields could be a good fit for Adam.
