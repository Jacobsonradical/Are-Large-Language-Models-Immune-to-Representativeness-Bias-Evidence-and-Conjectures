Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.6):**  The strongest indicators for this field are Adam's love of nature, interest in plants, and empathy for animals. 
* **Computer Science (0.4):** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts are strong indicators of aptitude for computer science.
* **Business Administration (0.1):** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applied to business, the personality sketch lacks strong indicators of a specific interest in business concepts or a desire for a business-oriented career. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are based on subjective interpretation of a brief personality sketch.  A more accurate assessment would require more information about Adam's interests, skills, and aspirations.
