**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.6):**  Adam's love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work strongly suggest a high probability of being in this field. 
* **Computer Science (0.3):** Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and his intelligence could point towards computer science. His understanding of abstract concepts is also a valuable trait in this field.
* **Business Administration (0.1):**  While intelligence is useful in business, there is little in the description to suggest Adam is drawn to this field. His empathy and love for nature don't typically align with traditional business goals. 

**Important Note:** This is a speculative estimate based on limited information. Many other graduate fields could be a good fit for Adam.
