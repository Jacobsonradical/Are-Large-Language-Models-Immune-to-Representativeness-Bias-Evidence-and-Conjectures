Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.6):**  Adam's love for animals, curiosity about nature, and empathy make this field the most likely. His intelligence and ability to grasp abstract concepts would also serve him well in this area. 
* **Computer Science (0.3):**  Adam's puzzle-solving abilities and intelligence make computer science a possibility. However, the description lacks direct indicators of a strong interest in technology or programming. 
* **Business Administration (0.1):**  While Adam's appreciation for hard work could be applied to business, his personality profile doesn't strongly suggest a drive for the corporate world.  

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on a limited personality sketch. There's a chance Adam could be in a completely different field that aligns with his interests in other ways.
