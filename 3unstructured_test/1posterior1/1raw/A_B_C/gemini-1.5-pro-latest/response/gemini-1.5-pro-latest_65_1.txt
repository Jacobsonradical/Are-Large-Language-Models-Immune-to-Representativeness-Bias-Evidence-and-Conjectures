Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly suggest an affinity for this field. His intelligence would be valuable in research or practical applications within these areas. 
* **Computer Science (0.3):**  While not a perfect fit, Adam's puzzle-solving abilities and capacity for abstract thought could translate well to computer science. This field often attracts those with a love for logic and problem-solving. 
* **Business Administration (0.1):**  Adam's personality sketch doesn't strongly suggest an inclination towards business administration. While intelligence and empathy are valuable in this field, his other traits point more strongly towards fields focused on science and nature. 

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are estimates based on limited information.  A deeper understanding of Adam's specific interests, skills, and goals would be needed for a more accurate prediction.
