Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science (0.7):** Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals strongly suggests an inclination towards fields like botany, environmental science, or veterinary medicine. This makes agricultural and veterinary science highly probable.

* **Business administration (0.1):**  The description doesn't highlight typical business-oriented traits like leadership, ambition for financial success, or strong networking skills. While Adam's intelligence could translate to business, his other interests make it less likely.

* **Computer science (0.3):** Adam's puzzle-solving skills and ability to grasp abstract concepts hint at a potential aptitude for computer science.  However, his strong affinity for nature makes this field less likely than agricultural and veterinary sciences, but still a possibility.
