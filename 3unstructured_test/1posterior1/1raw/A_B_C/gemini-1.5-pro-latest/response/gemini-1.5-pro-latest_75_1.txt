Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly suggest a high probability for this field. 
* **Computer science:** His puzzle-solving skills and ability with abstract concepts make computer science a possibility, though his personality profile doesn't lean as heavily towards it.
* **Business administration:** While intelligence is valuable in business, Adam's other traits don't align strongly with a typical business administration path. 

**Important Note:**  These are just educated guesses based on a personality sketch.  Many other graduate fields could also be a good fit for Adam.
