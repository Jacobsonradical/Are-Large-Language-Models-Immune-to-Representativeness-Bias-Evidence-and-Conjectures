Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):**  Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly suggests a high probability of interest in this field. 
* **Business Administration (0.1):** While intelligence is useful in business, Adam's profile lacks clear indicators of interest in finance, marketing, or management.  
* **Computer Science (0.3):** Adam's puzzle-solving skills and ability with abstract concepts could point towards computer science. However, his other traits lean more heavily towards life sciences. 

**Important Note:** This is a subjective assessment based on a limited personality sketch.  People's interests are complex, and it's impossible to definitively determine someone's field of study based solely on these traits.
