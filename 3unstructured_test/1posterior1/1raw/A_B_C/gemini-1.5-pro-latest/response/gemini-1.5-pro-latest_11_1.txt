Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.6):**  Adam's love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants, and empathy make this field highly likely. 
* **Computer Science (0.3):**  His puzzle-solving ability and aptitude for abstract concepts suggest a good fit for computer science.
* **Business Administration (0.1):** While his appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applied to business, nothing in the description strongly points towards an interest in business administration. 

**Important Note:** These are just estimates based on limited information.  Personality provides a loose guide, but many other factors (personal experiences, career goals, financial considerations) influence a person's field of study.
