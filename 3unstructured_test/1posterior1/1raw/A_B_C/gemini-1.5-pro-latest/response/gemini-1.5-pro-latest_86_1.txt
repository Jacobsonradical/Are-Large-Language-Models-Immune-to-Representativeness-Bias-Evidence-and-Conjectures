**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.6):** Adam's deep love for animals and curiosity about nature, particularly plants, strongly suggest a high probability of him pursuing a graduate degree in a field related to agriculture or veterinary science.
* **Computer Science (0.3):** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his high intelligence, particularly his understanding of abstract concepts, align well with the skills needed for computer science. This field also attracts individuals who appreciate logic and problem-solving. 
* **Business Administration (0.1):** While Adam's understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication are valuable traits in business, the personality sketch doesn't provide strong indicators of a specific interest in business administration. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are subjective estimations based on the provided personality sketch. Many other graduate fields could be likely for Adam, and without more information, it's impossible to determine his actual field of study with certainty.
