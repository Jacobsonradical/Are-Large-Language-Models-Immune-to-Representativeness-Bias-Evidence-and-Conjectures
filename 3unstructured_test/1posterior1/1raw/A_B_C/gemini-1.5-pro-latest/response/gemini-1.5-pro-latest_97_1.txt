Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**  Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly suggests a high probability of interest in this field. 
* **Computer Science:**  While not a perfect fit, Adam's puzzle-solving skills and intelligence make computer science a possibility.  Abstract thinking is highly valued in this field.
* **Business Administration:** This field seems least likely. Adam's personality description lacks clear indicators of interest in business, management, or finance. His empathy and warm heart might be found in more socially-oriented business areas, but the overall profile makes this a less probable choice.
