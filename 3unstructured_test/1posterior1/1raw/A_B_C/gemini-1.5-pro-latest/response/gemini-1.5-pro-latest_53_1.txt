Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals strongly suggests an inclination towards fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary science.  His empathy aligns well with caring for animals.
* **Business Administration (0.1):**  The description doesn't highlight typical business-oriented traits like ambition for leadership or financial success. While his intelligence could be applied to business, it's less likely given his other interests.
* **Computer Science (0.3):** Adam's puzzle-solving skills and ability to grasp abstract concepts indicate potential in computer science. However, his passion for nature makes fields directly related to it more probable. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on a limited personality sketch.  Many other fields could be a good fit for Adam. His actual field of study in 2021 could have been influenced by numerous other factors not mentioned in the description.
