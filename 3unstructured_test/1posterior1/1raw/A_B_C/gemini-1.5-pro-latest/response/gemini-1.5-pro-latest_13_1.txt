Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.6):**  The strongest indicators for this field are Adam's love of nature, interest in plants, and empathy for animals. 
* **Computer Science (0.4):** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his ability to grasp abstract concepts suggest an aptitude for computer science. His high intelligence further supports this possibility.
* **Business Administration (0.1):** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, there's little in his personality sketch to strongly suggest this field. 

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on limited information.  Personality traits alone are not definitive predictors of someone's field of study. Many other factors influence educational choices.
