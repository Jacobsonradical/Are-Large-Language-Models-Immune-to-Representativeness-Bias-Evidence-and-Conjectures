Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science (High Probability):** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly suggests an affinity for these fields. 
* **Computer science (Moderate Probability):**  His puzzle-solving skills and aptitude for abstract concepts align well with computer science. 
* **Business administration (Low Probability):** While intelligence is valuable in business, the description lacks clear indicators of interest in business concepts, leadership, or finance, making it less likely.

**Important Note:** These are just estimations based on a personality sketch.  People's interests and career paths are complex and can't be definitively determined from a short description.
