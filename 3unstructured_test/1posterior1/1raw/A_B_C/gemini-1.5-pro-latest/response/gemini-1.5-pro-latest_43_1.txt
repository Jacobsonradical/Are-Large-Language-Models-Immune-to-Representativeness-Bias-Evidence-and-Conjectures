Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's love for nature, animals, and appreciation for hard work strongly suggests an affinity for this field. This receives the highest probability.
* **Computer Science:** His puzzle-solving skills and aptitude for abstract concepts make computer science a possibility. However, the description lacks direct links to technology or programming, making it less likely than agricultural science. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence is valuable in business, Adam's empathy and lack of interest in typical business-oriented traits (ambition, leadership, risk-taking) make this the least likely option. 

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on a personality sketch.  People are complex, and Adam's actual field of study could be something entirely different!
