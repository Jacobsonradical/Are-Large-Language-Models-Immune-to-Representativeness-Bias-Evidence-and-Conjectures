Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):**  Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals strongly suggests an inclination towards this field. His empathy and warm heart further support this possibility. 
* **Computer Science (0.3):** While not as strong a connection as with agricultural sciences, Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and ability to grasp abstract concepts could point towards an interest in computer science.
* **Business Administration (0.1):** The description doesn't offer strong indicators for business administration. While his understanding of hard work and dedication is relevant, it's not specific enough to suggest a high probability for this field.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are subjective estimations based on a limited personality sketch. Many other fields could also be a good fit for Adam.
