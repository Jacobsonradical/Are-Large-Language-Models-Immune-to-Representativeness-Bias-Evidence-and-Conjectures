Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly suggest a high probability of him pursuing studies in this field. 
* **Computer Science:**  While not directly indicated in the description, Adam's puzzle-solving skills and intelligence make computer science a possibility. However, the lack of direct indicators makes it less likely than agricultural/veterinary science.
* **Business Administration:** Adam's profile doesn't strongly suggest an inclination towards business. His empathy and love for nature seem to point away from a purely business-oriented field, making this the least likely option. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are subjective estimations based on a limited personality sketch.  Other fields of study could also be a good fit for Adam.
