Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):**  Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly suggest this field. His intelligence and ability with abstract concepts would also be beneficial. 
* **Computer Science (0.3):** Adam's puzzle-solving ability and intelligence make computer science a possibility. However, the description lacks a strong indicator of interest in technology or programming, making it less likely than agricultural sciences.
* **Business Administration (0.1):**  There's little in Adam's personality that points to business administration. While intelligence and empathy are useful in business, his core interests seem to lie elsewhere.
