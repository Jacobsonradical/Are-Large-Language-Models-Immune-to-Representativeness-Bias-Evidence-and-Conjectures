Explanation:

* **Agricultural and veterinary science** is given the highest probability because Adam's love for animals and interest in plants aligns strongly with this field. 
* **Computer science** is given a moderate probability because people in this field often enjoy problem-solving and understanding abstract concepts, which describe Adam. 
* **Business administration** is given the lowest probability because nothing in the description points to interests commonly associated with this field. While Adam's understanding of hard work and dedication could be applicable, it's not specific enough to warrant a higher probability.
