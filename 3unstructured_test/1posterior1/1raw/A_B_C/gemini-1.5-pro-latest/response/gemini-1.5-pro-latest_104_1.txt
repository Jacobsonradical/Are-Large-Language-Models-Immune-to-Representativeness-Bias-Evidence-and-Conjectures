Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.75",
  "business administration": "0.15",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**  Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals makes this field highly probable. His empathy and warm heart further suggest a potential interest in animal care. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's intelligence and understanding of hard work could be applicable to business, nothing in his profile directly points to an interest in this field.  The probability is therefore lower.
* **Computer Science:** Adam's puzzle-solving skills and ability to grasp abstract concepts suggest an aptitude for computer science. This field is a reasonable possibility, though not as strong as agricultural and veterinary sciences based on his stated interests.
