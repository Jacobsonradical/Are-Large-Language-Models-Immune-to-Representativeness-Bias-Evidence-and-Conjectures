**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:** Adam's love for animals and interest in plants strongly suggest this field. His intelligence and appreciation for hard work further support this likelihood. 
* **Computer science:** Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and his ability with abstract concepts make computer science a possibility.
* **Business administration:** While Adam's empathy could be useful in business, nothing in his personality description points strongly towards an interest in this field. Thus, it's the least likely.
