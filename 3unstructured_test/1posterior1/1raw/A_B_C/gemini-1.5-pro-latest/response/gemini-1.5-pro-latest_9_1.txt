Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science (0.7):** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly suggests an inclination towards fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary science. 
* **Business administration (0.1):**  The description doesn't highlight typical business-oriented traits like ambition for leadership, financial drive, or strong interpersonal skills. While possible, it seems less likely.
* **Computer science (0.3):** Adam's puzzle-solving ability and aptitude for abstract concepts could point towards computer science. This field often attracts individuals who enjoy problem-solving and have a logical mindset. However, his other interests make this field less likely compared to agricultural and veterinary sciences.
