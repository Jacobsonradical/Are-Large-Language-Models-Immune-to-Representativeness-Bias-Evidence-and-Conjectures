Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.5",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.5):** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly suggest this field. His curiosity about plants further supports this as a likely choice.
* **Computer Science (0.4):** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his intelligence, particularly with abstract concepts, make computer science a good fit. Many areas within computer science require problem-solving skills and logical thinking. 
* **Business Administration (0.1):** While Adam's empathy could be valuable in business, the description doesn't strongly point towards an interest in the core aspects of business administration like finance, marketing, or management. 

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on a personality sketch. Many other fields could also be a good fit for Adam, and individual interests can vary greatly.
