Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly suggests a high probability of interest in this field. 
* **Computer Science (0.3):**  His puzzle-solving skills and ability to grasp abstract concepts make computer science a possibility, though the description lacks direct indicators like a passion for technology or programming.
* **Business Administration (0.1):**  The personality sketch provides little evidence to suggest an inclination toward business administration. While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, they aren't strong indicators on their own.

**Important Note:** This assessment is based on a limited personality sketch.  Real-life career choices are influenced by a much broader range of factors.
