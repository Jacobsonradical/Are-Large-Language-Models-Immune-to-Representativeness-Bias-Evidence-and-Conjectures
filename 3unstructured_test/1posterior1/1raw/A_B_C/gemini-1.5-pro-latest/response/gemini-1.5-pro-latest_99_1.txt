Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):**  Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals strongly suggests an affinity for this field. His empathy and warm heart also align well with careers focused on animal care or agricultural sustainability.
* **Business Administration (0.1):**  The description doesn't offer strong indicators for business administration. While intelligence and problem-solving are valuable in business, there's no direct mention of interests like finance, marketing, or management.
* **Computer Science (0.3):** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and ability to grasp abstract concepts could point towards computer science.  However, the lack of any mention of technology or programming makes this a less likely choice than agricultural and veterinary science. 

**Important Note:** This assessment is based on limited information and relies on stereotypical associations.  People's interests and career choices are complex and can't be perfectly predicted by a short personality sketch.
