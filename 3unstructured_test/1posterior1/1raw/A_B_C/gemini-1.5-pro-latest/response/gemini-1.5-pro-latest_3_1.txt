Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):**  Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals strongly suggests an affinity for this field. His empathy and warm heart align with caring for animals. 
* **Business Administration (0.1):**  Nothing in the description points towards an interest in business. While intelligence is useful in business, his other traits make it less likely.
* **Computer Science (0.3):** Adam's puzzle-solving skills and ability to grasp abstract concepts could point towards computer science. However, there's no direct mention of technology or programming interest. 

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on a limited personality sketch. Many other fields could also be a good fit for Adam.
