Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals makes this field highly probable. His empathy and warmth suggest a possible interest in animal welfare.
* **Computer Science:**  Adam's puzzle-solving skills and aptitude for abstract concepts align well with computer science. This field is a possibility, but the description lacks strong indicators like a passion for technology or programming. 
* **Business Administration:**  While Adam likely possesses the intelligence for business, his personality description doesn't point towards interests typically associated with this field (e.g., leadership, finance, management). His appreciation for hard work and dedication is a general trait, not specific to business. 

**Important Note:** This is just an estimated probability based on a limited personality sketch.  Many other fields could also be likely fits for Adam.
