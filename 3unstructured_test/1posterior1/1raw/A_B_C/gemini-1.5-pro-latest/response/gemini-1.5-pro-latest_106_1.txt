Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals strongly suggests an affinity for these fields. His empathy and warmth further support this, hinting at a possible desire to work with and care for animals. 
* **Business Administration (0.1):**  Nothing in the description directly points to an interest in business. While intelligence and an understanding of hard work are valuable in business, they are not unique to it. 
* **Computer Science (0.3):** Adam's puzzle-solving skills and ability to grasp abstract concepts could indicate an aptitude for computer science. However, there's no direct mention of technology or programming interest.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are speculative and based on a limited personality sketch. Many other fields could also be a good fit for Adam.
