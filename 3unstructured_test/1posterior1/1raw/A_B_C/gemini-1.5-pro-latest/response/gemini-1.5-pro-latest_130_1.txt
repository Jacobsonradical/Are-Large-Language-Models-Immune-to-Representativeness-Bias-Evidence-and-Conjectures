} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work makes this the most likely field. 
* **Computer science:**  His puzzle-solving ability and aptitude for abstract concepts make computer science a strong possibility. 
* **Business administration:** While Adam's intelligence could lead to success in business, his personality profile doesn't strongly suggest this field compared to the other two. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on a brief personality sketch. There's not enough information to definitively place Adam in any particular field.  Many other graduate fields could also be a good fit for him.
