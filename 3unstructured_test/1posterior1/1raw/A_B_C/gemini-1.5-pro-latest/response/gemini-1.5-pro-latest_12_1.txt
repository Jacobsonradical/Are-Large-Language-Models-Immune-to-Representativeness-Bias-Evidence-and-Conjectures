Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):**  Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly suggests an affinity for these fields. His intelligence would also be valuable in these scientific disciplines. 
* **Business Administration (0.1):** While Adam is intelligent, nothing in his profile points towards an interest in the core aspects of business like finance, marketing, or management. 
* **Computer Science (0.3):** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts could translate well to computer science. However, there's no direct mention of technology or programming interest. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are estimations based on limited information.  A person's actual field of study is influenced by a much wider range of factors.
