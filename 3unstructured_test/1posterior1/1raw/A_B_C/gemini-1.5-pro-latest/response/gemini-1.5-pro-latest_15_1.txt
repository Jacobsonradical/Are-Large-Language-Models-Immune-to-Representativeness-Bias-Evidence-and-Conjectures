Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (High Probability):** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly suggests a high probability of him being in a field related to agriculture or veterinary science.
* **Computer Science (Moderate Probability):**  Adam's puzzle-solving skills and intelligence make computer science a possibility.  His profile doesn't specifically lean towards technology, but these traits are often found in computer science students.
* **Business Administration (Low Probability):** While intelligence is valuable in business, Adam's profile lacks indicators like an interest in economics, leadership, or market dynamics, making business administration less likely. 

**Important Note:** These are just estimations based on a personality sketch.  People are complex, and there's always a chance Adam could be pursuing a field not immediately obvious from the description.
