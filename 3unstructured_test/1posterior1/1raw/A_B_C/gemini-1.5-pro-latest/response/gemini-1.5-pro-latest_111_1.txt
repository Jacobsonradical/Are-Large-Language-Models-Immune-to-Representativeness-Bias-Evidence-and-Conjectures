Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (High Probability):** Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals strongly suggests an affinity for these fields. His empathy and warm heart further support this likelihood. 
* **Computer Science (Moderate Probability):**  Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his high intelligence indicate a potential aptitude for computer science. Abstract thinking is crucial in this field.
* **Business Administration (Low Probability):** While Adam's intelligence could lend itself to business, the personality description lacks strong indicators of interest in finance, management, or marketing, which are core components of business administration. His appreciation for hard work isn't unique to business and fits within many fields. 

**Important Note:** This is a speculative assessment based on a limited personality sketch.  People's interests are complex, and there's always a chance Adam could be drawn to fields that don't perfectly align with these initial impressions.
