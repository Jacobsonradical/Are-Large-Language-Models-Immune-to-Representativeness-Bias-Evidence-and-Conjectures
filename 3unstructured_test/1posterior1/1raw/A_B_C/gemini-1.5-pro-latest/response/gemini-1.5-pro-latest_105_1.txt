**Explanation:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication strongly suggest a high probability of him being in this field. 
* **Computer science:**  While not a perfect fit, Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and ability with abstract concepts could point towards an interest in computer science.  
* **Business administration:** The personality sketch provides little to no indication of interest in business administration. His empathy and love for animals don't align well with typical business motivations, making this the least likely field for Adam.
