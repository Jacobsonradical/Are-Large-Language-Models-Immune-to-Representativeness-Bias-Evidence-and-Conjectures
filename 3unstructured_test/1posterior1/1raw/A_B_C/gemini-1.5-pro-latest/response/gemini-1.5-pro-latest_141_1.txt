Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):**  Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly suggests a high probability of interest in this field. 
* **Computer Science (0.3):**  His puzzle-solving skills and aptitude for abstract concepts make computer science a possibility, though his other traits don't point to it as strongly as agricultural sciences.
* **Business Administration (0.1):** The personality description doesn't align well with typical traits associated with business administration. While intelligence is useful, his other interests seem less relevant. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on limited information.  Adam's actual field of study could be entirely different!
