Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on the personality description:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (High Probability):** Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals strongly suggests an affinity for these fields. His empathy and warm heart further support this likelihood.
* **Computer Science (Moderate Probability):** Adam's puzzle-solving skills and intelligence indicate a potential aptitude for computer science. This field often attracts individuals who enjoy logic and abstract thinking.
* **Business Administration (Low Probability):** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, his core interests and personality traits don't strongly align with this field compared to the others. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are subjective estimations based on a limited personality sketch.  There's not enough information to definitively determine Adam's field of study.
