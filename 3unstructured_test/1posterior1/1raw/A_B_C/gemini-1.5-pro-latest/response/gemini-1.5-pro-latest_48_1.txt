Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly suggests an affinity for these fields. 
* **Computer Science:** His puzzle-solving skills and ability with abstract concepts make computer science a possibility. However, the description lacks a direct connection to technology or programming, making it less likely than agricultural/veterinary sciences.
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence is valuable in business, Adam's personality description lacks typical indicators of interest in this field, such as leadership, ambition for financial success, or interest in markets/economics. 

**Important Note:** This is just a probabilistic assessment based on limited information. There's no guarantee Adam fits neatly into these probabilities. He could easily be pursuing other fields entirely, or even combining his interests in unexpected ways.
