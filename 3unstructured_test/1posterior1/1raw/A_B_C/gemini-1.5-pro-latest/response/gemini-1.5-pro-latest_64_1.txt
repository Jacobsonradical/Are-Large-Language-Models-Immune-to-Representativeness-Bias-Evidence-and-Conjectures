Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science (0.7):** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly suggests an affinity for these fields. His curiosity about plants aligns well with agriculture. 
* **Computer science (0.4):**  Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his ability to grasp abstract concepts indicate potential for computer science. However, the description lacks direct links to technology or programming, so the probability is moderate.
* **Business administration (0.1):**  While intelligence is valuable in business, nothing in Adam's profile points towards an interest in business management, finance, or marketing. This makes it the least likely field for him.
