Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly suggests a high probability of being in this field. His interest in plants falls directly under agricultural studies. 
* **Computer Science (0.3):**  While not as strong a connection as the first, Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and ability to grasp abstract concepts could point towards an interest in computer science.  
* **Business Administration (0.1):** The personality sketch provides little evidence to suggest an inclination towards business administration.  While empathy and understanding hard work are valuable in business, they aren't specific enough to warrant a high probability.

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on a limited personality sketch.  Many other fields could also be a good fit for Adam.
