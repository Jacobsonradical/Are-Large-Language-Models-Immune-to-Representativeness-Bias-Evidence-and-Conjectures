Given Adam's strong curiosity about nature and plants, as well as a deep love for animals, there is a higher likelihood that he may be inclined towards fields that directly concern the natural world and life sciences. Agricultural and veterinary science, thus, seems like a natural fit for him. His high intelligence and skill at understanding abstract concepts may also suit the strategic thinking and problem-solving required in computer science, although his interests seem more aligned with the life sciences. The characteristics described do not directly align with business administration, as there is no mention of an interest in commerce, management, economic systems, or leadership in business contexts. Thus, his probability of studying business administration seems lower.

Here is the estimated probability distribution:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.5",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

These estimates reflect Adam's probable interests and capabilities based on the personality sketch provided, calculating moderate to strong probabilities based on related interests and skills.
