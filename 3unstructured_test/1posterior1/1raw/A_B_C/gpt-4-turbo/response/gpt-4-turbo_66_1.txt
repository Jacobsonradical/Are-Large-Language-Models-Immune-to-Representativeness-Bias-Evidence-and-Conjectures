Given Adam's personality sketch, interests, and skills:

- His genuine curiosity about nature and various plants suggests a strong alignment with fields related to the environment and biology. His love for animals aligns well with veterinary sciences. This makes agricultural and veterinary science a highly likely area of study for Adam.

- His interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence, especially in understanding abstract concepts, also makes computer science a plausible field. This field often requires abstract thinking and problem-solving skills, aligning well with his personality traits.

- However, nothing in the description directly suggests a strong connection to business administration. While his intelligence and ability to understand concepts could certainly be an asset in this field, there's no strong indication of interest in typical business topics like management, finance, or marketing.

Considering these observations, the estimates could be represented as follows:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
