Based on the personality sketch provided, here is an analysis that best estimates the probability of Adam being enrolled in each of the mentioned fields of study:

1. **Computer Science**: Adam's interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence align with typical characteristics favorable for computer science, particularly his ability to understand abstract concepts. However, his specific interest in nature and animals isn't strongly connected to computer science. Thus, the alignment is partial.

2. **Business Administration**: While the ability to understand abstract concepts and high intelligence could also benefit a student in business administration, there is little in the description that directly ties Adam to this field, such as an interest in management, finance, or entrepreneurship.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, along with his deep love for animals, makes agricultural and veterinary science a very likely field of study. His emotional qualities such as empathy and a warm heart are particularly well-suited to veterinary science.

Based on this analysis, here are the estimated probabilities:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
