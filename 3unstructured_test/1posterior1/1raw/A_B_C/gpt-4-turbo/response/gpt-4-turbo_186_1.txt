Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, here are the estimated probabilities that he was enrolled in the specified fields:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Given Adam's genuine curiosity for nature and various plants, coupled with his deep love for animals, it is plausible to theorize that this field would be highly interesting and suitable for him. Therefore, the probability of him enrolling in agricultural and veterinary science is likely higher.
  
- **Business Administration:** There is little in Adam's personality sketch that directly correlates with typical interests or skills directly associated with business administration (like a strong inclination towards leadership, management, or financial interests). However, his strong empathy and understanding might still make this field a possibility, albeit less likely.

- **Computer Science:** His enjoyment in solving puzzles and high intelligence, especially in understanding abstract concepts, aligns well with the skillset beneficial for computer science. This makes it a reasonable assumption that he could have been interested in this field, although his other expressed interests might slightly lessen this probability compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
