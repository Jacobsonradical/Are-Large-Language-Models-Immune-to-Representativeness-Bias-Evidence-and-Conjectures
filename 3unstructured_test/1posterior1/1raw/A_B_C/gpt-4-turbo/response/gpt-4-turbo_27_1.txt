Based on the personality sketch provided, we can make some educated guesses about the probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the specified fields. These estimates are derived from the attributes mentioned in the description:

1. **Computer Science**: Adam's interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence, particularly in understanding abstract concepts, suggests that he might be well-suited for computer science, a field that often requires analytical thinking and problem-solving skills. However, his primary interests in nature and plants do not strongly align with typical computer science fields unless he is focusing on bioinformatics or computational biology.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field aligns closely with Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and various plants, as well as his love for animals. His empathy could also be a beneficial trait for veterinary science, indicating he might handle the emotional aspects of working with animals effectively. Given these interests, this field seems quite likely.

3. **Business Administration**: While Adam has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication, which are valuable in any field, there's no direct indication that his interests lean towards business administration. His focus seems more aligned with scientific or environmental subjects rather than business practices, leadership, and administration.

Based on these insights, probabilities (in a range between 0 and 1 where 0 is extremely unlikely and 1 is extremely likely) might look something like this:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
