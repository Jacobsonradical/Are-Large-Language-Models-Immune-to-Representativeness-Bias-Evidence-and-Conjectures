Based on Adam's described personality and interests, here is an estimate of the probability for each field:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field aligns closely with Adamâ€™s interests in nature and love for animals. Thus, there is a relatively high probability that he may be studying within this discipline considering his characteristics.
  
- **Business Administration**: Given Adam's characteristics are more aligned with empathy, solving puzzles, and an understanding of complex concepts rather than typical business skills such as leadership, competitiveness, and financial acumen, it's less likely he would be in this field.
  
- **Computer Science**: This is also a good match, considering his enjoyment of puzzles and high intelligence, suggesting he might enjoy the problem-solving aspects and the abstraction inherent in computer science.
