Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, here are the estimated probabilities of his enrollment in the specified fields:

- Business Administration: Generally associated with skills in management, leadership, finance, and entrepreneurship. While these are valuable and applicable across many disciplines, Adam's profile, highlighting his empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature, does not directly align with typical characteristics emphasized in business administration programs.

- Computer Science: Although this field requires high intelligence and problem-solving skills, which Adam seems to possess, there isn't a strong indicator from his hobbies or interests that specifically aligns with computer science, such as a passion for technology, coding, or digital problem-solving. However, his ability for abstract thinking might make this a somewhat possible choice.

- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Adam's description as someone who has a deep love for animals and a genuine curiosity about nature and its plants strongly aligns with the interests typically pursued in agricultural and veterinary sciences. This field would leverage his empathy, warmth, and specific interests in nature and animals.

Here is the structured response reflecting these interpretations:
