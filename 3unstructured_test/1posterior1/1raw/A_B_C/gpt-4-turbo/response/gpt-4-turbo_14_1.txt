Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, here is the estimated probability for each of the fields mentioned:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

The reasoning for these values is as follows:

- Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, coupled with his love for animals, suggests he might have a strong inclination towards agricultural and veterinary science. 
- His ability to understand abstract concepts and solve puzzles could align well with computer science, although it is less directly linked with his interests compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
- While Adam demonstrates strong empathy, warmth, and appreciation for hard work—qualities that can indeed be beneficial in business administration—the overall description leans less directly towards this field. Hence, the lower probability.
