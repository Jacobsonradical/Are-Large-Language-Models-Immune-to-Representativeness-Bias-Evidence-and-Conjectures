Based on the personality sketch of Adam, which highlights his curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and capability in understanding abstract concepts, we can attempt to estimate the likelihood of him being enrolled in certain graduate fields. It is important to note that everyone is unique and may not necessarily follow a direct path predictable by their interests, so the estimates provided here are based on common correlations between personality traits and academic fields.

{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

These values reflect the following reasoning:
- Business Administration often attracts individuals who are keen on leadership, management, or entrepreneurship. While Adam might gain from skills in this area, his described traits do not strongly suggest a primary interest in business.
- Computer Science can be an appealing field for those who enjoy solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts. Adam's interest aligns well with these aspects, thus a moderate probability.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science seems highly relevant to Adam's love for animals and curiosity about nature and plants. Given these specific interests, this field might be the most likely among the three specified.
