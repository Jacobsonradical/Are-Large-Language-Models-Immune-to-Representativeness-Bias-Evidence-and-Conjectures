Given Adam's personality sketch, here are the probabilities that he might be enrolled in each of the mentioned graduate fields:

- The description indicates a deep interest in nature and animals, suggesting a higher likelihood for agricultural and veterinary science.
- His enjoyment of solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with computer science.
- There is minimal direct information linking his personality to traits typically associated with business administration, though his appreciation for hard work and dedication could be a relevant, albeit weaker, indicator.

Based on this analysis, here's an approximate probability distribution:

{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.5",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
