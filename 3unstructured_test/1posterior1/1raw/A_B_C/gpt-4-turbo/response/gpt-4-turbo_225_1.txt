Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam appears to have a range of interests and characteristics that align somewhat variably with the fields of study mentioned. Here's the assessment:

- Adam's curiosity about nature and love for animals suggest a strong alignment with fields related to the environment and living organisms. This makes agricultural and veterinary science a highly plausible field of study for him.
  
- His enjoyment in solving puzzles and high intelligence, especially in understanding abstract concepts, could indicate an aptitude for computer science, which often requires strong problem-solving skills and the ability to grasp complex, abstract theories.

- There are fewer direct indicators that Adam would be enrolled in business administration based on the traits described. While his appreciation for hard work and dedication could be advantageous in any field, these qualities alone do not strongly suggest an inclination towards business studies compared to the more clearly aligned interests in nature and problem-solving associated with agricultural/veterinary sciences and computer science.

Using this analysis, here are the estimated probabilities:

  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6",
