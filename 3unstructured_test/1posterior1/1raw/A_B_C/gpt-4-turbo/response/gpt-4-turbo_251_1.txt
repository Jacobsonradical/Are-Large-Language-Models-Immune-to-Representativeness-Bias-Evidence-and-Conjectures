Based on the personality sketch of Adam, here is an estimation of the probability that he was enrolled in each of the listed fields:

- **Computer Science:** Although Adam enjoys solving puzzles, which aligns with the problem-solving nature of computer science, there was no specific mention of an inclination towards technology or programming. This could somewhat lower the likelihood in this specific case compared to another field directly linked to his interests in nature and animals. Nevertheless, the analytical skills involved do create a relevant connection.

- **Business Administration:** Business administration typically requires strong interpersonal skills, understanding of business concepts, and often an interest in leadership or organizational goals. The prompt mentions Adam has empathy and appreciation for hard work, but lacks a direct correlation to business-oriented thinking or entrepreneurial interests.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's love for animals and curiosity about plants and nature directly aligns with a field in agricultural and veterinary sciences. His intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts would also serve well in scientific studies in these areas.

Here are the estimates:
