Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, who has a genuine curiosity about nature and various plants, a love for animals, and an empathetic nature, the likelihood of him being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science could be considered higher. His interest in abstract concepts and puzzle-solving could make him a good fit for fields that require analytical thinking like computer science. However, there is less information suggesting a strong alignment with business administration, which typically focuses more on managerial skills, economics, and less on natural sciences or direct problem-solving associated with puzzles and abstract thought.

Using a probabilistic approach and considering that many other fields of specialization exist, here's an estimation:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.5"
}
```

These values do not sum up to 1 as requested because the probabilities reflect the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in each field independently, without considering the probabilities of him studying other fields.
