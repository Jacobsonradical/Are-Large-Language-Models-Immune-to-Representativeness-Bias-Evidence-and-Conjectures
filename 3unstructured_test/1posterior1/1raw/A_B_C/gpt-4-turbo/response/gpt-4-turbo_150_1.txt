Based on the personality sketch and interests described for Adam, we can make educated guesses about his likely fields of study. Here are the probabilities based on the given traits:

- Adam has a strong interest in nature and its plants, a warm heart, empathy, and a love for animals. These traits suggest a higher likelihood of him being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- His high intelligence and ability for understanding abstract concepts make computer science a plausible field, though his specific interest in nature and animals is slightly less directly related to typical computer science applications. However, his interest in solving puzzles aligns well with the problem-solving skills often required in computer science.
- There is less information suggesting a direct connection to business administration. While empathy and understanding can be advantageous in business, these traits along with his interests seem more aligned with other areas.

Given these reflections, we can estimate the probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}
```

These values signify that it's more probable for Adam to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science due to his interests in plants and animals, a moderate possibility exists for computer science due to his puzzle-solving skills and intelligence, and a lower probability for business administration based on less direct evidence from the personality sketch provided.
