Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, who shows a strong curiosity toward nature and a love for animals, along with high intelligence and an ability to grasp abstract concepts—attributes suitable for rigorous and detailed fields—the estimations can be inferred as follows:

- **Computer Science**: Although Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with computer science, his specific interests and passions described do not heavily indicate a strong alignment with this field. Therefore, a moderate probability is suggested.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: His interests in nature and deep love for animals are very indicative of a passion for fields like agricultural or veterinary science. His traits suggest a high probability of being involved in studies that directly relate to his passions and empathy for living beings.
- **Business Administration**: There is less in the personality sketch that directly correlates with business administration, which often requires a passion for leadership, management, and a keen interest in business dynamics. Given his quiet nature and the lack of explicit mention of these interests, this seems less likely, but not impossible.

Here is the structured response based on the provided information:
