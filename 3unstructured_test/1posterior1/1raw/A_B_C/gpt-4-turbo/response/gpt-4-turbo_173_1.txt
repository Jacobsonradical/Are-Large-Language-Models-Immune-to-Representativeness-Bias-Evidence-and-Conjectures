Based on Adam's described interests and characteristics, here is an estimated probability for each field of study:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
} 

These probabilities are estimated based on Adamâ€™s noted curiosity about nature and love for animals, which highly aligns with agricultural and veterinary sciences. His intelligence and enjoyment in solving puzzles supplement his potential fit for computer science. His less explicit interest in typical business topics (e.g., finance, management, marketing) suggests a lower probability for business administration.
