Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, who has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and enjoys solving puzzles, we can make some estimated predictions about his potential fields of study in graduate school. The enjoyment of puzzles and strong empathy typically align more with fields that involve problem-solving, care, and possibly biology-focused disciplines, influencing the estimates provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.5"
}

These estimates reflect that Adam, given his interests and skills, might be most likely enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science due to his love for animals and plants. His capabilities in solving puzzles and high intelligence could also make computer science a suitable field, albeit slightly less likely. The estimate for business administration is lower, considering it does not directly correlate with his described passions and intellectual pursuits.
