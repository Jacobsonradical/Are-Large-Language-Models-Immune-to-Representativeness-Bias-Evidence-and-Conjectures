Based on the personality sketch and interests of Adam, particularly his curiosity about nature and plants, his empathy, and love for animals, it is plausible to infer that his graduate studies could align with his interests and personal attributes. Consideration is given to how these attributes might influence his choice of field:

1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science: His attributes directly align with the typical interests required for this field. His curiosity about nature and love for animals increases the likelihood he would pursue a field where these interests are fundamental.

2. Business Administration: While business administration does require intelligence and appreciation for hard work, the connection to his specific qualities such as a strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature, is less direct. Therefore, this might not be as strongly appealing unless he sees a path to incorporate his interests in an entrepreneurial way within this field.

3. Computer Science: His enjoyment of solving puzzles and strong intelligence suggests a possible fit for computer science, particularly areas within this field that require abstract thinking and logical problem-solving, such as algorithm design or software development. However, his direct interests in plants and animals aren't prominently reflected here unless he focuses on bioinformatics or computational biology.

Here is the estimated probability assignment considering these observations:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
``` 

These probabilities are not exhaustive nor exclusively definitive, other fields might also be suitable, and personal choices can vary widely based on a multitude of factors including opportunities, personal motivations, and specific goals.
