Given Adam's personality traits and interests:

- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, and a deep love for animals. This aligns closely with fields that involve direct interaction with nature or animals, making it considerably probable that he might be involved in agricultural or veterinary sciences.
- His enjoyment of puzzles and ability in understanding abstract concepts could also lean towards a field like computer science, which often involves complex problem-solving and theoretical thinking.
- There isn't a direct mentioning of interests or skills that typically align with business administration, such as leadership, finance, or market analysis.

Based on this analysis, the estimated probabilities for Adam's enrollment in each field are:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}
``` 

These values reflect the alignment between Adam's described personality/interests and the core requirements or focus areas of these fields of study.
