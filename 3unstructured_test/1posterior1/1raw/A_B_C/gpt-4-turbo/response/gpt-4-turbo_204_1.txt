Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, which emphasizes his curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and high intelligence, I shall estimate the probability of his enrollment in each of the specified graduate fields as follows:

- **Computer Science**: Although Adam has high intelligence and could potentially manage abstract concepts common in computer science, the description does not directly link him to a strong interest in technology or computing. Thus, the probability might be lower here.
  
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's interests in nature, plants, and animals align closely with agricultural and veterinary sciences. His empathy and love for animals particularly suggest a higher probability in fields related to animal care and nature conservation.

- **Business Administration**: There is no specific mention of interests in business, finance, management, or entrepreneurship. Although he appreciates hard work and dedication, which are valuable in any field, the connection to business administration is not as direct as with agricultural or veterinary science.

Considering these factors, the estimated probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
