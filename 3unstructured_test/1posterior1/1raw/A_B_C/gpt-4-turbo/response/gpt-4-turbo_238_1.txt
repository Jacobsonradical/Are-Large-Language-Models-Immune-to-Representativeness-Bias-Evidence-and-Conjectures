Based on the provided personality sketch of Adam, and considering his interests and aptitudes, here are the estimated probabilities of his enrollment in the specified graduate fields:

- Since Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and various plants, coupled with a deep love for animals, it's more likely he could be involved in a field closely related to these interests. Agricultural and veterinary science aligns well with these described passions.

- His enjoyment in solving puzzles and high intelligence, especially in understanding abstract concepts, suggests a fit for fields that require analytical and complex problem-solving skills, such as computer science.

- There's less information suggesting a direct link to business administration compared to the other fields, unless his interest in the 'hard work and dedication' can be interpreted as related to managing or administrating, but this is more tangential.

Considering these assessments, the estimated probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

These probabilities reflect a higher likelihood for fields closely tied to his interests in nature and analytical skills, with a lower probability for business administration based on the information given.
