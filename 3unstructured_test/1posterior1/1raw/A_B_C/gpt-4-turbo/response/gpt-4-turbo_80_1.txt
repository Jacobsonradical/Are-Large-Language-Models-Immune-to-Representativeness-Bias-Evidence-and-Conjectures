Based on the personality sketch provided, here's an estimated probability distribution regarding Adam's possible fields of study:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Reasoning:
- **Computer Science**: Adam's high intelligence and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts could align well with computer science, especially in areas that involve problem-solving and potentially artificial intelligence or robotics, which could intersect with his interest in nature.

- **Business Administration**: While Adam demonstrates qualities like empathy and dedication, these are less directly correlated with the typical skill sets and interests pursued in business administration. His profile suggests a focus on fields more directly related to natural sciences or technical disciplines.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's deep love for animals and curiosity about nature and plants strongly suggests his engagement could be more significant in fields like agricultural or veterinary sciences, where he can directly apply his interests and skills.
