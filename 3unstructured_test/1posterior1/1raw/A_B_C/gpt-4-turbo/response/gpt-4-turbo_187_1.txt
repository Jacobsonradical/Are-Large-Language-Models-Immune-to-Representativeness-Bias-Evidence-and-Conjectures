Based on the personality sketch of Adam and the details provided:

- Adam's interest in nature, plants, and a deep love for animals aligns closely with fields related to botany, biology, environmental science, or veterinary studies. This inclination toward natural elements suggests a probable affinity toward the agricultural and veterinary sciences.

- His passion for solving puzzles and high intelligence, particularly in understanding abstract concepts, can be commonly associated with fields that involve complex problem-solving and theoretical frameworks, like computer science.

- However, there is no direct indication of Adam's interest in areas typically covered by business administration, such as finance, management, or marketing. Although his appreciation for hard work and dedication is universal and could apply to any field, it is not specifically indicative of a preference for business administration without further context.

Given these observations, the estimated probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of these fields might look something like:
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.5"
}
