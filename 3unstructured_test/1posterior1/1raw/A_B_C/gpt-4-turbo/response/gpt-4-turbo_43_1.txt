Based on the personality sketch and interests provided, Adam's inclination towards nature, plants, and animals suggest a stronger alignment with fields related to these areas. His interest in solving puzzles and grasping abstract concepts also aligns well with fields that involve problem-solving and analytical skills. However, considering the entirety of the information provided:

- Business Administration: Though a valuable field, it doesn't directly align with Adam's described interests in nature and animals, or his noted intellectual pursuits towards solving puzzles or understanding abstract concepts. Hence, the likelihood here is lower.
- Computer Science: This field often involves problem-solving and understanding abstract concepts, which aligns with Adam's described interests in puzzles and intellectual challenges. However, there's no direct mention of a technology or computer-oriented inclination.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: This field aligns closely with Adam's profound interest in nature, plants, and animals, suggesting a higher probability compared to other mentioned fields.

The probability estimates, considering all the factors above, might reasonably be set as follows:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
