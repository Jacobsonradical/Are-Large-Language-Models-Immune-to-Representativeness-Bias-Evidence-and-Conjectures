Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, it suggests his interests align more directly with fields involving nature, animals, and possibly research into nature-related subjects due to his curiosity about nature and plants, and his love for animals. There's less mentioned that directly correlates to computer science or business administration, although his high intelligence and capability with abstract concepts could theoretically apply to those fields as well.

Therefore, the probabilities might be estimated as follows:

{
  "computer science": "0.2",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

This estimation reflects a higher probability for agricultural and veterinary science due to his affinity for nature and animals, a moderate but lower likelihood for computer science considering his puzzle-solving capabilities and understanding of abstract concepts, and a relatively lower likelihood for business administration as there seems to be less direct correlation with the interests and capabilities described.
