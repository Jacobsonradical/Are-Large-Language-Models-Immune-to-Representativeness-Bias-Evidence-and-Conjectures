Here is the estimation based on the described personality and interests of Adam:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

Explanation:
- Business Administration: While empathy and understanding are important for management and leadership roles, the specific interests and skills in puzzles and abstract concepts might make technical or more specialized fields more attractive than business administration, hence the lower probability.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Adam's love for animals and interest in plants suggests a higher likelihood of studying in fields that directly connect to these passions, such as agricultural or veterinary science.
- Computer Science: His enjoyment in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with computer science, which often involves problem-solving and abstract thinking. This would justify a moderate probability.
