Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for the fields Adam might be enrolled in as a graduate student:

- Adam's affinity for nature, plants, and a deep love for animals suggests a strong connection to fields related to biology and life sciences. Agricultural and veterinary science would strongly align with these interests.

- His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could also make him a good fit for computer science, particularly in areas like theoretical computer science or artificial intelligence, which involve complex problem-solving and abstract thinking.

- While Adam shows traits that can be valuable in business studies, such as an appreciation for hard work and dedication, there's less direct correlation between his described interests and business administration compared to the other fields.

Therefore, the estimates might look like:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```
