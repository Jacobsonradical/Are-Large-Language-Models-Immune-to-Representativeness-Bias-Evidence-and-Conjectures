Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, the probabilities that he was enrolled in certain fields can be estimated as follows:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Considering Adam's strong curiosity about nature and various plants, and his deep love for animals, this field might be a strong match for his interests and passions. Therefore, the probability he was studying in this field could be relatively high.
  
- **Business Administration:** This field might not align strongly with the specific interests and traits described, such as a focus on nature, plants, and animals. Business administration typically involves a focus on management, finance, and operations, which do not directly connect to his described interests.

- **Computer Science:** While this field can attract individuals with high intelligence and an appreciation for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, the specific interests in nature and animals are less directly connected. However, Adam's inclination towards puzzle-solving and abstract thought could still make this field a viable option, albeit less likely than agricultural and veterinary science.

Thus, the estimated probabilities might be:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
