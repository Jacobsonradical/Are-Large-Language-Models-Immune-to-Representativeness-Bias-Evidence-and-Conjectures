Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam and noting his interests and characteristics, here is an estimated probability for each of the given fields of study:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, and deep love for animals align well with the typical interests required in agricultural and veterinary sciences. Thus, he is likely to be drawn to these areas.
- **Computer Science**: While Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is good at understanding abstract concepts, which are valuable skills in computer science, these traits alone don't strongly indicate a particular inclination towards this field compared to his clear interest in nature and animals.
- **Business Administration**: Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication can be seen as relevant here; however, given his specific interest areas and personality traits, this field seems less likely than agricultural and veterinary sciences.

Here are the estimated probabilities in the required format:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```  

These probabilities reflect that while the traits shared might allow for a degree of suitability across different fields, the greater inclination appears towards agricultural and veterinary sciences based on the personality sketch provided.
