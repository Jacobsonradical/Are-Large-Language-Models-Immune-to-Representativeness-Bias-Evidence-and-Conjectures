Based on the personality sketch of Adam, which highlights his curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and strong empathy, it seems plausible that his interests align closely with a field related to those characteristics. Agricultural and veterinary science would be a likely fit for someone with these interests as this field encompasses both the study of plants and the care for animals.

On the other hand, although Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is strong in abstract concepts—traits desirable in computer science—there isn't a direct link between this skill set and his highlighted interests in the given personality sketch.

Business administration seems less likely compared to agricultural and veterinary science, based on the personality sketch provided. His characteristics do not directly suggest an inclination towards the typical motivations (e.g., leadership, management, profit optimization) associated with business administration.
