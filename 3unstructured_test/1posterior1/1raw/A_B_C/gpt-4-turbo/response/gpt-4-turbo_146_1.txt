Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, I would estimate the probabilities of him being enrolled in each of the specified graduate fields as follows:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.5",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

My rationale for these values is:

- Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, along with a deep love for animals, strongly align with interests typically found in students of agricultural and veterinary science.
- His enjoyment of solving puzzles and proficiency in understanding abstract concepts align well with the skills often necessary for computer science, making it a probable field of study.
- Although having strong empathy and a good understanding could help in business administration, the lack of direct indications towards an interest in business practices or economic-related activities suggests a lower probability for this field.
