Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, here is an estimation of how likely he may have been enrolled in each specified field of study:

- **Computer Science**: Adam's interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence, along with his capability to understand abstract concepts, aligns well with the skills beneficial for a computer science program. However, there is no direct indication of his interest in technology or programming. Thus, the likelihood could be moderate.

- **Business Administration**: While Adam possesses empathy and intelligence, the sketch does not explicitly mention interests directly pertaining to business administration, such as finance, management, or entrepreneurship. This field might not align strongly with his described nature-based interests and emotional attributes.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adamâ€™s love for animals and curiosity about nature and plants strongly suggests compatibility with a field like agricultural or veterinary science. His empathy and interest in the natural world make this field a likely choice for his studies.

Based on these considerations, the probability estimates would be as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.5",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}
