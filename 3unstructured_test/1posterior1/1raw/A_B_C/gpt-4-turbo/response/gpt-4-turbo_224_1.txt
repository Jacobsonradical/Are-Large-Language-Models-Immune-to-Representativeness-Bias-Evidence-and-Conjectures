Based on the personality sketch of Adam, including his genuine curiosity about nature and deep love for animals, there is a relatively higher probability that he was enrolled in a field related to agricultural and veterinary science. His enjoyment of solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts also suggest that he might thrive in analytically rigorous fields, such as computer science. However, there is less information in the personality sketch indicating a direct inclination towards business administration, which often involves a strong orientation towards human systems, leadership, and operational management.

Given this analysis, here are the estimated probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
