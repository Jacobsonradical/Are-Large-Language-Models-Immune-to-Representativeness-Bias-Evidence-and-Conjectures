Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, here are the estimated probabilities:

{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Explanation:
- The lower probability for business administration is due to the sketch focusing more on empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature and plants, which align more traditionally with life sciences than business disciplines.
- Computer science has a moderate probability given the mention of high intelligence and puzzle-solving skills, which can translate well into computational and problem-solving activities often required in computer science.
- Agricultural and veterinary science has the highest probability as it closely correlates with his interests in nature, plants, and a deep love for animals, suggesting that his graduate studies might more likely be situated in fields that connect directly to his personal interests and passions.
