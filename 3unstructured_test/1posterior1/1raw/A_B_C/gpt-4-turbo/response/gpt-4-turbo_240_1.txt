Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, here's an estimation of the probability for each field of study:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, his deep love for animals, and his appreciation for hard work and dedication make it likely that he would be interested in a field like agricultural and veterinary science. These interests align closely with the subjects he would encounter in these areas.
  
- **Computer Science**: Although Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is good at understanding abstract concepts—which are relevant skills in computer science—there's no direct indication of his interest in technology or computer-based studies. Nonetheless, these skills do not rule out the possibility.

- **Business Administration**: While Adam's demonstrated empathy, understanding of hard work, and intelligence would serve him well in a business administration program, there's no specific evidence in the personality sketch pointing directly to a business-oriented interest.

Given these considerations, the estimated probabilities are as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
