Based on the personality sketch provided, the likelihoods of Adam enrolling in various fields of graduate study are estimated as follows:

- Business Administration: Typically, disciplines such as business administration focus on management, financial skills, entrepreneurship, and strategic thinking. Adam's described personality, focusing on his curiosity about nature and love for animals, doesn't directly align with the common attributes associated with business administration. However, his high intelligence could enable him to excel in any field, including business. 

- Computer Science: This field requires strong analytical skills, problem-solving capabilities, and an understanding of complex, abstract concepts. Adam's interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence could suggest a potential fit here, particularly if his puzzle interests include elements relating to logic, algorithms, or mathematics, which are foundational to computer science.

- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: These fields align closely with Adam's interests in nature, plants, and animals. A degree focused on agricultural or veterinary science would cater directly to his passions and strengths, such as understanding living organisms and his empathy and love toward animals, which is essential for veterinary studies.

Thus, the probabilities are estimated as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.15",
  "computer science": "0.55",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.85"
}
```
These ratings take into account both Adam's personal interests and aptitudes, with a higher probability ascribed to fields that are more directly aligned with his described personality and lower probabilities to those less obviously connected.
