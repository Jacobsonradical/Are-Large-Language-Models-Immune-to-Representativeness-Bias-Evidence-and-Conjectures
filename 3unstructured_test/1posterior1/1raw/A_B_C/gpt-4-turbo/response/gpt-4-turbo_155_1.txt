Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, who exhibits a deep interest in nature, plants, and animals, along with high intelligence and a knack for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, we can make educated guesses on his likelihood of enrolling in different graduate fields. 

His love for nature and animals strongly aligns with the typical interests of someone who might study agricultural and veterinary sciences. His ability to understand abstract concepts could also make computer science a plausible field, especially given how often computer science involves problem-solving skills. Business administration seems less likely compared to the other two, based on the interests and qualities described.

Here are the estimates:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.5",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

In summary:
- Agricultural and veterinary science (0.7): High probability due to his love for animals and nature.
- Computer science (0.5): Moderate probability, given his problem-solving skills and intelligence.
- Business administration (0.2): Lower probability based on the description focusing less on business-oriented traits or interests.
