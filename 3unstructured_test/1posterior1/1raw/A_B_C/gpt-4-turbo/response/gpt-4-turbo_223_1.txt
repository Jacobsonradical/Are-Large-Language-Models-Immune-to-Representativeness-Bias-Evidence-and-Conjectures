Given Adam's described characteristics and interests, here are the probability estimates:

{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

These assessments are based on Adam's love of nature and animals, which closely aligns with agricultural and veterinary sciences. His high intelligence and affinity for abstract concepts make computer science a plausible choice, though less directly supported by the personal traits listed. Business administration seems less likely given the absence of specific indications towards business or managerial interests.
