Based on the personality sketch of Adam, here is an assessment of the probabilities for the fields of study he might have been enrolled in as a graduate student:

{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

These estimates consider Adam's described interests and characteristics: his passion for nature and animals suggests a higher likelihood for agricultural and veterinary sciences; his problem-solving skills and high intelligence support a reasonable probability for computer science; and a lower estimate for business administration as it seems less aligned with his expressed interests.
