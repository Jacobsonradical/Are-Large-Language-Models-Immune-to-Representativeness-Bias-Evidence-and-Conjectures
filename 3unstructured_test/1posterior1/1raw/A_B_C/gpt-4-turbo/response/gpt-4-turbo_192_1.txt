Based on the personality sketch of Adam, here is my estimation of the probabilities that he was enrolled in each of these fields of study:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field aligns well with Adamâ€™s interest in nature and plants, and his empathy and love for animals. The likelihood seems relatively high.
- **Business Administration**: There are fewer direct references in the personality sketch to skills typically associated with business administration, such as leadership, financial acumen, or a passion for market dynamics. This field seems less likely.
- **Computer Science**: While Adam's enjoyment in solving puzzles and high intelligence suggests a good fit with computer science (especially in areas like algorithms or programming), there is no direct indication of a specific interest in technology or computing.

Based on these considerations, the probability estimates are as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
