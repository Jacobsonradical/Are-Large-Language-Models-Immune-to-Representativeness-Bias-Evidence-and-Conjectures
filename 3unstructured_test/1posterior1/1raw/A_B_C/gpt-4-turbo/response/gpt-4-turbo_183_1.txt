Based on the personality sketch provided of Adam, it seems plausible to estimate the probabilities of his enrollment in different graduate fields as follows:

- His strong empathy, love for animals, and genuine curiosity about nature suggest a good fit with agricultural and veterinary science. This field typically encompasses a deep interest in plants and animal care, aligning closely with Adam's described interests and strength in understanding.
  
- His high intelligence and ability for understanding abstract concepts could indeed fit well with computer science. However, there is no direct indication of specific interest in technology or mathematical problem-solving, which are often significant components of computer science programs.

- There is minimal information suggesting a strong connection to business administration, without any direct references to interests in economics, business, or management.

Given this analysis, my estimated probabilities for Adam's field of study would be:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}
