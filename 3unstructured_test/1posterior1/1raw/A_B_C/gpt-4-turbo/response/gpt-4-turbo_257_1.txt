Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, it is possible to estimate his probable fields of graduate studies by aligning his interests and aptitudes with relevant academic fields. Adam’s curiosity about nature and plants, along with his love for animals, could make agricultural and veterinary sciences a strong fit. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with computer science, which often requires such skills for problem-solving and programming. Business administration, though a popular field, doesn't clearly match the specific interests or skills described.

Here’s the estimated probability for each field:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.35",
  "business administration": "0.20",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.45"
}
```

These values reflect the probability based on the description, considering Adam's interests and noted traits. Agricultural and veterinary science receives the highest probability due to his affinity for nature and animals. Computer science follows due to his problem-solving skills and understanding of abstract concepts. Business administration has a lower probability, as it more weakly aligns with the specific characteristics described.
