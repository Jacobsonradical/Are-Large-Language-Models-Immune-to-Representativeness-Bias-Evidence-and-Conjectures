Based on the description of Adam's interests and characteristics, here's my best estimate of the probability that he was enrolled in each of the specified fields:

- Adam shows a genuine curiosity about nature and plants and a deep love for animals, which aligns closely with subjects covered in agricultural and veterinary science. He also appears to value hard work and dedication, which are essential in these fields.

- His high intelligence and proficiency in understanding abstract concepts could suggest a fit for computer science, especially given the mention of his enjoyment in solving puzzles. Computer science often requires a capacity for abstract thinking and problem-solving.

- While business administration can benefit from a smart and empathic individual, the link is less direct compared to the other fields based on the description provided. Adam's traits and interests do not directly suggest a strong connection to business studies.
