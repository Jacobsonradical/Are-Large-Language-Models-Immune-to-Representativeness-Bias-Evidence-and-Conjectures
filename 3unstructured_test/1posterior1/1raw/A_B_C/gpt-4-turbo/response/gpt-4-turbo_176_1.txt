Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, it seems likely that his interests align most closely with fields related to nature, plants, and animals due to his genuine curiosity and love for these areas. This would suggest a lower probability of him studying business administration or computer science, which typically do not directly involve these interests. Agricultural and veterinary science, on the other hand, directly correlates with his interests in nature and animals.

Here is the estimated probability distribution based on the provided sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

These probabilities are speculative based on the personality and interest alignment discussed, with Adam most likely studying in a field that allows him to engage with his passions for nature and animals.
