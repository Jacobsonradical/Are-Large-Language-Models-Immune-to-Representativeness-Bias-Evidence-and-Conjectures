Based on the description of Adam's personality and interests, here is an estimated probability for each of the specified fields of graduate study:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's deep love for animals and curiosity about nature suggests a strong alignment with this field. Studies in agricultural and veterinary science would nourish his love for nature and animals. Hence, the probability could be relatively high.
- **Business Administration**: Given Adam's described interests and characteristics, there is less direct alignment with business administration, which typically focuses on management, finance, marketing, and operations. Unless Adam has underlying interests in the management side of natural resources, veterinary practices, or agricultural businesses, this might not be a primary field of interest.
- **Computer Science**: His enjoyment of solving puzzles and a high intelligence indicate that Adam could excel in computer science, particularly in areas that require problem-solving and understanding complex, abstract concepts. However, it isn't specifically mentioned that his interests lean towards technology or programming, so while possible, it's not as directly correlated as agricultural and veterinary science.

Here's the estimation of probability in the required format:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.5"
}

These probabilities reflect a relative likelihood based on the personality sketch provided, considering there are also other potential fields he might be enrolled in that were not listed.
