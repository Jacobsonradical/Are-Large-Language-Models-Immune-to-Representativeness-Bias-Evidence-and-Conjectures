Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, which highlights his curiosity about nature and love for animals, as well as his high intelligence and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts, we can infer probabilities for his enrollment in specific graduate fields:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - While Adam has high intelligence and aptitude for abstract thinking, which are beneficial for computer science, the description does not directly align with typical interests in computer science, such as programming or technology.
   - Probability: **0.15**

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Adam's love for animals and interest in nature suggest a strong alignment with agricultural or veterinary sciences. This field requires empathy and a passion for caring for animals and plants, which matches Adam's described interests and temperament.
   - Probability: **0.65**

3. **Business Administration**:
   - Although being good at understanding abstract concepts could be useful in business administration, there is no explicit indication of an interest in business or management skills. However, his pursuit of graduate studies implies some strategic thinking which could intersect slightly with business studies.
   - Probability: **0.1**
