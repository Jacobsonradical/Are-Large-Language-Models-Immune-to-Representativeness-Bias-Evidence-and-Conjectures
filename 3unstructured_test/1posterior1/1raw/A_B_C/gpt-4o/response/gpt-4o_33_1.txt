Given the provided personality sketch and characteristics of Adam, here is the estimated probability for each field:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

### Rationale:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.6)**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align well with this field. Therefore, the probability is higher.
- **Computer Science (0.2)**: His high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles can be indicative of someone who could excel in computer science, but his strong interests in nature and animals make this less likely than agricultural and veterinary science.
- **Business Administration (0.1)**: While Adam's high intelligence and appreciation for hard work might fit someone in business, his specific interests in nature, animals, and quiet personality create a lower probability for this field compared to the other two.
