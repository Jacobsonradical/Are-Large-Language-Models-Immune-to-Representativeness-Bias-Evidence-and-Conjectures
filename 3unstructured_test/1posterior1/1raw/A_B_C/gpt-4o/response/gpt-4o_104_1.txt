Explanation: Given Adam's personality sketch, he exhibits a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, which makes it highly likely that he might be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Considering his high intelligence and aptitude for solving puzzles, it's also plausible that he could be in computer science, potentially using his skills for research or applications related to nature and animals. His empathetic and warm-hearted nature does not strongly align with the typical traits associated with business administration, making it less likely he'll be in that field.
