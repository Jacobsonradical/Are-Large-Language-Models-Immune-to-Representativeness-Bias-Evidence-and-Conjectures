Explanation: Based on the personality sketch, Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest a strong alignment with fields like agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could also make him suitable for a field like computer science. However, given his empathy and somewhat introverted nature ("quiet boy"), he might be less inclined towards business administration, which typically involves a higher level of social interaction and leadership roles. Therefore, I estimate the highest probability for agricultural and veterinary science, followed by computer science, and then business administration.
