Based on the personality sketch of Adam, we can make some estimates on the probability of him being enrolled in various graduate fields. We know he has a strong curiosity about nature and plants, a warm heart for animals, and a high intelligence with an affinity for abstract concepts. These characteristics seem to align more closely with certain fields of study over others. Here's my best estimate:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.2
}

These probabilities reflect the fact that his interests and personality traits are a strong match for agricultural and veterinary science, somewhat align with computer science due to his puzzle-solving abilities and intelligence, and are less likely to align with business administration based on the provided information.
