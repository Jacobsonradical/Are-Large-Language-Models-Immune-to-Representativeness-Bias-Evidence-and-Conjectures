Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, and his empathy and love for animals, it seems he would be highly suited for a field like agricultural and veterinary science. Meanwhile, his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could also lead him towards computer science, though the natural world seems to be his primary interest. His personality traits and inclinations make business administration a less likely fit.
