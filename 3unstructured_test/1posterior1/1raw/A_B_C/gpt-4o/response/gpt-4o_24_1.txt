Based on the personality sketch of Adam, the following probabilities for his enrollment in the mentioned fields are estimated:

{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.70,
  "computer science": 0.25
}

These estimates are based on Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation of hard work, which align most closely with agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also suggest a fit with computer science, albeit to a lesser extent. Business administration seems less likely given the personality traits described.
