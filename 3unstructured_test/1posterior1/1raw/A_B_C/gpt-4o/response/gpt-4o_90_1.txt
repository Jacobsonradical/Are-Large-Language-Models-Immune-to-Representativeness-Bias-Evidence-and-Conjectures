Based on the personality sketch provided, here is the estimated probability that Adam was enrolled in the respective fields:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.45,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and veterinary science**: Adam shows a genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, which aligns well with this field. His empathy and warm heart suggest he might be drawn to a career that involves caring for animals and working with the natural environment. Therefore, this field seems quite likely.

- **Computer science**: Although this field requires high intelligence and an ability to solve puzzles and understand abstract concepts—qualities Adam possesses—there's no specific indication in the personality sketch that he has an interest in technology or computers. However, his puzzle-solving ability and intelligence do fit the profile for this field, making it somewhat probable.

- **Business administration**: This field generally requires strong interpersonal and leadership skills, which are not explicitly highlighted in Adam's personality sketch. Adam's interests and strengths seem to lean more towards nature, empathy, and abstract problem-solving, making this the least likely field among the three listed.
