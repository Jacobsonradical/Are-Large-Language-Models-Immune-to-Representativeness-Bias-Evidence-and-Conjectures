Reasoning: Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication strongly align with agricultural and veterinary science, making it the most probable field. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also make computer science a plausible field, though less likely given his inclination towards animals and nature. Business administration seems the least likely given the provided personality traits.
