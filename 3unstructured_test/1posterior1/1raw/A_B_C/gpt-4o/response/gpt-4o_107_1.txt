Based on the personality sketch and background information provided for Adam, let's estimate the probabilities of him being enrolled in each of the specified fields:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

### Reasoning:
- **Agricultural and veterinary science**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align well with this field. His background suggests a strong affinity for subjects related to plants and animals, making this a probable choice.
  
- **Business administration**: Although Adam is described as intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, his interests in nature, empathy, and animals don't strongly align with business administration. This seems to be the least likely option based on the provided description.

- **Computer science**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is of high intelligence, which aligns with the skills needed in computer science. However, his primary interests seem more directed towards natural sciences and animal care, making this less probable than agricultural and veterinary science, but still plausible.
