Based on Adam's personality sketch and interests, we can make an educated guess about the probabilities that he was enrolled in various fields of study.

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.35
}

This estimate takes into account Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, his love for animals, and his intelligence and appreciation for hard work, which align strongly with agricultural and veterinary sciences. While his intelligence and puzzle-solving skills could also align with computer science, his clear affinity for nature and animals suggests a higher probability for the former. Business administration seems less likely given his described interests and personality traits.
