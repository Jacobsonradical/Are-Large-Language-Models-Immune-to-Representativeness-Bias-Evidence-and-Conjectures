Based on Adam's personality sketch, including his love for nature, animals, solving puzzles, high intelligence, empathy, and appreciation for hard work, here are the estimated probabilities for him being enrolled in the specified fields:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,  // Given his deep love for animals and a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, this field seems highly probable.
  "computer science": 0.3,  // His enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence make this field plausible, though it's less directly aligned with his love for nature and animals.
  "business administration": 0.1  // Although he appreciates hard work and dedication, his personality sketch doesn't strongly indicate an interest in business administration, making this the least likely field.
