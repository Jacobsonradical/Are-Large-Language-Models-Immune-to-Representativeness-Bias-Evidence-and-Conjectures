Based on the provided personality sketch of Adam, here are the estimated probabilities for his enrollment in each field:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}

Given his strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, it seems more likely that Adam would be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts lend some probability to computer science, but the lack of business-related characteristics in his description makes business administration the least likely of the three fields.
