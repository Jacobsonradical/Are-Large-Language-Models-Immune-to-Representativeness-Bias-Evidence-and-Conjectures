Based on the provided personality sketch of Adam, we can make some educated estimates regarding the probability of his enrollment in the given fields of study:

1. Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, along with his deep love for animals, aligns well with the field of agricultural and veterinary science.
2. His high intelligence and aptitude for solving puzzles suggest he might also be interested in fields that require strong analytical and problem-solving skills, such as computer science.
3. Although business administration does require intelligence and dedication, there is no explicit trait or interest mentioned that aligns strongly with business administration compared to the other fields.

Therefore, I would estimate the probabilities as follows:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

These values reflect the more pronounced alignment of Adam's traits and interests with the fields of agricultural and veterinary science and computer science relative to business administration.
