Given Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, agricultural and veterinary science appears to be the most fitting field of study. His high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could also make him a candidate for computer science, though it seems less aligned with his personal interests. Business administration appears to be the least likely, as it typically does not align as closely with his described characteristics and interests.
