Given Adam's personality sketch, we can make inferences regarding his likely field of study based on his interests, traits, and strengths. Here's an estimate of the probabilities of his enrollment in the given fields:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}

Explanation:
- **Business Administration (0.1):** While Adam is intelligent and appreciative of hard work, his described interests and traits (e.g., curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals) do not strongly align with typical motivations for pursuing a degree in business administration.
  
- **Computer Science (0.3):** His skills in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts could translate well into computer science. However, there is no direct mention of a specific interest in technology or computing in the personality sketch.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.6):** This field aligns strongly with Adam's curiosity about nature, love for plants and animals, and empathy. These traits are very relevant to agricultural and veterinary science, making it a likely choice.
