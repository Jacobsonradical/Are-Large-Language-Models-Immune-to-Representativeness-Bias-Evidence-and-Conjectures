Given the provided personality sketch of Adam, I’ll provide estimates based on the alignment of his interests and traits with each field:

{
  "business administration": 0.10,
  "computer science": 0.20,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.70
}

### Rationale:
1. **Business Administration (0.10)**:
   - While business administration can involve problem-solving, it is less directly associated with Adam's strong connection to nature, plants, animals, and empathy. This field seems less likely given his described passions.

2. **Computer Science (0.20)**:
   - Adam’s enjoyment of solving puzzles and his high intelligence with abstract concepts might align with computer science. However, his interests lean more towards nature and animals, which makes this field a less probable fit compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.70)**:
   - Adam’s genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, appreciation for hard work and dedication, and strong empathy align closely with agricultural and veterinary science. This field seems the most consistent with the provided personality sketch, making it the most probable field of his enrollment.
