Explanation: Given Adam's personality traits such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work, it is highly likely he would be drawn to a field like agricultural and veterinary science, hence the higher probability. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could also make computer science a good fit, giving it a moderate probability. Business administration seems less aligned with his interests and personality traits, so it receives the lowest probability.
