Based on the provided personality sketch and considering Adam's interests and traits, here is an estimate of the probability for each field:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.2
}

Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, and genuine curiosity about nature heavily suggest a higher likelihood of him being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts give some weight to the possibility of him studying computer science. However, business administration seems less likely given the traits and interests described.
