Given the personality sketch of Adam, here's my estimate:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and veterinary science** seems highly likely due to Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for dedication and hard work, all of which align closely with this field.
- **Business administration** seems unlikely given that Adam appears to have an affinity for more natural and scientific pursuits rather than business.
- **Computer science** is a possibility because of his high intelligence, interest in solving puzzles, and ability to understand abstract concepts, but it is not as strong a fit as agricultural and veterinary science based on his love for nature and animals.
