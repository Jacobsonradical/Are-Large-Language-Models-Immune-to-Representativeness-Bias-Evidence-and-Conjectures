Based on Adam's personality sketch and interests, here is the estimated probability of his enrollment in each field:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest a high likelihood of him pursuing agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts make computer science a plausible option, though less likely due to his stronger interests in nature and animals. Business administration is the least likely, given no particular indication of interest or relevant traits in the personality sketch.
