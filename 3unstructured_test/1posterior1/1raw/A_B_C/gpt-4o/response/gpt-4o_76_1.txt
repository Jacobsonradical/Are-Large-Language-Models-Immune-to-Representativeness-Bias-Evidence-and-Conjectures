Given the personality sketch of Adam and his interests, here is the estimated probability for each of the fields:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

These probabilities reflect Adam's expressed curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, which are highly compatible with agricultural and veterinary science. His problem-solving skills and understanding of abstract concepts also make computer science a possible field, though less likely given the stated interests. Business administration appears to be the least likely option based on the provided information.
