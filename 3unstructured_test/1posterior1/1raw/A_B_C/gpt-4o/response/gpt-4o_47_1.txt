Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, here are my estimates of the probabilities that he was enrolled in the following fields:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

These estimates take into account Adam's interests and personality traits:

- "business administration" has a lower probability because his strong empathy, love for nature and animals, and interest in abstract concepts seem less aligned with this field.
- "computer science" has a moderate probability since Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is highly intelligent, which are traits that can fit well in this field. However, it doesn't align as closely with his love for nature and animals.
- "agricultural and veterinary science" has the highest probability because it directly relates to his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication in fields connected to nature and living beings.
