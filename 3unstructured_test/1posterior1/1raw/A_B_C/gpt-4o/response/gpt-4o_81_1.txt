Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have a preference for nature, animals, and intellectual pursuits like solving puzzles. Hereâ€™s my estimation for the probability of Adam being enrolled in each field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,  // Given his genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and animals
  "computer science": 0.3,  // Due to his high intelligence and knack for abstract concepts and puzzles
  "business administration": 0.1  // His love for animals and nature suggests less inclination towards business administration
