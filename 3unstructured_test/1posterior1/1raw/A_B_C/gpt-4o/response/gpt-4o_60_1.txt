Based on the personality sketch provided, the estimates for Adam's enrollment in the following fields can be given as:

{
  "computer science": 0.15,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.50,
  "business administration": 0.10
}

Rationale:
- **Computer Science**: While Adam has high intelligence and an aptitude for abstract concepts and solving puzzles, which are important traits for computer science, his strong empathy, curiosity about nature, and love for animals suggest he might be more inclined toward fields that involve living beings rather than purely technical subjects.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, a deep love for animals, and strong empathy. These traits align closely with the characteristics needed for agricultural and veterinary sciences, making it the most probable field for him.
- **Business Administration**: Adam has an appreciation for hard work and dedication, traits that would be beneficial in business administration. However, other aspects of his personality such as his love for nature and animals, and his quiet demeanor, might not align as strongly with the typical activities and challenges of the business field. Therefore, the probability is lower compared to the other fields.

These probabilities reflect the likelihood based on his personality and interests as described.
