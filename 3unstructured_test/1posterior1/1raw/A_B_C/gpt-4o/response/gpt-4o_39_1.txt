Based on Adam's personality sketch and interests, we can estimate the likelihood of his enrollment in various fields of graduate studies. Given his love for nature, animals, and his empathy, agricultural and veterinary science stands out prominently. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts may incline him towards computer science. Business administration appears less likely given the information provided about his personality and interests.

Here are the probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4
