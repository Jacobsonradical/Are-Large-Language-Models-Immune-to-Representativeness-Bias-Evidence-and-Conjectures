Given Adam's strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, it seems most probable that his field of study aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet nature and enjoyment of puzzles could suggest an inclination towards computer science, hence it gets a moderate probability. Business administration appears less likely due to the lack of any explicit interest in business-related activities or skills in the sketch.
