Based on Adam's personality sketch, the probability estimates for his enrollment in the mentioned fields are as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

### Rationale:

**Business Administration**: Adam's traits do not strongly align with the typical interests and skills associated with this field. As he has a genuine curiosity about nature and strong empathy, business administration seems less likely. Thus, the probability is relatively low.

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, this field seems highly relevant to his interests and personality traits. This alignment suggests a higher probability for this field.

**Computer Science**: While Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which could fit computer science, his primary interests in nature and animals make this field less probable but still plausible due to his affinity for abstract concepts. Therefore, the probability is moderate.
