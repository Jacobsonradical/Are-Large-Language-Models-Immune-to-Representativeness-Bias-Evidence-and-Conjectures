Based on the provided personality sketch of Adam, the following estimates represent the likelihood of his enrollment in the given fields:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

These estimates are derived from Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, which aligns closely with agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and capacity for understanding abstract concepts could suggest an affinity for computer science, though his warm, empathetic nature might not align as directly with the more business-oriented field of business administration.
