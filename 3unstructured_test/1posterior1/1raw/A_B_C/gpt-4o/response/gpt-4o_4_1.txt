The reasoning is as follows:
- Adam's strong curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication align well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science, making it the most probable field of study.
- His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts can be an asset in computer science, but his interests seem less aligned with this field compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
- Business administration seems less likely based on Adam's personality traits and interests, particularly his empathy and love for animals over a business-oriented outlook.
