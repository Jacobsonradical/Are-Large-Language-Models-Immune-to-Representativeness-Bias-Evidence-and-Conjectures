Given Adam's personality sketch, we can assess his likelihood of being enrolled in each field based on his interests and characteristics. Hereâ€™s my estimate:

- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, which is highly relevant to agricultural and veterinary science.
- His love for animals aligns closely with veterinary science.
- Although he is highly intelligent and good at abstract concepts, there is no direct mention of an interest in technology or business, which makes business administration and computer science less likely.

Considering these aspects, here are the probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
