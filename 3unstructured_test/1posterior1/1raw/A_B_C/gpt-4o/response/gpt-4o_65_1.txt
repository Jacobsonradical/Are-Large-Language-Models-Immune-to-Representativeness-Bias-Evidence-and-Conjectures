Explanation:
- **Business Administration**: Adam's personality sketch does not strongly indicate an interest in business or managerial roles. His love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles, coupled with high empathy, suggests he is more inclined towards fields that harmonize with his personal interests rather than business.
  
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals, this field aligns most closely with his interests and character traits. This makes it highly probable that he is enrolled in this area.
  
- **Computer Science**: Adam's intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest that computer science is a plausible field for him. However, given his strong empathy and love for nature, this field is slightly less probable than agricultural and veterinary science.
