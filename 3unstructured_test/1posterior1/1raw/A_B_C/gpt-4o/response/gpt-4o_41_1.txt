Explanation:
Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, appreciation for plants, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest a natural inclination towards agricultural and veterinary science. This field aligns very well with his interests and personality traits.

Business administration seems less likely, given that the personality sketch does not mention any interest in business, commerce, or management. Hence, the probability for this field is fairly low.

Computer science is still a considerable option due to Adam's high intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and ability to understand abstract concepts. However, it seems somewhat less likely than agricultural and veterinary science based on the information provided.
