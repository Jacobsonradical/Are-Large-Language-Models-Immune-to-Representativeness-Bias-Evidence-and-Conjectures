Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam being enrolled in the specified fields:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.2
}

These probabilities reflect Adam's strong curiosity about nature, plants, animals, and his appreciation for hard work, which aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science. Although he is good at solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, which are relevant to computer science, these traits seem secondary to his primary interests. Business administration seems less likely given the personality sketch that highlights traits more in line with scientific curiosity and empathy.
