Explanation: Based on Adam's personality sketch, his high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts make computer science a plausible field, though his interest in solving puzzles suggests this might not be the most likely. His lack of indicated interest in business concepts and focus on nature, empathy, and animals makes business administration less probable. His genuine curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, and strong appreciation for hard work and dedication make agricultural and veterinary science the most likely field of study.
