Based on the personality sketch of Adam, here's the estimated probability of him being enrolled in each of the specified fields:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.2
}

**Explanation:**

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7)**: Given his genuine curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, this field appears to be the best fit for Adam. His personality traits align well with the characteristics typically needed in this field.
  
- **Business Administration (0.1)**: Although Adam is intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, there is no specific indication in the personality sketch that he has an interest in business-related activities. His quiet nature and empathy are less commonly associated with business administration, making it a less likely field for him.
  
- **Computer Science (0.2)**: While Adam enjoys solving puzzles—a skill that could be useful in computer science—his main interests seem more aligned with nature and animals. Thus, while there is some probability that he might be interested in computer science due to his intelligence and problem-solving abilities, it is lower compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
