Based on the personality sketch and the details provided about Adam, we can make educated estimates about the likelihood of him being enrolled in specific fields of graduate study in 2021. Here are the estimates:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

Explanation:
- **Business administration**: Given Adam's described personality traits—empathy, love for nature and animals, and preference for solving puzzles—he seems less likely to be inclined towards the field of business administration, which often demands different sets of interests such as finance, management, and corporate strategy.
  
- **Agricultural and veterinary science**: Adam’s interest in nature, plants, and animals strongly aligns with this field. His empathy and love for animals also enhance the likelihood of him choosing a field that allows him to work closely with living beings and natural environments.

- **Computer science**: While Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and his high intelligence with understanding abstract concepts are relevant to computer science, his deep love for animals and nature suggests that fields directly involving these interests might be more appealing to him. Therefore, the probability of him choosing computer science is moderate but not as high as agricultural and veterinary science.
