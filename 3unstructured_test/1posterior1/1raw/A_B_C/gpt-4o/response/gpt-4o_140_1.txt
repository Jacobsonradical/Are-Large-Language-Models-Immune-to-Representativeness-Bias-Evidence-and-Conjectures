Based on Adam's personality sketch and interests, here's an estimate of the probabilities that he was enrolled in each of the specified fields in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.65,
  "computer science": 0.20,
  "business administration": 0.10
}

These estimates take into account Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, and love for animals, making agricultural and veterinary science a more likely field for him. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts might make computer science a possibility. However, business administration seems less likely given the lack of specific traits or interests pointing towards that field.
