Based on the given personality sketch of Adam — his curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, high intelligence, and enjoyment of solving puzzles — I can estimate the probabilities as follows:

{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.25
}

Explanation:
- "business administration" has a low probability since the provided personality traits don't strongly align with a natural inclination toward business or administrative work.
- "agricultural and veterinary science" has a high probability because Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication align strongly with this field.
- "computer science" has a moderate probability due to Adam's high intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts, which are relevant to this field, but his stronger inclination toward nature and animals makes this less likely than agricultural and veterinary science.
