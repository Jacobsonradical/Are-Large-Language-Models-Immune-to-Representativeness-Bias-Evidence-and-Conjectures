Given the personality sketch, Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work suggest a strong alignment with agricultural and veterinary sciences. His empathy and warm heart also fit well within this field where caring for animals and working with nature are central. 

His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he could also be a fit for computer science, though his interests seem more aligned with the natural world than technology. Business administration appears to be the least likely of the three given his described personality traits and interests.
