Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, here is the probability estimate for the fields in question:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}

While estimating these probabilities:

- Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts lend some possibility to the field of computer science.
- Business administration seems less likely given his empathy, warm heart, and love for animals, which often correlate less with business studies.
- Agricultural and veterinary science aligns well with his deep love for animals, genuine curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work and dedication.
