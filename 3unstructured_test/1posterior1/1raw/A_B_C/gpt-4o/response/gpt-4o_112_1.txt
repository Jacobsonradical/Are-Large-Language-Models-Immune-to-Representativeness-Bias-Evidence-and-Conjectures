Given Adam's strong empathy, deep love for animals, and genuine curiosity about nature and plants, it seems most likely that he would be enrolled in a field related to agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he could be in computer science, but it seems less aligned with his personal interests as described. Business administration seems even less likely based on the details provided.
