Based on Adam's personality sketch and interests, here's an estimate of the probabilities that he was enrolled in each of the given fields as a graduate student in 2021:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

- **Business Administration (0.1)**: Adam's strong empathy, love for nature, and animals suggest that he is more inclined towards fields that involve direct interaction with natural elements or abstract problem-solving rather than business-related disciplines.
  
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.5)**: Given Adam's deep love for animals and genuine curiosity about nature and plants, this field seems to be the most aligned with his interests and personality traits.

- **Computer Science (0.3)**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence in understanding abstract concepts, making computer science a reasonable possibility, though it seems less tied to his passion for animals and nature compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
