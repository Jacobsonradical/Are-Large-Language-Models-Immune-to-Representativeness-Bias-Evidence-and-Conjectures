Based on the personality sketch and interests of Adam, the probabilities for his enrollment in the given fields might be estimated as follows:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}

Here's the rationale for these estimates:

- **Business Administration (0.1)**: Adam's interests and personality traits do not strongly align with business administration. His curiosity about nature, love for animals, and interest in solving puzzles are not characteristics typically associated with a high probability of pursuing a business-related field.
  
- **Computer Science (0.2)**: While Adam's intelligence and interest in solving puzzles could align with computer science, his strong inclination towards nature, plants, and animals suggests that he is less likely to be focused on a field that is more abstract and technology-centered.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.6)**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, and deep love for animals suggest a high likelihood of him being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This field would align well with his personality and interests.

Of course, these are just estimates based on the provided information, and individual choices can vary widely.
