Based on the provided personality sketch of Adam, it is likely that his field of study closely aligns with his interests and characteristics. Here is a reasoned estimate for each field:

1. **Computer Science**: Although Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is of high intelligence, the description does not indicate a specific interest in technology, algorithms, or computing. While it's possible he could be involved in computer science, it seems less aligned with his described passions.
   
   Estimate: 0.2

2. **Business Administration**: The personality sketch does not mention any particular interest or skill set that would directly suggest a focus on business administration. There is a lack of emphasis on leadership, market strategies, or financial acumen, which are typically strong indicators of interest in this field.
   
   Estimate: 0.1

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, various plants, and a deep love for animals, which strongly aligns with agricultural and veterinary sciences. His empathy and warm heart also suggest an inclination towards caring for living beings, making this a highly probable field of study for him.
