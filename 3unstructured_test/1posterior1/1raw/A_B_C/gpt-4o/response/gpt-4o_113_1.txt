The high probability for agricultural and veterinary science is due to Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work, all of which align well with this field. 

The lower probability for business administration reflects that this field does not align as well with Adam's described interests and qualities.

The moderate probability for computer science accounts for Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, which are valuable traits in the field of computer science, even if his primary interests seem more aligned with nature.
