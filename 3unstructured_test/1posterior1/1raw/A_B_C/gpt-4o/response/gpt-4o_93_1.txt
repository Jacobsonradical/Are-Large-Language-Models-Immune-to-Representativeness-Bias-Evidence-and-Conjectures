Explanation:
- **Computer science (0.25)**: Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he might be drawn to fields like computer science. However, the personality sketch emphasizes his interest in nature, empathy, and love for animals more, making this less likely than agricultural and veterinary science.
  
- **Agricultural and veterinary science (0.60)**: Given Adam’s genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, it is most likely that he would choose a field closely related to his interests and passions.

- **Business administration (0.15)**: While Adam’s intelligence might serve him well in business administration, his personality traits as described are more aligned with scientific exploration and empathy-driven fields rather than business, making this the least likely among the three provided options.
