Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, here is an estimate of the probability that he was enrolled in each of the specified fields:

{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.25
}

These probabilities are inferred from the following observations:

- Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication make "agricultural and veterinary science" the most likely field.
- His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts open the possibility of "computer science," although this field is less tied to his strong empathy and love for animals.
- "Business administration" seems the least likely given that his interests align more with scientific and nature-oriented fields rather than business-related studies.
