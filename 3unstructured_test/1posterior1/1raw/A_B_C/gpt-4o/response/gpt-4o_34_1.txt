Based on Adam's interests and personality traits described in the sketch, we can make reasonable estimates for his likelihood of being enrolled in the specified fields:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.2
}

These estimates reflect his strong connection to nature, animals, and his high intelligence, which align well with agricultural and veterinary science. Business administration seems less likely given his personality, while computer science could be a possibility due to his high intelligence and love for solving puzzles.
