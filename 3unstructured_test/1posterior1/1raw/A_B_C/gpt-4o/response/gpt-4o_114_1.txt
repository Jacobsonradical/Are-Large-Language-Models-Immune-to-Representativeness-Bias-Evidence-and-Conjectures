Explanation:
Adam's personality sketch indicates a strong affinity for nature, plants, animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication, which aligns closely with fields related to agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and enjoyment in solving puzzles might make computer science a plausible option, but his pronounced interests in nature and animals tilt the probability more towards agricultural and veterinary science. Business administration seems the least likely, given that the sketch does not highlight interests typically associated with that field.
