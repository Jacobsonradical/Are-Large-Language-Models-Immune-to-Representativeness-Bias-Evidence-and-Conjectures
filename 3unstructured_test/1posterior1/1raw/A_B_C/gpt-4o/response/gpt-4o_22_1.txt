Based on the personality sketch of Adam and considering his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication, it seems more likely that he would be enrolled in a field related to agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts might suggest computer science as a possible field, but the details given do not strongly indicate a fit for business administration.

Here is my estimated probability for each field:
