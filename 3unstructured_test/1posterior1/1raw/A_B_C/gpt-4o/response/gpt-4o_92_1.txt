Based on Adam's personality sketch and interests, here are the estimated probabilities for each field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

- Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and love for animals strongly suggest a higher probability of being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- His high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could fit well with computer science, although his specific interests lean more towards nature, reducing the probability.
- Business administration is the least likely given his personality traits, which do not particularly align with the typical interests and skills associated with that field.
