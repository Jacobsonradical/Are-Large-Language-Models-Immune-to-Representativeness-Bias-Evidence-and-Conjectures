Based on the personality sketch of Adam provided, the probabilities of his enrollment in the listed fields of study are estimated as follows:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}

These estimates take into account his strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts. His empathy and appreciation for hard work align well with agricultural and veterinary science. However, his problem-solving skills and high intelligence also suggest potential compatibility with computer science. Business administration seems less likely based on these traits.
