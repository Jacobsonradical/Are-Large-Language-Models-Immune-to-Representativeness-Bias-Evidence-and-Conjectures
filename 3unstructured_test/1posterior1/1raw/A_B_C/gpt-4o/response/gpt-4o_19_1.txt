Based on Adam's personality sketch and interests:

{
  "computer science": 0.1,
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}

Given Adamâ€™s strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, agricultural and veterinary science seems most aligned with his profile, thereby receiving the highest probability. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts give a moderate but lower probability to computer science. Business administration appears least likely due to the lack of any related interests mentioned in the sketch.
