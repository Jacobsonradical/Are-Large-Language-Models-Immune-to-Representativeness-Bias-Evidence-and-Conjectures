Based on Adam's personality sketch, it is possible to make educated guesses about his likelihood of being enrolled in different fields. Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work suggest a strong alignment with agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and abstract thinking ability could align well with computer science, although the specific mention of curiosity about nature and plants leans the inference more towards a biological science. Business administration appears to be the least likely field given his described interests and personality traits. Here is my estimate:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
