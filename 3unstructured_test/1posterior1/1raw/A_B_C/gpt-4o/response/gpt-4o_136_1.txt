Based on the personality sketch of Adam and his interests, here's an estimate of the probability that he was enrolled in each of the specified fields:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

Adam's love for nature, plants, animals, and his empathy and appreciation for hard work suggest a stronger alignment with agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts indicate some probability of being in computer science, particularly if he finds abstract puzzles intellectually stimulating. However, there seems to be less in his personality sketch that would suggest a focus on business administration.
