Based on the personality sketch provided, let's estimate the probabilities for Adam being enrolled in the given fields:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

Explanation:
- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, a love for animals, and a warm heart with strong empathy. These traits strongly align with agricultural and veterinary science, which involves working with nature, plants, and animals.
- Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has a high intelligence with a good understanding of abstract concepts, which are traits that can be useful in computer science. Therefore, there is a moderate likelihood that he might have been interested in this field.
- Business administration does not clearly align with the interests described in his personality sketch. Hence, the probability is lower for this field.
