Based on the provided personality sketch and interests of Adam, we can make some educated guesses. He has a genuine curiosity about nature, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication. These traits align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could also align him with computer science, though less so than agricultural and veterinary science given his interests.

Given these observations, the probability estimates are as follows:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
