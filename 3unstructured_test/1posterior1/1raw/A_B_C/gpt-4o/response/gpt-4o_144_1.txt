Given Adam's personality sketch, here are the estimated probabilities for his enrollment in the specified fields:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

**Explanation:**
- Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work aligns closely with **agricultural and veterinary science**, making it more probable that he is in this field.
- His high intelligence and problem-solving skills could be suited for **computer science**, but his primary interests seem more aligned with nature and animals.
- Given his personality traits, **business administration** appears less likely, although not impossible, since it does not directly connect with his stated interests in nature, animals, and empathy.
