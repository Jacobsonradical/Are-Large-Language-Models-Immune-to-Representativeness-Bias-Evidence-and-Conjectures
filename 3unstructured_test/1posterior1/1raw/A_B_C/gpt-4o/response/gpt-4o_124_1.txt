Based on Adam's personality sketch and interests, I would estimate the following probabilities for his enrollment in the specified fields:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

These estimates take into account his curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and high intelligence with a capability for abstract thinking. Agricultural and veterinary science seems most aligned with his interests and empathy for animals. Computer science is a possibility given his intelligence and interest in solving puzzles, while business administration appears least likely based on the provided information.
