Explanation: Given Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, appreciation for nature and plants, agricultural and veterinary science seems like the most fitting field, thus it has the highest probability. His interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence could also point towards computer science, but to a lesser degree compared to agricultural and veterinary science. Business administration appears to be the least likely, as the described personality traits do not strongly align with typical traits emphasized in business-related fields.
