Based on the personality sketch provided, here is an estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the specified fields:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

Explanation:
- Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, various plants, and his deep love for animals make agricultural and veterinary science the most likely fit for his interests and personality.
- His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit well with computer science, although there is no explicit mention of an interest in technology or programming.
- Business administration seems the least likely given his described personality traits and interests, which are more aligned with natural sciences and empathy-driven fields rather than business.
