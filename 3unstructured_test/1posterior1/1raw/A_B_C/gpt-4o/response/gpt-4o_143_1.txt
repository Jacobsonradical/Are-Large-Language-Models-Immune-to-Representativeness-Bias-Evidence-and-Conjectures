### Rationale:
Given Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, and genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, it is highly likely that he would be inclined towards a field that allows him to explore these interests, making "agricultural and veterinary science" a strong contender.

Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is of high intelligence with a good grasp of abstract concepts. This could suggest an aptitude for "computer science," but given the personality traits emphasizing empathy and love for animals, it's not as strong a fit as the former.

Appearing to have a warm heart and appreciation for hard work doesn't specifically align with "business administration." Therefore, it seems less likely compared to the other two fields.
