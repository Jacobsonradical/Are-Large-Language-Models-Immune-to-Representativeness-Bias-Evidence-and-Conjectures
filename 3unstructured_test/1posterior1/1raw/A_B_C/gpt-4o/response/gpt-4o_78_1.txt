Based on the personality sketch of Adam, here is my estimate of the probabilities that he was enrolled in the following fields:

{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.60,
  "computer science": 0.15
}

These estimates are based on the following reasoning:
- **Business Administration (0.05)**: While Adam is described as having strong intelligence and understanding abstract concepts, there is no direct indication that he has a particular interest in business or management. His curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathetic nature do not strongly align with the typical interests that lead someone into business administration.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.60)**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals strongly suggests that he might be drawn to a field where he could engage with these interests professionally. Fields like agriculture and veterinary science would allow him to explore his love for nature and animals more directly.
- **Computer Science (0.15)**: While Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is good at understanding abstract concepts, which are skills that align well with computer science, his personality sketch does not emphasize a particular interest in technology or computer science specifically. Hence, the probability is moderate but not as high as for agricultural and veterinary science.
