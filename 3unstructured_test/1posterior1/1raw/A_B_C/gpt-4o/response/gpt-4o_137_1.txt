Based on Adam's personality sketch and interests, here are the estimated probabilities for each field of study:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.2
}

- Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and deep love for animals strongly align with the field of agricultural and veterinary science.
- His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit into computer science, but his primary interests suggest this is less likely.
- Business administration seems least likely given his personality and interests.
