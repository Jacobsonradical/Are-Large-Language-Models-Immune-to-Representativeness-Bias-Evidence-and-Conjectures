Based on the provided personality sketch of Adam, here are the estimated probabilities of him being enrolled in the specified graduate fields:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

### Rationale:

- **Computer Science (0.2):** Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts are compatible with computer science, but there is no explicit mention of interest in technology or computer-related fields.
  
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.6):** Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, this seems the most fitting field for him.

- **Business Administration (0.1):** This field does not align well with the details provided about Adam's personality and interests.
