Based on the personality sketch of Adam, here are the estimated probabilities for each field of study:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

These probabilities reflect Adam's interests in nature, plants, animals, and his strong empathy, which align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and problem-solving skills make computer science plausible, while business administration seems less aligned with his stated interests and personality traits.
