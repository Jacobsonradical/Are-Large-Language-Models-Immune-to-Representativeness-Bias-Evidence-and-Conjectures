Considering Adam's personality sketch, it's evident he has a strong affinity towards nature, plants, and animals, making it highly probable that he would pursue a field aligned with those interests. Therefore, agricultural and veterinary science appears to be the most likely. His high intelligence and affinity for solving puzzles suggest a propensity towards computer science as well, although it is less aligned with his love for nature and animals. Business administration seems the least likely, given his interests and empathetic nature which align less with the traditional demands of this field.
