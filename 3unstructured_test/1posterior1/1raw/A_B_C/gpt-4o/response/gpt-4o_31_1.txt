Based on the personality sketch provided, here is the estimated probability for each field:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5
}

Explanation:
- Adam's curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, and strong empathy make it highly probable that he is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
- His intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could lend themselves to Computer Science, but his profile does not explicitly mention a strong interest in technology or coding, making this less likely.
- Business Administration seems less likely given his defined interests and personality traits, which don't strongly align with the typically people-oriented and profit-driven aspects of this field.
