Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, we can make educated estimates about the likelihood of his enrollment in each field of study as of 2021. Given his strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and abstract thinking, certain fields seem more likely to align with his profile.

Here are my estimates:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

- **Computer Science (0.2)**: While Adam's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts might make him suitable for a field like computer science, his primary interests seem to be more aligned with the natural world rather than technology.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.6)**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, this field appears to be the most likely fit for him.

- **Business Administration (0.1)**: Adam's personality traits and interests donâ€™t strongly indicate a focus on business or administration-related studies, making it the least likely of the three fields.

These estimates are based on the given personality traits and interests.
