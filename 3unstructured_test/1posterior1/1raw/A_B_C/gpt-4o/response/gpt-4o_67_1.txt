Given the personality sketch of Adam, his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work seem to align closely with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and inclination towards solving puzzles are also compatible with computer science, though it seems less fitting compared to agricultural and veterinary science. Business administration seems the least likely, as the sketch does not highlight interests or traits typically associated with that field.
