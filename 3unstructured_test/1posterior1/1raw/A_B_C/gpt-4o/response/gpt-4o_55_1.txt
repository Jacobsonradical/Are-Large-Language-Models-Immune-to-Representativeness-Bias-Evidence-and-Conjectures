Based on Adam's personality sketch and interests, here is the estimated probability that Adam was enrolled in the following fields in 2021:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5,
  "computer science": 0.2
}

- **Business Administration**: Although Adam is intelligent and understands hard work and dedication, his strong interest in nature, plants, and animals does not align well with a focus on business administration. Thus, the probability is relatively low.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and warm-hearted, empathetic nature, Adam's personality and interests are a strong match for a field in agricultural and veterinary science. Hence, this field has the highest probability.

- **Computer Science**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is intelligent, which hints at some interest in computer science. However, his deeper connection with nature and animals suggests that computer science is not his primary focus. This gives it a moderate probability.
