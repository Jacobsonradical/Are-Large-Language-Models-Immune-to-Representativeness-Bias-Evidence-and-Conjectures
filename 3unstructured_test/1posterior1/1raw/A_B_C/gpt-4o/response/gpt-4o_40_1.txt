Based on Adam's personality sketch and his interests, the estimated probabilities for each field are as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
```

These probabilities reflect Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as his intelligence and appreciation for hard work, which align well with the field of agricultural and veterinary science. His skills in understanding abstract concepts could also lend themselves to computer science, though it is less aligned with his described interests than agricultural and veterinary science. Business administration seems the least likely based on his personality profile.
