Based on Adam's personality sketch, interests, and traits, we can make some reasonable estimates about the likelihood of his graduate study field. Given his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and interest in solving puzzles and abstract concepts, here are the estimated probabilities for each field:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

- **Computer Science**: While Adam enjoys solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, which are relevant to computer science, his other interests seem more aligned with natural sciences and animals.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, and strong empathy make this field a highly likely match for his interests and personality.
- **Business Administration**: Adam's traits do not strongly align with business administration. While his appreciation for hard work and dedication is valuable in any field, his specific interests suggest a different primary focus.
