Based on the provided personality sketch and background of Adam, the probability estimates for his enrollment in the given fields are as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business administration**: Although Adam is of high intelligence and understands abstract concepts, his described interests and personality traits — such as his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy — do not strongly align with the typical profile of a business administration student. Hence, the probability is lower.
- **Agricultural and veterinary science**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, interest in plants, love for animals, and strong empathy are traits that strongly align with this field. Therefore, the probability is higher.
- **Computer science**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is good at understanding abstract concepts, which are important skills in computer science. However, his primary interests in nature and animals suggest that although he might have the aptitude for computer science, it is less likely to be his chosen field compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
