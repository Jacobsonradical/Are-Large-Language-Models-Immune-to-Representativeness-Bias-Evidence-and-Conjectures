Based on Adam's personality sketch and interests, I can estimate the probabilities of him being enrolled in particular fields. Here's the assessment:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.2
}

This estimation is influenced by Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, which align well with agricultural and veterinary sciences. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could also make him a fit for computer science, albeit to a lesser extent. His traits and interests seem less aligned with business administration.
