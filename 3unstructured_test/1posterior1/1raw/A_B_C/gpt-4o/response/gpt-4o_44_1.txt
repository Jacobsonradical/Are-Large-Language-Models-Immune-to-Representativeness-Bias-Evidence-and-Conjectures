Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the probabilities I estimate for Adam being enrolled in each of the specified fields:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}

Explanation:
- "Business administration" is given a low probability because Adam's interests and personality traits (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals) do not strongly align with the typical focus of this field.
- "Computer science" is given a moderate probability. While Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence and abstract thinking skills, his primary interests seem more aligned with nature and animals, making this less likely but still possible.
- "Agricultural and veterinary science" is given the highest probability. Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align well with this field, making it the most probable choice.
