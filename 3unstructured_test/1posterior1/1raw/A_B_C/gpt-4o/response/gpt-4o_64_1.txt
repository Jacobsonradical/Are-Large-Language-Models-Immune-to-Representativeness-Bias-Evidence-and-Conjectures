Based on the provided personality sketch of Adam, we can try to align his interests and characteristics with the typical fields of study:

1. **Computer Science**: While Adam is intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts (which suits computer science), he has a stronger inclination toward nature, plants, and animals. Hence, the probability of him choosing this field is lower compared to fields more closely aligned with his interests.

2. **Business Administration**: Adam's profile suggests a warm-hearted, empathetic individual with a love for nature and animals. There is no direct indication of his interest in business administration, so the probability is relatively low for this field as well.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field closely aligns with Adam's deep love for animals, curiosity about nature, and strong empathy. Given these interests, the probability of him being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is higher compared to the other fields.

Based on this analysis, here is an estimate:
