Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, we can make some educated guesses about the likelihood of his enrollment in various fields. Here's the estimate:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}

Explanation:
- **Business Administration**: Given Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, he doesn't seem to exhibit a strong inclination toward business-related endeavors. Thus, the probability is relatively low.
- **Computer Science**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, making it plausible that he might be interested in a field like computer science. However, his deep love for nature and animals indicates that this is less likely compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field aligns closely with Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, as well as his strong empathy. Therefore, this seems to be the most probable field of enrollment for him.
