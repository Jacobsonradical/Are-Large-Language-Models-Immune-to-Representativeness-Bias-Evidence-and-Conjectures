Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam's interests and personality traits align more closely with fields related to nature, animals, and understanding complex systems. Considering these aspects, below is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the specified fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.20,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.60
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business administration:** Adam's personality traits and interests do not strongly align with business administration, which typically requires a keen interest in management, economics, and organizational behavior.
- **Computer science:** While Adam has high intelligence and enjoys solving puzzles, his passion for nature and animals is more dominant. However, a moderate probability is allotted here due to his good understanding of abstract concepts, which is beneficial in computer science.
- **Agricultural and veterinary science:** Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align most closely with this field. His personality and interests suggest a strong fit for this area of study.
