Given Adam's personality traits and interests, we can make some educated guesses about his likelihood of enrolling in different fields:

1. Business administration: Adam's described traits focus heavily on nature, animals, empathy, and abstract thinking. These are not typically the dominant traits for someone pursuing a degree in business administration.
   
2. Computer science: While Adam is described as high in intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts, there's no specific mention of a strong interest in technology or programming. His curiosity and puzzle-solving ability do correlate somewhat with the skills needed in computer science, but the lack of a direct connection to technology dampens the probability slightly.

3. Agricultural and veterinary science: Adam has a clear and strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy. This field aligns very well with his stated interests and personality traits. 

Here are the estimated probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
