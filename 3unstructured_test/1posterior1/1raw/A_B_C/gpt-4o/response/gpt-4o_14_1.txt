Explanation: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication strongly align with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could also be beneficial in computer science, but his interests suggest a stronger fit with agricultural and veterinary fields. Business administration seems least likely given his described interests and personality traits.
