Based on the personality sketch of Adam, the following probabilities are estimated for his enrollment in the specified fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.25,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.70
}
```

### Rationale:
- **Business Administration (0.05)**: The description of Adam's interests and personality traits does not strongly align with typical interests needed for business administration. His passion for nature, empathy, and love for animals suggest a different focus.

- **Computer Science (0.25)**: Adam’s high intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles could make computer science a plausible field for him. However, his love for nature, empathy, and affinity for animals seem stronger indicators for a different field.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.70)**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, appreciation for hard work, and dedication, align strongly with agricultural and veterinary sciences. Therefore, it’s the most probable field of study for him.
