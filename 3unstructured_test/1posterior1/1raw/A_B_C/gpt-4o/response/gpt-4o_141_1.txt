Given Adam's deep love for nature, animals, and his strong empathy, it is highly probable that he might be enrolled in a field closely related to his interests, such as agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and aptitude for abstract concepts make computer science a possibility, though less aligned with his expressly stated passions. Business administration seems the least likely due to his personality traits and interests described.
