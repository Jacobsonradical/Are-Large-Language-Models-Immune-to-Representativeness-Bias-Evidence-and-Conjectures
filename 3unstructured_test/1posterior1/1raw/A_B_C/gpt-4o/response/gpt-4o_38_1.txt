Based on the personality sketch provided, it is possible to make educated estimates about the likelihood of Adam's field of study, although this remains speculative. Here's a plausible estimation:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

This estimation is influenced by Adam's strong empathy, deep love for animals, and genuine curiosity about nature, which align well with agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit computer science as well, though it doesn't align as strongly with his described interests and personality traits. Business administration appears less likely given the profile, though not impossible.
