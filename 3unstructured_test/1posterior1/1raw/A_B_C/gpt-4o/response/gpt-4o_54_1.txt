Given the personality sketch of Adam, here's an estimate of the probability that he was enrolled in each of the specified fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,  // Given his curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and love for animals, business administration seems less likely.
  "computer science": 0.3,         // His intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles make this a plausible choice, but it doesn't align as closely with his expressed affinity for nature and animals.
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6  // This field aligns very well with his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication.
}
```

It's important to remember that these are just estimates based on the information provided about Adam's personality, and actual enrollment could deviate based on other factors not mentioned.
