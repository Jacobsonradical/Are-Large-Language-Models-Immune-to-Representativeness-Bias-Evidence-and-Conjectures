Based on Adam's personality sketch and interests, here are the estimated probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4
}

Adam's strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest a higher probability of being enrolled in a field related to agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could also make computer science a plausible field of study, but his interests don't align as strongly with business administration.
