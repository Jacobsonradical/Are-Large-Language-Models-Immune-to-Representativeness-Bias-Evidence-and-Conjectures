Based on the personality sketch of Adam, here are the estimated probabilities that he was enrolled in the specified fields:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

The probability for computer science is moderate because Adam has high intelligence and enjoys solving puzzles, which are traits that could align with this field. However, his strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature strongly suggest a higher likelihood for agricultural and veterinary science. The probability for business administration is lower since his described interests and personality traits do not strongly align with typical characteristics associated with that field.
