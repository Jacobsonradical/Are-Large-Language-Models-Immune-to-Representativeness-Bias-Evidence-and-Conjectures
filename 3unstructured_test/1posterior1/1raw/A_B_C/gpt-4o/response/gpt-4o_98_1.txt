Given Adam's personality sketch, his strong empathy, deep love for animals, and appreciation for nature line up well with the field of agricultural and veterinary science. This field often attracts individuals with a passion for animals and nature, making it a likely fit for Adam. His high intelligence and capability with abstract concepts give some weight to computer science, though it is less directly aligned with his interests in natural and living things. Business administration seems the least likely given his personality and interests.
