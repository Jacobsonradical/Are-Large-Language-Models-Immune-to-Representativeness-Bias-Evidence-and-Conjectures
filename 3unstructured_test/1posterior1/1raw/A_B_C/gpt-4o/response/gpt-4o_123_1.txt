Explanation:
Adam's strong curiosity about nature, love for plants and animals, and warm heart align well with agricultural and veterinary science. His traits suggest a likelihood of being involved in a field that connects closely with nature and animals.

Business administration does not align well with Adam's personality traits and interests, which indicate a preference for nature and empathy over business and management, making this a less probable field for him.

Computer science is a possibility given Adam's high intelligence, appreciation for solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts. While it is not as aligned with his love for nature and animals, his intellectual skills could suit this field.
