Based on Adam's personality sketch, here's an estimate of the likelihood that he was enrolled in the specified fields:

{
  "computer science": 0.15,
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.60
}

Given Adam's deep love for animals, curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, agricultural and veterinary science seems like the most fitting field. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts might also apply to computer science, although it is less aligned with his interests. Business administration seems the least likely among the three given his personality and interests.
