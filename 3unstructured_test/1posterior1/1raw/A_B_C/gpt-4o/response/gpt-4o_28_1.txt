Based on the given personality sketch of Adam, here are the probabilities estimated for each field:

{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

Iâ€™ve assigned the highest probability to agricultural and veterinary science due to Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, his love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work. Computer science has a significant probability as well, given his high intelligence and enjoyment in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts. Business administration has the lowest probability as it does not strongly align with the specific interests and traits described in his personality sketch.
