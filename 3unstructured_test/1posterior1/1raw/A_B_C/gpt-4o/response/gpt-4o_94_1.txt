Given Adamâ€™s detailed personality sketch, his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work strongly suggest a likelihood of the agricultural and veterinary sciences. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit multiple fields, including computer science, but his empathy and specific interests make agricultural and veterinary science more probable. Business administration seems less likely given his interests and traits.
