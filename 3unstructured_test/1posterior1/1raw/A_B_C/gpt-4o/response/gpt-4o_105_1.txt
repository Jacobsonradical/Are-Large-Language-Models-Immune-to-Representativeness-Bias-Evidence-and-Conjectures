Based on Adam's personality sketch and interests, here is my estimate of the probability that he was enrolled in each of the specified fields:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication strongly align with agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest a possibility for computer science, but this is less aligned with his described interests. Business administration is the least aligned with his personality and interests.
