Certainly, based on Adam's personality sketch and interests, here is an estimate of the probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

These probabilities are informed by Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature, which are well-aligned with agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and aptitude for solving puzzles could correlate with computer science, while his appreciation for hard work could apply to various fields, including business administration, though it seems less likely given the information provided.
