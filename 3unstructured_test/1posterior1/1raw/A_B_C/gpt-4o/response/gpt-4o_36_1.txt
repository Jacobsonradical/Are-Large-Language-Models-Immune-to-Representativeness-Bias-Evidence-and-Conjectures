Given the personality sketch and interests of Adam, he seems particularly well-suited for fields that align with nature, animals, and abstract concepts.

Here is the best estimate for his enrollment probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.65,
  "business administration": 0.10,
  "computer science": 0.25
}

Adam's strong curiosity about nature and love for animals make it most likely that he would pursue a graduate program in agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also make computer science a viable option, though his empathy and naturalist inclinations suggest it is less likely than the former. Business administration seems the least likely field given his personality traits and interests.
