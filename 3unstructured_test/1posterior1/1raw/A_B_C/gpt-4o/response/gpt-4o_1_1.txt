Given his strong affinity for nature, plants, animals, and empathy, Adam's personality and interests seem to align most closely with fields related to agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also make computer science a plausible option, albeit less aligned with his stated interests in nature and animals. Business administration seems the least likely field given the absence of any related traits in his personality sketch.
