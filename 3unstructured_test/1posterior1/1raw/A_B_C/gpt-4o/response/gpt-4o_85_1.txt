Based on Adam's personality traits and interests, the probabilities are as follows:

{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.5",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Explanation:
- **Business Administration**: Adam's interests in nature, animals, and puzzles don't strongly align with business administration, where the focus is typically on management, finance, and economics. Hence, a lower probability is assigned here.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given his genuine curiosity about nature and plants, deep love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, this field seems to be a strong match.
- **Computer Science**: While Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is highly intelligent with a good grasp of abstract concepts, these attributes align well with computer science. However, the direct connection to nature and animals suggests a slightly lower probability compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
