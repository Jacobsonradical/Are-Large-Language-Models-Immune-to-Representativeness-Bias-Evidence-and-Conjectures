Based on the personality sketch provided, here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in the following graduate fields in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals suggests a strong inclination towards agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also align well with this field.

While his intelligence could also suit him for computer science, his specific interests seem more directly related to agricultural and veterinary science.

Business administration seems the least likely given his personality profile, as it doesn't directly involve his curiosity about nature, plants, animals, or abstract concepts. However, there is still a small possibility he could have pursued this field.
