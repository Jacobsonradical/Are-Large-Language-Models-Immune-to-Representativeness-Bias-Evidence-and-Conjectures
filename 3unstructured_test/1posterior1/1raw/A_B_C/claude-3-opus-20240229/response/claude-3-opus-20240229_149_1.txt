Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the specified graduate fields in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have a strong interest in nature, plants and animals, which suggests he is more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to the other two fields. His curiosity, intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also make computer science a reasonable possibility. Business administration seems less likely given his described interests and personality traits, but cannot be ruled out entirely.
