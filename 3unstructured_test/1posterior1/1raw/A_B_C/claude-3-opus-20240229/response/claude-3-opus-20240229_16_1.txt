Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields as a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6",
  "computer science": "0.2",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

Based on Adam's personality sketch, his genuine curiosity about nature and plants, empathy and love for animals, as well as his appreciation for hard work and dedication, suggest a high probability that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts indicate some probability that he could have been in computer science, but this seems less likely than agricultural and veterinary science given his specific interests.

Business administration seems the least probable given the information provided, as the sketch does not mention any particular interest in business or related fields. However, there is still a small possibility, considering his strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.
