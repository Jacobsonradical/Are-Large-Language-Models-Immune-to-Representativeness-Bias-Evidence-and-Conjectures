Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the mentioned graduate fields in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Based on Adam's personality sketch, his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation of hard work and dedication suggest a higher likelihood that he was pursuing graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science.

His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts indicate some probability that he was studying computer science, though this seems less likely than agricultural and veterinary science given his specific interests.

Business administration appears to be the least probable field among the three, as the personality sketch does not highlight any strong interests or traits that directly align with typical motivations for pursuing graduate studies in business.
