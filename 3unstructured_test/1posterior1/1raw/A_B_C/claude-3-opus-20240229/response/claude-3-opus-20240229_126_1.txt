Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the graduate fields, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, plants and love for animals suggests a high probability that he studied agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also point to a reasonable probability of studying computer science. The personality sketch provides less evidence that he would have chosen to study business administration.
