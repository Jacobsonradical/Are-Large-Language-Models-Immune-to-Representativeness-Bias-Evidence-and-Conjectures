Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Based on Adam's interests and personality traits, I think it is most likely that he was studying agricultural and veterinary science, given his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation of hard work and dedication which are important in that field. There is a reasonable chance he may have been studying computer science, as it involves problem solving, abstract concepts and intelligence which seem to match Adam's strengths. I think business administration is least likely given the details provided, as it doesn't seem to align as closely with his main interests and attributes.
