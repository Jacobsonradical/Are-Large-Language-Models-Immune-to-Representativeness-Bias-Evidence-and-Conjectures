Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields as a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Based on Adam's personality sketch, his curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest a high probability that he was pursuing graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and puzzle-solving skills also indicate a moderate probability of being enrolled in computer science. The description does not strongly suggest an inclination towards business administration, so I assigned a lower probability to that field.
