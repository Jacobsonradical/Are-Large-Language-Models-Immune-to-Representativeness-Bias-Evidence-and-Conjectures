Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the given graduate fields in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.35",
  "computer science": "0.15",
  "business administration": "0.10"
}

Based on Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals, I believe there is a decent chance he may have pursued graduate studies in agricultural or veterinary science.

His high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and skill at solving puzzles suggests he could potentially be drawn to computer science as well, though the bio doesn't mention a specific affinity for technology or computers.

While he has an appreciation for hard work and dedication which could lend itself to business, overall the bio seems to point more toward fields relating to nature, animals, and abstract problem-solving. So I gave business a lower probability compared to the other two fields.
