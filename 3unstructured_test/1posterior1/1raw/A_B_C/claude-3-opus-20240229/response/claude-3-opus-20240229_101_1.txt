Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as a deep empathy. This suggests he is more likely to be drawn to agricultural and veterinary science compared to the other fields. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could lend itself to computer science. However, the sketch does not mention any particular aptitude or interest in computers or technology. Business administration seems the least likely based on his personality profile, as it does not directly relate to his mentioned interests and traits. Of course, there are many other potential fields of graduate study not listed.
