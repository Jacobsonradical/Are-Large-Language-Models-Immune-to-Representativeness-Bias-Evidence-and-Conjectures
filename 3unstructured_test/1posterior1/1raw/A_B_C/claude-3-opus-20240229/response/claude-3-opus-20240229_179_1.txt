Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6",
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

Based on Adam's strong interest in nature, plants and animals, as well as his empathy and love for animals, I think it is most likely that he was enrolled in a graduate program related to agricultural and veterinary science.

His high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication also make computer science a possibility, though not as likely as agricultural and veterinary science given his specific interests.

While business administration is a popular graduate field, Adam's personality and interests don't seem to align as closely with typical traits and motivations for pursuing an advanced business degree. So I assigned a relatively low probability to that field.
