Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the specified graduate fields in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on Adam's personality sketch, his strong interest in nature, plants and animals along with his empathy and love for animals suggests a high probability that he was studying agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and aptitude for abstract concepts also makes computer science a reasonable possibility. Business administration seems less likely given his personality and interests, but can't be ruled out entirely.
