Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Based on Adam's strong curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, as well as his deep love for animals, I believe he has a relatively high probability of having been enrolled in an agricultural and veterinary science graduate program.

His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he could also potentially be in a computer science program, but I consider this less likely than agricultural and veterinary science given his specific interests.

Business administration seems the least probable out of the three options, as the personality sketch does not highlight any strong inclination towards business or management.
