Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the specified graduate fields in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.5",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, and love of animals suggests a high probability that he was studying agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also points to computer science as a possibility. His personality sketch does not strongly indicate an inclination towards business administration, so I assigned that a lower probability.
