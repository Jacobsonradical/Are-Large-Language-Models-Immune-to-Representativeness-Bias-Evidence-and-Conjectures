Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the specified graduate fields in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.2",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have a strong interest in and affinity for nature, plants, animals, and hard work and dedication. This suggests he would be most drawn to a field like agricultural and veterinary science. His curiosity, intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could lend itself to computer science as well, but the description overall points more towards agricultural and veterinary pursuits. Business administration seems least likely given his quiet nature and the lack of anything in his profile suggesting an interest in business or management.
