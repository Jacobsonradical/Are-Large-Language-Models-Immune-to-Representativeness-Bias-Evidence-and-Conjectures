Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the specified graduate fields in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have a strong interest in and aptitude for natural sciences, especially related to plants and animals. This suggests a high probability that he was studying agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could also suit him well for computer science, though the link is less direct than for agricultural and veterinary studies. Business administration seems less probable given his primary interests, but his strong work ethic and dedication could enable him to succeed in that field as well, even if it's not his true passion.
