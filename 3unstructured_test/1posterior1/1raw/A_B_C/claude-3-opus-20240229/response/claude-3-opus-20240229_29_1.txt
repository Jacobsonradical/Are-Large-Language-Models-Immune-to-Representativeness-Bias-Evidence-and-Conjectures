Here is my estimate of the probabilities for Adam's graduate field of study in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6",
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

Based on Adam's strong interest in nature, plants and animals, along with his empathy and love for animals, I believe he has a high probability of around 60% of being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science for graduate studies.

His high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggests he may also have an interest in computer science. I estimate a 20% probability he was studying that.

While he has traits that could lend themselves to business (intelligence, hard work, dedication), his other interests seem to point more towards other fields, so I put the probability of him pursuing an advanced business degree lower at 10%.

Of course, these are just rough estimates based on limited information in his personality profile. His actual graduate studies could certainly vary based on his specific interests, opportunities and goals.
