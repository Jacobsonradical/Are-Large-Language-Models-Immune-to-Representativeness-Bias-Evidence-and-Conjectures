Here is my estimate of the probabilities for Adam's graduate field of study in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

Based on Adam's strong interest in nature, plants and animals, as well as his empathy and love for animals, I believe agricultural and veterinary science is the most likely field at 60%. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts suggests he could also potentially be studying computer science, so I assign that a 30% probability. Business administration seems less likely given his personality and interests, so I estimate only a 10% chance for that field.
