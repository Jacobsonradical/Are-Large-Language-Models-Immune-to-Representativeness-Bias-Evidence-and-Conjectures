Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields as a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as empathy and a love for animals. This suggests he may be more likely to pursue agricultural and veterinary science compared to the other fields.

His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could lend itself to computer science, but the sketch emphasizes more his curiosity about nature and love of animals. 

While he has an appreciation for hard work and dedication which could be applicable to business administration, there are no other strong indicators that he would specialize in that field.

Of course, this is a rough estimate based solely on the limited information in the personality sketch. Many other factors could influence his choice of graduate specialization.
