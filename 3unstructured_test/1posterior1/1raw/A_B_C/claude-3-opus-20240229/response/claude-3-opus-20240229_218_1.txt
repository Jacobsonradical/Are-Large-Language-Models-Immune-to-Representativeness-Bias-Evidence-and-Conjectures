Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields as a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

Based on Adam's described personality traits and interests, I believe he is most likely to have been enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, given his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation of hard work and dedication which are valuable in that field. 

Computer science is a possibility given his intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, but seems less likely than agricultural and veterinary science based on the description.

Business administration seems the least likely of the three options, as the personality sketch does not highlight any strong business or leadership related traits or interests.
