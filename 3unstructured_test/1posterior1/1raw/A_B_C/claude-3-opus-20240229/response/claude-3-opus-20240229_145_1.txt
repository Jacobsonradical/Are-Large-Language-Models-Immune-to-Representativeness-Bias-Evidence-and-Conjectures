Here is my estimate of the probabilities for Adam's graduate field of study based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Given Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and his deep empathy, I believe he has a relatively high probability of studying agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also suggests he could be well-suited for computer science. Business administration seems less likely given his personality profile, but it's still possible. Of course, there are many other potential fields he could be studying as well.
