Here is my estimate of the probabilities for Adam's graduate field of study based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Based on Adam's strong love for animals, curiosity about plants and nature, as well as his empathy and warm heart, I believe he has a high probability of studying agricultural and veterinary science.

His high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles also suggest a decent probability that he could be studying computer science.

Business administration seems less likely given his personality profile, but I still assign it a small probability since he has a strong work ethic and dedication which could lend itself to that field.
