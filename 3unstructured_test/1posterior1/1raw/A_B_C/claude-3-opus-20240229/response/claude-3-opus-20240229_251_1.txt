Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields as a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

Based on Adam's personality sketch, his love of nature, plants, and animals, as well as his strong empathy, suggest a high probability that he was studying agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts indicate some probability he may have been studying computer science. The description does not strongly suggest an inclination toward business administration, so I assigned that a lower probability.
