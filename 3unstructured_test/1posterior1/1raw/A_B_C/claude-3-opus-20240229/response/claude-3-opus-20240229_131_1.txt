Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.35",
  "computer science": "0.25",
  "business administration": "0.10"
}

Based on Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals, I estimate a relatively high probability of 0.35 that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Given his high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles, I estimate a probability of 0.25 that he was enrolled in computer science.

Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could potentially align with business administration, but the given personality sketch does not provide strong evidence for this field. Therefore, I estimate a lower probability of 0.10 for business administration.
