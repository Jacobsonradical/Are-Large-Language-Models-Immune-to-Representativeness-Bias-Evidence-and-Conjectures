Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields as a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

Based on Adam's personality sketch, his curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest a high probability that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also make computer science a reasonable possibility, though not as likely as agricultural and veterinary science given his specific interests. Business administration seems less probable given his personality and interests, but still a possibility.
