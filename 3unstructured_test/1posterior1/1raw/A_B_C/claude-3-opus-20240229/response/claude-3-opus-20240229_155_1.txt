Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1", 
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests Adam has a strong interest in nature, plants and animals, as well as empathy and love for animals. This makes agricultural and veterinary science a likely choice.

His high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles point to an aptitude for computer science as well.

Business administration seems less likely given his personality profile, but still possible. He appreciates hard work and dedication which are valuable in business.

Of course, this is just an estimate based on limited information. There are many other potential fields he could have specialized in. But based on the personality sketch, I'd say agricultural/veterinary science is most likely, followed by computer science, with business administration less probable but still possible.
