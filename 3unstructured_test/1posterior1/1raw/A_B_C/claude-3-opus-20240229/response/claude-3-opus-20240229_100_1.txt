Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the specified graduate fields in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have a strong interest in and appreciation for nature, animals, and abstract thinking. This suggests a higher probability that he was pursuing graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts also make computer science a reasonable possibility. While business administration cannot be ruled out, the description doesn't provide strong evidence of Adam being drawn to that field compared to the other two, so I assigned it a lower probability.
