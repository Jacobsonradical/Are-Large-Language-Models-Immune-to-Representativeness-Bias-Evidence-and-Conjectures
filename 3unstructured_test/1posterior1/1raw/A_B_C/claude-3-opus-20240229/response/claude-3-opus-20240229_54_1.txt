Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the following graduate fields in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6",
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

Based on Adam's personality sketch, his love of nature, animals, and abstract concepts suggests he is most likely to have pursued graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and problem-solving skills also point to a reasonable probability of computer science. Business administration seems least likely given his interests and traits, but still possible. Of course, this is just an estimate based on limited information.
