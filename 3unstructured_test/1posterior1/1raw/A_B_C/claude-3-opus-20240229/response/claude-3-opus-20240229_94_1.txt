Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields as a graduate student in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Based on Adam's personality sketch, his curiosity about nature, love of animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication make agricultural and veterinary science the most likely field of study, with an estimated 60% probability. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could lend themselves to computer science, giving that field an estimated 30% probability. Business administration seems the least likely fit given his interests and traits, so I assigned it a 10% probability. Of course, there are many other potential graduate fields not listed here that Adam could have pursued as well.
