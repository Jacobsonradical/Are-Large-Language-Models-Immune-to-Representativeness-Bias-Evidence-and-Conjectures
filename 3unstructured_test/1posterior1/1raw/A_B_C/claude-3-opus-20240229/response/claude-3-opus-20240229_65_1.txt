Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the specified graduate fields in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on Adam's personality sketch, he has a strong interest in and understanding of nature, plants and animals. This suggests a high probability that he was studying agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also points to a decent likelihood of studying computer science. Business administration seems less probable given his personality traits and interests, though it can't be ruled out entirely.
