Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the specified graduate fields in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.2",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has a strong interest in and appreciation for nature, plants, animals, and hard work. This suggests he is more likely to pursue graduate studies related to those passions, such as agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could lend itself to many fields, including computer science to some degree. Business administration seems less likely given his personality profile, but it can't be ruled out entirely. Of course, there are many other potential fields he could have specialized in as well.
