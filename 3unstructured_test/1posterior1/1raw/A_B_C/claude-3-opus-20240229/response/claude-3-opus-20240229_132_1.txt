Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields as a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Based on Adam's described interests, personality and skills, I believe he is most likely to have been enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, given his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also fit well with this field.

There is a lower but still reasonable probability he may have been in computer science, as it involves problem-solving, puzzles and abstract concepts which seem to match his interests and strengths.

I think business administration is the least likely of the three fields, as it doesn't align as closely with the specific traits and interests mentioned, though his appreciation for hard work and dedication could be relevant.
