Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields as a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

Based on Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as his empathy and love for animals, I believe he is most likely to have been enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also suggest he could potentially be in computer science. Business administration seems less likely given his personality and interests, but still a possibility. Of course, there are many other graduate fields he could have been in as well.
