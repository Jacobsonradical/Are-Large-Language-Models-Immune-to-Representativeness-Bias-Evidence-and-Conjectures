Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the specified graduate fields in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.2",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have a strong interest and aptitude for fields related to nature, animals, and abstract problem-solving. His love for animals and curiosity about plants makes agricultural and veterinary science a likely choice, so I assigned the highest probability to that field. His intelligence and skill at understanding abstract concepts could lend itself to computer science, but it seems less aligned with his core interests, so I gave that a lower probability. Business administration seems the least likely fit based on his personality profile, so I assigned the lowest probability to that field. Of course, there are many other potential fields he could have pursued as well.
