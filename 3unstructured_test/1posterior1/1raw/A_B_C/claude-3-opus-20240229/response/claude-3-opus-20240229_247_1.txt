Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.2",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Based on Adam's personality sketch, his genuine curiosity about nature and plants, deep love for animals, and high intelligence in understanding abstract concepts suggest a strong likelihood that he was pursuing graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. His problem-solving skills could also lend themselves well to computer science, so I assigned a modest probability there. Business administration seems less likely given his interests and traits, so I gave that the lowest probability of the three fields, but still a non-zero chance.
