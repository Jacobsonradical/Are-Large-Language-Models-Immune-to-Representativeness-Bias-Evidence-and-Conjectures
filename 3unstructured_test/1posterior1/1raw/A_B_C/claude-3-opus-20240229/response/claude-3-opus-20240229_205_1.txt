Based on the personality sketch provided, here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the mentioned fields:

{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Explanation:
Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals, he seems to have a strong inclination towards agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could also be beneficial in this field.

While his problem-solving skills and intelligence could be applicable to computer science, the personality sketch does not strongly indicate a specific interest in this area.

Business administration seems to be the least likely field based on the given information, as the description does not mention any strong interest or skills related to business or management.
