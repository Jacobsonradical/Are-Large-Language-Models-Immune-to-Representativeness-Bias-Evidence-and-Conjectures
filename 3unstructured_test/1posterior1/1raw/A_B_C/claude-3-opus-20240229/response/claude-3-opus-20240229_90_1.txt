Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the listed graduate fields in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have strong interests and aptitudes that align most closely with agricultural and veterinary science, given his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation of hard work and dedication. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could lend itself to computer science as well. Business administration seems less likely given his personality profile, but still possible. Of course, this is just an estimate based on limited information.
