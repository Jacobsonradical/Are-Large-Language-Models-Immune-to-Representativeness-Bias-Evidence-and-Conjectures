Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the given graduate fields in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Based on Adam's personality sketch, his love of nature, plants and animals, as well as his strong empathy, make agricultural and veterinary science the most likely field. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also fit well with this field.

Computer science is a possibility given his intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles, but seems less likely than agricultural science given his other traits.

Business administration seems the least likely of the three fields based on the description, as it doesn't align as closely with his curiosity about nature and love of animals. However, his understanding of hard work and dedication could lend itself to business.

Of course, there are many other potential graduate fields not listed here that could also be good fits for Adam based on his personality profile. This estimate includes a fair bit of uncertainty without more details on his specific interests and academic background.
