Here is my estimate of the probabilities for Adam's graduate field of study in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6",
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

Based on Adam's personality traits, I believe he has a relatively high probability of studying agricultural and veterinary science given his deep love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants, and appreciation for hard work and dedication which are important in this field.

Computer science is a possibility given his high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles. However, the personality sketch doesn't emphasize a strong interest in technology.

Business administration seems less likely based on the quieter, empathetic personality traits described, so I assigned it a lower probability. The personality profile suggests interests that align more with scientific fields than business.
