Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.5",
  "computer science": "0.2",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

Based on Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and his deep empathy, I believe there is a relatively high probability (around 50%) that he was studying agricultural and veterinary science.

His skills in abstract thinking and high intelligence suggest he may have an interest in computer science as well, so I assign a 20% probability to that field.

Business administration seems less likely given his personality profile, so I estimate only a 10% probability for that field of study.
