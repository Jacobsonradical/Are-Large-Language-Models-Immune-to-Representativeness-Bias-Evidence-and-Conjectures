Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the specified graduate fields in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Based on Adam's personality sketch, his love of nature, plants and animals along with his strong empathy suggest a high probability that he was studying agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and aptitude for abstract concepts also point to a decent probability of studying computer science. Business administration seems less likely given his personal traits and interests, though still possible. Of course, there are many other graduate fields he could have pursued as well.
