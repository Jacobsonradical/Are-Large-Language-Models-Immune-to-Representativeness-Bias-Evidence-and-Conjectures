Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.05",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6",
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

Based on Adam's personality sketch, his genuine curiosity about nature and plants, deep love for animals, and strong empathy suggest a high probability that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts indicate a moderate probability of being enrolled in computer science.

The personality sketch does not provide strong evidence for Adam being enrolled in business administration, so I assigned a low probability to that field.
