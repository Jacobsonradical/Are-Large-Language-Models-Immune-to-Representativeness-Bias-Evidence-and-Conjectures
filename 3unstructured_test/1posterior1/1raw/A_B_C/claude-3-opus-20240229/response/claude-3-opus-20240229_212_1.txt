Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Based on Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and his empathy and love for animals, I think it is most likely that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. His curiosity, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts also make computer science a reasonable possibility. While business administration is certainly possible, I think it is less likely given his specific interests and personality traits described in the sketch.
