Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.25",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

Based on Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants and animals, his strong empathy and love for animals, I estimate a relatively high 40% probability that he studied agricultural and veterinary science.

His enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggests he may also have an aptitude for computer science, so I estimate a 25% chance he studied in that field.

The personality sketch provides less evidence of business-related interests or strengths, so I assign a lower 10% probability to business administration. His appreciation of hard work and dedication could apply to business, but seems more focused on understanding and curiosity rather than commerce.

Of course, there are many other potential graduate fields not listed, so these probabilities are estimates based solely on the limited information provided. More details about Adam's specific interests and academic background would help refine the estimates further.
