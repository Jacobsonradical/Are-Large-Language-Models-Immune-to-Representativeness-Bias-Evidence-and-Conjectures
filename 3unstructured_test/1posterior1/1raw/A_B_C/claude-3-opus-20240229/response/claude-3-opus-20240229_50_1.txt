Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the specified graduate fields in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have a strong interest and aptitude for subjects related to nature, animals, and abstract concepts. His curiosity about plants and love for animals suggests a high likelihood of pursuing agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and skill with abstract concepts could also lend itself to computer science. Business administration seems less probable given his personal traits and interests, but still a possibility. Of course, this is just my best estimate based on limited information.
