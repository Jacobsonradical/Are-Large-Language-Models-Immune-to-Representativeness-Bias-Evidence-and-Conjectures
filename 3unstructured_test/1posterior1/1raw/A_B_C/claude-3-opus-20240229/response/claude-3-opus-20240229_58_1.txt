Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.25",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Based on Adam's strong curiosity about nature, plants and animals, as well as his deep love for animals, I believe he has a relatively high probability of around 0.6 of being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science for his graduate studies.

His high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles gives him a moderate probability of around 0.25 of specializing in computer science.

Given the personality sketch, I think business administration is less likely, with a probability of around 0.1. The description doesn't highlight interests or traits that seem to align as strongly with typical business administration studies.
