Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the listed fields in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6",
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

Based on Adam's personality sketch, his love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants, as well as his strong empathy suggest a high likelihood that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts indicate some probability that he was enrolled in computer science.

The description doesn't strongly suggest an inclination towards business administration, so I assigned a relatively low probability to that field.
