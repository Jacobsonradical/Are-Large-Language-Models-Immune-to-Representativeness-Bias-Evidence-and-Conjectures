Based on the given personality sketch of Adam, here is my estimate of the probability that he was enrolled in the following graduate fields in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Explanation:
- Business administration: While Adam is intelligent and understands the value of hard work, his interests seem to lie more in natural sciences and abstract concepts rather than business. Therefore, a low probability of 0.1.
- Computer science: Adam's interest in solving puzzles and his ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he might be drawn to computer science. However, it is not a perfect fit given his love for nature and animals. Thus, a moderate probability of 0.3.
- Agricultural and veterinary science: This field aligns well with Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and his deep love for animals. His empathy and intelligence would also be valuable in this field. Therefore, a high probability of 0.7.
