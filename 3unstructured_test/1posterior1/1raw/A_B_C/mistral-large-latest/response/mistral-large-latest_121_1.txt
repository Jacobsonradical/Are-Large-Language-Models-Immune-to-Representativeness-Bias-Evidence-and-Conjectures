Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's field of study:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration (0.1)**: While Adam is intelligent, his interests and personality traits do not strongly align with business administration. Hence, the lowest probability is assigned to this field.
- **Computer Science (0.3)**: Adam's problem-solving skills and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he could be interested in computer science, but it's not as strongly indicated as the next field.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.5)**: Given Adam's love for nature, plants, animals, and his strong empathy, this field seems to be the most aligned with his interests and personality. Thus, it has the highest probability.
