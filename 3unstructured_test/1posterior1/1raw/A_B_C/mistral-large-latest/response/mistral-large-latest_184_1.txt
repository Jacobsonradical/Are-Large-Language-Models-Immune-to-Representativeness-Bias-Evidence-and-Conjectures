Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's field of study:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration (0.1)**: While Adam is intelligent, his interests and personality traits do not strongly align with business administration. Hence, the low probability.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7)**: Given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as his empathy and appreciation for hard work, this field seems highly likely.
- **Computer Science (0.4)**: Adam's problem-solving skills and ability to understand abstract concepts make computer science a possibility, but his interests in nature and animals may not make it his first choice.
