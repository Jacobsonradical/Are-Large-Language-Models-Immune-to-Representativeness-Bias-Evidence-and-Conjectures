Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's field of study:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.6)**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest a high likelihood of him being in this field.
- **Computer Science (0.3)**: His enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence indicate a reasonable probability of him being in computer science, but it's not as strongly indicated as the first field.
- **Business Administration (0.1)**: There's little in the description to suggest a strong interest in business administration, hence the low probability.
