Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's field of study:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.4)**: Adam's strong intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest he might be well-suited to computer science. However, this is not the only field that fits these traits.
- **Business Administration (0.1)**: There is little in the description to suggest a strong fit for business administration. Adam's empathy and appreciation for hard work could be applicable, but these traits are not uniquely aligned with business administration.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.6)**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy make this field a strong fit. His appreciation for hard work and dedication also aligns well with the demands of this field.
