Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's field of study:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.6)**: Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with the skills needed for computer science. However, his strong empathy and love for animals suggest he might prefer a field with more direct interaction with living things.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7)**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy, this field seems like a very good fit. His appreciation for hard work and dedication also aligns well with these fields.
- **Business Administration (0.2)**: While Adam's high intelligence could be applicable in business, his personality traits and interests do not seem to align strongly with this field. Therefore, the estimated probability is lower.
