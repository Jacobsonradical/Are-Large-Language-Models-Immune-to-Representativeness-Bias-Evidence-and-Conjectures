Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's field of study:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration**: While Adam is intelligent, his interests seem to lie more in nature, animals, and abstract concepts rather than business-related topics. Hence, the lower probability.
- **Computer Science**: Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts suggests he might have an aptitude for computer science, but it's not his most prominent interest.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy, this field aligns most closely with his described personality and interests.
