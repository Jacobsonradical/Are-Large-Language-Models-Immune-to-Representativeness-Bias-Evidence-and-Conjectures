Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's field of study:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.6)**: Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest he could be well-suited for computer science. However, his strong empathy and love for animals might lead him towards a different field.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7)**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, and strong empathy, this field seems to align very well with his interests and personality.
- **Business Administration (0.2)**: While Adam appreciates hard work and dedication, there's little in the description to suggest a strong inclination towards business administration. His quiet nature and other interests make this field less likely.
