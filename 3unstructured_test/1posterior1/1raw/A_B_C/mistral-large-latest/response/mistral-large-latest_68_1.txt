Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.6)**: Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with the skills required for computer science. However, his strong empathy and love for animals suggest he might prefer a field where he can directly apply these qualities.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7)**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, and strong empathy, this field seems highly suitable for him. His appreciation for hard work and dedication also fits well with the demands of this field.
- **Business Administration (0.2)**: While Adam's high intelligence and understanding of hard work could be applicable in business administration, his personality traits and interests seem less aligned with this field compared to the other two.
