Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's field of study:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration**: Adam's personality traits do not strongly indicate an interest in business. Hence, the probability is low at 0.1.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as his empathy and appreciation for hard work, this field seems the most likely. Thus, the probability is higher at 0.6.
- **Computer Science**: Adam's aptitude for understanding abstract concepts and solving puzzles suggests he could be suited for computer science, but it's not as strongly indicated as the agricultural and veterinary science field. Therefore, the probability is 0.3.
