```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.15,

Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.4)**: Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles make him a good fit for computer science. However, this is not the only field that matches his skills.
- **Business Administration (0.15)**: While Adam is intelligent, there are no clear indicators in the personality sketch that suggest a strong fit for business administration. Hence, the lower probability.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.6)**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy make him a strong fit for agricultural and veterinary science. This field also aligns with his appreciation for hard work and dedication.
