Based on the personality sketch provided, here are my estimated probabilities for Adam's field of study:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.4)**: Adam's aptitude for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts suggests he might be drawn to computer science. However, this is not the only field that values these skills.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.5)**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy, there's a significant probability he was studying something related to agricultural or veterinary science.
- **Business Administration (0.1)**: While Adam appreciates hard work and dedication, there's little in the description to suggest a strong inclination towards business administration. Hence, the lower probability.
