Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's field of study:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration (0.2)**: While Adam is intelligent and understands hard work, his interests seem to lie more in nature, animals, and puzzles rather than business-related topics.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.6)**: Given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as his strong empathy, this field seems to align well with his interests.
- **Computer Science (0.4)**: Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts suggests he might be interested in computer science, but his love for nature and animals might make this field slightly less likely than agricultural and veterinary science.
