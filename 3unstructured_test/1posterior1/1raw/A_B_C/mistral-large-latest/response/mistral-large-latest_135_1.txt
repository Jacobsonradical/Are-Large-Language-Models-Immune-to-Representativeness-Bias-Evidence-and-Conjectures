Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's field of study:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration**: While Adam is intelligent, his interests and empathy lean more towards nature and animals rather than business-related topics. Hence, the lower probability of 0.1.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy, this field aligns well with his interests. Therefore, a higher probability of 0.6.
- **Computer Science**: Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts suggests he could be suited to computer science, but it's not as strongly indicated as agricultural and veterinary science. Hence, a probability of 0.3.
