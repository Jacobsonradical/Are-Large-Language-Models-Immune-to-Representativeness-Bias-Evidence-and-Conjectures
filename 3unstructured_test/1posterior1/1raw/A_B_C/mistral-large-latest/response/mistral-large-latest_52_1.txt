Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's field of study:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration (0.1)**: While Adam's profile does not strongly indicate an interest in business, it's possible he might be studying this, hence a low but non-zero probability.
- **Computer Science (0.3)**: Adam's aptitude for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts suggests he could be interested in computer science, but it's not the most likely field given his other interests.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.6)**: Given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as his empathy and appreciation for hard work, this field seems the most likely for him to be studying.
