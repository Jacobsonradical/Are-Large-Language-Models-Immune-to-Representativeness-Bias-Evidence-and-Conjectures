```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration**: Adam's interests and personality traits do not strongly align with this field, hence the lower probability.
- **Computer Science**: His aptitude for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts suggests he might be interested in this field, but it's not as strongly indicated as the next option.
