Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's field of study:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration (0.2)**: While Adam's profile doesn't strongly indicate an interest in business, it's possible, hence a lower probability.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.6)**: Given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as his empathy and appreciation for hard work, this field seems quite likely.
- **Computer Science (0.4)**: Adam's aptitude for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts suggests he could be well-suited to computer science, but it's not as strongly indicated as agricultural and veterinary science.
