Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's graduate fields of specialization:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration (0.2)**: While Adam is intelligent and understands hard work, his interests seem more aligned with nature, animals, and problem-solving rather than business-related topics.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.6)**: Given Adam's love for nature, plants, animals, and his strong empathy, this field seems to be a good fit for him.
- **Computer Science (0.4)**: Adam's interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts suggests he might enjoy computer science, but it's not as strongly indicated as the agricultural and veterinary science field.
