```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.4)**: Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles make him a good fit for computer science. However, this is not the only field that matches his skills.
- **Business Administration (0.1)**: While Adam is intelligent, there's little in his personality sketch that suggests a strong fit for business administration. His quiet nature, empathy, and love for animals and nature don't typically correlate with this field.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.6)**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy make him a strong fit for this field. His appreciation for hard work and dedication also aligns well with these fields.
