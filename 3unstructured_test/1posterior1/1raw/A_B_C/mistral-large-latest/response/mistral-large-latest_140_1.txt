Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's field of study:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.6)**: Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles make him a good fit for computer science. However, his strong empathy and love for nature and animals suggest that his interests might lie more in fields directly related to these passions.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7)**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, his love for animals, and his strong empathy, he seems very likely to be interested in this field. His appreciation for hard work and dedication also aligns well with these fields.
- **Business Administration (0.2)**: While Adam's intelligence and understanding of hard work could be applicable to business administration, his personality sketch does not highlight typical interests or skills related to this field, such as leadership, management, or entrepreneurial tendencies. Therefore, the probability is lower.
