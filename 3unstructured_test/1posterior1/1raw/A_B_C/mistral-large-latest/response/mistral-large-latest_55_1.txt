Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's field of study:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration**: Adam's personality traits do not strongly indicate an interest in business. Hence, the lowest probability is assigned to this field.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy, this field seems to align well with his interests. Therefore, it has the highest probability.
- **Computer Science**: Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and his high intelligence suggest he might find computer science appealing, but it's not as strongly indicated as agricultural and veterinary science.
