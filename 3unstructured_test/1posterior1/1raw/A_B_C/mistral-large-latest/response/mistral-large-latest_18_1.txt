Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's field of study:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7)**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest a high probability of him being in this field.
- **Business Administration (0.1)**: There's little indication in the personality sketch that suggests Adam would be interested in business administration.
- **Computer Science (0.3)**: Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts could indicate an interest in computer science, but it's not as strongly suggested as the agricultural and veterinary science field.
