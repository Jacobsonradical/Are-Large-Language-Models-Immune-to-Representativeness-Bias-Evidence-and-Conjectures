Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's field of study:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.4)**: Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest he could be well-suited to computer science. However, this is not the only field that fits these traits.
- **Business Administration (0.1)**: While Adam is intelligent, there are no clear indicators in the personality sketch that suggest a strong fit for business administration. This field typically requires strong leadership, management, and entrepreneurial skills, which are not explicitly mentioned.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.6)**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication make this field a strong fit. These traits align well with the demands and focus of agricultural and veterinary science.
