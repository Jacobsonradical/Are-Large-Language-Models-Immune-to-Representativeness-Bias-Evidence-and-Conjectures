Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's field of study:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.4)**: Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles make him a good fit for computer science. However, his strong empathy and love for animals suggest that he might prefer a field where he can directly apply these qualities.
- **Business Administration (0.1)**: While Adam appreciates hard work and dedication, there's little in his personality sketch to suggest a strong inclination towards business administration. His quiet nature and interests seem to align more with other fields.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.6)**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy, he seems well-suited to a field like agricultural and veterinary science. This field would allow him to apply both his intellectual abilities and his caring nature.
