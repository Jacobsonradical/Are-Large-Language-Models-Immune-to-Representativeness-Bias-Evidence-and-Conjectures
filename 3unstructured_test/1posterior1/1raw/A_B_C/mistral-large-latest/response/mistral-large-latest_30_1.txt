Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's field of study:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration**: Adam's personality traits do not strongly align with this field. His interests seem more focused on nature, animals, and problem-solving rather than business. Hence, the lower probability.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy, this field seems to be a good fit. Therefore, it has the highest probability.
- **Computer Science**: Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts suggests he might have an aptitude for computer science, but it's not as strongly indicated as the agricultural and veterinary science field. Hence, a moderate probability.
