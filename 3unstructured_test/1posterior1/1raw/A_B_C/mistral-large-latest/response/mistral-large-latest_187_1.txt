- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7)**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy make this field highly probable. His appreciation for hard work and dedication also aligns well with these fields.
- **Business Administration (0.2)**: While Adam is intelligent and appreciates hard work, his personality sketch does not strongly indicate an interest in business-related topics. Therefore, the probability is lower compared to the other fields.
