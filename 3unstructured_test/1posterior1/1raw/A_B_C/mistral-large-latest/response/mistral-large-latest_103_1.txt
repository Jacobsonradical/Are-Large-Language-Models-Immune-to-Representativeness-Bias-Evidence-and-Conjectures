Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's field of study:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration**: While Adam is intelligent, his interests and personality traits do not strongly align with this field. Hence, the lowest probability is assigned to this field.
- **Computer Science**: Adam's aptitude for understanding abstract concepts and solving puzzles suggests he might be interested in computer science, but it's not as strongly aligned with his personality as the next field.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as his empathy and appreciation for hard work, this field seems the most likely choice for him. Therefore, it has the highest estimated probability.
