Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's field of study:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration**: Adam's personality traits do not strongly indicate an interest in business. Hence, the lowest probability is assigned to this field.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as his empathy and appreciation for hard work, this field seems the most likely.
- **Computer Science**: Adam's aptitude for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts suggests he could be well-suited to computer science, but it's not as strongly indicated as agricultural and veterinary science.
