Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's field of study:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.6)**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest a high likelihood of him being in this field.
- **Computer Science (0.3)**: His enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence indicate a reasonable probability of him being in computer science, but it's lower than agricultural and veterinary science due to his strong connection with nature and animals.
- **Business Administration (0.1)**: While Adam appreciates hard work and dedication, there's little indication in the personality sketch that suggests he would be interested in business administration. Hence, the lowest probability is assigned to this field.
