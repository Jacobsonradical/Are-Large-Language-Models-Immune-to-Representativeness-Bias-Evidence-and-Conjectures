Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's field of graduate study:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.4)**: Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest he might be interested in computer science. However, this is not the only field that fits these traits.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.5)**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy, this field seems to align very well with his interests and personality.
- **Business Administration (0.1)**: While Adam appreciates hard work and dedication, there's little in the personality sketch to suggest a strong inclination towards business administration.
