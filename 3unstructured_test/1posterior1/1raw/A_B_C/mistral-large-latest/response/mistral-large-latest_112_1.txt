Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's graduate fields of specialization:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.6)**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest a high likelihood of him pursuing a field related to agricultural and veterinary science.
- **Computer Science (0.3)**: His enjoyment in solving puzzles and high intelligence, particularly in understanding abstract concepts, make computer science a possible field of study, but it seems less likely than agricultural and veterinary science based on his personality traits.
- **Business Administration (0.1)**: While Adam appreciates hard work and dedication, there is little in the sketch to suggest a strong interest in business-related topics, making this the least likely of the three fields.
