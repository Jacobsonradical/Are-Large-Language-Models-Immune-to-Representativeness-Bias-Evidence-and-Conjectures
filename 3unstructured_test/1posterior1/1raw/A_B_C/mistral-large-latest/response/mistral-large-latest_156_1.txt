Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's field of study:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7)**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest a high probability of him being in this field.
- **Business Administration (0.1)**: There's little indication in the personality sketch that Adam has a strong interest in business-related topics.
- **Computer Science (0.4)**: Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts suggest a moderate probability of him being in this field. However, it's not as high as agricultural and veterinary science due to his strong connection with nature and animals.
