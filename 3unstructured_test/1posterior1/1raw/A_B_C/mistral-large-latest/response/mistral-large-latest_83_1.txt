Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's field of study:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.6)**: Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest a good fit for computer science. However, his strong empathy and love for nature and animals might pull him towards other fields.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7)**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, and strong empathy, this field seems highly suitable for him.
- **Business Administration (0.2)**: While Adam appreciates hard work and dedication, there's little in the personality sketch to suggest a strong inclination towards business administration. His quiet nature, empathy, and love for nature and animals might not align as well with this field.
