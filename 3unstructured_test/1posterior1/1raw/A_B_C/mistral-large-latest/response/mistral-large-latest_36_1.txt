Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's field of study:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration**: Adam's personality traits do not strongly align with this field, hence the lower probability.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as his empathy and appreciation for hard work, this field seems the most likely.
- **Computer Science**: Adam's problem-solving skills and ability to understand abstract concepts make this a possible field, but it's less likely than agricultural and veterinary science based on his interests.
