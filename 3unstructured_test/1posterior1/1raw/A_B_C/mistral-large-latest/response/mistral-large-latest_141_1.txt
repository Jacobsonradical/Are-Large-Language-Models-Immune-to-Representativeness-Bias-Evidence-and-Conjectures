Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's field of study:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.6)**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest a high likelihood of him pursuing a field related to agricultural and veterinary science.
- **Business Administration (0.1)**: There's little indication in the personality sketch that Adam has a strong interest in business or management, hence the low probability.
- **Computer Science (0.3)**: Adam's aptitude for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts suggests a moderate probability of him pursuing computer science. However, this is lower than the probability for agricultural and veterinary science due to his strong connection with nature and animals.
