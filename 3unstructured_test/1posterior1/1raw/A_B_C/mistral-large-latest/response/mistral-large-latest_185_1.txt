Explanation:
- Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication align strongly with agricultural and veterinary science, hence the highest probability.
- His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he might also do well in computer science, but his personality traits seem less indicative of this path compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
- Business administration seems the least likely fit given Adam's personality and interests, but there is still a small probability as it cannot be ruled out entirely.
