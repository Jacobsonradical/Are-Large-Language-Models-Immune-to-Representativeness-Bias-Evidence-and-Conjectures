Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's field of study:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.4)**: Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles make him a good fit for computer science. However, his strong empathy and love for animals suggest that he might prefer a field where he can directly apply these traits.
- **Business Administration (0.1)**: While Adam appreciates hard work and dedication, there's little in the personality sketch to suggest a strong fit with business administration. His interests and empathy seem to lie more in the natural world and problem-solving.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.6)**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy, this field seems like a strong fit. His appreciation for hard work also aligns well with these fields.
