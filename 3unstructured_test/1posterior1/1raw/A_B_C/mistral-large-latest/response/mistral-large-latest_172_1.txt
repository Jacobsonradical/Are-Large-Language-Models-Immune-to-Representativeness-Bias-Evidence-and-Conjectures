Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's field of study:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration**: While Adam is intelligent, his interests and personality traits do not strongly align with this field. Hence, the lower probability of 0.1.
- **Computer Science**: Adam's aptitude for understanding abstract concepts and solving puzzles suggests he might be interested in computer science. However, his deep love for nature and animals might make this less likely than a field more directly related to those interests. Hence, a probability of 0.3.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, his love for animals, and his strong empathy, this field seems to align most closely with his interests and personality. Hence, the highest probability of 0.5.
