```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.4)**: Adam's strong intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest he could be well-suited to computer science. However, his interests in nature and animals might pull him in another direction.
- **Business Administration (0.1)**: There's little in the description to suggest a strong fit with business administration. Adam seems more drawn to nature, animals, and intellectual pursuits than business-related activities.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.6)**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy, this field seems like a strong fit. His appreciation for hard work and dedication also aligns well with these fields.
