```json

- **Business Administration (0.1)**: While Adam's empathy and appreciation for hard work could be useful in business, there's little in the description to suggest a strong inclination towards business administration.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.6)**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy make this field seem like a strong fit. His appreciation for hard work and dedication also aligns well with these fields.
