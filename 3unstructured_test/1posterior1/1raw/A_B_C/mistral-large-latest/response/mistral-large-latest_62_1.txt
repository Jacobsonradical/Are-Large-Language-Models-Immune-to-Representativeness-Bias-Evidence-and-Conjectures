```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.6)**: Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest a good fit for computer science. However, his personality sketch also strongly indicates interests in other areas.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7)**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy, this field seems highly likely. His appreciation for hard work and dedication also aligns well with these fields.
- **Business Administration (0.2)**: While Adam's intelligence and understanding of hard work could be applicable, his personality sketch does not strongly indicate an interest in business-related topics. Therefore, the probability is lower for this field.
