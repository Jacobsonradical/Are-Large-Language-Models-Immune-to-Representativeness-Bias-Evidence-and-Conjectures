Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's field of study:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration (0.1)**: While Adam is intelligent, his interests seem to lie more in nature, animals, and puzzles rather than business-related topics.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.6)**: Given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as his empathy and appreciation for hard work, this field seems to align strongly with his interests.
- **Computer Science (0.3)**: Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts suggests he might find computer science appealing, but it's not as strongly indicated as agricultural and veterinary science.
