Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's field of study:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration**: Adam's personality traits do not strongly indicate an interest in business. Hence, the lowest probability is assigned to this field.
- **Computer Science**: Adam's aptitude for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts suggests he might be interested in computer science, but it's not the most aligned with his love for nature and animals.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field aligns most closely with Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, his love for animals, and his strong empathy. Therefore, it has the highest probability.
