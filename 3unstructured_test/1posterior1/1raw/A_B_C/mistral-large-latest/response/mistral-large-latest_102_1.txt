Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's field of study:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration**: Adam's personality traits do not strongly indicate an interest in business. Hence, the probability is relatively low at 0.1.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy, this field aligns well with his interests. Therefore, the probability is higher at 0.6.
- **Computer Science**: Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and his high intelligence suggest he might be interested in computer science, but it is not as strongly indicated as agricultural and veterinary science. Thus, the probability is 0.3.
