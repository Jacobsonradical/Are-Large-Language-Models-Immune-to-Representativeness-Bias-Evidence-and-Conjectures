- **Business Administration (0.1)**: While Adam appreciates hard work and dedication, there's little in the description that suggests a strong inclination towards business-related topics.
- **Computer Science (0.3)**: Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts could indicate an interest in computer science, but it's not as strongly suggested as the agricultural and veterinary science field.
