Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has interests and qualities that align well with studying agricultural and veterinary science, such as his curiosity about nature and plants, love of animals, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work. So I estimate a relatively high 70% probability that this was his field of graduate study.
