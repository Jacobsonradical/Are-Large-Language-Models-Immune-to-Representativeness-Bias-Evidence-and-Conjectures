Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has a strong interest in and empathy for animals and an appreciation for nature and plants. He is also intelligent and able to grasp abstract concepts well. These traits align closely with someone who would likely pursue graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. However, without more specific information about his undergraduate background and other interests, I cannot say with certainty that this was his field, so I estimate a 70% probability.
