Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.65"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as a deep empathy and love for animals specifically. He is also highly intelligent and able to understand abstract concepts well. These traits align well with a field of study like agricultural and veterinary science.

However, the information provided does not definitively state his field of graduate study, so I cannot say with certainty that he was enrolled in this specific program. The probability I provided is my best estimate given the details in the personality sketch. There is still a reasonable chance he may have been studying a different but potentially related field.
