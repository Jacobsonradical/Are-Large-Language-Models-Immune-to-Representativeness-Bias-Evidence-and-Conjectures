Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has interests and traits that align well with studying agricultural and veterinary science, including a curiosity about nature and plants, empathy and love for animals, high intelligence to understand abstract scientific concepts, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication which is important in these fields. So I estimate a 60% probability he was enrolled in this area of study. However, the sketch does not definitively state his field of study, so there is some uncertainty in the estimate.
