Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has traits and interests that align well with studying agricultural and veterinary science, such as his curiosity about nature and plants, his love for animals, his intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, and his appreciation for hard work and dedication. These qualities would serve him well in a field involving the study of plants, animals, and the natural world. Therefore, I estimate a relatively high probability of 0.7 that he was enrolled in this field of study.
