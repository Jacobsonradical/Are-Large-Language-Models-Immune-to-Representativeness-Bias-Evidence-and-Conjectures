Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have strong interests and qualities that align well with studying agricultural and veterinary science, including:

- Curiosity about nature and plants
- Love for animals and strong empathy 
- High intelligence to understand abstract scientific concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication typical in these fields

While it's impossible to say definitively, these traits suggest a relatively high probability, around 70%, that agricultural and veterinary science was his chosen field of graduate study. Of course, he could have potentially applied these interests and strengths to other fields as well.
