Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on his strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and his empathy and appreciation for hard work, I believe there is a relatively high probability (around 70%) that Adam was pursuing graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. His curiosity, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts also align well with this field of study. However, without more specific information about his academic background and stated interests, I cannot say with certainty that this was his chosen field.
