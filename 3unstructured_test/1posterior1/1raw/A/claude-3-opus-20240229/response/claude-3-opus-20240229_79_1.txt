Here is my estimate for the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has a strong interest in nature, plants, and a deep love for animals. He is also highly intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts. These traits align well with a field of study like agricultural and veterinary science.

However, without more specific information about his academic background and career goals, I cannot say with certainty that he was enrolled in this field. The probability of 0.7 reflects a reasonably high likelihood based on the given information, but acknowledges the uncertainty involved in making this determination.
