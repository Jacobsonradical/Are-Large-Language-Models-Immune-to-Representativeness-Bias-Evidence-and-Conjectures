Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and information about Adam:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, empathy and love for animals, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication all point towards a high likelihood that Adam was studying agricultural and veterinary science as a graduate student. However, without more specific information about his actual field of study, I cannot say this with certainty, hence the probability estimate of 0.7.
