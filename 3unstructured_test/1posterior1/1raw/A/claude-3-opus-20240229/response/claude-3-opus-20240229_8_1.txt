Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The subject's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, deep love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication all point towards a strong likelihood that they were pursuing graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. However, without more specific information about their academic background and interests, I cannot say with certainty that this was their field of study, hence the probability estimate of 0.7.
