Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has a strong interest in and affinity for nature, plants, and animals. His curiosity, empathy and love for animals in particular align well with pursuits in agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to grasp abstract concepts would also serve him well in this field of graduate study. Therefore, I estimate a relatively high 70% probability that this was his area of focus.
