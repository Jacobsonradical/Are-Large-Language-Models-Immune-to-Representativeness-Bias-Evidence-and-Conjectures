Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has traits and interests that align well with studying agricultural and veterinary science, such as his curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, intelligence, and appreciation of hard work. However, without more definitive information about his specific graduate program, I cannot say with certainty that he was enrolled in this field, so I estimate a 70% probability rather than a near-certain probability.
