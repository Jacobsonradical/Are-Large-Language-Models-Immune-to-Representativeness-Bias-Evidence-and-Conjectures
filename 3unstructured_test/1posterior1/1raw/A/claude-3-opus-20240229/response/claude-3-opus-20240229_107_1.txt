Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits of having a curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, high intelligence, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication seem very well aligned with studying agricultural and veterinary science. So I estimate a relatively high 70% probability that this was his field of graduate study in 2021. Of course, there are many other fields that could also fit his interests and talents, but agricultural and veterinary science seems like a strong possibility based on the information provided.
