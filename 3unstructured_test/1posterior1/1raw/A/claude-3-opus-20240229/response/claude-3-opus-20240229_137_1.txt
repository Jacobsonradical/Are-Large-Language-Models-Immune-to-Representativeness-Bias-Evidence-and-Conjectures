Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has interests and traits that align well with studying agricultural and veterinary science, including his curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, intelligence, and appreciation of hard work. However, without more specific information about his academic background and career goals, I cannot say with certainty that he was enrolled in this field. A probability estimate of 0.6 reflects that it seems likely given his profile, but there is still a significant chance he may have been studying something else.
