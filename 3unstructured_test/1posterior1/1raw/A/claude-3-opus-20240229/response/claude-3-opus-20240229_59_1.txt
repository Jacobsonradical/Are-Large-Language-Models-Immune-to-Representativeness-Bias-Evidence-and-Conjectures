Based on the personality sketch, Adam has interests and traits that align well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. His curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication all suggest a good fit for this area of study. While it's impossible to say definitively without more information, I estimate a relatively high 70% probability that agricultural and veterinary science was his field of graduate study in 2021.
