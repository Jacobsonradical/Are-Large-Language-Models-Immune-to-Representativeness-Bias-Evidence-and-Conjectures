Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as his intelligence, empathy and appreciation for hard work, I believe there is a fairly high probability (around 70%) that he was studying agricultural and veterinary science as a graduate student. His curiosity about plants and love of animals in particular seem well-aligned with this field of study. However, without more specific information about his academic background and interests, I cannot say with certainty that this was his chosen field.
