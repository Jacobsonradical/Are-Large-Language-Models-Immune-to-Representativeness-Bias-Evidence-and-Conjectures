Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits that align well with studying agricultural and veterinary science, such as his curiosity about nature and plants, his deep love for animals, his high intelligence in understanding abstract concepts, and his appreciation for hard work and dedication. Therefore, I estimate a relatively high 70% probability that he was enrolled in this field.
