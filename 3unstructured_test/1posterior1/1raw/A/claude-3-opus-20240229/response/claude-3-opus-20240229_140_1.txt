Here is my estimate for the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021 as a graduate student in the U.S., based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits of having a curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication all align well with pursuing graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. However, without more specific information about Adam's academic background and research interests, I cannot say with full certainty that this was his field of study, hence the probability estimate of 0.7.
