Based on the personality sketch provided, here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The key factors that influence this estimate are:

1. Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants
2. His deep love for animals
3. His strong empathy, which could translate well to working with animals
4. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, which are valuable in scientific fields

However, it's important to note that personality traits alone do not definitively determine a person's choice of study. Other factors, such as personal experiences, family background, and career goals, can also play significant roles in the decision-making process.
