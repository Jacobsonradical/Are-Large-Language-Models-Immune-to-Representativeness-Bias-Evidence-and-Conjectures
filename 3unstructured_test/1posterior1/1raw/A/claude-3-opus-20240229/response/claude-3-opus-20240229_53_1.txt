Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on the given personality sketch, Adam has traits and interests that align well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. His curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication all point toward a relatively high likelihood of him pursuing graduate studies in this area. However, without more specific information about his undergraduate background and other interests, I cannot say with certainty that he was enrolled in this particular field, hence my probability estimate of 0.7.
