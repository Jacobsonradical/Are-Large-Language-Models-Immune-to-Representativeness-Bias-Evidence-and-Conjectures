Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has interests and traits that align well with the agricultural and veterinary science field, such as his curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication. However, without more specific information about his academic background and career goals, I cannot say with certainty that he was enrolled in this field. Therefore, I estimate a probability of 0.6, indicating it is more likely than not based on the given information, but far from guaranteed.
