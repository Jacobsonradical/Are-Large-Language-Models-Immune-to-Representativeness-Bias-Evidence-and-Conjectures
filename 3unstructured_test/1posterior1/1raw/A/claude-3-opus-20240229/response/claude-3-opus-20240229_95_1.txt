Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has a strong interest in and appreciation for nature, plants, and animals. His empathy, love for animals, and ability to understand abstract concepts also align well with studying agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, I estimate there is a relatively high 70% probability he was enrolled in this field as a graduate student in 2021.
