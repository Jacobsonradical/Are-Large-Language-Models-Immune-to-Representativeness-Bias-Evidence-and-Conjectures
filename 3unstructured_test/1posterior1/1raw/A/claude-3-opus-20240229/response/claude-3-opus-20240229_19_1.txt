Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as empathy and a love for animals. He is also highly intelligent and has an appreciation for hard work. These traits align well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. However, without more specific information about his academic background and career goals, I cannot say with certainty that he pursued this field. Therefore, I estimate a 60% probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science as a graduate student in 2021.
