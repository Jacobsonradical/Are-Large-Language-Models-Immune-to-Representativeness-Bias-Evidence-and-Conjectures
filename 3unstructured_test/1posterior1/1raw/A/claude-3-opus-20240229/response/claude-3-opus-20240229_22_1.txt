{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest a reasonably high likelihood that Adam was pursuing graduate studies in a field related to agricultural and veterinary science. However, without more specific information about his academic background and interests, I cannot say with certainty that this was his chosen field of study.
