Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.75"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has a strong curiosity about nature, plants, and a deep love for animals. He is also highly intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts. These traits align well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science.

However, without more specific information about his academic background and interests, I cannot say with certainty that he was enrolled in this field. The probability of 0.75 reflects a high likelihood based on the given description, but allows for some uncertainty.
