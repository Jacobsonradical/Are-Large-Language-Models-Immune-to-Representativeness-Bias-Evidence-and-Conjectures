Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication. These traits align well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts would also serve him well in graduate-level studies in this field. So while it's impossible to say definitively without more information, I estimate a relatively high 70% probability that Adam was enrolled in an agricultural and veterinary science graduate program in 2021.
