Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has a strong interest in and appreciation for nature, plants, and animals. His curiosity, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts also point towards aptitude in a scientific field. Agricultural and veterinary science aligns well with these traits and interests. However, without more specific information about his undergraduate degree and other academic pursuits, I cannot say with certainty that this was his graduate field, hence my probability estimate of 0.7 rather than a higher figure.
