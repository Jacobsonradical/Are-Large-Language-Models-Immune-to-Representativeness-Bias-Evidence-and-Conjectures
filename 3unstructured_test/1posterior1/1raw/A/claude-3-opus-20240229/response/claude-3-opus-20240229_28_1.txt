Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has a strong interest in and aptitude for topics related to nature, plants, animals, and abstract concepts. These qualities align well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. However, without more specific information about his academic background and career interests, I cannot say with certainty that he was enrolled in this field. Therefore, I estimate a relatively high probability of 0.7 based on the limited information provided.
