Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The details in the personality sketch, such as Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, his deep love for animals, and his appreciation for hard work and dedication, strongly suggest that he would be interested in a field like agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also align well with graduate-level studies in this field. Therefore, I estimate a relatively high probability of 0.7 that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021.
