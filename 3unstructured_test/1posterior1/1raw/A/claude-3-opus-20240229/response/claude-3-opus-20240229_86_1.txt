Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, his deep love for animals, his high intelligence, and his appreciation for hard work and dedication, there seems to be a reasonably high probability that he was enrolled in an agricultural and veterinary science graduate program. His personality traits and interests align well with this field of study. However, without more specific information about his academic background and career goals, I cannot say with certainty that this was his chosen field, hence my probability estimate of 0.7.
