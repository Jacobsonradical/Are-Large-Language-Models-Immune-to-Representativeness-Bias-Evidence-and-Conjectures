{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on the details provided in Adam's personality sketch, including his curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, I believe there is a relatively high probability (around 70%) that he was pursuing graduate studies in the field of agricultural and veterinary science.
