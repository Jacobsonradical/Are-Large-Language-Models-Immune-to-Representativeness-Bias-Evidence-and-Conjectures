Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has a strong interest in and empathy for nature, plants, and animals. His curiosity, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts also point towards an aptitude for sciences. While this profile could fit a few different fields of graduate study, agricultural and veterinary science seems to be the most likely match given his specific interests and traits. That said, without more definitive information, I cannot say with certainty, so I estimate the probability to be around 0.7 or 70%.
