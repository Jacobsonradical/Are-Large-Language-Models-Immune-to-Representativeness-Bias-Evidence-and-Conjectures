Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.75"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has a strong interest in and love for nature, plants and animals. His curiosity, empathy and intelligence would align well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. So while it's impossible to say definitively, I believe there is a high probability, around 75%, that this was his chosen field of graduate study.
