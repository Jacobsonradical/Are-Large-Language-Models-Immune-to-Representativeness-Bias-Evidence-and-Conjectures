Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has a strong interest in and appreciation for nature, plants, and animals. His curiosity, empathy and love for animals in particular suggest a high likelihood that he would pursue studies related to veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts are also qualities that would serve him well in a scientific field like agricultural or veterinary studies. So while we can't say for certain, I estimate around an 80% probability that Adam was enrolled in an agricultural and veterinary science graduate program given his interests and attributes.
