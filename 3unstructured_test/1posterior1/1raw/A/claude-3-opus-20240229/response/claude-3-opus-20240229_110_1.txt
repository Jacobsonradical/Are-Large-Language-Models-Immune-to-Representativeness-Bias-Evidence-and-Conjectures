Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has a strong interest in and affinity for nature, plants, and animals. His curiosity, empathy and love for animals in particular suggest a high likelihood that he would pursue studies related to animals and veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also align well with graduate-level studies in a scientific field. So while not certain, I estimate a fairly high 70% probability that Adam's graduate studies were in the agricultural and veterinary science domain.
