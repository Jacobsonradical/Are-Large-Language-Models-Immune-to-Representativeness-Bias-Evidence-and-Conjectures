Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has a strong interest in and appreciation for nature, plants, and animals. His curiosity, empathy and love for animals suggest he would be drawn to a field involving the study and care of living things. Agricultural and veterinary science aligns well with these traits and interests. While it's certainly possible he pursued a different field, I estimate a relatively high 70% probability that this was his chosen area of graduate study given the information provided.
