Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has interests and traits that align well with studying agricultural and veterinary science, including a curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, high intelligence, and an appreciation for hard work. While it's impossible to say definitively, I estimate a fairly high 70% probability that he was enrolled in this field as a graduate student given the information provided.
