Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has a keen interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as a strong sense of empathy. He is also described as highly intelligent and able to grasp abstract concepts well. These traits align well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science.

However, without more specific information about his academic background, research interests, or career goals, I cannot say with certainty that he was enrolled in this particular field. The probability I provided is my best estimate given the limited information available.
