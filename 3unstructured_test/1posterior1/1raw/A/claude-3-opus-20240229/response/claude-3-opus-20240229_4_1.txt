Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has qualities and interests that align well with the agricultural and veterinary science field, such as his curiosity about nature and plants, his love for animals, his intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, and his appreciation for hard work and dedication. While it's impossible to say for certain without more information, I believe there is a relatively high probability, around 0.7 or 70%, that Adam was studying agricultural and veterinary science as a graduate student in 2021 given his described traits and interests.
