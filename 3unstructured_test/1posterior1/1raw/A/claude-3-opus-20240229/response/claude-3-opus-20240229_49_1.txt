Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as a deep empathy and love for animals. He is also described as highly intelligent and able to understand abstract concepts well. These traits align well with a potential interest and aptitude for agricultural and veterinary science.

However, without more specific information about Adam's academic background, research interests, or career aspirations, I cannot say with certainty that he was enrolled in this particular field. The probability I provided is my best estimate based on the limited information in the personality sketch.
