Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has a strong interest in and empathy for nature, plants, and animals. His curiosity, intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts also align well with the skills and interests that would be valuable in agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, I estimate a relatively high probability of 0.7 that he was enrolled in this field.
