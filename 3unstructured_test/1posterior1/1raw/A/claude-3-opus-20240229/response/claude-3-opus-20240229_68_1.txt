Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has a strong interest in and appreciation for nature, plants, and animals. His curiosity, empathy and love for animals in particular suggest he would be drawn to fields related to animal science and care. Agricultural and veterinary science aligns well with these traits and interests. However, without more specific information about his undergraduate degree and other details, I cannot say with certainty that this was his graduate field, so I estimate a 70% probability.
