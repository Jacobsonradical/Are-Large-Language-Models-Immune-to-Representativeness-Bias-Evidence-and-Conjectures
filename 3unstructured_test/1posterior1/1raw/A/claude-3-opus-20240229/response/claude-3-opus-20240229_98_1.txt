Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has a strong interest in and love for nature, plants, and animals. He is also highly intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts. These traits align well with a graduate field of study in agricultural and veterinary science. While the sketch doesn't conclusively prove this was his field, I believe there is a high probability, around 80%, that he was enrolled in an agricultural and veterinary science graduate program given his described interests and attributes.
