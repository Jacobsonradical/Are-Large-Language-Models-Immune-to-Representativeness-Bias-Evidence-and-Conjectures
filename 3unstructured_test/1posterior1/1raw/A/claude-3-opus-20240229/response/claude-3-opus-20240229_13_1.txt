Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021 as a graduate student in the U.S., based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has a strong interest in and appreciation for nature, plants, and animals. His curiosity, empathy, and love for animals in particular point towards a potential fit with veterinary science. His high intelligence and ability to grasp abstract concepts would also align well with graduate-level studies in the agricultural and veterinary sciences. Therefore, I estimate a relatively high 70% probability that this was his field of graduate study in 2021.
