Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has a strong interest in and appreciation for nature, plants, and animals. His curiosity, empathy and love for animals, along with his intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, align well with pursuing graduate studies in a field like agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, I estimate a relatively high probability of 0.7 that this was his field of study.
