Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has a strong interest in and appreciation for nature, plants, and animals. His deep love for animals, combined with his curiosity about nature and its various plants, makes it quite likely that he would pursue a field related to agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also align well with graduate-level studies in this field. Therefore, I estimate a relatively high probability of 0.7 that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021.
