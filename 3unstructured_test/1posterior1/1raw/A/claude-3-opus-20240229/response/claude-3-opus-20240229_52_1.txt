Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have interests and traits that align well with studying agricultural and veterinary science, including curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, high intelligence, and an appreciation for hard work. However, without more specific information about his academic background and goals, I cannot say with certainty that he was enrolled in that particular field. Therefore, I estimate a 60% probability that he was studying agricultural and veterinary science as a graduate student in 2021.
