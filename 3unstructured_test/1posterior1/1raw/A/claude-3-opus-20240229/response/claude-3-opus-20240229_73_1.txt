Here is my estimate for the probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam has a strong interest in and love for nature, plants, and animals. His curiosity, empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication also align well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. While his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could lend themselves to various fields, I estimate there is a reasonably high probability of around 0.7 that he chose to pursue graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science given his specific interests and traits.
