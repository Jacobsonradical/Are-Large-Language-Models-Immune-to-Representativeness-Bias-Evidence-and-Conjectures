Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has traits and interests that align well with studying agricultural and veterinary science, such as his curiosity about nature and plants, his love for animals, his intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, and his appreciation for hard work and dedication. These qualities suggest a relatively high probability that he would pursue graduate studies in this field. However, without more specific information about his undergraduate background and other interests, I cannot say with certainty that agricultural and veterinary science was his chosen field of graduate study. Therefore, I estimate the probability to be around 0.7 or 70%.
