Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"

Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam has a strong interest in and empathy for nature, plants and animals. His curiosity, intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also align well with scientific fields. Given these traits and interests, I believe there is a relatively high probability, around 70%, that Adam was pursuing graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science.
