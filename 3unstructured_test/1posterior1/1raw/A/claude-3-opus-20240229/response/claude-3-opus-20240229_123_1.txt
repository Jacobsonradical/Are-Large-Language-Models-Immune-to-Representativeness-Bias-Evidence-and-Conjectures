Based on the given personality sketch, here is my estimate:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The subject's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, combined with his deep love for animals and high intelligence, suggests a strong likelihood that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. His empathy and appreciation for hard work and dedication also align well with this field. However, without more specific information about his academic background and interests, there is still some uncertainty, so I estimate the probability to be around 0.7.
