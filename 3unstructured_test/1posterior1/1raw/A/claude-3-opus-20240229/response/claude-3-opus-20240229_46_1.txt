Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has several traits and interests that align well with studying agricultural and veterinary science, including his curiosity about nature and plants, his deep love for animals, his high intelligence, and his appreciation for hard work and dedication. Therefore, I estimate a relatively high 70% probability that he was enrolled in this field of study as a graduate student.
