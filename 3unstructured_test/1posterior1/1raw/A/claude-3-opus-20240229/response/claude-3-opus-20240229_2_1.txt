Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.75"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has a strong interest in and empathy for animals, appreciates nature and plants, and has high intelligence - all traits that align well with studying agricultural and veterinary science. While it's certainly possible he may have been studying a different field, I believe there is a reasonably high probability of around 75% that this was his area of graduate study given his stated interests and attributes.
