Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, intelligence, and appreciation of hard work and dedication suggest a reasonably high likelihood that Adam's graduate studies aligned with agricultural and veterinary science. However, without more specific information about his academic background and interests, I cannot say with certainty, so I estimate the probability as 0.7.
