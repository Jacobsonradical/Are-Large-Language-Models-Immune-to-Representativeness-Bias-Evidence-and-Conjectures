Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has traits and interests that align well with studying agricultural and veterinary science, such as his curiosity about nature and plants, his empathy and love for animals, his intelligence in understanding abstract concepts, and his appreciation for hard work and dedication. These qualities suggest a reasonably high probability that he would choose to study in this field. However, without more specific information about his academic background and career goals, I cannot say with certainty that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, so I estimate the probability to be around 70%.
