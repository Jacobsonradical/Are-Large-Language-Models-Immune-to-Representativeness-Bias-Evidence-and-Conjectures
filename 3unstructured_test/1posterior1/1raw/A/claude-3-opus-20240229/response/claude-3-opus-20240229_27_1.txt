Based on the given personality sketch, here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The key factors influencing this estimate are:

1. Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants
2. His deep love for animals
3. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts
4. His appreciation for hard work and dedication

These traits align well with the requirements and interests of someone likely to pursue agricultural and veterinary science. However, without more specific information about his academic background and career goals, there is still some uncertainty, which is why I have assigned a probability of 0.7 rather than a higher value.
