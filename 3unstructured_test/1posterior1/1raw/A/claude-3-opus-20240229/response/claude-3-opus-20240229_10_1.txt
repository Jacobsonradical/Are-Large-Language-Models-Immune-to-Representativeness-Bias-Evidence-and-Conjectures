Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on his interests in nature, plants, animals, and his empathetic personality, I believe there is a relatively high probability that Adam was studying agricultural and veterinary science as a graduate student. His curiosity, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication also align well with this field of study. However, without more specific information, I cannot say with certainty, so I estimate the probability to be around 70%.
