Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.75"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has a strong curiosity about nature, plants, and animals. He is empathetic and loves animals. He is also intelligent and appreciates hard work and dedication. These traits align well with someone who would be drawn to studying agricultural and veterinary science. So while it's not certain, I estimate a relatively high 75% probability that this was his field of graduate study in 2021.
