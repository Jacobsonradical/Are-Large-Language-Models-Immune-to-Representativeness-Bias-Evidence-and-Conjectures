Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has a strong interest in and empathy for nature, plants and animals. He is also highly intelligent and dedicated. These traits align well with someone who would likely pursue graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. However, without more specific information about his undergraduate degree and other academic pursuits, I can't say with certainty that he was in this field, so I estimate a 70% probability rather than a near-certainty.
