Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has interests and traits that align well with studying agricultural and veterinary science, such as his curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work. So I think there is a relatively high probability, around 70%, that this was his field of graduate study in 2021. However, the sketch does not definitively state his area of study, so I cannot say with certainty that this was his field.
