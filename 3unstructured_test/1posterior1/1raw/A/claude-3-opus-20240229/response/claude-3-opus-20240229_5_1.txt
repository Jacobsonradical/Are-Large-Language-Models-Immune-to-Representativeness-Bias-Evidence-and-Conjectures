Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.75"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has traits and interests that align well with studying agricultural and veterinary science, such as his curiosity about nature and plants, his love for animals, his intelligence, and his appreciation for hard work. So I think there is a fairly high probability, around 75%, that this was his field of graduate study.
