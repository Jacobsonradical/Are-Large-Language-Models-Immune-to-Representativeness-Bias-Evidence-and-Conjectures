Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on his genuine curiosity about nature and plants, deep love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, I believe there is a relatively high probability (around 70%) that Adam was pursuing graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. His interests and traits seem well-aligned with that field of study.
