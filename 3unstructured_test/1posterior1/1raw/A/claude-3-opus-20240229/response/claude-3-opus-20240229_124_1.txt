Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.75"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has a strong interest in and empathy for animals and plants, as well as an aptitude for science and abstract concepts. These traits align well with a field of study like agricultural and veterinary science. However, without more specific information about his academic background and career goals, I cannot say with certainty that he was enrolled in this field, hence my probability estimate of 0.75.
