Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has a strong interest in and empathy for animals, as well as a curiosity about plants and nature. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts would serve him well in a scientific field. Agricultural and veterinary science aligns well with these traits, as it involves the study of animals, plants, and the natural world, and requires strong analytical and problem-solving skills. Therefore, I estimate a relatively high probability of 0.7 that Adam was enrolled in this field.
