Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has a strong interest in and empathy for nature, plants, and animals. He is also highly intelligent and able to understand abstract concepts well. Given these traits, along with his appreciation for hard work and dedication, I believe there is a fairly high probability (around 70%) that Adam was studying agricultural and veterinary science as a graduate student in 2021. His curiosity, warmth and problem-solving skills would serve him well in this field. However, without more specific information about his academic background and research interests, I cannot say with certainty that this was his field of study.
