Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.75"
}

Based on his interests in nature, plants, animals, and his empathetic personality, I believe there is a relatively high probability that Adam was studying agricultural and veterinary science. His abstract thinking skills and intelligence also align well with graduate-level studies in this field. However, without more specific information, I cannot say with certainty that this was his area of study, hence the probability estimate of 0.75.
