Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has qualities and interests that align well with studying agricultural and veterinary science, such as his curiosity about nature and plants, his love for animals, his intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, and his appreciation for hard work and dedication. These traits are highly relevant to that field of study. Therefore, I estimate a relatively high probability of 0.7 that he was enrolled in an agricultural and veterinary science graduate program.
