Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021 as a graduate student in the U.S., based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has a strong interest in and empathy for animals, as well as a curiosity about nature and plants. These traits align well with graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts would also serve him well in this field. Therefore, I estimate a relatively high probability of 0.7 that he was enrolled in an agricultural and veterinary science graduate program.
