Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam has a strong interest in and empathy for nature, plants, and animals. He is also intelligent and appreciates hard work and dedication. Given these traits, there is a reasonably high probability that he would choose to study agricultural and veterinary science. However, without more specific information about his academic background and career goals, I cannot say with certainty that this was his field of graduate study. Therefore, I estimate the probability to be around 0.7 or 70%.
