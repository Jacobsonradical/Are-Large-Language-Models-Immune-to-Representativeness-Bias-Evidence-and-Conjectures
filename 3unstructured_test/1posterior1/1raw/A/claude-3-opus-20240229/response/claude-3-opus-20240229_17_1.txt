Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has a strong interest in and empathy for nature, plants, and animals. He is also described as highly intelligent and able to understand abstract concepts well. Given these traits and interests, I believe there is a relatively high probability, around 0.7 or 70%, that Adam was studying agricultural and veterinary science as a graduate student.
