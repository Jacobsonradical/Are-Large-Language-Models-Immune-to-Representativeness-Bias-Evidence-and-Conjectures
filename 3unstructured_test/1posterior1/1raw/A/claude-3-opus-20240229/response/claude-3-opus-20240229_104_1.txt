Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has interests and traits that align well with studying agricultural and veterinary science, such as his curiosity about nature and plants, his love for animals, his intelligence, and his appreciation for hard work. While it's impossible to say for certain, I believe there is a reasonably high probability, around 70%, that he was enrolled in this field of study.
