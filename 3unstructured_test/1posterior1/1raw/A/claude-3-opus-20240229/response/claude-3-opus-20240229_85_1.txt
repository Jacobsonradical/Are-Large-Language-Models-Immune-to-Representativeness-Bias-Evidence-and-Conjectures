Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has a strong interest in and empathy for animals and plants, as well as an aptitude for science and understanding abstract concepts. This combination of traits and interests suggests a relatively high probability that he would pursue graduate studies in a field related to agricultural and veterinary science.
