Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has qualities and interests that align well with the agricultural and veterinary science field, such as a curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, high intelligence, and an appreciation for hard work. However, without more specific information about his academic background and career goals, I cannot say with certainty that he was enrolled in this field, so I estimate a 70% probability rather than a near-definite probability.
