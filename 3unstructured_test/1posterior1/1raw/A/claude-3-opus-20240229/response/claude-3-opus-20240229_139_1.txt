Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has interests and traits that align well with studying agricultural and veterinary science, including a curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, high intelligence, and an appreciation for hard work. These all suggest a fairly high likelihood that he would pursue graduate studies in this field. However, without more specific information about his undergraduate background and other academic interests, I cannot say with certainty that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, so I estimate the probability at 0.7.
