Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication seem very well aligned with studying agricultural and veterinary science. So I believe there is a fairly high probability, around 0.7, that this was Adam's field of graduate study in 2021 based on the information provided.
