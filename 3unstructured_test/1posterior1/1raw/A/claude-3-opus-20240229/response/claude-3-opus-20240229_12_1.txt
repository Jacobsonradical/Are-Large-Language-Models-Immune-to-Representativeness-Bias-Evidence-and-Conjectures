Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.65"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has traits and interests that align well with the agricultural and veterinary science field, such as his curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, intelligence, and appreciation of hard work. However, without more specific information about his academic background and career goals, I cannot say with certainty that he pursued graduate studies in this area, so I estimate a probability of 0.65 rather than a higher value closer to 1.
