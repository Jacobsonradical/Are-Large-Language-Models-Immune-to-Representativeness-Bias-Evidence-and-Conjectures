Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The key factors that suggest a high probability of Adam being in this field are his curiosity about nature and plants, his deep love for animals, his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, and his appreciation for hard work and dedication. These traits align well with what is needed to succeed in agricultural and veterinary science. However, without more definitive information about his specific interests and academic background, I cannot say with certainty that he was in this field, hence the probability estimate of 0.7.
