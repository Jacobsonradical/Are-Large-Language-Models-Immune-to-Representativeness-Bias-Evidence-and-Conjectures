{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature and plants, deep love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest a high probability that they were enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. However, without more specific information about their academic interests and background, I cannot say with certainty that this was their field of study.
