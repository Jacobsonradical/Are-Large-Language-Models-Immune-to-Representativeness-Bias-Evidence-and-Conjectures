Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch indicates that Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication. These traits align well with someone who might pursue graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. However, without more specific information about Adam's academic background and interests, I cannot say with certainty that he was enrolled in this particular field. Therefore, I estimate a relatively high probability of 0.7, but not a near-certainty.
