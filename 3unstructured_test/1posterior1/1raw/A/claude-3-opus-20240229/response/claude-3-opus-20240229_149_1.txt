Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation of hard work and dedication align well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. However, without more specific information about Adam's academic interests and background, I cannot say with certainty that he was enrolled in this field, hence the probability estimate of 0.7.
