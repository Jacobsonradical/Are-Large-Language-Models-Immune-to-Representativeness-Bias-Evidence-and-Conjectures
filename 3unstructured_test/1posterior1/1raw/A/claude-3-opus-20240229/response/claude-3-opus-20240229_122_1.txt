Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has interests and traits that align well with studying agricultural and veterinary science, such as his curiosity about nature and plants, his love for animals, his intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, and his appreciation for hard work and dedication. Agricultural and veterinary science would allow him to deeply explore these interests. Therefore, I estimate a relatively high 70% probability that this was his field of graduate study in 2021.
