Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits that align well with studying agricultural and veterinary science, such as his curiosity about nature and plants, his love for animals, his intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, and his appreciation for hard work and dedication. However, without more specific information about his academic background and career goals, I cannot say with certainty that he pursued this field. Therefore, I estimate a probability of 0.6, indicating it is more likely than not based on the given information, but not a near certainty.
