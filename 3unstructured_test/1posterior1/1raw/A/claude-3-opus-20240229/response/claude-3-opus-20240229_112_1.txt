Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has a strong interest in and love for nature, plants, and animals. He is also described as highly intelligent and able to understand abstract concepts well. These traits align with someone who may be drawn to studying agricultural and veterinary science. However, without more specific information about his academic background and stated interests, I cannot say with certainty that he was enrolled in this field. Therefore, I estimate a relatively high probability of 0.7 that he was studying agricultural and veterinary science, based on the details provided.
