Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.75"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals. He is empathetic, loves animals, and appreciates hard work and dedication. These traits align well with studying agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts would also serve him well in this field of graduate study. Therefore, I estimate a relatively high 75% probability that Adam was enrolled in an agricultural and veterinary science graduate program in 2021.
