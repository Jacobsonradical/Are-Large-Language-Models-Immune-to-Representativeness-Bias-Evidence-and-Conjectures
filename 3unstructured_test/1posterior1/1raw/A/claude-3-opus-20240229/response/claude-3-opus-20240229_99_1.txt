{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits that align well with studying agricultural and veterinary science, such as his curiosity about nature and plants, his love for animals, his intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, and his appreciation for hard work and dedication. Therefore, I estimate a relatively high probability of 0.7 that he was enrolled in this field.
