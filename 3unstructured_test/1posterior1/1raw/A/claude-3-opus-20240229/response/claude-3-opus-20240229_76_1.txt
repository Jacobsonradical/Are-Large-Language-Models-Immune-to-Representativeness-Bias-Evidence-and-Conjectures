{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"

Given his curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation of hard work and dedication, I believe there is a strong likelihood (around 70%) that Adam was pursuing graduate studies in a field related to agricultural and veterinary science. His interests and traits align well with this area of study.
