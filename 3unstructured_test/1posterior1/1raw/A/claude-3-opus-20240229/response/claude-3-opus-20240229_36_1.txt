Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has traits and interests that align well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. His curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication all point towards a relatively high likelihood of him pursuing graduate studies in this area. However, without more specific information about his undergraduate background and other interests, there is still some uncertainty, which is why I estimated the probability at 0.7 rather than higher.
