Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has qualities and interests that align well with the agricultural and veterinary science field, such as his curiosity about nature and plants, his love for animals, his strong empathy, and his appreciation for hard work and dedication. These traits suggest a relatively high probability that he would pursue graduate studies in this area. However, without more specific information about his undergraduate background and other academic interests, I cannot say with certainty that agricultural and veterinary science was his chosen field, so I estimate the probability to be around 70%.
