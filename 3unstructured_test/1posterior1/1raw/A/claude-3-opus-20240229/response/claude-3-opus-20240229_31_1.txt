Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has a strong interest in and compassion for nature, plants, and animals, as well as an aptitude for science and abstract concepts. These traits align well with a graduate field of study in agricultural and veterinary science. However, without more specific information about his academic background and research interests, I cannot say with certainty that this was his field, so I estimate a 70% probability.
