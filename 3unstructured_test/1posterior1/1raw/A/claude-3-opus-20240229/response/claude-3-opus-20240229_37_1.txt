Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam has a strong interest in and aptitude for topics related to nature, plants, animals, and abstract thinking. These qualities align well with a field of study like agricultural and veterinary science. So while it's impossible to say for certain without more information, I believe there is a fairly high probability, around 70%, that this was his area of graduate study in the U.S. in 2021.
