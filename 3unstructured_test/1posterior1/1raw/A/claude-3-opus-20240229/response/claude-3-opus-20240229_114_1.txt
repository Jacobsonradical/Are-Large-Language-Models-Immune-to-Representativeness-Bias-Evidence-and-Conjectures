Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has a strong interest in and empathy for nature, plants, and animals. He is also intelligent and enjoys understanding abstract concepts. These traits align well with pursuing graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. However, without more specific information about his undergraduate background and research interests, I cannot say with certainty that he was in this field. Therefore, I estimate a 70% probability that Adam was a graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021.
