Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest a strong fit and likelihood that he was studying agricultural and veterinary science. However, without more specific information about his academic background and interests, I cannot say with certainty, so I estimate the probability to be around 70%.
