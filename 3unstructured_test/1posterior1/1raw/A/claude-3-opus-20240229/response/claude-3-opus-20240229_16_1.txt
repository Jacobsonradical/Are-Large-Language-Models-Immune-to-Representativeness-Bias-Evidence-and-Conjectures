Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication all align well with a field of study like agricultural and veterinary science. However, without more specific information about Adam's academic interests and background, I cannot say with certainty that this was his field of graduate study. Therefore, I estimate a relatively high probability of 0.7 that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, while allowing for the possibility that he may have pursued a different field that also fits his personality profile.
