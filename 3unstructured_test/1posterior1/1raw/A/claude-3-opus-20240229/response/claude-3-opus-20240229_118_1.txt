Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has a strong interest in and empathy for nature, plants, and animals. He is also highly intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts. These traits align well with the field of agricultural and veterinary science. While it's impossible to say for certain without more information, I believe there is a relatively high probability, around 0.7, that Adam was pursuing graduate studies in this field.
