Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has traits and interests that align well with studying agricultural and veterinary science, such as his curiosity about nature and plants, his love for animals, his strong empathy, and his appreciation for hard work. His high intelligence would also enable him to succeed in a challenging graduate program in this field. Therefore, I estimate a relatively high probability of 0.7 that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
