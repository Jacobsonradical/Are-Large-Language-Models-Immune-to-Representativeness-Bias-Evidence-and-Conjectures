Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has interests and traits that align well with studying agricultural and veterinary science, such as his curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, intelligence, and appreciation of hard work. So while it's impossible to say for certain without more information, I believe there is a reasonably high probability, around 0.7, that this was his field of graduate study.
