Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits and interests described, such as curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, seem well-aligned with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. However, without more specific information about Adam's academic background and career goals, I cannot say with certainty that this was his field of study, hence the probability estimate of 0.7.
