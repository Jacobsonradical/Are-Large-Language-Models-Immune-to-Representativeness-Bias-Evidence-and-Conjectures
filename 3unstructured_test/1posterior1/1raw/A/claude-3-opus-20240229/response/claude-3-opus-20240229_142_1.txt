Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has a strong interest in and empathy for nature, plants, and animals. He is also highly intelligent and able to understand abstract concepts well. Given these traits, along with his appreciation for hard work and dedication, I believe there is a relatively high probability (around 70%) that Adam chose to pursue graduate studies in a field related to agricultural and veterinary science.
