Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has interests and traits that align well with the agricultural and veterinary science field, such as his curiosity about nature and plants, his love for animals, his intelligence in understanding abstract concepts, and his appreciation for hard work and dedication. These qualities suggest a relatively high probability that he chose to study agricultural and veterinary science. However, without more specific information about his academic background and career goals, I cannot say with certainty that this was his chosen field of graduate study, hence the probability estimate of 0.7.
