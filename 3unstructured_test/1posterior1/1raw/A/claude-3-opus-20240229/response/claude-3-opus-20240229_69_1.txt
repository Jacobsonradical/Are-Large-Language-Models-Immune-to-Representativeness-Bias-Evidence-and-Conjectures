Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have interests and traits that align well with studying agricultural and veterinary science, such as his curiosity about nature and plants, his love for animals, his intelligence in understanding abstract concepts, and his appreciation for hard work and dedication. These qualities suggest a relatively high probability that he would choose to study in this field. However, without more specific information about his academic background and goals, I cannot say with certainty that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, which is why I estimate the probability to be 0.7 rather than higher.
