Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has a strong interest in and love for nature, plants and animals. His curiosity, empathy and intelligence also align well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. While it's impossible to say for certain without more information, I believe there is a relatively high probability, around 0.7 or 70%, that this was his field of graduate study given his background and traits.
