Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has a strong interest in and appreciation for nature, plants, and animals. His empathy, love for animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication also align well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. While his intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could lend themselves to many fields, I estimate a relatively high 70% probability that he was pursuing graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science given his overall profile and interests.
