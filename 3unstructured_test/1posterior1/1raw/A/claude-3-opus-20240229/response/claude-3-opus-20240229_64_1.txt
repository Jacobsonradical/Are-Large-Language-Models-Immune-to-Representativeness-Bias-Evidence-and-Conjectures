{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"

Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam has interests and traits that align well with studying agricultural and veterinary science, including his curiosity about nature and plants, his love for animals, his intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, and his appreciation for hard work and dedication. While it's impossible to say for certain without more information, I believe there is a reasonably high probability of around 70% that Adam was pursuing graduate studies in this field.
