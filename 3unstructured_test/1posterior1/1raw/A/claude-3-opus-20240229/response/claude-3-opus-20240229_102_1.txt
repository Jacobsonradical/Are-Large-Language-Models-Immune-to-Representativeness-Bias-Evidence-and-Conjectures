Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has a strong interest in and appreciation for nature, plants, and animals. His empathy, love for animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication also point towards him potentially studying a field related to agriculture, plants, or veterinary science. However, without more specific information about his academic background and interests, I cannot say with certainty that he studied agricultural and veterinary science, so I estimate the probability to be relatively high at 0.7 but not definitive.
