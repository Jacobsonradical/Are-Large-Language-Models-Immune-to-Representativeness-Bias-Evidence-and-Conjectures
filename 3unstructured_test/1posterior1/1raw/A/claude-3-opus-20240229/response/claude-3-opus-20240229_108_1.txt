Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have a strong interest in and appreciation for nature, plants, and animals. His empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature all point towards a higher likelihood of him pursuing a field related to agriculture, plants, or veterinary science. However, without more specific information about his academic background and career goals, I cannot say with certainty that he was enrolled in this field, so I estimate the probability to be around 0.7 or 70%.
