Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has traits and interests that align well with studying agricultural and veterinary science, such as his love for animals, curiosity about plants and nature, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work. However, without more specific information about his academic background and goals, I cannot say with very high confidence that he was enrolled in that particular field. An estimated probability of 60% reflects a likelihood that is higher than a coinflip based on the relevant details provided, but far from certain given the limited information available.
