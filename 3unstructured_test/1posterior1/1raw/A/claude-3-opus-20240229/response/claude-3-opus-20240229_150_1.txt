Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has a strong interest in and appreciation for nature, plants, and animals. His curiosity, empathy, and love for animals, combined with his intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, align well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, I estimate a relatively high probability of 0.7 that he was enrolled in this field as a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021.
