Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has interests and traits that align well with studying agricultural and veterinary science, such as his curiosity about nature and plants, his love for animals, his intelligence in understanding abstract concepts, and his appreciation for hard work and dedication. These qualities suggest a reasonably high probability that he would pursue graduate studies in this field. However, without more specific information about his undergraduate background and other academic interests, I cannot say with near certainty that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
