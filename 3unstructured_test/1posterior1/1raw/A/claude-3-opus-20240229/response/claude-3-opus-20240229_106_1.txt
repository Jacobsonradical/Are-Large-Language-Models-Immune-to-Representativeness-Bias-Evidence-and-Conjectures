Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has a strong interest in and appreciation for nature, plants, and animals. His curiosity, empathy and love for animals in particular suggest a high likelihood that he would pursue studies related to animal health and agriculture. While his intelligence and aptitude for abstract concepts could point to other fields as well, I believe the details provided make agricultural and veterinary science the most probable area of graduate study for Adam, with an estimated probability around 0.7.
