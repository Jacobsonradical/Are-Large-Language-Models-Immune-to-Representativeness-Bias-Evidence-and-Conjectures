Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits that align well with studying agricultural and veterinary science, such as:

- Curiosity about nature and plants
- Love for animals and strong empathy 
- High intelligence to understand abstract scientific concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication, which is needed in these fields

So while it's impossible to say for certain based on this limited information, I estimate a relatively high 70% probability that Adam was pursuing graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality profile. However, there are certainly other fields he could have been studying as well.
