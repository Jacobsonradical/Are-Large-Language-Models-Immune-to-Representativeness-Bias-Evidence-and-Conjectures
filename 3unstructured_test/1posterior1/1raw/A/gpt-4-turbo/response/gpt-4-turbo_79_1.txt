Given Adam's strong interest in nature and plants, as well as his love for animals, it is highly plausible that he would choose a field that aligns closely with these interests. Agricultural and veterinary science both closely relate to his described passions and attributes. However, considering the broad spectrum of possible graduate fields and the specificity of interests needed to choose a particular field, one must also acknowledge the possibility of other related fields such as environmental science, biology, or even zoology. Thus, while there is a good probability of him choosing agricultural and veterinary science, it would not account for all potential options. Therefore, I estimate:
