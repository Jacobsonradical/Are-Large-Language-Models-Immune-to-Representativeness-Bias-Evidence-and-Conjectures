Given Adam's deep love for animals, genuine curiosity about nature and plants, and his strong appreciation for hard work and dedication, it is reasonable to estimate a relatively high probability that he could be enrolled in a field like agricultural and veterinary science. His interest in abstract concepts and high intelligence could align well with the need for critical thinking and problem-solving in these fields. Therefore, I would estimate a 40% probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science during his graduate studies in 2021.
