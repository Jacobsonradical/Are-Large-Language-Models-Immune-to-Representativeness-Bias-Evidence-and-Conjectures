  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4
}

Agricultural and veterinary science would align well with his curiosity about nature and animals. The probability I've provided reflects a reasonably high likelihood but acknowledges that his intelligence and abstract thinking skills could also lead him to other fields.
