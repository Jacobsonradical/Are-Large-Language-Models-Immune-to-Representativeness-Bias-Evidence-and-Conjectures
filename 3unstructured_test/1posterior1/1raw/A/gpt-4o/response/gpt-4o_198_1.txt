  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, his empathy and love for animals, and his appreciation for hard work and dedication, it is likely that he would be very drawn to a field that involves working with plants and animals. Agricultural and veterinary science fits well with his interests and personality traits, making it a strong possibility for his field of study. Therefore, I estimate a probability of 0.7.
