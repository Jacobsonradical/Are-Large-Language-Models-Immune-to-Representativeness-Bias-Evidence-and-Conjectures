  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.2"
}

Given Adam's deep love for animals, genuine curiosity about nature and plants, and strong empathy, it is plausible that he could be drawn to a field like agricultural and veterinary science. However, his high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts suggest he could also be successful in a variety of other fields, so the estimate is relatively moderate.
