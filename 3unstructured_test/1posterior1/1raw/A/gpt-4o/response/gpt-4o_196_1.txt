Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam exhibits characteristics that are highly compatible with fields related to nature, animals, and a deep understanding of various plants. Given his strong empathy and love for animals, as well as his appreciation for hard work and dedication, it is indeed plausible that he chose a field like agricultural and veterinary science. Additionally, his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with the kind of complex problem-solving and critical thinking required in these fields.

Here's my estimate for the probability:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
