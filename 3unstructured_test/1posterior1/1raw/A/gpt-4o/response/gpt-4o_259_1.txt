Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and his deep love for animals, it is likely that he would be drawn to fields that align closely with his interests and empathic qualities. Agricultural and veterinary science would potentially be a good fit for someone with these traits. However, his interest in puzzles and abstract concepts might also lead him to other fields, which is why the probability is not extremely high but is still significant.
