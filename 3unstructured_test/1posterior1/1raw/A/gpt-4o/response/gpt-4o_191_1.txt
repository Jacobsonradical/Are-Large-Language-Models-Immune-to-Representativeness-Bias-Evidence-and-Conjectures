  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.25
}

Given Adam's deep love for animals, genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, and strong empathy, there is a reasonable chance that he would gravitate towards a field where he can interact with animals and nature. Agricultural and veterinary science aligns well with these interests. However, since there are many other fields that could also match his description (e.g., biology, environmental science), I estimate the probability around 0.25.
