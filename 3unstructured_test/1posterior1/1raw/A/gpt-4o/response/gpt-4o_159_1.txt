  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.35
}

Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, it is reasonable to estimate that he would have a relatively high probability of being enrolled in a field like agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts further support this likelihood, as these traits are beneficial in complex scientific research and practical application within these fields. A value of 0.35 reflects a significant but not overwhelming probability, under the assumption that other graduate fields of specialization are also options for someone with his diverse interests and capabilities.
