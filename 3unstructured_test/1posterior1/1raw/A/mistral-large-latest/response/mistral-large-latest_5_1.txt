  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.85
}

Explanation: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, his love for animals, and his strong empathy, it seems quite likely that he would be interested in a field that involves working with plants and animals. His appreciation for hard work and dedication also aligns well with the demands of agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, I estimate the probability to be 0.85.
