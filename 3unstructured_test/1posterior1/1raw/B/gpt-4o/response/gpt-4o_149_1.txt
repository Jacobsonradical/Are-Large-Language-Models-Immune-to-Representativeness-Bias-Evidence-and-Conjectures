Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam's interests and characteristics (curiosity about nature, love for animals, solving puzzles, empathy, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work) suggest that he might be more inclined towards fields related to natural sciences, environmental studies, biology, psychology, or even education, rather than business administration.

Therefore, I'd estimate the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

This estimate is based on the observation that his described interests and traits seem to align more closely with other fields.
