  "business administration": 0.1

Given Adam's personality sketch, including his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and enjoyment of solving puzzles, it is more likely that he might have pursued a field more directly related to his interests, such as biology, environmental science, or possibly even engineering or a natural science discipline. His characteristics do not strongly align with the typical interests or skills often associated with business administration, which generally includes a focus on management, finance, or organizational behavior. Hence, the probability for business administration is estimated on the lower side.
