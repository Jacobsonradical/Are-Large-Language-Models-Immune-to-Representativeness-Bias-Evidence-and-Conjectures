Based on the given personality sketch of Adam, it appears that his interests and strengths are more aligned with fields related to nature, animals, abstract concepts, and possibly puzzles (which could imply a propensity towards fields requiring problem-solving skills, such as science, engineering, mathematics, or psychology).

Here's my estimate:
