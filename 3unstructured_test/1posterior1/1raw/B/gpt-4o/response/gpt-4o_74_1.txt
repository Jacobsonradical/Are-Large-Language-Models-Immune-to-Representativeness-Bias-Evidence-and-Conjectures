  "business administration": 0.15
}

Given Adam's attributes—a genuine curiosity about nature, an appreciation for plants and animals, empathy, intelligence, and a propensity for solving puzzles—it's more likely that he would be drawn to fields such as biology, environmental science, veterinary studies, or psychology. Business administration typically attracts individuals with a focus on management, finance, marketing, and organizational behavior, which doesn't closely align with Adam's described interests and strengths. Nonetheless, a small probability remains as people can have diverse interests and career paths. Therefore, 0.15 is a reasonable estimate.
