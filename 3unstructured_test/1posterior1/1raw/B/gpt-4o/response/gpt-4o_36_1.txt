Based on the personality sketch and the information provided, Adam seems to have a strong inclination toward nature, animals, empathy, and abstract concepts. These attributes are not typically associated with business administration, which often focuses on management, economics, finance, and related subjects. Therefore, I would estimate the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration to be relatively low.
