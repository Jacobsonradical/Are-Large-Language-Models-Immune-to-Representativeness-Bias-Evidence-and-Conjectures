Given his strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, and interest in abstract concepts, Adam is more likely to pursue fields related to biology, environmental science, or a related discipline rather than business administration. His empathy and appreciation for hard work also suggest he might be interested in fields where he can make a direct positive impact on the environment or society, rather than focusing on the business aspects of organizations.
