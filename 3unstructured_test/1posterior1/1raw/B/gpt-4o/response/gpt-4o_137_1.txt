Given Adam's personality sketch, including his interests and characteristics, the likelihood of him being enrolled in a field related to business administration seems lower compared to fields like biology, ecology, or environmental science. His genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation of hard work and dedication are more commonly aligned with scientific rather than business-oriented studies. However, it is still possible, though less likely, that he could be in business administration, particularly if he wanted to apply his intelligence and empathy in sectors such as sustainable business practices or environmental consulting.
