Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong understanding of hard work and dedication, it seems less likely that he would be enrolled in business administration, which typically focuses on areas like finance, marketing, and organizational management. Instead, his interests and qualities suggest he might be more inclined towards fields like environmental science, biology, or a similar discipline related to nature and animals. However, it's not entirely impossible, as business administration could involve aspects of management within environmental or nonprofit sectors.
