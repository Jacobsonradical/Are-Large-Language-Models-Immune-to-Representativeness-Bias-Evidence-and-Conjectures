  "business administration": 0.1
}

Given Adam's personality traits, interests, and strengths, he seems more aligned with fields that involve nature, animals, abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving. Business administration typically attracts individuals with interests in management, finance, marketing, and organizational strategy. While it's not entirely impossible for someone with Adam's profile to be enrolled in business administration, the probability is relatively low compared to fields in the natural sciences, environmental studies, or similar areas. Thus, an estimate of 0.1 (or 10%) seems reasonable.
