  "business administration": 0.1
}

Given Adam's described interests in nature, puzzles, animals, and abstract concepts, it seems less likely that he pursued a field associated with business administration. While business administration can involve strategic thinking and problem-solving, the description of his warm heart, empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication might more strongly align with fields related to science, education, psychology, or environmental studies. Thus, an estimate of 0.1 reflects a lower probability of his enrollment in a business administration program.
