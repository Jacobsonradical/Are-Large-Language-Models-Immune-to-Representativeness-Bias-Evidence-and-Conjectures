Given Adam's interests and qualities—such as a genuine curiosity about nature, a deep love for animals, a warm heart, strong empathy, and high intelligence with an appreciation for hard work—he is more likely to be enrolled in a field related to natural sciences, biology, environmental studies, or a similar discipline. Business administration typically appeals to individuals interested in management, finance, or entrepreneurship, which does not strongly align with the traits described. Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration is relatively low.
