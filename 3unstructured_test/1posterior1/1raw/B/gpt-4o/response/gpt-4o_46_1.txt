  "business administration": 0.1
}

Given Adam's described personality traits—such as a strong curiosity about nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, empathy, love for animals, and understanding of hard work—it seems more likely that he would be drawn to fields like biology, environmental science, psychology, or other disciplines that align with his interests and strengths. While it's not impossible for him to be in business administration, the characteristics provided do not strongly align with the typical interests and motivations of a business administration student. Hence, a probability of 0.1 seems reasonable.
