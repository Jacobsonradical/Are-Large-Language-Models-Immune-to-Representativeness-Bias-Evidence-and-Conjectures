  "business administration": 0.1

Considering Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, puzzles, empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, it is less likely that he pursued a field like business administration, which may not align as closely with his interests and personality traits. While it's not impossible, fields related to natural sciences, environmental studies, psychology, or even veterinary studies might be a better fit for him. Therefore, the probability of him being in a business administration program is relatively low, but not zero.
