Based on the personality sketch and interests provided for Adam, it seems less likely that he would be enrolled in a field like business administration. His distinct curiosity about nature, plants, animals, and his appreciation for hard work and dedication may lead him to a field that aligns more closely with those interests such as biology, environmental science, or a related field rather than business administration. 

Therefore, my best estimate for the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration is relatively low.
