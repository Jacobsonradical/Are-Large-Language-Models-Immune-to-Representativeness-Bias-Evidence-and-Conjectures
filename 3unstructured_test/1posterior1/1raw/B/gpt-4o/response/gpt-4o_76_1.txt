  "business administration": 0.1
}

Given Adamâ€™s interests in nature, plants, puzzles, and animals, as well as his high intelligence and empathy, it seems less likely that he would choose a field like business administration, which tends to focus more on management, finance, and organizational skills rather than his expressed passions and strengths. Therefore, I have estimated a low probability of 0.1 for Adam being enrolled in business administration.
