  "business administration": 0.05
}

Given Adam's strong inclination towards nature, plants, animals, and his empathetic and puzzle-solving characteristics, it seems less likely that he would be enrolled in a business administration program. These traits align more closely with fields such as environmental science, biology, psychology, or perhaps other natural sciences. Therefore, the estimated probability of him being in business administration is relatively low.
