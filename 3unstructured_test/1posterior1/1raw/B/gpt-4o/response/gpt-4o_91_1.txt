  "business administration": 0.1
}

Given Adam's personality sketch, his interests and attributes align more closely with fields such as biology, environmental science, psychology, or even veterinary studies rather than business administration. Business administration typically attracts individuals with a keen interest in managing operations, finance, marketing, or leadership roles, which does not align strongly with Adam's described traits. Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration is relatively low.
