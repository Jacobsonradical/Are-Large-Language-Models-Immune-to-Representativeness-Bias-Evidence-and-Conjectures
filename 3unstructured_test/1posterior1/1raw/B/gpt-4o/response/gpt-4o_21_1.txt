Given the personality sketch and background information provided for Adam, it seems less likely that he would be enrolled in a field such as business administration, which often focuses on management, finance, and organizational behavior. Instead, Adam's strong empathy, deep love for animals, curiosity about nature, and high intelligence geared towards abstract concepts suggest that he might be more inclined towards fields such as biology, environmental science, psychology, or another science-related discipline. Given this analysis, my best estimate for the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration is relatively low.
