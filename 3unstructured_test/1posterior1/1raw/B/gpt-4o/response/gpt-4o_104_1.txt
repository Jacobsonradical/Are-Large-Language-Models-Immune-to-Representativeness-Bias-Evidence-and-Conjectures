The probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration, given his personality sketch and interests, seems relatively low. His genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and interest in abstract concepts point more towards fields like biology, environmental science, psychology, or even philosophy, rather than business administration. His empathy and appreciation for hard work might align with fields that have a direct positive impact on society rather than a traditional business trajectory.
