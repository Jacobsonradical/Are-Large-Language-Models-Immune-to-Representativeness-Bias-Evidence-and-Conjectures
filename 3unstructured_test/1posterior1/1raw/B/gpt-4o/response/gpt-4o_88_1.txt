  "business administration": 0.10
}

Given Adam's personality traits, interests, and background, particularly his curiosity about nature, love for animals, high intelligence, and empathy, it's somewhat less likely that he chose a field like business administration, which typically requires a different set of interests and skills focused on economics, management, and organizational behavior. However, it's still possible, as people have diverse interests and may pursue career paths that seem unrelated to their hobbies or personality traits.
