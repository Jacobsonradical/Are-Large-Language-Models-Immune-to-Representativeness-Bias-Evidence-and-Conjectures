Given Adam's expressed interests and characteristics related to nature, empathy, animals, and abstract concepts, he seems more likely to be involved in a field such as biology, environmental science, or psychology, rather than business administration. Therefore, while it is still possible he could be pursuing a degree in business administration, it appears to be less likely compared to other fields.
