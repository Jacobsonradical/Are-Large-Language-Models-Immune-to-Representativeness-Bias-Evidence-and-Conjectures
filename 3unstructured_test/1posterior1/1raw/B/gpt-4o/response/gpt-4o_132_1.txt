Given Adam's personality traits and interests, it's reasonable to make some inferences about his likelihood of being enrolled in various fields of study. Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts suggest he might lean towards fields related to natural sciences, biology, or environmental studies. His quiet nature and puzzle-solving skills could also make fields like mathematics or computer science appealing to him.

Business administration typically attracts students with interests in management, finance, entrepreneurship, and organizational behavior. These interests don't seem to align closely with Adam's described personality and interests.

Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration is likely to be relatively low.
