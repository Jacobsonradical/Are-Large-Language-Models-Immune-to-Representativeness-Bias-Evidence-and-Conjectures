Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have a strong inclination towards nature, empathy, animals, and solving puzzles, with a high level of intelligence and appreciation for hard work. These traits suggest a likelihood of him being in fields related to biology, environmental science, animal behavior, psychology, or other scientific research domains rather than business administration. Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration is relatively low.

Based on this analysis, my best estimate is as follows:

  "business administration": 0.1
