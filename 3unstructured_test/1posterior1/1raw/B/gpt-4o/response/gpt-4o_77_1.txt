Given Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and his warm and empathetic personality, it is more likely that he would be drawn to fields such as biology, environmental science, or psychology rather than business administration. His love for understanding abstract concepts and his intellectual capabilities may also steer him towards fields in research or academia. While it is not impossible for Adam to be enrolled in business administration, the probability is relatively low.
