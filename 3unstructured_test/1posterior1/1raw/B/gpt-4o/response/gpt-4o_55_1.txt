Based on Adam's personality sketch, which includes a genuine curiosity about nature, a quiet demeanor, an enjoyment of solving puzzles, strong empathy, a love for animals, high intelligence, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication, it seems less likely that his interests align closely with the field of business administration. He appears to be more suited for fields directly related to his interests in nature, animals, and puzzles, such as biology, environmental science, zoology, or even fields like psychology due to his empathy and intelligence.

Given this information, my estimate for the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021 is:
