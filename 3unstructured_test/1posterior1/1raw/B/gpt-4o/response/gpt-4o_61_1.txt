Based on the personality sketch of Adam, it appears he has a pronounced interest in nature, animals, and solving puzzles, coupled with strong empathy and intelligence. These traits align more closely with fields like environmental science, biology, ecology, psychology, or another field involving research and understanding living systems and human behavior rather than business administration. Therefore, the estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration would likely be low.
