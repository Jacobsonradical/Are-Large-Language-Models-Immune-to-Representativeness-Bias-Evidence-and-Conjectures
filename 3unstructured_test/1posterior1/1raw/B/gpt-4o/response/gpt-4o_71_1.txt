  "business administration": 0.1

Considering Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and his appreciation for hard work and dedication, along with his high intelligence and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts, it seems less likely that he would be enrolled in a field like business administration, which is more focused on corporate, managerial, and economic skills. Instead, he might be more inclined towards fields related to biology, environmental science, animal behavior, or other nature-related disciplines. However, there's still a small possibility that he could be combining his interests with business administration, particularly if he has a goal in environmental consulting or managing a nature-related business. Thus, the estimated probability is relatively low but not zero.
