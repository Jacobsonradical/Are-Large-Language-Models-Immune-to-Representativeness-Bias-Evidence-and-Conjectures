Based on Adam's personality sketch, it is less likely that he would pursue business administration given his interests and traits. His curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and love for animals suggest a stronger inclination towards fields that are more aligned with environmental science, biology, psychology, or veterinary studies rather than business administration. Although it is not impossible for someone with these traits to be in business administration, the probability seems relatively low.

Therefore, my estimate would be:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1
}
