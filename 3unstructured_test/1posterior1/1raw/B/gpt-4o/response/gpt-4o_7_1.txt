Given the personality sketch of Adam, which describes him as having a genuine curiosity about nature, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication, it seems less likely that he would be enrolled in a business administration program. His interests and strengths are more aligned with fields such as biology, environmental science, psychology, or other areas related to natural sciences and problem-solving. Hence, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration is estimated to be relatively low at around 0.1 (or 10%).
