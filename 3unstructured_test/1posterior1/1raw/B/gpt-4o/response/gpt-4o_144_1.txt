  "business administration": 0.1
}

Given Adam's personality sketch—his curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and interest in abstract concepts—it's more likely that he would be enrolled in a field related to biology, environmental science, psychology, or a similar area. While it's possible that someone with his intelligence and understanding of hard work could pursue a degree in business administration, the specific interests described make it a less probable fit compared to other fields. Hence, a probability of 0.1 is a reasonable estimate.
