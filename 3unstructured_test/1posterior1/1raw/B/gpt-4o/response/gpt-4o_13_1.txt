  "business administration": 0.1
}

Given Adam's curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and strong appreciation for hard work, it's less likely that he would be enrolled in a business administration program compared to fields more closely related to his interests, such as environmental science, biology, or psychology. However, there is still a non-zero probability that he might have chosen business administration, potentially with a focus on environmental or nonprofit management. Therefore, an estimate of 0.1 is a reasonable value.
