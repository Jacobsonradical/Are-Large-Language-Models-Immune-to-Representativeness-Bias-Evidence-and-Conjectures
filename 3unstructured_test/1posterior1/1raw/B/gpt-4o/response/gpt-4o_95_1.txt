  "business administration": 0.1

Given Adam's deep interest in nature, plants, puzzles, animals, and his strong understanding of hard work and empathy, it seems more likely that he would pursue a field related to sciences, environmental studies, or something that correlates strongly with his interests and traits. Therefore, while it's not impossible for him to be enrolled in business administration, I would estimate a relatively low probability for this field.
