Sure, based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, here's my best estimate of the probability that he was enrolled in the field of business administration:

{
  "business administration": 0.1
}

Given Adam's interests in nature, puzzles, animals, and his appreciation for hard work and dedication, it's more likely that he might be involved in a field related to environmental science, biology, or a similar discipline. However, business administration is not entirely out of the question, so I've provided a moderate probability.
