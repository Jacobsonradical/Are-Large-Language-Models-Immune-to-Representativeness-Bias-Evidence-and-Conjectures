Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have a profound interest in nature and animals, enjoys solving puzzles, and has high intelligence and empathy. These characteristics are not typical for a business administration field, which often attracts individuals interested in corporate environments, finance, management, and economics. 

Therefore, I estimate Adam's probability of being enrolled in business administration as relatively low.
