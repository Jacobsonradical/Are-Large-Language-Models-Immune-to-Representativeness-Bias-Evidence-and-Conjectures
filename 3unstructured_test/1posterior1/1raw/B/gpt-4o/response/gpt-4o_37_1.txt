Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have interests and qualities that align more closely with fields such as biology, environmental science, psychology, or even education, given his curiosity about nature, love for animals, high intelligence, and strong empathy. Business administration, on the other hand, usually attracts individuals with interests in management, economics, and organizational skills, which do not prominently appear in Adam's personality sketch.

Given this information, my best estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in the field of business administration is relatively low.
