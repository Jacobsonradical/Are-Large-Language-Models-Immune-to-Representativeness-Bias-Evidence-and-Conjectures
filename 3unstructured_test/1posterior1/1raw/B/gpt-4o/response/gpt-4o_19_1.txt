Sure, based on the personality sketch provided, the characteristics and interests suggest a personality more inclined towards natural sciences, puzzles, and empathy, rather than a field like business administration, which typically requires a different set of interests and skills.

Here is my estimate:

{
  "business administration": 0.1
}

This estimate takes into account the fact that Adam's curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and love for animals would likely guide him towards fields more aligned with those interests, such as biology, environmental science, or psychology, rather than business administration.
