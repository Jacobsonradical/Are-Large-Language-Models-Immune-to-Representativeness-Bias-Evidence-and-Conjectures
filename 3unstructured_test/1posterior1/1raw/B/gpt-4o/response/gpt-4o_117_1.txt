  "business administration": 0.15

Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, interest in plants and animals, problem-solving skills, warmth, empathy, and appreciation for hard work, it seems less likely that he would have chosen a field like business administration, which often focuses on different kinds of problem-solving and organizational contexts. However, it's not entirely impossible, as business administration can also involve strategic planning and understanding complex systems, which might appeal to his intelligence and abstract thinking capabilities. So, while it's not the most likely field for Adam given his traits, a small probability still exists.
