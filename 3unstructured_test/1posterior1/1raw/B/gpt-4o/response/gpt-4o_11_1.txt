  "business administration": 0.1
}

Given Adam's interests and traits — such as a genuine curiosity about nature, a love for animals, a quiet demeanor, intelligence in abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication — it seems more likely that he would pursue a field related to nature, biology, or environmental sciences rather than business administration. Therefore, while it is not impossible, the probability that he was enrolled in business administration is relatively low. A value of 0.1 seems reasonable.
