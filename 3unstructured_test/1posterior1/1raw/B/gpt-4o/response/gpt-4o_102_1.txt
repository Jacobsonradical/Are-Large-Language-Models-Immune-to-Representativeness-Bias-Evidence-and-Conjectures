  "business administration": 0.1
}

Given Adam's personality traits such as a love for nature, strong empathy, and deep love for animals, it seems more likely that he would be enrolled in a field related to biology, environmental science, psychology, or perhaps veterinary studies rather than business administration. The estimate of 0.1 reflects that while it is possible for someone with Adam's profile to be in business administration, it is not the most probable field given his interests and traits.
