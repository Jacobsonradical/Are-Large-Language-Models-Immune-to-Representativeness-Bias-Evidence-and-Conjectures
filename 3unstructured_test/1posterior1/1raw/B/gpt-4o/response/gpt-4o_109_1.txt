Given Adam's interests and personality traits, such as his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy, it seems more likely that he would be drawn to fields related to biology, environmental science, psychology, or other areas that involve understanding living organisms and helping others. While some of these traits could be useful in business administration, they do not strongly align with the typical interests and motivations associated with that field, leading to a lower estimate of probability.
