  "business administration": 0.1
}

Based on the provided personality sketch, it seems likely that Adam's interests and strengths lie more in fields related to nature, biology, and possibly environmental science, rather than business administration. His genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and high empathy suggest he may be drawn to fields that involve working with living organisms or understanding environmental systems. However, there's still a small chance he could have pursued business administration, perhaps with a focus on environmental management or sustainability, but this seems less likely given the information provided.
