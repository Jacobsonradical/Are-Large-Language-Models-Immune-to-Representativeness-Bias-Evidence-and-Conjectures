  "business administration": 0.1
}

Given Adam's interests in nature, plants, animals, puzzles, and empathy, it seems less likely that he would pursue a field such as business administration, which typically focuses on corporate strategies, management, finance, and marketing. Although it's not impossible, his characteristics and interests suggest greater alignment with fields such as environmental science, biology, psychology, or other studies related to natural sciences and human behavior. Hence, the probability assigned to him being enrolled in business administration is relatively low.
