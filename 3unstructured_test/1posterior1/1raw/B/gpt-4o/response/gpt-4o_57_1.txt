  "business administration": 0.1

Given Adam's curiosity about nature, strong empathy, love for animals, and high intelligence with an ability to understand abstract concepts, it seems more likely that he would be drawn to fields like biology, environmental science, psychology, or another subject related to his interests. While it is still possible he could be studying business administration, the probability is lower compared to more relevant fields. Hence, an estimated probability of 0.1 seems appropriate.
