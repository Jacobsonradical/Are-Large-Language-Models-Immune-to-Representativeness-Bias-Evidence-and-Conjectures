Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam's interests and qualities seem to align more with fields related to science, environmental studies, or psychology rather than business administration. Therefore, I would estimate the probability as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.15
}
```

This estimate is based on the fact that Adam's curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and aptitude for abstract concepts do not strongly correlate with the typical profile of a business administration student. However, it is still possible that he could be studying business administration, hence a non-zero probability.
