Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam's interests and qualities seem to align more with fields like biology, environmental science, or other natural sciences due to his curiosity about nature and love for animals. He also seems to enjoy problem-solving, which could indicate a potential for fields like mathematics, physics, or computer science. His empathy and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he might also be interested in social work, education, or healthcare.

Business administration, while a practical and valuable field, does not seem to directly align with the interests and qualities described in Adam's personality sketch. Therefore, I would estimate a lower probability for this field.
