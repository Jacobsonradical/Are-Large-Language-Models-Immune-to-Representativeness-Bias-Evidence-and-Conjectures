Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam's interests and qualities seem more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, or other natural sciences due to his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy. He also has a penchant for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, which might indicate a leaning towards fields that require analytical and critical thinking skills.

Given these points, it seems less likely that he would be enrolled in business administration, which typically focuses on management, finance, and marketing. Therefore, my estimate for the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration is:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.15
}
```

This estimate is subjective and based on the limited information provided in the personality sketch.
