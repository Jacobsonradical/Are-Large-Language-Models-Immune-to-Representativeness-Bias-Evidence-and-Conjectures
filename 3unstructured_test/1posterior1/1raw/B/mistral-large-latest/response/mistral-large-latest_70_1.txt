Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam's interests and qualities seem more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, or other natural sciences due to his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy. He also seems to enjoy problem-solving and understanding abstract concepts, which could point towards fields like mathematics, physics, or philosophy.

Given this, it seems less likely that he would be enrolled in business administration, which typically attracts students with interests in commerce, management, economics, and finance. Therefore, my estimate would be:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.15
}
```

This estimate is subjective and based on the limited information provided. Actual probabilities may vary.
