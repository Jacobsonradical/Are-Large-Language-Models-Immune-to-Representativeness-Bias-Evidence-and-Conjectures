Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam's interests and qualities seem to align more with fields like biology, environmental science, or other natural sciences due to his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy. His aptitude for understanding abstract concepts and solving puzzles also suggests a potential fit for fields like mathematics, physics, or computer science.

Given this, it seems less likely that he would be enrolled in business administration, which typically attracts students with interests in management, finance, and organizational behavior. Therefore, my estimate for the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration is:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.15
}
```

This estimate is subjective and based on the limited information provided in the personality sketch.
