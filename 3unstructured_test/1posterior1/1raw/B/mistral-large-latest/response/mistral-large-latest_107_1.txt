  "business administration": 0.1
}

Explanation: Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam's interests and qualities seem more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, or other natural sciences due to his curiosity about nature and love for animals. His affinity for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts also suggests he might be drawn to fields like mathematics, physics, or computer science. His empathetic nature could lead him towards fields that involve helping others, such as social work or healthcare. Business administration, while it cannot be ruled out entirely, does not seem to be a strong match with the described personality traits, hence the low probability of 0.1.
