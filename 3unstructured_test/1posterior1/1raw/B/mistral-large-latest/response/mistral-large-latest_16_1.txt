Explanation: Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam's interests and qualities seem more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, or other natural sciences due to his curiosity about nature and love for animals. His aptitude for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts also suggests he might be drawn to fields like mathematics, physics, or philosophy. His empathetic nature could lead him towards fields focused on helping others, such as social work or healthcare. Business administration, while not entirely misaligned, does not seem to be a strong fit given his described passions and strengths. Therefore, the probability is estimated to be relatively low at 0.1.
