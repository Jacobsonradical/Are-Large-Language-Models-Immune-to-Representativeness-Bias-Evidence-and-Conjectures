Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam's interests and qualities seem to align more with fields related to science, environmental studies, or psychology rather than business administration. However, it's important to note that personal interests don't always correlate with academic pursuits. Here's a rough estimate:

{
  "business administration": 0.15
}

This estimate is based on the following reasoning:
- Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest interests in fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology.
- His aptitude for abstract concepts and puzzle-solving could indicate a leaning towards fields like mathematics, physics, or computer science.
- While it's possible that he could be interested in business administration, the given traits don't strongly indicate this direction. Hence, a lower probability is assigned.
