Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam's interests and qualities seem more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, or other natural sciences due to his curiosity about nature and love for animals. His affinity for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts also suggests a potential leaning towards fields like mathematics, physics, or computer science. Given this, it seems less likely that he would be enrolled in business administration. Therefore, my estimate is:
