  "business administration": 0.1
}

Explanation: Based on the personality sketch, Adam's interests and strengths seem to align more with fields like biology, environmental science, or other natural sciences due to his curiosity about nature and love for animals. His aptitude for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts could also indicate a potential for fields like mathematics, physics, or computer science. His strong empathy might draw him to fields where he can help others, such as social work or healthcare. Business administration, while it cannot be ruled out entirely, does not seem to be a strong match with the given traits, hence the low probability of 0.1.
