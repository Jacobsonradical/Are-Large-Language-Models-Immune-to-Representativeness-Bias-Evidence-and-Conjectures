  "business administration": 0.1
}

Explanation: Based on Adam's personality sketch, which highlights his curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and aptitude for abstract concepts and puzzles, it seems less likely that he would be enrolled in business administration. These traits more closely align with fields like biology, environmental science, psychology, or mathematics. Therefore, the probability is estimated to be relatively low at 0.1.
