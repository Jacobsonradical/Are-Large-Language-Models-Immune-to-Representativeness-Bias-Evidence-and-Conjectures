Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam's interests and qualities seem to align more with fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology rather than business administration. However, it's important to note that personal interests don't always correlate with academic pursuits. Here's a rough estimate:

{

}

This estimate is based on the assumption that Adam's interests in nature, animals, and abstract concepts might lead him to prefer other fields, but it's still possible that he could be interested in business administration for other reasons not mentioned in the sketch.
