Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam's interests and qualities seem more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, or other natural sciences due to his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy. He also enjoys solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, which might suggest a leaning towards fields like mathematics, physics, or philosophy.

Given this, it seems less likely that he would be enrolled in business administration, which typically attracts students with interests in commerce, management, and economics. Therefore, I would estimate a lower probability for Adam being enrolled in business administration.
