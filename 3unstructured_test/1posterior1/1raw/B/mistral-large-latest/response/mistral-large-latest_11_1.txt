  "business administration": 0.1
}

Explanation: Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam's interests and qualities seem more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, or other natural sciences due to his curiosity about nature and love for animals. His affinity for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts also suggests a potential fit for fields like mathematics, physics, or computer science. His strong empathy could also lead him towards fields focused on helping others, such as social work or psychology. Business administration, while not entirely misaligned, does not seem to be a strong fit given his described interests and qualities. Therefore, the probability is estimated to be relatively low at 0.1.
