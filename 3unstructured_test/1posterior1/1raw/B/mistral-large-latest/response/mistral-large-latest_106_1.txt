  "business administration": 0.05
}

Explanation: Based on Adam's personality sketch, which highlights his curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts, it seems less likely that he would be enrolled in business administration. These traits more closely align with fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology. Therefore, the probability is estimated to be quite low at 0.05.
