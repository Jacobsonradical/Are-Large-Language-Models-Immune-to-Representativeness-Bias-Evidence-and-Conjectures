Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam's interests and qualities seem more aligned with fields such as science, environmental studies, or psychology rather than business administration. However, it's important to note that people's interests and career paths can vary widely and may not always align with their personalities in a predictable way.

Given this information, I would estimate the probability as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.15
}
```

This estimate takes into account that while Adam's interests and qualities do not strongly indicate a pursuit in business administration, there is still a possibility that he chose this field for other reasons.
