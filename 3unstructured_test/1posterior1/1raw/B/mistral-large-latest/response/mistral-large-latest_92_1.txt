Explanation: Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam's interests and qualities seem more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, or other natural sciences due to his curiosity about nature and love for animals. His aptitude for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts also suggests he might be drawn to fields like mathematics, physics, or computer science. His empathetic nature could also lead him towards fields in social sciences or humanities. Business administration, while not impossible, seems less likely given these interests and traits, hence the lower probability.
