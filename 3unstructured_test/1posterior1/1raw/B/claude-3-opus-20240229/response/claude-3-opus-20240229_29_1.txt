Based on the given personality sketch, here is my estimate:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The subject's interests and traits (curiosity about nature and plants, enjoyment of puzzles, empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication) do not strongly align with typical characteristics associated with students pursuing business administration. However, since the field of study is not explicitly mentioned, there is still a small possibility that Adam could be enrolled in a business administration program.
