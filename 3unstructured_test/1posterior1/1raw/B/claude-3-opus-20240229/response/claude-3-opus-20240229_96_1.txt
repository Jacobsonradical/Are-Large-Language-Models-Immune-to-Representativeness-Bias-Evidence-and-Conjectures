Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits more aligned with fields like biology, psychology, or perhaps mathematics. His curiosity about nature and plants, empathy and love for animals, and ability to understand abstract concepts point more towards sciences than business administration. However, the sketch does mention an appreciation for hard work and dedication, which could be applicable to business studies. Overall though, based solely on the limited information provided, I estimate a relatively low 20% probability that Adam was studying business administration specifically in graduate school.
