Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

Based on Adam's personality sketch which emphasizes his curiosity about nature, love for animals, aptitude for abstract concepts, and empathy, it seems less likely that he would have pursued graduate studies in business administration. Fields such as biology, zoology, veterinary medicine, mathematics, or philosophy seem more aligned with his interests and strengths. However, it's certainly possible he could have been in business administration, so I didn't assign a probability of 0, but rather a relatively low 10% probability.
