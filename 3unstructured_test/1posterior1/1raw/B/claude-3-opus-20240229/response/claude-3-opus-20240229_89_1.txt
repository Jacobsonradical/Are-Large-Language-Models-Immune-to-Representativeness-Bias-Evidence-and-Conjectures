Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, psychology, or perhaps mathematics. His curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and ability to understand abstract concepts point more towards sciences than business administration. However, since he is described as having an appreciation for hard work and dedication, there is still some possibility he could be drawn to business. Overall though, based solely on the personality description provided, I estimate only around a 20% chance that he was enrolled in business administration specifically.
