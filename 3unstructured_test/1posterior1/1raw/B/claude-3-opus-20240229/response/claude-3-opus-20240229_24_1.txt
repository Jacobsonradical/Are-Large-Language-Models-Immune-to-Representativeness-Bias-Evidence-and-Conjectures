Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has strong interests in nature, animals, abstract concepts, and hard work. These traits seem more aligned with fields like biology, zoology, mathematics, or other sciences rather than business administration. Of course, it's possible for someone with those interests to study business, but it seems less probable given the information provided. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.1 that Adam was a graduate student in business administration.
