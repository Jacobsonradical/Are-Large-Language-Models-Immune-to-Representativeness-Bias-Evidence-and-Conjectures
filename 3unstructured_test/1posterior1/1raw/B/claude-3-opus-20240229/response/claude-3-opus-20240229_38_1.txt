Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits more aligned with scientific fields like biology, zoology, or perhaps more abstract disciplines like mathematics or philosophy. His curiosity about nature, love for animals, and ability to understand abstract concepts point towards fields outside of business administration. However, business administration is a broad field, so there is still some possibility he could have pursued it. Based on the limited information provided, I estimate a relatively low 20% probability that Adam was a graduate student in business administration specifically in 2021.
