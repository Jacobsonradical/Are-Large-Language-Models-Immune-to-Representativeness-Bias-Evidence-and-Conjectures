Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has strong interests in nature, animals, puzzles, and abstract concepts. He is also empathetic and appreciates hard work and dedication. However, the sketch does not mention anything directly related to business, management, finance, or other topics commonly associated with business administration.

While it's certainly possible for someone with Adam's traits to pursue business administration, I believe it is more likely that he would gravitate towards fields more closely aligned with his stated interests, such as biology, environmental science, mathematics, psychology, or philosophy. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.2 that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
