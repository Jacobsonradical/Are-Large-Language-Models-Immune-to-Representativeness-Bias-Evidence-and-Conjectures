Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests Adam has interests and aptitudes more aligned with scientific fields like biology, zoology, or even more abstract disciplines like mathematics or philosophy. His love of nature, animals, puzzles and abstract concepts points more towards STEM or humanities rather than business. However, business administration is a broad field and his intelligence and work ethic could lend themselves to business studies, so I wouldn't rule it out entirely. But based on the limited information provided, I estimate only around a 20% chance he was enrolled in business administration specifically in 2021.
