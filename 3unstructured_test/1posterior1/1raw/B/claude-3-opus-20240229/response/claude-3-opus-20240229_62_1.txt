Based on the given personality sketch, here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, enjoying puzzles, empathy, love for animals, and understanding abstract concepts, suggest that Adam is more likely to be interested in fields related to natural sciences, psychology, or abstract disciplines rather than business administration. However, since he is described as having a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication, there is still a possibility that he could be enrolled in a business administration program. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.2 for Adam being enrolled in business administration.
