Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality description suggests Adam has interests and traits more aligned with scientific fields like biology, zoology, or perhaps more abstract and theoretical disciplines. His curiosity about nature and plants, love of animals, ability to grasp abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could suit many fields. However, business administration is not strongly indicated by the description, so I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.2 that this was his field of graduate study.
