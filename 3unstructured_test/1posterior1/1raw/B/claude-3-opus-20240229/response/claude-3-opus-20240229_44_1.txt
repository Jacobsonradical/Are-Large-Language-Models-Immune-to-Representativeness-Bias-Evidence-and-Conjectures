Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits more aligned with sciences, mathematics, or possibly humanities rather than business. His curiosity about nature and plants, enjoyment of puzzles and abstract concepts, and empathy point to fields other than business administration as being more likely. However, the information provided is limited, so I cannot rule out business administration entirely. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low 20% probability that he was enrolled in a business administration graduate program.
