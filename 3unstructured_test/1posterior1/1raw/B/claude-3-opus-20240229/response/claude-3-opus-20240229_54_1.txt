Based on the personality sketch provided, here is my estimate:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The subject's strong interest in nature, animals, puzzles, and abstract concepts suggests a higher likelihood of pursuing a field related to natural sciences, environmental studies, or possibly mathematics. While business administration is certainly a possibility, the given personality traits do not strongly align with typical characteristics associated with that field. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.2 for the subject being enrolled in business administration.
