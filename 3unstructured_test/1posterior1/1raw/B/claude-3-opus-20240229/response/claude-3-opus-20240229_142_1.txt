Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has traits and interests more commonly associated with science, nature, abstract thinking, and empathy. While it's certainly possible for someone with those traits to study business administration, fields like biology, environmental science, psychology, mathematics, or veterinary medicine seem more probable given his curiosity about plants, love of animals, puzzle-solving, and understanding of abstract concepts. Business administration is certainly a possibility, but based solely on the limited information provided, I estimate the probability is only around 0.2 or 20%.
