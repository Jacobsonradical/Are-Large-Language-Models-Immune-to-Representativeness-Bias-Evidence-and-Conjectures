Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits more aligned with science, nature, and abstract thinking rather than business. His curiosity about plants, love for animals, and ability to understand abstract concepts point more toward fields like biology, ecology, zoology, or other natural sciences. The sketch also does not mention anything directly related to business, management, finance, or typical business administration topics.

However, business administration is a broad field, and it's possible that Adam could apply his intelligence, problem-solving skills, and strong work ethic to business. So while the probability seems low based on the limited information provided, it cannot be ruled out entirely. Therefore, I estimate a 20% chance (0.2 probability) that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
