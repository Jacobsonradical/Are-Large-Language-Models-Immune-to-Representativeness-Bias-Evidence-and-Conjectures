Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and aptitude for abstract concepts, seem more aligned with fields like biology, psychology, philosophy, or animal science rather than business administration. However, since no specific field of study is mentioned, I cannot completely rule out the possibility that Adam was studying business, so I assigned a relatively low but non-zero probability.
