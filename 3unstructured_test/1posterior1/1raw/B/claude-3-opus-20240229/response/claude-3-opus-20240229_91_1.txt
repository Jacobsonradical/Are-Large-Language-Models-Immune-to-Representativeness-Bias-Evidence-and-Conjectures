Based on the personality sketch provided, here is my estimate:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest a higher likelihood of pursuing a field related to natural sciences, mathematics, or engineering rather than business administration. However, since the subject also has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication, there is still a possibility they could be enrolled in a business administration program. Therefore, I estimate the probability to be relatively low at 0.2.
