Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits more aligned with scientific fields like biology, zoology, or perhaps more abstract and theoretical fields. His curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could suit a variety of academic pursuits. However, business administration is less directly related to these mentioned interests and strengths. It's certainly possible he was studying business, but I estimate the probability to be relatively low based solely on the provided description of his personality and interests.
