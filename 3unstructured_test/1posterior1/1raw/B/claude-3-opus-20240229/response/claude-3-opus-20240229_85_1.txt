Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.15"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits more aligned with fields like biology, zoology, psychology, or perhaps mathematics or computer science. His curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, empathy, and ability to understand abstract concepts point more towards science and research-oriented fields rather than business administration. However, there is still some possibility he could be studying business, so I estimated a relatively low but non-zero probability of 0.15.
