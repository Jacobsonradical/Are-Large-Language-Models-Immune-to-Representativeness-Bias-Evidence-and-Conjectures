Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests Adam has strong interests and aptitudes in areas like nature, puzzles, abstract concepts, and empathy. While these traits could be somewhat applicable to business, they seem more aligned with fields such as biology, psychology, mathematics, or veterinary medicine. The sketch does not provide any direct indication of interest in business topics. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low 20% probability that Adam was pursuing graduate studies in business administration.
