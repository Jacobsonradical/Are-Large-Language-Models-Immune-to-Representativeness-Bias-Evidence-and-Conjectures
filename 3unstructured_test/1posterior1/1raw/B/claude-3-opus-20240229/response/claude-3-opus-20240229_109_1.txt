Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

Based on Adam's personality traits and interests described in the sketch, he seems more inclined towards fields related to nature, animals, abstract concepts and hard sciences rather than business administration. His empathy, curiosity about plants and animals, and ability to grasp abstract ideas suggest he likely pursued graduate studies in a field such as biology, environmental science, zoology, or perhaps even mathematics or physics. Of course, it's possible for someone with those traits to study business, but it seems less probable given the information provided. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low 10% probability that Adam was a graduate student in business administration.
