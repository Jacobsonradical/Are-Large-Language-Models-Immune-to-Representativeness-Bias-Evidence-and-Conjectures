Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has a strong interest in nature, animals, and abstract concepts. He is empathetic and appreciates hard work. However, there is no direct indication of an interest in business or related fields. While it's certainly possible he could have pursued business administration, the details provided point more towards fields related to natural sciences, mathematics, or possibly humanities. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.2 that he was enrolled in a business administration program.
