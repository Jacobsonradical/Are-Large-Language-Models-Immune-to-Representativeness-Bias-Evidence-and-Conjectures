Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.15"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has strong interests in nature, animals, puzzles, and abstract concepts. He is also empathetic and appreciates hard work and dedication. However, there is no direct mention of an interest in business, management, finance, or related fields that would be more typical for someone studying business administration.

While it's certainly possible Adam could have chosen to study business, the given description better fits someone more likely to pursue graduate studies in fields like biology, zoology, philosophy, mathematics, or other sciences. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low 15% probability that he was enrolled specifically in business administration.
