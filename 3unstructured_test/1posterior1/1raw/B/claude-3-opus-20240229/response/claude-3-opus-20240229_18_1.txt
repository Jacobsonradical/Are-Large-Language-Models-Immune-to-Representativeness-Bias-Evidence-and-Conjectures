Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.15"
}

Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have interests and traits more aligned with science, nature, and possibly technology fields rather than business. His curiosity about plants, love of animals, aptitude for abstract concepts, and appreciation of hard work and dedication could point to fields like biology, zoology, environmental science, mathematics, or computer science. Of course, it's certainly possible he pursued an MBA, but the limited information provided suggests his graduate studies were more likely in a STEM-related discipline. Without more specifics about his undergraduate background and career goals, I estimate only a 15% probability that he was enrolled in business administration in 2021.
