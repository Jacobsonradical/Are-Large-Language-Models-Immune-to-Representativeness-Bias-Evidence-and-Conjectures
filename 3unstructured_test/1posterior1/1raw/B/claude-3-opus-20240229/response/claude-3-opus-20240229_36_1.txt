Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, enjoyment of puzzles, empathy, love for animals, and aptitude for abstract concepts, seem more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, psychology, mathematics, or philosophy. Business administration is certainly a possibility, but the given description does not strongly indicate an inclination towards business studies compared to other potential graduate fields. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.2 that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021.
