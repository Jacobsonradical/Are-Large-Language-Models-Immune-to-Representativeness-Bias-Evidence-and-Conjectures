Based on the personality sketch provided, here is my estimate for the probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has a strong interest in nature, animals, and abstract concepts. He is also described as having high intelligence and a deep appreciation for hard work and dedication. While these qualities could be applicable to various fields, they do not strongly align with the typical profile of a business administration student.

Business administration students often have strong interests in finance, management, marketing, and entrepreneurship. The sketch does not mention any of these areas as particular strengths or interests for Adam.

However, it is essential to note that individuals can have diverse interests and skill sets, and their chosen field of study may not always perfectly align with their personality. Therefore, while the probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration seems relatively low based on the given information, it is not entirely impossible.
