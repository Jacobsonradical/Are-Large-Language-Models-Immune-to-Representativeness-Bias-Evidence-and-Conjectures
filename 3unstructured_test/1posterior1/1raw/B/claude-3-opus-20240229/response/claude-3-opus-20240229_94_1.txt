Based on the personality sketch provided, here is my estimate:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The sketch suggests that Adam has a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as an aptitude for understanding abstract concepts. These traits, combined with his empathy and appreciation for hard work, could potentially align with various graduate fields, such as biology, environmental science, or even psychology.

However, the description does not provide any strong indication that Adam is particularly inclined towards business administration. While it's possible that he could be enrolled in this field, the given information does not strongly support this possibility.

Please note that this is a subjective estimate based on the limited information provided in the personality sketch.
