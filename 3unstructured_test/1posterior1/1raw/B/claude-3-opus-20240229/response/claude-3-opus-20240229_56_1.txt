Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has a strong interest in nature, animals, puzzles, and abstract concepts. He is also empathetic and appreciates hard work and dedication. However, there is no direct indication of an interest or aptitude for business administration. While it's possible he could have pursued that field, the details provided point more towards areas like biology, zoology, mathematics, philosophy, or other sciences. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low 10% probability that Adam was a graduate student in business administration specifically.
