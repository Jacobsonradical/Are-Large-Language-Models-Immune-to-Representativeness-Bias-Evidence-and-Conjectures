Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.05"
}

Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have interests and traits more aligned with fields like biology, zoology, psychology, or perhaps mathematics or philosophy. His curiosity about nature and plants, love of animals, empathy, and ability to understand abstract concepts point more towards sciences, social sciences, or humanities rather than a business-oriented field like business administration. Of course, it's possible for someone with those interests and strengths to study business, but I estimate a relatively low probability of around 5% given the information provided.
