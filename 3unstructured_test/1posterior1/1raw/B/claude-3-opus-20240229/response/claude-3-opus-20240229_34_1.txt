Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

The personality traits and interests described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and aptitude for abstract concepts, do not strongly align with typical characteristics of business administration students. The sketch suggests Adam may have been more likely to pursue graduate studies in a field related to natural sciences, psychology, veterinary medicine, or perhaps mathematics. Of course, it's possible for someone with those traits to study business, but I estimate a relatively low probability based solely on the information provided.
