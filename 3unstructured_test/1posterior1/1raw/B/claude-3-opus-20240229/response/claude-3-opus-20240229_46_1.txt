Based on the provided personality sketch, here is my estimate:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has a strong interest in nature, animals, and abstract concepts, as well as a deep appreciation for hard work. While these qualities could be applicable to various fields, they do not strongly align with the typical focus of business administration, which deals more with management, finance, and organizational operations. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.2 that Adam was enrolled in a business administration graduate program.
