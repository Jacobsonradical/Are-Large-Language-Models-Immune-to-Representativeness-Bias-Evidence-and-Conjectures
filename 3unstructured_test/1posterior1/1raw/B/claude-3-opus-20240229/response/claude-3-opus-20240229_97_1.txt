Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits more aligned with fields like biology, zoology, psychology, or philosophy rather than business administration. His curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, empathy, and ability to understand abstract concepts point more towards sciences and humanities. The sketch doesn't mention anything related to business, management, finance, or entrepreneurship that would suggest a strong likelihood of him pursuing an MBA or similar degree. Of course, it's certainly possible he was in business administration, as people can have varied interests, but the probability seems relatively low based solely on the given information.
