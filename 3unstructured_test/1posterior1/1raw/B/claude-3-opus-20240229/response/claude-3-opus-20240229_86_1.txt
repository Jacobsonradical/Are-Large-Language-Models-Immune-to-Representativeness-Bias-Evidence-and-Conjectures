Based on the given personality sketch, here is my estimate for the probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for abstract concepts, suggest that Adam is more likely to be interested in fields related to natural sciences, environmental studies, or perhaps mathematics. While it's possible for someone with these traits to pursue business administration, it seems less likely given the information provided. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.2 for Adam being enrolled in a business administration program.
