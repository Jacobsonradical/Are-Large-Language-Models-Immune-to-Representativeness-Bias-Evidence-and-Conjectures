Here is my estimate for the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits more aligned with fields such as biology, zoology, psychology, or philosophy, rather than business administration. However, it's still possible that he could have been enrolled in a business program, so I didn't assign a probability of 0. The probability of 0.2 reflects that while it seems less likely given his profile, it cannot be ruled out entirely without more information.
