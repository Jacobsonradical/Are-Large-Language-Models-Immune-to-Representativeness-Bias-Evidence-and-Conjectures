Here is my estimate for the probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests Adam has strong interests and aptitudes in areas like nature, puzzles, abstract concepts, and empathy. While it's certainly possible he could be studying business administration, the description doesn't provide strong direct evidence of business-related interests or skills. His genuine curiosity, intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication could lend themselves to a variety of fields. Without more information indicating a specific interest in business, I estimate a relatively low 20% probability that business administration was his chosen graduate field of study.
