Based on the given personality sketch, here is my estimate:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work, do not strongly align with typical characteristics associated with students pursuing business administration. However, since no information is provided about Adam's specific interests or undergraduate background, I cannot completely rule out the possibility. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.2 that Adam was enrolled in a business administration graduate program in 2021.
