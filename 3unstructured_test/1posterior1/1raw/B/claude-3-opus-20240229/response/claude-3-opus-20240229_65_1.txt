Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.15"
}

Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have interests and traits more aligned with scientific fields like biology, zoology, or perhaps mathematics or computer science given his intelligence and enjoyment of puzzles and abstract concepts. The description does not strongly suggest an interest in business. However, I did not assign a probability of 0 since it's certainly possible he could have pursued business administration despite the description not directly hinting at business aptitude or interest. The probability I assigned is a rough estimate based solely on the limited information in the personality sketch.
