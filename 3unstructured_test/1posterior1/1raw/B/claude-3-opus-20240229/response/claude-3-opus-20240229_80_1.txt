Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in the specified field in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have interests and strengths that would align more with fields like biology, zoology, psychology, or perhaps mathematics or philosophy. His curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, empathy, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he would be more drawn to and successful in those types of fields compared to business administration. However, the information provided is limited, so I cannot rule out business administration entirely. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low 20% probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021.
