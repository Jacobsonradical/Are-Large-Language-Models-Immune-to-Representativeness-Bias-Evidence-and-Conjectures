Based on the personality sketch provided, here is my estimate:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The description suggests that Adam has a strong interest in nature, animals, and abstract concepts. He is also empathetic and appreciates hard work. While these qualities could be applicable to various fields, they seem more aligned with areas such as natural sciences, psychology, or perhaps philosophy. Business administration is certainly a possibility, but the given information doesn't strongly indicate a high likelihood of Adam being enrolled in that specific field. Therefore, I estimate the probability to be relatively low at 0.2.
