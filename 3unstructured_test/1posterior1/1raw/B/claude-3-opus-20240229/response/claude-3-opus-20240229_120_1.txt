Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and understanding of abstract concepts, seem more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, psychology, or even certain humanities rather than business administration. However, since no specific field of study is mentioned, I cannot completely rule out the possibility that Adam was in a business program. The probability I provided reflects this uncertainty based on the limited information available.
