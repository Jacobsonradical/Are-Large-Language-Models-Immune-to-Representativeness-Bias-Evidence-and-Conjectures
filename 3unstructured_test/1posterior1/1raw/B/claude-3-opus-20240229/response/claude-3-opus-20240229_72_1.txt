Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits more aligned with scientific, analytical, and empathetic pursuits rather than business. His curiosity about nature and plants, enjoyment of puzzles and abstract concepts, and deep empathy point more towards fields like biology, environmental science, psychology, or philosophy. The sketch does not mention anything related to business, management, finance, or entrepreneurship. Therefore, while it's certainly possible he studied business administration, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.2 based solely on the information provided.
