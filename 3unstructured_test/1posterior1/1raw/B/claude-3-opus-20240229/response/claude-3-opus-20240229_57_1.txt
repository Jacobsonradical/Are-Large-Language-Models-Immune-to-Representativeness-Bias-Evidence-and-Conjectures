Based on the given personality sketch, here is my estimate:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has a keen interest in nature, plants, and animals. He is intelligent, empathetic, and appreciates hard work and dedication. However, there is no strong indication that he would be particularly drawn to the field of business administration. His curiosity seems more directed towards natural sciences and abstract concepts rather than business-related subjects. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.2 that Adam was enrolled in business administration as a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021.
