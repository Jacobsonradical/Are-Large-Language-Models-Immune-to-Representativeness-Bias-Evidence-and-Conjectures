Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits that may be more aligned with fields such as biology, zoology, psychology, or philosophy, rather than business administration. However, it's still possible for someone with those characteristics to pursue business, so I didn't assign a very low probability. The sketch doesn't provide strong evidence that business administration would be his chosen field of graduate study.
