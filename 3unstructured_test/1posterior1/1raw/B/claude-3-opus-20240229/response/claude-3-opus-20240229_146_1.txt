Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits more aligned with natural sciences, abstract thinking, and empathy. While it's certainly possible for someone with those characteristics to study business administration, the sketch provides no strong indication of interest in that particular field. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.2 that he was enrolled in business administration specifically.
