Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.15"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests in nature, puzzles, animals, and abstract concepts. He is also empathetic and appreciates hard work. However, there is no direct indication of an interest in business or management.

While it's certainly possible for someone with Adam's personality traits to pursue business administration, the given information points more towards fields related to natural sciences, mathematics, or perhaps certain humanities or social sciences. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.15 that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
