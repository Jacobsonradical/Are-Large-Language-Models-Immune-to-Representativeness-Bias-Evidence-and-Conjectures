Here is my estimate for the probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems more likely to be drawn to fields related to nature, animals, abstract concepts and hard work rather than business administration. However, without more specific information about his academic interests and career goals, I cannot completely rule out business administration, so I estimate a 20% probability that he may have been enrolled in that field.
