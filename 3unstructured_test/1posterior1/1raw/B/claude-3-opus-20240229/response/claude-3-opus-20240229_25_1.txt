Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.15"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits more aligned with scientific fields like biology, zoology, or perhaps more abstract and theoretical fields. His curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could fit well with graduate studies in various scientific disciplines.

While it's certainly possible for someone with these traits to pursue business administration, the sketch doesn't provide strong evidence to suggest this field in particular. Hence, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.15 that Adam was enrolled in a business administration graduate program in 2021.
