Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality description suggests Adam has interests and traits more aligned with scientific fields like biology, psychology, or abstract disciplines like mathematics or philosophy. His empathy and love of animals could point to veterinary studies as well. While it's certainly possible he studied business administration, the limited information provided makes other fields seem more probable for someone with his profile. Of course, without more details about his specific academic interests, career goals, and undergraduate background, this is a very rough estimate.
