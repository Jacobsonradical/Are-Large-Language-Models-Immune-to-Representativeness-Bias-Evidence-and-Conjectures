Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.15"
}

The personality sketch suggests Adam has interests and traits more aligned with scientific fields like biology, ecology, or animal behavior, rather than business administration. His curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, along with his intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, point more towards graduate studies in the life sciences or a related field. The sketch does not mention any business or finance-related interests. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.15 that he was a business administration graduate student.
