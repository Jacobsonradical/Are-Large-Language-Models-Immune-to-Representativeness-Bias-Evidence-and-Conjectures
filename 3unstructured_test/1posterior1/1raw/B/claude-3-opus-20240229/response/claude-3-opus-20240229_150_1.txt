Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits more aligned with scientific fields like biology, zoology, or perhaps more abstract and theoretical fields. His curiosity about nature and plants, love of animals, skill with abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could suit a variety of academic pursuits. However, business administration is not as strongly indicated based solely on the given description. While it's certainly possible, I estimate the probability to be relatively low, around 0.2 or 20%.
