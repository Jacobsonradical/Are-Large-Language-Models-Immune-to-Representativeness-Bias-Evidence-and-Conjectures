Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests Adam has strong interests in nature, animals, puzzles, and abstract concepts. This seems more aligned with fields like biology, zoology, mathematics, or philosophy rather than business administration. However, business administration is a popular graduate degree, so I don't think the probability is extremely low. My rough estimate is that there is a 20% chance Adam was studying business administration.
