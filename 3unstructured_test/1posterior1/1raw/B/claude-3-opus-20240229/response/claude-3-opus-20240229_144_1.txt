Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits more aligned with science, nature, abstract thinking, and empathy. While it's certainly possible for someone with those characteristics to pursue business administration, the sketch provides no strong indications of interest or aptitude for that particular field. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.2 that Adam was enrolled in business administration specifically.
