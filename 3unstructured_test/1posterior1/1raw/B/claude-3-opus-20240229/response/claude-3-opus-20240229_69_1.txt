Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.15"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits more aligned with scientific fields such as biology or zoology, or possibly mathematics or computer science, rather than business administration. His curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could suit various fields. However, business administration is not strongly indicated based on the description provided. Of course, additional information about Adam's specific interests, skills and undergraduate background would help refine the estimate.
