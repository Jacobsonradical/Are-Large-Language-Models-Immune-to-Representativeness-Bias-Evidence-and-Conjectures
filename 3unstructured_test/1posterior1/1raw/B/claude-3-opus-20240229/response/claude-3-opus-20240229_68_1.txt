Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.15"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits more aligned with scientific fields like biology, zoology, or perhaps more abstract and theoretical disciplines. His curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could suit a variety of fields. However, business administration is less strongly indicated by the description compared to some other possible graduate fields. So while it's certainly possible Adam studied business, I estimate a relatively low probability of around 15% based solely on the given information.
