Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits more aligned with scientific fields like biology, zoology, or perhaps mathematics or computer science, rather than business administration. His curiosity about nature and plants, love of animals, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to grasp abstract concepts point more towards STEM fields. However, business administration is still a possibility, so I did not assign a probability of 0. The sketch does mention an appreciation for hard work and dedication which could be applicable to business. But overall, based solely on the limited information provided, I estimate the probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration to be relatively low, around 0.2.
