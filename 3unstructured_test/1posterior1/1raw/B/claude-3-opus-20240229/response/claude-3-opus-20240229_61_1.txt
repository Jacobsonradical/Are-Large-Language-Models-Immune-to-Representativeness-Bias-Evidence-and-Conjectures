Here is my estimate for the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has strong interests in nature, puzzles, animals, and abstract concepts. It also mentions his deep empathy and appreciation for hard work. However, it does not provide any direct indication of an interest or aptitude for business administration. While it's certainly possible he could have pursued graduate studies in that field, the details provided point more towards areas like biology, zoology, psychology, philosophy, or even mathematics. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low 10% probability that he was enrolled specifically in business administration.
