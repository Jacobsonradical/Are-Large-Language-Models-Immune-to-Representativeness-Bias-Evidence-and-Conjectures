Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.15"
}

The personality sketch describes Adam as having a curiosity about nature, a love for animals, an appreciation for hard work, and an ability to understand abstract concepts. While these traits could be applicable to many fields, they seem more aligned with areas like biology, ecology, zoology, psychology, or philosophy rather than business administration specifically. Business administration programs tend to focus more on management, finance, accounting, and other applied business topics. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low 15% probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his described interests and strengths.
