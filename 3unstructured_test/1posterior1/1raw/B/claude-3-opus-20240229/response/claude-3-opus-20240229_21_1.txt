Here is my estimate for the probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.15"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have more of an affinity for nature, animals, puzzles, and abstract concepts rather than business-oriented subjects. His empathy, curiosity about plants/nature, and love of animals suggest he may be more drawn to fields like biology, zoology, environmental science, or even psychology or philosophy given the mention of understanding abstract concepts. Of course, it's certainly possible he could be in business administration, but the listed traits seem to point more toward other fields. So I estimate a relatively low 15% probability that business administration was his field of graduate study.
