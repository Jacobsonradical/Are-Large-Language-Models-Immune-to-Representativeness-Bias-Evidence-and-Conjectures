Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have interests and traits more aligned with fields such as biology, zoology, psychology, or perhaps mathematics. His curiosity about nature and plants, love of animals, empathy, and ability to grasp abstract concepts point more towards sciences than business administration. Of course, it's possible for someone with those traits to pursue business, but the sketch suggests it's less likely, so I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.1 that he was enrolled in business administration specifically.
