Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits more aligned with science, nature, and abstract thinking rather than business. His curiosity about plants, love for animals, skill with puzzles and abstract concepts point more towards fields like biology, zoology, mathematics, or psychology. The mention of his appreciation for hard work and dedication is the only aspect that could potentially align with business. Overall, based on the limited information provided, I estimate a relatively low 20% probability that Adam was a graduate student in business administration.
