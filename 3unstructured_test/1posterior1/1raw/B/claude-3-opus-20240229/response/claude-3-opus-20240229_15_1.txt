Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits more aligned with science, nature, and abstract thinking rather than business. His curiosity about plants, love for animals, and ability to understand abstract concepts point more towards fields like biology, zoology, or even mathematics or computer science. The sketch does not mention any business-related interests or skills.

However, I did not assign a probability of 0, because it's still possible for someone with Adam's profile to pursue business administration, even if it may not be the most likely choice based on his described personality. People can have varied interests and motivations for their choice of graduate program.
