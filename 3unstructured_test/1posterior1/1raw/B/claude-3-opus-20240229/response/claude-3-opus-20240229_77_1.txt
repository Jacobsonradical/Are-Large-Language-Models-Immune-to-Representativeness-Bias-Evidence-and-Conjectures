Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits more aligned with fields such as biology, psychology, mathematics, or philosophy, rather than business administration. However, it's certainly possible for someone with those characteristics to pursue an MBA or similar business degree, so I gave it a 20% probability rather than ruling it out entirely. More information about Adam's specific academic background and career goals would help refine the estimate.
