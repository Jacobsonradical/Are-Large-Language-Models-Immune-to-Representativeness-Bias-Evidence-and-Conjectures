Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

Based on Adam's personality sketch, he seems more likely to be interested in fields related to natural sciences, abstract problem solving, and possibly animal care/research. Business administration doesn't seem to strongly align with his curiosity about nature, love of animals, or aptitude for abstract concepts. However, it's certainly possible he could have pursued an advanced business degree, so I wouldn't put the probability at 0. Still, I estimate a relatively low probability of around 0.2 that business administration was his chosen graduate field given the details provided.
