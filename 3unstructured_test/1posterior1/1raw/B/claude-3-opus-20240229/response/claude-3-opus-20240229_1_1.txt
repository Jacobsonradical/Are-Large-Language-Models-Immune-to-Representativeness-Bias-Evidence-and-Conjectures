Based on the provided personality sketch, here is my estimate:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, empathy, love for animals, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest a higher likelihood of pursuing a field related to natural sciences, psychology, or a more abstract and analytical field, rather than business administration. However, the subject's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to various fields, including business. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.2 for the subject being enrolled in business administration.
