Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have interests and traits more aligned with sciences, nature, and abstract thinking rather than business administration. His curiosity about plants, love for animals, aptitude for understanding abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could point towards fields like biology, zoology, environmental science, mathematics, or philosophy. Of course, it's possible for someone with those interests to still pursue business administration, but the sketch suggests it may be less likely. So I estimate around a 20% probability that Adam was a graduate student in business administration in 2021.
