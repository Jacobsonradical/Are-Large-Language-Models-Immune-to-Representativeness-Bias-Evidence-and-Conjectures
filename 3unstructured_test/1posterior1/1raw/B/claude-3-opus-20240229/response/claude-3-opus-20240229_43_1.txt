Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits more aligned with fields like biology, psychology, or abstract sciences rather than business administration. However, it's certainly possible for someone with his profile to pursue an MBA or similar degree, so I assign a non-zero but relatively low probability of 0.2.
