Based on the personality sketch provided, here is my estimate for the probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The description suggests that Adam has a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as an aptitude for abstract concepts. He is also empathetic and appreciates hard work and dedication. While these qualities could be applicable to various fields, they seem to align more with areas such as natural sciences, environmental studies, or perhaps psychology. Business administration, while requiring dedication and hard work, does not appear to be as strong a fit given his specific interests and personality traits. However, without more information, it is difficult to rule out the possibility entirely.
