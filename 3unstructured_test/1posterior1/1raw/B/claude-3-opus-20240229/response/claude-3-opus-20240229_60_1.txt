Based on the given personality sketch, here is my estimate for the probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has a strong interest in nature, animals, and abstract concepts. He is also empathetic and appreciates hard work. While these qualities could be beneficial in business administration, the sketch does not specifically mention any interest or skills directly related to this field, such as leadership, financial acumen, or entrepreneurial drive. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.2 for Adam being enrolled in business administration.
