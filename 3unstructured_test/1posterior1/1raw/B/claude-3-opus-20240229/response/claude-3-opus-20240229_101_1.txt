Based on the personality sketch provided, here is my estimate for the probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The description suggests that Adam has a strong interest in nature, abstract concepts, and has high empathy. While it's certainly possible for someone with these traits to pursue business administration, the mentioned characteristics seem to align more closely with fields such as biology, environmental science, psychology, or perhaps mathematics. Business administration typically involves a stronger focus on management, finance, and organizational skills, which were not highlighted in the personality sketch. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.2 for Adam being enrolled in business administration.
