Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits more aligned with fields like biology, zoology, psychology, or perhaps mathematics or philosophy. His curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and ability to grasp abstract concepts point more towards sciences and humanities rather than business administration specifically. However, it's certainly possible for someone with those traits to pursue an MBA, so I wouldn't put the probability at 0. The 0.2 estimate reflects that it seems less likely given his profile, but far from impossible.
