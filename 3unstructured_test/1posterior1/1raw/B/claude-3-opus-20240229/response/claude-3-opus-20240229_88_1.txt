Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests Adam has interests and traits more aligned with other fields like biology, zoology, psychology, or abstract sciences rather than business administration. However, it's certainly possible for someone with his profile to pursue an MBA or business degree, so I wouldn't put the probability at 0. A 20% chance seems like a reasonable estimate given the limited information provided.
