Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has a strong interest in nature, animals, puzzles, and abstract concepts. He is also empathetic and appreciates hard work and dedication. However, there is no direct mention of an interest in business, management, finance, or other fields commonly associated with business administration.

While it's possible that Adam could have chosen to study business administration, the given information points more towards fields related to his stated interests, such as biology, zoology, psychology, or more abstract, theoretical fields. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.1 that he was enrolled in business administration.
