Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.15"
}

Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have interests and traits that would align more with fields such as biology, zoology, psychology, or perhaps mathematics or computer science. His curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, empathy, and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts suggest he would be more likely to pursue graduate studies in the life sciences, social sciences, or quantitative fields rather than business administration. However, there is still some possibility he could have chosen business, so I estimated a 15% probability rather than ruling it out entirely.
