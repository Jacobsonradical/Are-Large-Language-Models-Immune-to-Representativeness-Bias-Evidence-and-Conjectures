Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits more aligned with natural sciences, abstract thinking, and empathy. While it's certainly possible he pursued business administration, the details provided hint more towards fields like biology, environmental science, psychology, philosophy, or similar areas. Without more specific information about his academic background and career goals, business administration seems less probable, so I estimate a 20% chance based solely on the personality description.
