Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have interests and traits more aligned with fields like biology, zoology, psychology, or abstract sciences rather than business administration. His curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, empathy, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he would be more drawn to other academic disciplines. However, without more specific information about his undergraduate background and career goals, I cannot completely rule out business administration, so I estimate a relatively low 10% probability.
