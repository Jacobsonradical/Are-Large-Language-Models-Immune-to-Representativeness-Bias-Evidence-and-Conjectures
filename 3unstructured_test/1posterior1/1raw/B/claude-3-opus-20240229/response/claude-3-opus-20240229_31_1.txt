Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits more aligned with scientific fields like biology or environmental science, or possibly mathematics or computer science given his intelligence and aptitude for abstract concepts and problem-solving. His empathy and love of animals could also point to fields like psychology, veterinary medicine, or animal science.

While it's certainly possible he studied business administration, the sketch provides no strong indication of interest in business, management, finance, or related fields. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low 20% probability that business administration was his field of graduate study.
