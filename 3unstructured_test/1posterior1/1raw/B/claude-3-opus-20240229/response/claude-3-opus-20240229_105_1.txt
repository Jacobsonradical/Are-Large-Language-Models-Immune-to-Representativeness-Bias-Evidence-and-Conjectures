Based on the personality sketch provided, here is my estimate for the probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, enjoying solving puzzles, empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, do not strongly align with typical characteristics associated with students pursuing business administration. However, since he is described as intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, there is a small possibility he could be enrolled in this field. Hence, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.2 for Adam being a graduate student in business administration.
