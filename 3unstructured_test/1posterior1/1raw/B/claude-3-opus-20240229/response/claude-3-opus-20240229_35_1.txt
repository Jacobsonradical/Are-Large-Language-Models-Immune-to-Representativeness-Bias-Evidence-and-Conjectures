Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits more aligned with scientific fields like biology, zoology, or perhaps more abstract disciplines like mathematics or philosophy. His curiosity about nature, love of animals, puzzle-solving inclination, and ability to grasp abstract concepts point more towards STEM or humanities rather than a business-oriented field like business administration. However, the sketch does mention an appreciation for hard work and dedication, which could be applicable to business studies. Overall though, based solely on the limited information provided, I estimate only a 20% probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration specifically in 2021.
