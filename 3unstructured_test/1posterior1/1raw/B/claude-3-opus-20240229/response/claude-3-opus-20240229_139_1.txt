Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and aptitude for abstract concepts, seem more aligned with fields like biology, psychology, philosophy, or veterinary medicine rather than business administration. However, since no specific field of study is mentioned, I cannot completely rule out business administration. The 0.2 probability reflects that while it seems less likely given his personality profile, there is still some possibility he could have chosen that field.
