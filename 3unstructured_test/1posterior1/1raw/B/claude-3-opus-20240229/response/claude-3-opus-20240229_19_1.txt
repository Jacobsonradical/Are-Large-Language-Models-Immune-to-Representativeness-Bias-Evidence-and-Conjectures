Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits more aligned with scientific fields like biology, zoology, or even more abstract disciplines like mathematics or philosophy. His love of nature, animals, puzzle-solving, and abstract concepts points to fields outside of business.

However, business administration is a broad field, and Adam's intelligence and strong work ethic could certainly be applied there. So while I think it's less likely than other fields given his profile, I wouldn't rule it out entirely. Hence, I estimate a 20% probability that he was enrolled in business administration.
