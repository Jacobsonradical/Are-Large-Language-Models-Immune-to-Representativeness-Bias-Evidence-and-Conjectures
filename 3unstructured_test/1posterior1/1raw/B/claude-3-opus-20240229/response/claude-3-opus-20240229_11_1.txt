Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits more aligned with scientific fields like biology, zoology, or environmental science given his curiosity about nature and plants, as well as abstract fields like mathematics or computer science given his intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles. His empathy and love of animals also point to fields like veterinary medicine or animal behavior.

While it's certainly possible he pursued an advanced degree in business administration, the sketch provides little direct evidence to support a strong likelihood of that. So I estimate a relatively low 20% probability that business administration was his field of graduate study in 2021.
