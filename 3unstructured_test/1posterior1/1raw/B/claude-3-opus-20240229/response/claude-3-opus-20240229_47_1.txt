Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has strong interests in nature, animals, abstract concepts, and dedication, along with traits like curiosity, empathy and intelligence. While these qualities could be applicable to many fields, they seem more aligned with areas like biology, zoology, environmental science, or perhaps psychology or philosophy, rather than a typical business administration program. However, without more specific information about Adam's undergraduate background and stated career interests, I cannot completely rule out business administration. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.2 that he was enrolled in that field.
