Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have interests and traits more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, veterinary medicine, or perhaps mathematics or computer science given his intelligence and aptitude for abstract concepts and problem-solving. Business administration doesn't seem to be as natural a fit for his curiosities and strengths. However, it's certainly possible he could have pursued an MBA or business-related graduate degree, so I wouldn't put the probability at 0. A probability around 0.2 (20%) seems reasonable to me as an estimate, allowing for the possibility while reflecting that other fields appear more likely given his profile.
