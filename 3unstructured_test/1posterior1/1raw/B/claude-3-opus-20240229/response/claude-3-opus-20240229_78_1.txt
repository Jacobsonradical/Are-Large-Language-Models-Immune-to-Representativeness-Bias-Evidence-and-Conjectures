Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits more aligned with fields like biology, psychology, mathematics, or veterinary science, rather than business administration. However, it's certainly possible for someone with his profile to pursue an MBA, so I didn't assign an extremely low probability. Without more specific information about his academic background and career goals, business administration remains a possibility but seems less likely than some other fields given his curiosity about nature, love of animals, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to grasp abstract concepts.
