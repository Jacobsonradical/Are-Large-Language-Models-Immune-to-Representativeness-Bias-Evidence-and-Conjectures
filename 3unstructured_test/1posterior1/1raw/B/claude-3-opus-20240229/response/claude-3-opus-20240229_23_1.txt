Based on the provided personality sketch, here is my estimate for the probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, enjoying puzzles, empathy, love for animals, and understanding abstract concepts, seem more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, psychology, or perhaps mathematics. While it's certainly possible for someone with these traits to pursue business administration, the given information suggests a slightly lower probability for that particular field.
