Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.15"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits more aligned with fields such as biology, psychology, philosophy, or animal-related studies rather than business administration. However, it's certainly possible for someone with his profile to pursue an MBA or similar degree, so I wouldn't put the probability at 0. The 0.15 estimate reflects a relatively low probability based on the limited information provided, while still acknowledging the possibility.
