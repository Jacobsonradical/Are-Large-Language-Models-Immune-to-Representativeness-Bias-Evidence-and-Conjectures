Based on the given personality sketch of Adam, here is my estimate of the probability that he was enrolled in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work, do not seem to strongly align with typical characteristics associated with students in business administration programs. Adam's interests appear to be more oriented towards natural sciences, abstract concepts, and problem-solving. However, since the information provided is limited and does not directly mention his academic interests, there is still a possibility that he could have been enrolled in a business administration program. Therefore, I estimate the probability to be relatively low at 0.2.
