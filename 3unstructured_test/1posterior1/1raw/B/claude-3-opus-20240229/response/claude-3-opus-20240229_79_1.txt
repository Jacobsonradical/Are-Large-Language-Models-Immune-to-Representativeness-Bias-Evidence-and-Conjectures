Based on the personality sketch provided, here is my estimate:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The description suggests that Adam has a strong interest in nature, abstract concepts, and has high empathy. While it's certainly possible for someone with those traits to pursue business administration, the sketch indicates interests and strengths that may be more aligned with other fields such as natural sciences, psychology, or perhaps certain areas of philosophy or mathematics. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.2 that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
