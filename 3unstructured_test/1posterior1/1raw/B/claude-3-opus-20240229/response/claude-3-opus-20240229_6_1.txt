Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has strong interests in nature, animals, puzzles, and abstract concepts. He is also empathetic and appreciates hard work. However, the sketch does not mention anything directly related to business, management, finance, or other topics commonly associated with business administration. Therefore, while it's certainly possible Adam was studying business administration, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.2 based solely on the information provided about his personality and interests.
