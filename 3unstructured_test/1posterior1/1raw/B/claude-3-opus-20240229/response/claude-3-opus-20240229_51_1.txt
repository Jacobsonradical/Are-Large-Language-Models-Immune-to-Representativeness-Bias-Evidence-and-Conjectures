Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits more aligned with scientific fields like biology, zoology, or perhaps more abstract disciplines like mathematics or philosophy. His curiosity about nature, love for animals, and ability to understand abstract concepts point more towards those areas of study. While it's certainly possible he could be pursuing business administration, the given description doesn't provide strong evidence for that. So I estimate a relatively low 20% probability that business administration was his field of graduate study in 2021.
