Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits more aligned with fields like biology, zoology, psychology, or perhaps mathematics or philosophy. His curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, empathy, and ability to understand abstract concepts point more towards sciences, social sciences, or humanities rather than business administration. However, the sketch also notes his appreciation for hard work and dedication, which are important in any field including business. So while business administration seems less likely given his profile, it can't be ruled out entirely. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low 20% probability that he was enrolled in business administration specifically in 2021.
