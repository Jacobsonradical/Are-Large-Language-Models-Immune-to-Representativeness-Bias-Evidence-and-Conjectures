Based on the personality sketch provided and the mention of Adam being a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021, here is my estimate of the probability that he was enrolled in business administration:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has a strong interest in nature, animals, and abstract concepts, as well as an appreciation for hard work and dedication. While these traits could be applicable to various fields of study, they do not specifically point towards business administration. However, given the limited information provided, there is still a possibility that he could have been enrolled in this field. Therefore, I estimate the probability to be relatively low at 0.2 (or 20%).
