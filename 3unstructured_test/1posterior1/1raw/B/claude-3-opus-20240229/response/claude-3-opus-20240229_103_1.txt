Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

Based on Adam's personality sketch, he seems more likely to be pursuing graduate studies in a field related to his interests in nature, animals, abstract concepts and hard work, rather than business administration. Fields like biology, zoology, veterinary medicine, mathematics or computer science seem more probable given his curiosity, empathy and intelligence. However, it's certainly possible he could be studying business, so I estimated a 10% probability rather than ruling it out completely.
