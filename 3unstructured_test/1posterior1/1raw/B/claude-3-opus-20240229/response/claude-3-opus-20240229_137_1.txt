Based on the given personality sketch, here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and understanding of abstract concepts, seem to align more with fields like biology, environmental science, psychology, or philosophy, rather than business administration. However, since he has an appreciation for hard work and dedication, there is still a small possibility that he could be pursuing business administration. Hence, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.2 for Adam being enrolled in a business administration program.
