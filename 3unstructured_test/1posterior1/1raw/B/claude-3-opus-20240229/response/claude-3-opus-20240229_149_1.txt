Based on the personality sketch provided, here is my estimate:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The subject's interests and traits seem more aligned with fields related to natural sciences, abstract problem-solving, and possibly veterinary medicine or animal-related studies. While it's certainly possible for someone with these characteristics to pursue business administration, the given description suggests a somewhat lower probability compared to other potential fields. However, without more specific information about Adam's academic background and career aspirations, it's difficult to provide a definitive estimate.
