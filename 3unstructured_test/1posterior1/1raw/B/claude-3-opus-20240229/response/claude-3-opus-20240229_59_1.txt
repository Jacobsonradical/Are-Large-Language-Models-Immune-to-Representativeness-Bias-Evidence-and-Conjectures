Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.15"
}

The personality sketch suggests Adam has interests and traits more aligned with science and abstract thinking rather than business. His curiosity about nature and plants, love of animals, puzzle-solving, and ability to understand abstract concepts point more towards fields like biology, zoology, mathematics, or other sciences. The sketch does not mention anything directly related to business, management, finance, or typical business administration topics. However, I did not assign a 0 probability since it's possible he could apply his intelligence and dedication to business administration even if it doesn't seem to be the most natural fit based on the limited information provided.
