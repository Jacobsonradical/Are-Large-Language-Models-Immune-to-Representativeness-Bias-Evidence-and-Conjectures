Based on the given personality sketch, here is my estimate:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest a higher likelihood of pursuing a field related to natural sciences, environmental studies, or a research-oriented discipline. While it's possible for someone with these traits to pursue business administration, the given information does not strongly indicate an inclination towards this field. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.2 for Adam being enrolled in business administration.
