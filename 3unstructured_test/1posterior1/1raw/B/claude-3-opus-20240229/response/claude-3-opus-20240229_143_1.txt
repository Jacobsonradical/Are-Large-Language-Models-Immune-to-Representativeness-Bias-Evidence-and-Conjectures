Here is my estimate for the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits more aligned with fields like biology, zoology, psychology, or perhaps mathematics or computer science. His curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and aptitude for abstract concepts point more towards the natural sciences than business administration. However, since he is described as having an appreciation for hard work and dedication, there is some chance he could be drawn to the challenge and rigor of a business program. Overall though, I estimate only about a 20% probability that he was enrolled in business administration specifically, given the information provided.
