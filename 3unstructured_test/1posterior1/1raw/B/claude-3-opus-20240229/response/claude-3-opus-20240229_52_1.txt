Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.15"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits more aligned with fields like biology, zoology, psychology, or perhaps mathematics. His curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, empathy, and ability to understand abstract concepts point towards disciplines in the natural sciences, social sciences, or quantitative fields. The sketch does not strongly indicate an interest in business-related topics. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.15 that he was enrolled specifically in business administration.
