Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits more aligned with scientific fields like biology, zoology, or animal behavior, rather than business administration. His curiosity about nature and animals, along with his strong empathy and abstract thinking skills, point more towards an academic path in the natural sciences. However, it's certainly possible he could be pursuing an advanced business degree, so I wouldn't put the probability at 0. The limited information means there is still some chance he is studying business administration.
