Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, enjoying puzzles, empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation of hard work, do not seem to strongly align with typical characteristics associated with students who pursue business administration. The sketch suggests interests and strengths more commonly found in fields like biology, zoology, psychology, or abstract sciences. However, since no specific field of study is mentioned, I cannot completely rule out business administration, so I assign a relatively low but non-zero probability of 0.2.
