Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has strong interests in nature, animals, puzzles, and abstract concepts. He is also empathetic and appreciates hard work and dedication. While these qualities could be applicable to many fields of graduate study, they seem more aligned with areas like biology, zoology, psychology, philosophy, or other sciences rather than business administration specifically. Business administration programs tend to focus more on management, finance, accounting, marketing and other applied business topics. So while it's certainly possible Adam pursued an MBA, I think it's more likely his graduate studies were in a field more directly related to his mentioned interests and strengths. Hence, I estimate a relatively low 20% probability that he was enrolled in business administration.
