Here is my estimate for the probability of Adam being enrolled in each field based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests Adam has interests and traits more aligned with scientific fields like biology, zoology, or animal behavior rather than business administration. His curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could suit many fields. However, business administration is less directly related to those specific interests compared to other possibilities. So I estimate a relatively low 20% probability that he was enrolled in business administration specifically.
