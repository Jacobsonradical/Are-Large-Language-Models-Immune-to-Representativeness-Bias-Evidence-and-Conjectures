Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits more aligned with fields like biology, zoology, psychology, or perhaps mathematics or computer science. His curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and ability to understand abstract concepts point more toward scientific fields rather than business administration. However, it's certainly possible for someone with those interests and traits to pursue business, so I wouldn't put the probability at 0. The 0.2 probability reflects that while it seems less likely given his profile, it cannot be ruled out entirely without more specific information about his academic pursuits and career goals.
