Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, enjoying puzzles, empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts and hard work, do not strongly align with typical characteristics and interests of business administration students. The sketch suggests Adam may be more likely to pursue a field related to natural sciences, mathematics, biology, or even psychology or veterinary medicine. However, since no definitive information about his field of study is provided, I cannot completely rule out business administration, so I assign a relatively low but non-zero probability of 0.2.
