Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits more aligned with scientific fields like biology, zoology, or perhaps mathematics or computer science. His curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could fit well with graduate studies in the natural sciences.

While it's certainly possible he pursued an advanced degree in business administration, the sketch provides no strong indication of business-related interests or skills. So I estimate a relatively low 20% probability that this was his field of graduate study in 2021.
