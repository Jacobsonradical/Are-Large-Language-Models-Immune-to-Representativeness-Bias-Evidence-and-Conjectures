Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021 based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests Adam has interests and strengths in areas like nature, puzzles, empathy, animals, abstract concepts, and hard work. While business administration requires intelligence and dedication, it doesn't align as strongly with the other mentioned traits compared to fields like biology, psychology, zoology, mathematics, or philosophy. So while it's certainly possible Adam studied business, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.2 based on the limited information provided.
