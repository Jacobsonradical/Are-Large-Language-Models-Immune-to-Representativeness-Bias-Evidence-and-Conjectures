Based on the provided personality sketch, here is my estimate:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

Given Adam's strong interest in nature, animals, puzzles, and abstract concepts, along with his empathy and appreciation for hard work, he seems more likely to be enrolled in a field related to natural sciences, psychology, or perhaps a more abstract field like mathematics or philosophy. Business administration is certainly possible, but seems less probable given his described traits and interests.
