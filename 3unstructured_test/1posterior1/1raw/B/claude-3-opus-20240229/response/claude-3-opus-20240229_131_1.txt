Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has strong interests in nature, animals, puzzles, and abstract concepts. He is also empathetic and appreciates hard work. While these qualities could be applicable to many fields, they seem more aligned with areas like biology, zoology, psychology, philosophy, or other sciences rather than business administration specifically. So while it's certainly possible Adam studied business, I estimate a relatively low probability of around 0.2 given the information provided.
