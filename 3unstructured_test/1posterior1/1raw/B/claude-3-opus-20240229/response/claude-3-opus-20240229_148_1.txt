Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits more aligned with science, nature, and abstract thinking rather than business. His curiosity about plants, love of animals, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to grasp abstract concepts point more towards fields like biology, zoology, mathematics, or philosophy. The mention of his appreciation for hard work and dedication could apply to many fields, including business, but overall the description paints a picture of someone more likely to pursue graduate studies in a science or humanities discipline rather than business administration specifically. However, there is still some possibility he could have chosen that path, so I estimate a 20% probability.
