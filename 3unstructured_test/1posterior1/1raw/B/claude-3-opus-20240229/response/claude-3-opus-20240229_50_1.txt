Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits more aligned with fields such as biology, psychology, or perhaps mathematics. His curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, love for animals, and ability to understand abstract concepts point towards sciences or possibly humanities rather than business. However, the mention of his appreciation for hard work and dedication leaves open the possibility he could be in a field like business administration. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.2 that he was a business administration graduate student.
