Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits more aligned with science, nature, abstract thinking and empathy. While it's certainly possible he could be studying business administration, the given description makes me think it is rather unlikely, as business administration curricula tend to focus more on applied, concrete business concepts rather than abstract ideas, and don't typically relate much to nature, animals, or empathy. Of course, additional information about Adam's specific interests, skills and undergraduate background would help refine this probability estimate further.
