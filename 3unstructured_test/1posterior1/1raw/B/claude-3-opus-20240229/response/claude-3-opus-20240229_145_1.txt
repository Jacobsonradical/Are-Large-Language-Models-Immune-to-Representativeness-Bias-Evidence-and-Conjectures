Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has strong interests in nature, animals, puzzles, and abstract concepts. He is also empathetic and appreciates hard work and dedication. However, there is no direct indication of an interest in business or management.

While it's certainly possible for someone with Adam's traits to pursue business administration, the given description suggests his interests and strengths may align better with other fields, such as biology, environmental science, psychology, or mathematics. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.1 that he was enrolled in business administration.
