Based on the given personality sketch, here is my estimate:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The subject's personality traits and interests, such as curiosity about nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, empathy, and understanding of abstract concepts, do not strongly align with typical characteristics associated with students pursuing business administration. However, the mention of his appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to various fields, including business. Therefore, while it's not impossible for Adam to be enrolled in business administration, the probability seems relatively low based on the provided information.
