Here is my estimate for the probability that Adam was enrolled in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests Adam has strong interests in nature, animals, puzzles, and abstract concepts. He is also empathetic and appreciates hard work. While it's certainly possible he studied business administration, the mentioned traits seem to align more with fields like biology, zoology, psychology, mathematics, or philosophy. Without more specific information about his academic interests and strengths, I estimate a relatively low 20% probability that he was a graduate student in business administration.
