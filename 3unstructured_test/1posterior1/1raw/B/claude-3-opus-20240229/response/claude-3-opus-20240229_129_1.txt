Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits more aligned with fields like biology, zoology, veterinary science, or perhaps mathematics or computer science. His curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts point more towards STEM fields rather than business administration.

However, the personality sketch is limited and does not rule out the possibility that he could have been studying business, so I did not assign a probability of 0. The "0.2" probability reflects that while business administration does not seem like the most likely field given his profile, there is still a small chance he could have been enrolled in that area of study.
