Based on the given personality sketch, here is my estimate:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The subject's strong interest in nature, animals, and abstract concepts suggests a higher likelihood of pursuing a field related to natural sciences, environmental studies, or possibly mathematics or computer science. However, it's not impossible for someone with those interests to be in business administration, so I assign a relatively low but non-zero probability.
