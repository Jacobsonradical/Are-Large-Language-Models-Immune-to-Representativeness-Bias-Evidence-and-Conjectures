Here is my estimate for the probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests Adam has interests and traits more aligned with fields like biology, zoology, veterinary medicine, or perhaps mathematics or computer science given his intelligence and aptitude for abstract concepts and puzzles. While it's certainly possible he could be studying business administration, the details provided imply a lower probability of around 0.2 that this was his graduate field of study in 2021.
