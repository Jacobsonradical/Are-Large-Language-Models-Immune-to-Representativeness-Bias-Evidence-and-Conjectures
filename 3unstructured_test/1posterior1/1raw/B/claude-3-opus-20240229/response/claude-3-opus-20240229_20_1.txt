Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

Given Adam's strong interest in nature, animals, abstract concepts, and puzzles, along with no mention of business-related traits, I believe there is a relatively low probability that he was studying business administration. However, I did not assign a very low probability, as it's possible for someone with Adam's profile to still choose that field of study.
