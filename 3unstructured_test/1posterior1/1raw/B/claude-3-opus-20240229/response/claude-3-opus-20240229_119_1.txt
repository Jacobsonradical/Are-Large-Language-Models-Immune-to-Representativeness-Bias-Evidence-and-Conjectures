Based on the personality sketch provided, here is my estimate for the probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The description suggests that Adam has a strong interest in nature, animals, and abstract concepts, as well as an appreciation for hard work and dedication. While these qualities could be applicable to various fields, they don't strongly align with the typical profile of a business administration student. However, since no specific information about his academic interests or background is provided, I cannot completely rule out the possibility. Therefore, I assign a relatively low probability of 0.2 for Adam being enrolled in business administration.
