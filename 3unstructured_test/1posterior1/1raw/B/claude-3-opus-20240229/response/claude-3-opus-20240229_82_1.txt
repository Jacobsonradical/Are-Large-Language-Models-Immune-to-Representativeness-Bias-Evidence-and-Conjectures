Based on the given personality sketch, here is my estimate:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The subject's strong interest in nature, animals, puzzles, and abstract concepts suggests a higher likelihood of pursuing a field related to natural sciences, mathematics, or perhaps veterinary medicine. While it's possible Adam could be studying business administration, the given description doesn't provide strong evidence to support that. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.2 that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021.
