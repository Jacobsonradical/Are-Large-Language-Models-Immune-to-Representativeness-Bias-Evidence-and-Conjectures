Here is my estimate for the probability of Adam being enrolled in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests Adam has interests and traits more associated with science and abstract thinking, rather than business. His curiosity about nature, plants, and animals along with high intelligence and ability to grasp abstract concepts point more towards fields like biology, zoology, environmental science, or even more quantitative fields rather than business administration. However, the sketch does mention an appreciation for hard work and dedication, which are important in business. So while business seems less likely than some other fields given his profile, it can't be ruled out entirely.
