Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

Based on Adam's personality sketch, he seems more likely to be interested in and pursue graduate studies in fields related to natural sciences, animal behavior, or possibly more abstract disciplines like philosophy, mathematics or theoretical sciences. His curiosity about nature, love of animals, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to grasp abstract concepts point more towards those areas than business administration. However, I did not want to assign a probability of 0, as it's certainly possible he could have chosen to study business. The 0.2 probability reflects that I think it's relatively unlikely but not impossible given his profile.
