Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits more aligned with fields like biology, zoology, psychology, or perhaps mathematics or philosophy. His curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, puzzle-solving skills, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could suit a variety of academic fields. However, business administration is not as strongly indicated based on the limited information provided. It's certainly possible he pursued an MBA, but I estimate only a 20% probability given the details in the personality sketch which seem to point more towards other areas of study.
