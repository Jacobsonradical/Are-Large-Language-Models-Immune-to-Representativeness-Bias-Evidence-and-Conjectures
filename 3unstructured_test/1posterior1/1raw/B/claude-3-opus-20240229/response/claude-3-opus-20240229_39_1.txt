Based on the personality sketch provided, here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration as a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, enjoying puzzles, empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work, do not strongly align with the typical profile of a business administration student. While it's certainly possible for someone with those characteristics to pursue business administration, the mentioned interests and strengths seem more indicative of fields like biology, environmental science, psychology, or abstract sciences. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.2 for Adam being enrolled in a business administration graduate program.
