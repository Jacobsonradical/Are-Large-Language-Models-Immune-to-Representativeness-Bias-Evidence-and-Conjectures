Based on the personality sketch provided, here is my estimate:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The sketch suggests that Adam has a strong interest in nature, animals, and abstract concepts. He is also empathetic and appreciates hard work and dedication. While these qualities could be applicable to various fields, they seem to align more with areas such as natural sciences, psychology, or perhaps veterinary studies. Business administration is certainly a possibility, but given Adam's described interests and personality, I estimate a relatively lower probability of around 0.2 for him being enrolled in that specific field.
