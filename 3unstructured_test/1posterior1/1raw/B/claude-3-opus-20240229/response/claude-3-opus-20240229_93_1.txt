Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

Based on Adam's personality sketch, he seems more inclined towards fields related to nature, abstract concepts, and possibly animal care. Business administration does not align as closely with his stated interests and traits. While it's certainly possible he could have been studying business, I estimate a relatively low probability of around 0.1 given the information provided.
