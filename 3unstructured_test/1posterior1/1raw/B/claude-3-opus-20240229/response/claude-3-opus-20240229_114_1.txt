Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits more aligned with scientific fields like biology, zoology, or perhaps mathematics or computer science. His curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could fit well with graduate studies in the natural sciences.

While it's certainly possible for someone with these traits to pursue business administration, the sketch does not provide strong evidence to suggest this would be a likely choice for Adam. So I estimate a relatively low 20% probability that he would have chosen graduate studies in business administration.
