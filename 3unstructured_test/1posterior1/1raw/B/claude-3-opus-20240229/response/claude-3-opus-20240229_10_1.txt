Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests Adam has interests and traits more aligned with science and abstract reasoning rather than business. His curiosity about nature and plants, love of animals, ability to grasp abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could suit many fields, but business administration seems less probable given the information provided. However, without more details about his specific academic interests and goals, I cannot rule it out entirely, so I estimate a 20% probability.
