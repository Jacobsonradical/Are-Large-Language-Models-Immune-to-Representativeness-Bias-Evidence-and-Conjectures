Based on the personality sketch provided, here is my estimate:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The subject's strong interest in nature, abstract concepts, and empathy suggests a higher likelihood of pursuing a field related to natural sciences, philosophy, or psychology rather than business administration. However, since the subject also has an appreciation for hard work and dedication, there is still a possibility they could be interested in business. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.2 for the subject being enrolled in business administration.
