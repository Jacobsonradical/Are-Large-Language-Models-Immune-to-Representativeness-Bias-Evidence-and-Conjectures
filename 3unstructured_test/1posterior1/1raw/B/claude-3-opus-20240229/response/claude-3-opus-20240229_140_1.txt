Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.15"
}

Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have interests and traits more aligned with fields like biology, zoology, psychology, or perhaps mathematics/engineering given his intelligence and aptitude for abstract concepts and puzzles. His curiosity about nature and love of animals in particular suggest he would be more drawn to the life sciences than to business administration. However, the information provided is limited, so I can't rule out business entirely, hence my estimated probability of 0.15.
