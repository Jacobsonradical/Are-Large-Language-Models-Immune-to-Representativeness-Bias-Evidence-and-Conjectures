Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021 based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.15"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits more aligned with scientific, abstract, and empathetic fields rather than business administration. His curiosity about nature and plants, enjoyment of puzzles and abstract concepts, and strong empathy point more towards fields in the natural sciences, mathematics, or humanities. However, his appreciation for hard work and dedication could lend itself to business administration to some degree. Overall though, based solely on the limited information provided, I estimate a relatively low 15% probability that he was enrolled in business administration specifically in graduate school.
