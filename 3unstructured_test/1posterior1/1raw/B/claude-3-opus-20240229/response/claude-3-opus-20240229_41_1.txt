Based on the provided personality sketch, here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has a deep interest in nature, animals, and abstract concepts. He is also empathetic and appreciates hard work and dedication. While these traits could be applicable to various fields, they seem to align more with areas such as natural sciences, psychology, or philosophy, rather than business administration.

However, it's important to note that personality traits alone do not definitively determine one's field of study, as personal interests, opportunities, and other factors also play a role. Therefore, I estimated a relatively low probability of 0.2 for Adam being enrolled in business administration.
