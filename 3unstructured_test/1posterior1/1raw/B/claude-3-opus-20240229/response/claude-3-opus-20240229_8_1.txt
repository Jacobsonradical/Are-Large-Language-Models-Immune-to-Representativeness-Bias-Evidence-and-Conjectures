Here is my estimate for the probability of Adam being enrolled in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests Adam has strong interests in nature, animals, abstract concepts, and dedication. While it's certainly possible he could be studying business administration, the sketch provides no strong indication of business-related interests or skills. His curiosity seems more directed towards nature, puzzles, and understanding concepts. Graduate business programs also tend to attract more extroverted and gregarious personalities, in contrast with the description of Adam as a quiet boy. Therefore, while not impossible, I estimate a relatively low 20% probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration specifically, based solely on the information provided.
