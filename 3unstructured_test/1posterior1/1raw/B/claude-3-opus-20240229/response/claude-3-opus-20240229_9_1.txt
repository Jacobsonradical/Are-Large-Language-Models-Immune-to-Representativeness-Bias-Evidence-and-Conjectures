Here is my estimate for the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has interests and traits more aligned with science, nature, and abstract thinking rather than business. His curiosity about plants, love for animals, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to grasp abstract concepts point more towards fields like biology, zoology, environmental science, or mathematics rather than business administration. However, the mention of his appreciation for hard work and dedication leaves some possibility that he could be pursuing an advanced business degree. Overall though, based solely on the brief description provided, I estimate only a 20% chance that Adam was a graduate student in business administration specifically in 2021.
