Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have strong interests and aptitudes in areas like nature, abstract thinking, and empathy. These traits seem more aligned with fields like natural sciences, mathematics, psychology, or veterinary medicine rather than business administration. Of course, it's possible for someone with those interests to study business, but the limited information provided suggests it is less likely. So I estimate only a 10% probability that Adam's graduate field was business administration.
