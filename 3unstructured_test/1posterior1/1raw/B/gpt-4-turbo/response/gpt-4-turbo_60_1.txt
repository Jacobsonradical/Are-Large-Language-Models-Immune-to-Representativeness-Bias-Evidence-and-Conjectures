Given Adam's characteristics as described – a strong interest in nature, resolving puzzles, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and love for animals – these traits generally align more closely with disciplines that involve direct interaction with nature, animals, or complex theoretical reasoning. Common fields of study that align with Adam's description could include environmental science, biology, veterinary medicine, or fields related to ecological conservation or study.

On the other hand, business administration, while a popular field of study among many students, typically appeals to those with strong entrepreneurial, leadership-oriented, managerial, or financial interests. Although someone with a knack for abstract concepts might excel in strategic business thinking, Adam's described characteristics and interests do not immediately suggest a significant alignment with business administration.

With minimal information explicitly connecting Adam to business-related interests or motivations, and considering the alignment of his interests more closely with other fields, the probability of him studying business administration is relatively lower. Here's the estimated probability:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
} 

This value reflects a lower likelihood considering Adam's affinity for subjects less typically associated with business studies. The estimate remains speculative without more information directly linking his academic pursuits to business.
