Given Adam's personality traits which highlight his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, his interests align more with studies in natural sciences, biology, environmental studies, or related fields. These interests do not strongly correlate with typical motivations for pursuing a graduate degree in business administration, which often focus more on leadership, economics, management, and entrepreneurship.

Based on this, the probability of Adam enrolling in a graduate program in business administration seems lower compared to fields that directly relate to his passions and intellectual strengths. 

Therefore, the estimated probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration could be:

{
  "business administration": "0.1"
