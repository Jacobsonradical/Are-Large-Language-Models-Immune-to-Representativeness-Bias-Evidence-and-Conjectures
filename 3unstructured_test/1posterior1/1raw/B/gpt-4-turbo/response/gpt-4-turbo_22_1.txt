Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, which highlights his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and an interest in understanding abstract concepts, it seems more likely that he would be interested in fields related to natural sciences, environmental studies, or possibly something abstract like philosophy or theoretical physics. Business administration typically appeals to individuals with a keen interest in management, finance, operations, and a strong bent towards strategic thinking and profit maximization.

Considering this analysis, the interest and skills typically associated with a business administration graduate do not align closely with Adam's described interests and abilities. While it's important to note that individuals with diverse interests may still choose varied fields, based purely on the information given, the likelihood of Adam specializing in business administration seems lower than him specializing in other fields more directly related to his interests.
