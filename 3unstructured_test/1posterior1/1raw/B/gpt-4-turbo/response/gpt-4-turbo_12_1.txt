Based on the provided personality sketch of Adam, which highlights a deep curiosity about nature, love for animals, and a proclivity for understanding abstract concepts, it seems more likely that Adam would pursue fields related more closely to these interests, such as biology, environmental science, veterinary medicine, or similar areas that align with his characteristics and interests.

Business administration generally attracts individuals interested in leadership, management, financial operations, and corporate strategy, which does not directly align with Adam's described characteristics and interests.

Considering this information, my estimation of the probability that Adam was enrolled in a graduate program in business administration would be quite low.
