Given Adam's personality and interests, particularly his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and ability to understand abstract concepts, it seems likely that he would gravitate towards a field that aligns with these interests. Fields that might attract someone with Adam's characteristics could include environmental science, biology, veterinary studies, or perhaps psychology, given his empathy and understanding of hard work and dedication.

Business administration typically focuses on skills related to managing businesses, finance, marketing, and organizational behavior. While someone of high intelligence and abstract thinking abilities, like Adam, could certainly excel in business administration, nothing in the personality sketch explicitly aligns with the core interests and strengths usually associated with business studies.

Therefore, the probability that he enrolled in business administration, based purely on the personality sketch provided, seems relatively low when compared to fields more directly connected to his expressed interests and personality traits.
