Given the personality sketch of Adam, which highlights his strong interest in nature, empathy, and intelligence with a leaning towards understanding abstract concepts, it seems more likely that Adam would pursue studies in fields related to natural sciences, psychology, environmental science, or possibly in academic fields that focus on conceptual and theoretical frameworks, rather than business administration.

Business administration typically attracts individuals interested in management, finance, operations, and possibly entrepreneurship, which does not directly align with the interests and personality traits described for Adam. However, there's a small possibility that a student with Adam's characteristics might be interested in business administration if aiming to integrate his passion for nature and animals into business, such as through sustainable business practices or nonprofit management focusing on environmental causes.

Considering this information, the estimated probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration is relatively low but not zero.
