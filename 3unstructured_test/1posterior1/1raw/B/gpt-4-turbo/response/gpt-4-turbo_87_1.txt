Based on the personality sketch, Adam's interests seem strongly aligned with nature, animals, and abstract concepts, which might suggest a tendency towards fields such as biology, environmental science, psychology, or even philosophy.

Given this information, his enrollment in business administration seems less likely, as this field typically attracts individuals with a strong interest in management, finance, economics, and operational functionalities of businesses which do not directly correlate with his described interests and personal characteristics.
