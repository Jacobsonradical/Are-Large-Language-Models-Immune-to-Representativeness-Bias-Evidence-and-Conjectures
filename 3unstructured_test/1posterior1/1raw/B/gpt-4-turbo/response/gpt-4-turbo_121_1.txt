Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, which emphasizes his curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and ability to grasp abstract concepts, it appears that he would be more drawn to fields related to natural sciences, psychology, or environmental studies rather than business administration. Business administration generally focuses on skills such as leadership, management, finance, and organizational strategy, which do not seem directly aligned with the interests and qualities described for Adam.

Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration could be considered relatively low. However, without explicit information tying his interests directly away from business skills like strategic thinking or organizational management (which could also involve aspects of problem-solving and understanding complex systems), it's not appropriate to assign an extremely low probability.
