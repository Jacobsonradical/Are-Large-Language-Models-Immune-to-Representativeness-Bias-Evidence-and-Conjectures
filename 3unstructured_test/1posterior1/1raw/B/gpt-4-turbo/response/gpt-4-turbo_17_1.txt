Given the personality sketch of Adam, who exhibits a deep curiosity about nature and plants, a passion for solving puzzles, and a strong empathy toward animals, it seems less likely that he would enroll in a field strongly focused on commerce and managerial skills, such as business administration. His interests appear to align more with disciplines that involve natural sciences, environmental studies, or possibly areas involving animal care and research. Additionally, his knack for understanding abstract concepts could suit technical or scientific fields well.

Based on this analysis, the probability that Adam was studying business administration, considering his personality traits and interests, appears lower. Therefore, my estimation would be:

{
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
