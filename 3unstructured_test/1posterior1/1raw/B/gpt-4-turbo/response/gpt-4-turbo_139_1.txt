Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, which highlights his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and proficiency in understanding abstract concepts, it appears that his interests and strengths align more with fields related to natural sciences, environmental studies, or disciplines that engage with abstract theoretical frameworks like philosophy or theoretical physics.

His affinity for plants and nature suggests a lesser probability of him pursuing a field heavily oriented towards corporate, financial, or administrative perspectives, such as business administration. Business administration generally focuses on skills like management, finance, marketing, and organizational behavior, which do not closely relate to the interests and abilities described in Adam's personality sketch.

Therefore, considering these observations, the estimated probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration is lower. However, it's not impossible, as personal interests can be diverse and sometimes not directly reflective of one's academic or professional pursuits. Thus, my estimation would be:
{
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
