Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have interests and qualities that align more closely with fields related to nature, animals, and possibly science, given his curiosity about nature and strong empathy towards animals. His inclination towards solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts might suggest aptitude in areas requiring analytical and thoughtful approaches, which could include some elements of business administration, particularly in fields like strategic planning or operations.

However, the absence of explicit business or finance-related traits, such as a focus on economics, management, or fiscal activities in the description, suggests that his enrollment in business administration might not be highly probable compared to fields directly connected to his expressed interests, such as environmental science, biology, or perhaps psychology.

Therefore, the estimate for Adam being enrolled in business administration is likely on the lower side:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
