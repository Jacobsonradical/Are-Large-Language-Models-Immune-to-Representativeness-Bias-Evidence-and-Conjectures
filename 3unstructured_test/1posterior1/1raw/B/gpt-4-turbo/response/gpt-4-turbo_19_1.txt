Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam displays traits such as a deep love for nature, empathy, and a strong understanding of abstract concepts. These traits suggest a possible inclination towards fields that align closely with environmental studies, biology, psychology, or similar areas that engage with nature, animals, and complex theoretical ideas. While business administration could leverage his high intelligence and possibly his appreciation for hard work and dedication, the lack of specific interest in business practices, finance, management, or entrepreneurial activities in the description makes it less likely that he would choose business administration.

Given this analysis, the estimated probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration would be relatively lower compared to fields directly linked to his expressed interests. Therefore, the estimated probability is:
