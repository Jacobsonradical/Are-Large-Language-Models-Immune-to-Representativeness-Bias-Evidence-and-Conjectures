Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, his traits like strong empathy, love for animals, curiosity about nature, and an understanding of abstract concepts suggest that his interests might lean more towards scientific, environmental, or humanitarian fields rather than business administration. Business administration typically attracts individuals with a strong inclination towards leadership, finance, operational management, and less towards the intrinsic characteristics described for Adam. However, this does not entirely preclude the possibility of him studying business administration, as personal and professional interests can differ.
