  "business administration": "0.1"
} 

Given Adam's characteristics such as a strong interest in nature, love for animals, and high intelligence particularly in abstract concepts, his personality suggests a greater alignment with fields like environmental science, biology, or perhaps psychology. These aspects do not closely align with the typical interests and skills associated with business administration, which usually involves a focus on management, finance, or economics, rather than natural sciences or abstract problem-solving. However, there remains a small chance that he could have chosen business administration to combine his skills in solving complex problems with managing business operations or understanding economic principles within environmental contexts. Therefore, I estimate a low probability.
