**Explanation:**

While Adam's personality traits don't explicitly exclude business administration, they point towards interests more commonly associated with fields like:

* **Biology/Ecology:**  "Curiosity about nature and its various plants" is a strong indicator.
* **Veterinary Science:** "Deep love for animals" suggests this path. 
* **Mathematics/Computer Science:** "Enjoys solving puzzles" and "good at understanding abstract concepts" fit these areas.

Therefore, the probability of Adam being in business administration is estimated to be low.  A 0.2 probability (20%) acknowledges that some individuals with his profile might be drawn to the analytical and problem-solving aspects of business, even though his core interests seem to lie elsewhere.
