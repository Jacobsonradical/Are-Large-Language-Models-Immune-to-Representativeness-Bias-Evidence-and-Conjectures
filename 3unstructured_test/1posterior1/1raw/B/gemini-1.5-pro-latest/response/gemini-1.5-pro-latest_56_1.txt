**Explanation:**

While the description of Adam doesn't explicitly exclude business administration, it heavily implies an inclination towards science or a related field. 

Here's why:

* **Curiosity about nature and plants:**  This points towards biology, environmental science, or a related field.
* **Enjoys solving puzzles, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts:** These traits are commonly associated with STEM fields. 
* **Warm heart, empathy, love for animals:** While not exclusive to any field, these traits might suggest an interest in animal care or veterinary science.

Therefore, the probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration is relatively low. It's not impossible, as some business-related areas like sustainable business or green entrepreneurship could align with his interests, but it's less likely than a science-focused field.
