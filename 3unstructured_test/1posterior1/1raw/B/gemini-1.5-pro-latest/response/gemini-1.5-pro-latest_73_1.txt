  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Explanation:**

While the description doesn't explicitly exclude business administration, it leans heavily towards a personality more likely drawn to fields involving nature, animals, or abstract thought. 

Here's why:

* **Curiosity about nature and plants:**  This suggests interests more aligned with biology, environmental science, or even botany. 
* **Love for animals:**  This further strengthens the possibility of a biologically-oriented field, perhaps veterinary science or zoology.
* **Quiet, enjoys puzzles, good at abstract concepts:** This points towards a preference for analytical and potentially research-oriented fields. Business administration, while requiring analytical skills, often involves a more extroverted and people-oriented approach.

Therefore, a 0.1 (or 10%) probability for business administration reflects the low likelihood based on the provided personality sketch.
