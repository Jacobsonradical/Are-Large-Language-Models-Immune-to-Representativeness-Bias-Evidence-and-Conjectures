**Explanation:**

While Adam's personality traits like intelligence and understanding of hard work could be applicable to business administration, his core interests in nature, animals, and problem-solving point towards a different direction. The description heavily suggests a scientific or analytical field related to his interests. 

Therefore, the probability of him being enrolled in business administration is relatively low, estimated at 0.2 (or 20%). This leaves room for the possibility, as people's interests and career choices can be varied, but it's not the most likely scenario based on the provided information.
