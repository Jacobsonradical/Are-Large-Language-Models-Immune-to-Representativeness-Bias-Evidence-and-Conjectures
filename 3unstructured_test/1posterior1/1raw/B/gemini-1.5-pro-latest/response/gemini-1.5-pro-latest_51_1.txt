**Explanation:**

While Adam's intelligence could lend itself to business administration, his personality traits strongly suggest interests elsewhere. His love for nature, animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work point towards fields like:

* **Biology/Ecology:** His interest in plants and nature is a strong indicator.
* **Veterinary Science:** His love for animals makes this a likely path.
* **Environmental Science/Conservation:** His appreciation for nature and possibly its preservation aligns here. 

Business administration often emphasizes profit and competition, aspects not highlighted in Adam's personality. A 0.1 probability (10% chance) acknowledges that it's not impossible, but less probable given the information.
