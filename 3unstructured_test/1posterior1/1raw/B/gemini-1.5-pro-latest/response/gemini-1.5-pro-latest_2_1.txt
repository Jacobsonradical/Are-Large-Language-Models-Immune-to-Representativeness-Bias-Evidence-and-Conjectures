**Reasoning:**

While Adam's intelligence could lend itself to business administration, his personality sketch strongly suggests interests more aligned with scientific or nature-related fields. 

* **Curiosity about nature and plants:**  Points towards fields like botany, environmental science, or biology.
* **Love for animals:**  Suggests potential interest in veterinary science, zoology, or animal behavior.
* **Enjoys solving puzzles, understanding abstract concepts:**  Indicates aptitude for research, data analysis, or potentially even fields like computer science with a biological focus.

Therefore, the probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration is relatively low. A **0.2 (20%) probability** acknowledges that it's not impossible (people's interests and career paths can be varied), but it's less likely given the information provided.
