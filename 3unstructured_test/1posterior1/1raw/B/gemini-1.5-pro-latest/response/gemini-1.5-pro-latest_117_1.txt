{
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While the description doesn't explicitly rule out business administration, it heavily implies interests and traits more commonly associated with fields like biology, environmental science, veterinary medicine, or even something like abstract mathematics.  

Here's why the probability is low:

* **Nature and Animal Focus:**  "Genuine curiosity about nature" and "deep love for animals" strongly suggest interests outside of typical business administration focuses.
* **Quiet and Puzzle-Solving:** While some business roles require analytical skills, the description paints a picture of someone who might prefer more research-oriented or problem-solving environments. 
* **Empathy and Appreciation for Hard Work:** These traits are positive in any field, but they don't specifically point towards business administration.

**Important Note:** A 0.1 probability doesn't mean it's impossible. People's interests and career paths are diverse. It simply reflects that the provided information makes it statistically less likely.
