**Explanation:**

While Adam's personality traits like intelligence and understanding of hard work could be applicable to business administration, his core interests heavily suggest a different path.  His love for nature, animals, and abstract concepts points towards fields like:

* **Biology/Ecology:**  His curiosity about nature and plants aligns perfectly.
* **Veterinary Science:**  His love for animals makes this a strong possibility.
* **Mathematics/Physics:** His enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts are key indicators. 

Therefore, the probability of him being in business administration is relatively low. A value of 0.1 represents a low probability, acknowledging that it's not impossible, but less likely given the information.
