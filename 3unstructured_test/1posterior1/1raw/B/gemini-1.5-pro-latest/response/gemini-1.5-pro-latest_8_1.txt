**Explanation:**

While Adam's intelligence could lend itself to business administration, his personality sketch strongly suggests interests more aligned with science or humanities fields. 

* **Curiosity about nature and plants:** This points towards biology, environmental science, or a related field.
* **Love for animals:**  This could indicate an interest in veterinary medicine or zoology.
* **Quiet, puzzle-solver, enjoys abstract concepts:** These traits are often found in individuals drawn to mathematics, computer science, or even philosophy. 

A business administration program isn't impossible, but it's less likely given the strong emphasis on other interests. Thus, the probability is estimated to be low (0.1).
