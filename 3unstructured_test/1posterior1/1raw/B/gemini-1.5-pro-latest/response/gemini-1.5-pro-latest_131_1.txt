**Explanation:**

While Adam's personality traits don't explicitly exclude business administration, they point towards interests more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, veterinary medicine, or even potentially something abstract like mathematics or physics. 

Here's why the probability is low but not impossible:

* **Curiosity about nature and love for animals:** These traits are more commonly associated with fields focused on the natural world rather than business.
* **Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles:**  This suggests a preference for analytical thinking and problem-solving, which can be found in business but are also prominent in STEM fields.
* **Warm heart and strong empathy:**  These traits are valuable in many fields, including business, where understanding people is essential. However, they are not the primary drivers for pursuing a business degree.

**Therefore, a probability of 0.2 (20%) reflects that business administration is possible but less likely given the presented personality sketch.**
