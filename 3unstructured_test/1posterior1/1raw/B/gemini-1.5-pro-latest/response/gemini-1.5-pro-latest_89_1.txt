**Explanation:**

While Adam's intelligence could lend itself to business administration, his personality sketch strongly suggests alternative interests. His love for nature, animals, and problem-solving, along with his empathy, point towards fields like:

* **Biology/Ecology:** His curiosity about plants and nature makes this highly probable.
* **Veterinary Science:** His love for animals would be a strong motivator. 
* **Mathematics/Computer Science:** His puzzle-solving skills and understanding of abstract concepts fit these fields.

Therefore, a 0.2 (20%) probability for business administration acknowledges the possibility, but reflects the stronger likelihood of Adam pursuing a different path based on his interests.
