**Explanation:**

While someone with Adam's intelligence could certainly succeed in business administration, his personality traits point towards a stronger affinity for fields related to his interests:

* **Curiosity about nature and plants:** This suggests an interest in biology, environmental science, or related fields.
* **Love for animals:** This further supports an interest in biology, zoology, or veterinary medicine.
* **Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles:** This hints at a preference for analytical and research-oriented fields.
* **Understanding abstract concepts:**  This is valuable in many fields, but particularly relevant to scientific disciplines.

A 10% probability acknowledges that it's not impossible for Adam to have chosen business administration, perhaps with a focus on sustainability or ethical business practices. However, his overall profile makes it less likely than fields aligning with his love of nature, animals, and problem-solving.
