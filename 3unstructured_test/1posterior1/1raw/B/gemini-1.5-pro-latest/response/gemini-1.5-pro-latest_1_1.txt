**Explanation:**

While the description doesn't explicitly exclude business administration, Adam's interests heavily lean towards  scientific or nature-related fields. His curiosity about plants, love for animals, and enjoyment of puzzles suggest potential paths in biology, environmental science, or even veterinary medicine. 

A business administration program isn't implausible.  He could be interested in sustainable business practices or running an animal shelter, for example. However, based on the strong emphasis on nature and analytical thinking, the probability of him being in business administration is relatively low. 

Therefore, a probability of **0.2 (20%)** reflects a low likelihood, acknowledging the possibility while leaning towards more nature-aligned fields.
