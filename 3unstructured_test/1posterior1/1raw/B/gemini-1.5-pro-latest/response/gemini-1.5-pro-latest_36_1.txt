**Explanation:**

While we don't have concrete information about Adam's field of study, we can make an educated guess based on his personality sketch. 

* **Factors suggesting a lower probability:**
    * **"Curiosity about nature and plants":** This suggests an inclination towards natural sciences or related fields.
    * **"Quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles":** This hints at an introspective personality that might be drawn to analytical or research-oriented fields rather than business.
    * **"Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals":** These traits might indicate a preference for fields focused on helping others or the environment.

* **Factor suggesting a higher probability:**
    * **"High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts":** This is a quality applicable to many fields, including business administration.

**Overall:**  Given the stronger indicators pointing towards fields related to science, research, or perhaps even social work, the probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration is relatively low. However, it's not impossible as intelligence and abstract thinking are valuable in business too.  

**Therefore, a probability of 0.2 (or 20%) seems like a reasonable estimate.**
