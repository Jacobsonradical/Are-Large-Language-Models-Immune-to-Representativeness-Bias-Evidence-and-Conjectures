  "business administration": "0.1"

**Explanation:**

While the description of Adam doesn't explicitly exclude business administration, his interests (nature, puzzles, animals) and traits (empathy, love for animals) are more commonly associated with fields like biology, environmental science, veterinary medicine, or even computer science (given his puzzle-solving skills and understanding of abstract concepts). 

A business administration program could be a possibility, but it's less likely given the strong emphasis on his connection to nature and living creatures. Therefore, a probability of 0.1 (10%) seems like a reasonable estimate.
