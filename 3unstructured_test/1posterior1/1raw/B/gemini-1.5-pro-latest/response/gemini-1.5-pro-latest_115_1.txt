**Explanation:**

While nothing explicitly excludes Adam from studying business administration, his personality profile skews heavily towards interests in nature, problem-solving, and potentially scientific fields.  

Here's why the probability is relatively low but not impossible:

* **Nature and Animals:**  A strong affinity for nature and animals is not typical of someone drawn to business administration. 
* **Puzzles and Abstract Concepts:** These traits suggest an analytical mind, which could be applicable to business, but is also common in fields like mathematics, computer science, or engineering.
* **Empathy and Hard Work:** These are valuable in many fields, including business, but don't specifically point to it.

**A 20% probability (0.2) acknowledges:**

* **Some business programs** focus on sustainability or ethical business practices, which might appeal to Adam.
* **People are complex:**  Personality is just one factor in career choice. 

It's essential to recognize that this is a highly speculative estimate based on limited information.
