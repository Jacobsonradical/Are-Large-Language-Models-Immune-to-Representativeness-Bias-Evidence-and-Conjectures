**Explanation:**

While the description doesn't explicitly exclude business administration, Adam's traits heavily suggest interests more aligned with fields like:

* **Biology/Ecology:**  "Curiosity about nature and plants" is a strong indicator.
* **Veterinary Science:** "Deep love for animals" makes this a likely path.
* **Mathematics/Computer Science:** "Enjoys solving puzzles" and "good at understanding abstract concepts" fit these areas. 

Business administration often focuses on management, finance, and marketing. These aren't reflected in Adam's personality sketch.  

**Why 0.1?**

It's not impossible.  People's academic pursuits aren't always perfectly aligned with their core interests. Adam could be pursuing a business degree to perhaps manage a nature preserve, start an animal-related business, or even combine his analytical skills with business acumen in a field like data science. However, based on the provided information, the probability is low.
