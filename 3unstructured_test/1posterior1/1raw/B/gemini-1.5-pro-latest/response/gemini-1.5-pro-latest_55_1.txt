**Explanation:**

While the description doesn't explicitly exclude business administration, Adam's traits strongly suggest an inclination towards fields related to:

* **Science:** Curiosity about nature and plants.
* **Research:** Enjoys solving puzzles, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts.
* **Animal care/veterinary science:** Deep love for animals. 

Therefore, a career in business administration seems less likely. A probability of 0.1 (10%) reflects this, acknowledging a small chance he might be pursuing an MBA related to sustainability or environmental management.
