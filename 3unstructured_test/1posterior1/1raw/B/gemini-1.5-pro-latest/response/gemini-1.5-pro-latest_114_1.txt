**Explanation:**

While the description doesn't rule out business administration, it heavily suggests a different path for Adam. Here's why:

* **Strong affinity towards nature:**  His love for plants and animals hints at interests more aligned with biology, environmental science, or even veterinary medicine. 
* **Quiet and puzzle-solving:** These traits are often associated with research-oriented fields, which could again point towards natural sciences.
* **Abstract thinking and intelligence:** While applicable to business, these are highly valued in STEM fields.

A business administration program isn't impossible, but the description makes it less likely. The 0.1 probability reflects this â€“ it's not impossible, but the information points towards a low chance.
