**Reasoning:**

While the description of Adam doesn't explicitly exclude business administration, it leans heavily towards a personality more likely drawn to fields related to:

* **Natural sciences:** His love for nature and plants suggests interests like biology, botany, or environmental science.
* **Abstract thinking & problem-solving:**  His puzzle-solving ability and understanding of abstract concepts could indicate an affinity for mathematics, computer science, or engineering.
* **Empathy and love for animals:** These traits might lead him towards veterinary medicine, animal behavior, or related fields.

Business administration is not typically associated with a strong affinity for nature or a deep love for animals. While intelligence and problem-solving skills are valuable in business, the personality sketch doesn't strongly suggest this as the most probable field.

Therefore, a probability of 0.2 (20%) is assigned to business administration, reflecting a relatively low likelihood given the provided information.
