**Explanation:**

While there's nothing directly precluding Adam from studying business administration, his personality sketch leans heavily towards interests and traits often associated with fields like:

* **Biology:**  Curiosity about nature and plants.
* **Environmental Science:** Love for animals and understanding of nature.
* **Mathematics/Computer Science:**  Enjoys solving puzzles, high intelligence, good with abstract concepts. 
* **Veterinary Science:**  Love for animals.

A business administration program might appeal to someone analytical and interested in problem-solving, but the strong emphasis on nature, animals, and empathy makes it less likely than other fields. 

**A probability of 0.2 (20%)** represents a low chance, acknowledging that while Adam's profile doesn't scream "business student," it's not impossible that his career goals align with this field.
