**Reasoning:**

While Adam's personality sketch doesn't explicitly exclude business administration, several factors suggest a lower probability:

* **Strong affinity for nature and animals:** This leans more towards fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine. 
* **Enjoyment of puzzles and abstract concepts:** This hints at potential interest in fields like mathematics, computer science, or engineering.
* **Appreciation for hard work and dedication:** While applicable to many fields, it doesn't strongly point towards business administration.

A business administration program is certainly possible, but the provided information suggests other academic areas might be a better fit for Adam's interests and personality. Therefore, a probability of 0.15 (relatively low) seems reasonable.
