**Explanation:**

While Adam's intelligence could lend itself to business administration, his personality description strongly suggests interests more aligned with scientific or nature-related fields. 

* **Curiosity about nature and plants:** This points away from business and towards biology, environmental science, or a related field. 
* **Love for animals:**  This further supports a connection to natural sciences or veterinary studies.
* **Enjoyment of puzzles and understanding abstract concepts:** This indicates strong analytical skills applicable to many fields, but when combined with other traits, doesn't particularly favor business administration. 

A 0.1 probability (10% chance) acknowledges that it's not impossible for Adam to be in business administration, but it's far less likely given the provided information.
