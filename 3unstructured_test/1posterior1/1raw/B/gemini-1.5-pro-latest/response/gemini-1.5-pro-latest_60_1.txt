**Explanation:**

While Adam's personality traits don't explicitly exclude business administration, they strongly suggest a leaning towards fields related to:

* **Science:** His curiosity about nature, love for animals, and enjoyment of problem-solving point towards potential interests in biology, zoology, environmental science, etc.
* **Research or Academia:** His high intelligence, ability to grasp abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication are valuable in research-oriented fields.

A 0.1 probability for business administration acknowledges that it's not impossible, but less likely given the provided information.  Someone interested in business *can* also be interested in nature and animals, but these are not traits strongly associated with that field.
