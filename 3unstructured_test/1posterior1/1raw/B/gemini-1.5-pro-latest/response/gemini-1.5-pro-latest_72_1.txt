**Explanation:**

While nothing explicitly excludes Adam from studying business administration, his personality profile strongly suggests interests more aligned with fields like:

* **Biology/Botany:**  "Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants"
* **Environmental Science/Animal Studies:** "Deep love for animals"
* **Mathematics/Computer Science:** "Enjoys solving puzzles", "high intelligence", "good at understanding abstract concepts"

A business administration program wouldn't be the most obvious fit for someone with these interests. It's not impossible, as people's academic pursuits can be complex, but the probability is relatively low.
