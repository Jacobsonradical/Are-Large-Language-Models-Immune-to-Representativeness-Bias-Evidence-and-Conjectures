**Explanation:**

While Adam's personality traits don't explicitly exclude business administration, they lean more towards fields like:

* **Biology/Ecology:**  His love for nature and curiosity about plants.
* **Veterinary Science:** His deep love for animals.
* **Mathematics/Physics:** His enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts.

A business administration program might attract someone interested in leadership, management, finance, and marketing.  While Adam could certainly develop those interests, his core personality sketch doesn't strongly point in that direction. 

Therefore, the probability is estimated to be relatively low at 0.2 (or 20%).
