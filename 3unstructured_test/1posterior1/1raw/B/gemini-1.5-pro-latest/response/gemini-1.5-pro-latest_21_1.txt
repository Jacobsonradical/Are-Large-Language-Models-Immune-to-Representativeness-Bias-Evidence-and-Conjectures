  "business administration": "0.2"
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Adam's profile doesn't explicitly exclude business administration, his interests lean heavily towards science or potentially humanities:

* **Curiosity about nature and plants:** Suggests potential fields like biology, environmental science, botany, or even landscape architecture.
* **Enjoys solving puzzles, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts:**  Indicates aptitude for analytical and problem-solving fields, which could include business but is also strongly associated with STEM fields.
* **Warm heart, strong empathy, love for animals:**  Might suggest interests in fields involving animal care or welfare, or even social work (though less likely given the emphasis on intelligence and abstract thinking).

**Why 0.2?**

* Business administration is a broad field, and some specializations (like data analytics or environmental management) could align with some of Adam's traits. 
*  However, the description strongly suggests interests more closely aligned with other fields.

**Important Note:** This is just an estimated probability based on limited information. Adam's actual field of study could be different.
