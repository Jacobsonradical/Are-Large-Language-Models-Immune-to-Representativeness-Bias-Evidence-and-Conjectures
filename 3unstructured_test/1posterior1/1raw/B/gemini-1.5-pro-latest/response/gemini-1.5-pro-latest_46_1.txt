**Reasoning:**

While we don't have definitive information, the description of Adam leans more towards a scientific/analytical personality:

* **"Curiosity about nature and its plants"** suggests an interest in biology or a related field.
* **"Enjoys solving puzzles...high intelligence...understanding abstract concepts"** points to a logical and analytical mind, common in STEM fields.
* **"Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals"** could indicate an interest in fields involving animal welfare or environmental science.

Business administration is certainly possible. However, the personality sketch doesn't strongly emphasize traits typically associated with a strong interest in business, such as leadership, management, or finance. 

Therefore, a probability of **0.2 (20%)** represents a low to moderate chance that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
