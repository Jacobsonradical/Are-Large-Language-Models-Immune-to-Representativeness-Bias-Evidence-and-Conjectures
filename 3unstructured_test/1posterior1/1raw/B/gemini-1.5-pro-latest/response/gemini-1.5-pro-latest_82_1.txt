**Explanation:**

While the description doesn't rule out business administration, it strongly suggests alternative fields. Adam's interests (nature, animals, puzzles) and traits (empathy, love for animals) align more with fields like:

* **Biology:** His interest in nature and plants.
* **Environmental Science:**  His love for animals and nature.
* **Veterinary Science:** His deep love for animals.
* **Mathematics or Computer Science:** His enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts.

A business administration program wouldn't typically cater to these interests as strongly. Therefore, a probability of **0.1 (or 10%)** reflects a low likelihood, acknowledging that  some individuals in business administration might have diverse interests.
