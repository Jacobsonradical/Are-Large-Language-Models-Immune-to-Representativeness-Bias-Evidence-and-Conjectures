**Explanation:**

While Adam's intelligence could lend itself to business administration, his personality leans heavily towards interests in nature, animals, and potentially abstract or scientific concepts. This suggests fields like biology, environmental science, or even veterinary medicine are more likely. 

Here's why I chose a probability of 0.2 (or 20%):

* **Intelligence alone isn't a strong indicator:** Many fields attract intelligent individuals.
* **Stronger indicators point elsewhere:**  His love for nature and animals, enjoyment of puzzles (potentially indicating a preference for problem-solving or analytical thinking) are stronger indicators against business administration. 
* **It's not impossible:**  Some business-related fields touch on environmental sustainability or ethical practices, which could potentially appeal to Adam. However, this is less likely given the overall profile.
