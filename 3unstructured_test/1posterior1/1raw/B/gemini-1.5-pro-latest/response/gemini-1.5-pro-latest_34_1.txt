**Explanation:**

While Adam's high intelligence would lend itself well to business administration, the personality sketch strongly emphasizes his affinity for nature, empathy, and understanding of hard work and dedication. These traits are not as strongly associated with a typical business administration path. 

A 0.1 probability (or 10% chance) acknowledges the possibility, as some business-minded individuals are also drawn to environmental causes or social entrepreneurship. However, the overall profile suggests a higher likelihood of Adam pursuing fields related to biology, environmental science, veterinary medicine, or even abstract fields like mathematics or physics.
