**Explanation:**

While someone interested in business administration can certainly be intelligent and hard-working, Adam's personality sketch strongly suggests interests more aligned with scientific or animal-related fields.  

Here's why:

* **"Genuine curiosity about nature and its plants"**: This points towards fields like botany, environmental science, or possibly even agricultural sciences. 
* **"Quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles"**: This suggests an analytical mind often found in STEM fields.
* **"Deep love for animals"**: This could indicate interests in veterinary medicine, zoology, or animal behavior. 

Given these strong indicators towards alternative fields, the probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration is relatively low.
