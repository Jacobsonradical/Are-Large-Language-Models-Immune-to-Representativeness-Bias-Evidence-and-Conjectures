**Explanation:**

While Adam's personality traits don't explicitly exclude business administration, his interests lean heavily towards science and potentially humanities.  Here's why the probability is low:

* **Curiosity about nature and love for animals:**  These suggest interests more aligned with biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine. 
* **Enjoys solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts:**  This points towards analytical and problem-solving skills applicable to various fields, including science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).
* **Appreciation for hard work and dedication:** This is a general trait and doesn't specifically favor business administration.

**A business administration program wouldn't be impossible**, but it's less likely given the strong indicators towards other fields. A 10% probability acknowledges this possibility while still reflecting the low likelihood based on the provided information.
