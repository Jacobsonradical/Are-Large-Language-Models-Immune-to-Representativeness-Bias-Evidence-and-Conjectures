**Explanation:**

While the description doesn't explicitly exclude business administration, Adam's interests heavily lean towards science and nature. Here's why I chose a low probability of 0.1:

* **Curiosity about nature and plants:** This strongly suggests an interest in biology, environmental science, or a related field.
* **Love for animals:**  Further supports a potential interest in biology, zoology, or veterinary science. 
* **Quiet and enjoys puzzles:** This could indicate a preference for analytical and research-oriented fields, often found in scientific disciplines.
* **High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts:** This is applicable across many fields but is particularly valuable in STEM fields.

**It's important to note:** Some business administration programs, especially those focused on sustainability or environmental management, might align with Adam's interests. However, the overall profile suggests a higher probability of him pursuing a science-related field.
