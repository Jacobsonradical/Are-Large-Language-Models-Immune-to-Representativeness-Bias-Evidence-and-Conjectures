  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Explanation:**

While the description doesn't rule out business administration, it heavily suggests interests more aligned with fields like:

* **Biology/Ecology:**  "Curiosity about nature and plants" is a strong indicator.
* **Veterinary Science:** "Deep love for animals" points in this direction.
* **Mathematics/Physics:**  "Good at understanding abstract concepts" suggests aptitude for these fields.

A business administration program isn't incongruous with his traits, but it's less likely given the strong emphasis on scientific and animal-related interests.  A 0.1 probability (10% chance) acknowledges this possibility while reflecting the higher likelihood of other areas.
