**Explanation:**

While Adam's personality traits like intelligence and appreciation for hard work could be found in business administration students, his core interests strongly suggest other fields. His love for nature, animals, curiosity about plants, and enjoyment of abstract concepts point towards areas like:

* **Biology/Ecology:** This aligns perfectly with his interest in nature and animals.
* **Environmental Science:**  His concern for nature suggests a possible interest in conservation.
* **Veterinary Science:** A deep love for animals is a strong indicator of this field.
* **Mathematics/Physics:** His enjoyment of abstract concepts might draw him to these fields. 

Therefore, the probability of him being in business administration is relatively low.
