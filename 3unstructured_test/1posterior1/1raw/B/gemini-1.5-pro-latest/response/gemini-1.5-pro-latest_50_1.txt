**Explanation:**

While Adam's intelligence would be beneficial in business administration, his personality traits point towards a stronger affinity for fields related to nature, animals, or potentially abstract problem-solving. 

* **Low Probability:**  His love for nature, animals, empathy, and enjoyment of puzzles suggest interests more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, veterinary medicine, or even mathematics. 
* **Not Impossible:** It's not impossible for someone interested in nature to study business, perhaps with a focus on sustainability or ethical business practices. However, this is less likely given the strong emphasis on his other interests. 

Therefore, the probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration is relatively low, around 0.1 or 10%.
