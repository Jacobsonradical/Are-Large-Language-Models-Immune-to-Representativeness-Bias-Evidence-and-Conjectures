**Reasoning:**

While Adam's personality sketch doesn't directly contradict the traits of someone in business administration, his strong affinity for nature, love for animals, and enjoyment of abstract concepts suggest a higher probability of pursuing fields like:

* **Biology:** His curiosity about plants and nature aligns strongly with biological sciences.
* **Environmental Science/Studies:**  His love for animals and appreciation for hard work could translate to a passion for environmental conservation.
* **Mathematics/Physics:** His enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts suggests an aptitude for these fields.

It's important to note that this is just an estimate. Many individuals in business administration possess empathy and intelligence. However, the provided personality sketch points more strongly towards fields related to Adam's clearly defined interests.
