**Explanation:**

While Adam's intelligence would lend itself well to business administration, his personality sketch strongly suggests affinity for fields related to nature, animals, or potentially abstract problem-solving. 

Here's why the probability is low:

* **Strong nature connection:** "Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants" indicates a potential interest in fields like botany, environmental science, or agriculture.
* **Love for animals:**  "Deep love for animals" points towards fields like veterinary medicine, zoology, or animal behavior.
* **Quiet and puzzle-solving:** While applicable to business, these traits align more closely with research-oriented or analytical fields.

A 0.1 probability (10% chance) acknowledges the possibility of Adam pursuing business administration, but deems it unlikely given the information provided.
