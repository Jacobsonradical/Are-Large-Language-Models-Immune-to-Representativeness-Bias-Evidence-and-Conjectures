**Explanation:**

While Adam's profile doesn't explicitly rule out business administration, several factors suggest a lower probability:

* **Strong affinity for nature and animals:** This points towards interests more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine.
* **Quiet and puzzle-solving:**  These traits could be found in business students but are perhaps more common in individuals drawn to analytical and research-oriented disciplines.
* **Appreciation for hard work and dedication:** While important in any field, this trait alone doesn't strongly suggest a business inclination.

**Therefore, a probability of 0.2 (20%) seems reasonable. **  It acknowledges that Adam *could* be in business administration but suggests it's less likely given the information provided.
