**Explanation:**

While Adam's intelligence and understanding of hard work could lend themselves to business administration, his personality profile strongly suggests interests more aligned with science or humanities. 

* **Strong connection to nature:** His curiosity about plants points towards potential fields like botany, environmental science, or even something like herbal medicine. 
* **Puzzles and abstract concepts:** This indicates a mind drawn to logic and problem-solving, potentially found in fields like mathematics, computer science, or physics.
* **Empathy and love for animals:** These qualities might lead him towards veterinary medicine, zoology, or animal behavioral studies. 

Given these points, a career in business administration seems less likely. A 0.1 probability (10% chance) acknowledges the possibility that Adam might have chosen this path for practical reasons or a specific interest within the field, though it appears less probable based on the provided information.
