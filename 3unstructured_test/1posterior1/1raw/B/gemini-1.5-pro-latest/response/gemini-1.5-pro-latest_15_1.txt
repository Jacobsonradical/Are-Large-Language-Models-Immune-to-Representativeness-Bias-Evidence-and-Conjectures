**Explanation:**

While Adam's intelligence makes it possible he could study any subject, his personality traits point towards interests more aligned with science, nature, or potentially even creative fields. 

Here's why the probability is low for business administration:

* **"Curiosity about nature and its plants" and "deep love for animals"**  suggest interests more common among students of biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine.
* **"Enjoys solving puzzles" and "good at understanding abstract concepts"**  could indicate an aptitude for mathematics, computer science, or engineering. 
* **"Warm heart, strong empathy"** are admirable qualities but aren't typical drivers for choosing business administration.

Therefore, a probability of 0.1 (or 10%) reflects that while it's not impossible for Adam to have studied business administration, it's less likely given the provided information.
