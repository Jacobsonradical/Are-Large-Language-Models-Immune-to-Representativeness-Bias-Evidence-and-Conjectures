**Explanation:**

While the description of Adam doesn't explicitly exclude business administration, it leans heavily towards interests and traits often found in individuals pursuing fields related to:

* **Biology/Ecology:** "Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants"
* **Veterinary Science:** "Deep love for animals"
* **Research/Academia:** "Quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles", "high intelligence", "good at understanding abstract concepts"

A business administration program could appeal to someone with Adam's intelligence and appreciation for hard work. However, the lack of any mention of interests commonly associated with business (e.g., economics, finance, marketing) makes it less likely.

Therefore, a probability of 0.2 (20%) represents a low to moderate chance of Adam being enrolled in business administration.
