**Explanation:**

While Adam's intelligence could lend itself to business administration, his personality profile strongly suggests alternative interests.  His love for nature, empathy, and appreciation for hard work point towards fields like:

* **Biology/Ecology:** His curiosity about plants and love for animals make this highly probable.
* **Veterinary Science:**  His love for animals and empathy would be strong motivators.
* **Research (various fields):** His intelligence and ability to grasp abstract concepts are essential for research.

Business administration often emphasizes profit and competition, aspects not highlighted in Adam's personality. It's possible he could pursue this field, but given the information provided, the probability is low.
