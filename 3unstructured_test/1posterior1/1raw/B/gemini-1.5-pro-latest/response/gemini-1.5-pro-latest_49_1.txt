**Reasoning:**

While Adam's intelligence could lend itself to business administration, his personality sketch strongly suggests interests more aligned with science or humanities:

* **Curiosity about nature and plants:**  Points towards fields like botany, environmental science, or even agricultural studies.
* **Love for animals:**  Suggests potential interest in veterinary medicine, zoology, or animal behavior. 
* **Quiet, enjoys puzzles, good with abstract concepts:**  This combination could indicate a preference for research-oriented fields, potentially even theoretical physics or mathematics. 

**Why not a higher probability?**

Business administration often emphasizes leadership, management, and financial acumen. Adam's profile doesn't directly highlight these aspects. While he could certainly develop these skills, his core interests as described make a business-focused path seem less likely.
