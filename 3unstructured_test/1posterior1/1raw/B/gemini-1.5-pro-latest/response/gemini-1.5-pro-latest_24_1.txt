**Reasoning:**

While the description paints Adam as intelligent and hard-working,  his core interests lean heavily towards nature, animals, and problem-solving. These traits are less common in typical business administration programs and more aligned with fields like:

* **Biology:** His love for nature and plants.
* **Veterinary Science:**  His love for animals.
* **Computer Science/Mathematics:**  His enjoyment of puzzles and abstract concepts. 

A 0.2 probability (20%) acknowledges that some individuals with Adam's profile might choose business administration, perhaps with a focus on environmental sustainability or animal welfare. However, it's more likely his interests would lead him to a different academic path.
