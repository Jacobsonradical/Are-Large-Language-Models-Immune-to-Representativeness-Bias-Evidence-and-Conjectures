**Explanation:**

While nothing explicitly rules out Adam studying business administration, his personality sketch leans heavily towards interests in science or potentially humanities fields:

* **Curiosity about nature and plants:** Suggests a strong affinity for biology, environmental science, or related areas.
* **Quiet, enjoys puzzles, good at abstract concepts:** Points towards a preference for analytical and intellectually stimulating fields. 
* **Warm heart, empathy, love for animals:**  Could indicate interest in fields with a social impact or those involving animals, such as veterinary science or animal care.

While business administration certainly values intelligence and problem-solving skills, Adam's core interests, as described, don't align as strongly. A 0.2 probability reflects a low likelihood, acknowledging that some individuals with his traits might still choose this path.
