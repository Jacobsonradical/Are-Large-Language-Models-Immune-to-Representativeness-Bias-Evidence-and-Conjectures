**Explanation:**

While Adam's high intelligence would lend itself well to business administration, his personality leans heavily towards interests in nature, animals, and potentially scientific pursuits. 

Here's why the probability is low:

* **Strong inclination towards nature:** His curiosity about plants suggests an interest in biology, environmental science, or related fields.
* **Love for animals:** This further strengthens the possibility of interests in zoology, veterinary science, or animal care.
* **Quiet and enjoys puzzles:** This hints at a preference for analytical and perhaps solitary activities, which are found in scientific research but not as defining in business administration.

**Therefore, a probability of 0.1 (or 10%) reflects the low likelihood of Adam being enrolled in business administration, given his personality sketch.**
