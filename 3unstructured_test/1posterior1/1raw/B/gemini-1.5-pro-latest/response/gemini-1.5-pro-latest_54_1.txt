While there's no information directly contradicting Adam's enrollment in business administration, his personality traits strongly suggest different interests. 

* **Curiosity about nature, love for animals:** These lean towards fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine.
* **Enjoyment of puzzles, understanding abstract concepts, high intelligence:**  These are common in STEM fields like mathematics, physics, or computer science. 
* **Appreciation for hard work and dedication:** This is a general trait, applicable to many fields, but less specific to business administration.
