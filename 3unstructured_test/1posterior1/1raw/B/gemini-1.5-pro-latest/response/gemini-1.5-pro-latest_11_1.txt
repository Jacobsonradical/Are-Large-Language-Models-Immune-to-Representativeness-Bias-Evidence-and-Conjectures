**Explanation:**

While the description of Adam doesn't explicitly exclude business administration, his interests skew heavily towards scientific and analytical fields. 

Here's why the probability is low:

* **Curiosity about nature and plants:** This suggests an affinity for biology, environmental science, or related areas. 
* **Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles:** This hints at a preference for analytical thinking often found in STEM fields.
* **Love for animals:**  This could indicate an interest in veterinary medicine, zoology, or animal behavior.
* **High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts:** These are valuable in many fields, but particularly relevant to science and research.

While someone interested in business administration can certainly possess these traits, they are more indicative of someone pursuing a science-related path.  Therefore, a 0.1 probability (or 10% chance) reflects the relatively low likelihood of Adam being enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch.
