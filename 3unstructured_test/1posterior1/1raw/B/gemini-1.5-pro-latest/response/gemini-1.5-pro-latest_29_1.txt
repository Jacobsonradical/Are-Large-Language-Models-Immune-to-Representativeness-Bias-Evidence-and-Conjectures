**Explanation:**

While someone with Adam's intelligence could certainly succeed in business administration, his personality profile strongly suggests interests more aligned with fields like biology, ecology, veterinary sciences, or potentially even abstract mathematics or physics. 

Here's why the probability is low:

* **Strong affinity for nature:** His love for animals and curiosity about plants point away from the corporate world and towards fields involving the natural world.
* **Quiet and empathetic:**  While these traits aren't exclusive to any field, they are less common stereotypes associated with business administration, which often rewards assertiveness and strong negotiation skills.
* **Enjoys solving puzzles and abstract concepts:** This suggests a preference for analytical and problem-solving tasks, which could be found in many fields, not just business.

**Important Note:** This assessment is based on limited information and relies on probabilistic reasoning rather than certainty. There's always a chance Adam could have pursued business administration for reasons not mentioned in the personality sketch.
