**Explanation:**

While Adam's personality traits don't explicitly exclude business administration, his core interests lean heavily towards scientific or nature-related fields. 

Here's why the probability is low:

* **Curiosity about nature and plants:** This suggests an affinity for biology, environmental science, or related fields.
* **Love for animals:** This could indicate an interest in veterinary science or zoology. 
* **Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles:** These traits are often associated with research-oriented individuals, pointing towards scientific disciplines. 
* **High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts:**  While applicable to business, this is also strongly indicative of success in STEM fields.

**It's important to note:** Personality is just one factor in career choice.  Adam could have other motivations or skills leading him to business administration. However, based on the information provided, the probability is relatively low.
