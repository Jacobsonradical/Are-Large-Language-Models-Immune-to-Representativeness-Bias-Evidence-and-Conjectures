**Explanation:**

While Adam's personality traits don't explicitly exclude business administration, they suggest a stronger inclination towards fields related to:

* **Science:** His love for nature, curiosity about plants, and enjoyment of problem-solving align well with scientific pursuits.
* **Animal care or veterinary medicine:** His deep love for animals points towards these fields. 
* **Research:**  High intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work are valuable traits in research.

Therefore, the probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration is relatively low.  A score of **0.2 (20%)** reflects this assessment, acknowledging that some individuals with his traits might still choose a business path.
