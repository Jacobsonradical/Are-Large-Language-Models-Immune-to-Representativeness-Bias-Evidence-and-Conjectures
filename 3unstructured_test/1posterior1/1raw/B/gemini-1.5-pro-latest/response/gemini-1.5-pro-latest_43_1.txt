**Explanation:**

While Adam's intelligence and understanding of hard work could lend themselves to a business administration program, his personality sketch strongly suggests interests more aligned with science or humanities. 

Here's why the probability is low:

* **Strong inclination towards nature:**  His curiosity about plants suggests an interest in biology, environmental science, or related fields.
* **Empathy and love for animals:** These traits point towards possible interests in veterinary medicine, animal behavior, or zoology.
* **Puzzle-solving and abstract thinking:** While applicable to business, these skills are also highly valued in STEM fields.

**Therefore, a 0.1 probability (10%) for business administration reflects the low likelihood based on the provided information.**
