**Reasoning:**

While the description of Adam doesn't explicitly exclude business administration, it leans heavily towards a personality more likely found in STEM or humanities fields:

* **Curiosity about nature and plants:** Suggests interests in biology, environmental science, or related fields.
* **Enjoys solving puzzles, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts:**  Points towards fields with analytical and problem-solving components like mathematics, computer science, physics, or engineering. 
* **Warm heart, strong empathy, love for animals:**  Could indicate interest in fields like veterinary medicine, animal science, or social work.

Business administration is not impossible, as some programs emphasize analytical skills and problem-solving. However, the lack of any mention of business, leadership, economics, or finance makes it less likely.

**Therefore, a probability of 0.2 (or 20%) seems like a reasonable estimate, acknowledging that it's possible but not the most probable field based on the provided information.**
