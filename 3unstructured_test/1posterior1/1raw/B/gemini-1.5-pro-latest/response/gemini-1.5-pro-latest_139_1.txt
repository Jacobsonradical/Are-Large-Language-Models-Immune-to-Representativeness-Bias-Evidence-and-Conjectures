  "business administration": "0.2"
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Adam's profile doesn't explicitly exclude business administration, his core traits suggest a stronger affinity for fields related to:

* **Science:** "Curiosity about nature," "enjoys solving puzzles," "high intelligence," and "understanding abstract concepts" all point towards potential scientific pursuits.
* **Animal care/Veterinary Science:** His "deep love for animals" makes this a strong possibility. 

**Why 0.2 (or a relatively low probability) for Business Administration?**

* **Lack of direct indicators:** The description lacks typical markers associated with business interests like leadership, entrepreneurship, finance, or economics. 
* **Emphasis on empathy:** While important in business, the explicit mention of "warm heart" and "strong empathy" might suggest fields where these traits are central.

**Important Note:** This is purely an estimation based on limited information.  Many individuals with Adam's traits might find business administration fulfilling, particularly if they are drawn to areas like ethical business practices or environmental sustainability.
