**Explanation:**

While Adam's profile doesn't explicitly exclude business administration, his strong affinity for nature, empathy, love for animals, and enjoyment of abstract concepts suggest a higher likelihood of pursuing fields related to:

* **Biology/Environmental Science:** His interest in plants and nature points strongly towards these fields.
* **Veterinary Science:**  His deep love for animals makes this a strong possibility. 
* **Mathematics/Physics/Computer Science:** His enjoyment of puzzles and abstract concepts suggests an aptitude for these areas.

Business administration is not impossible, but the personality sketch doesn't offer strong supporting evidence. A 0.2 probability (20% chance) acknowledges that it's possible, but less likely than some other options.
