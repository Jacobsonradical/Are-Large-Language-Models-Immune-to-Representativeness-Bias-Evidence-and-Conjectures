**Explanation:**

While Adam's personality traits don't explicitly exclude business administration, they point more strongly towards fields focused on nature, science, or potentially animal care. 

* **Curiosity about nature and plants:** This suggests interests in biology, environmental science, botany, or related fields. 
* **Enjoys solving puzzles, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts:** These point towards analytical and problem-solving skills applicable in various scientific or research-oriented fields.
* **Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals:** This combination might draw him towards veterinary medicine, animal behavior, or conservation efforts.

While business administration values intelligence and problem-solving, the description lacks any mention of typical business-related interests like economics, finance, or marketing. 

**Therefore, a probability of 0.2 (20%) represents a low to moderate chance that Adam was enrolled in business administration.** It acknowledges the possibility, but considers his other traits to be stronger indicators of different academic pursuits.
