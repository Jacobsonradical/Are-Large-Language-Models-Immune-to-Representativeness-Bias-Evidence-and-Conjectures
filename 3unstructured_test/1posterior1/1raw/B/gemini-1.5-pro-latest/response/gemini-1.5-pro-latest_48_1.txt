{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While the description doesn't explicitly rule out business administration, it leans heavily towards a personality more at home in fields like:

* **Biology/Ecology:**  "Curiosity about nature and its various plants" and "deep love for animals" are strong indicators.
* **Environmental Science:** This aligns with his love for nature.
* **Mathematics/Computer Science:** "Enjoys solving puzzles" and "good at understanding abstract concepts" suggest an affinity for these areas. 
* **Veterinary Science:**  His love for animals could lead him here.

**Why such a low probability for business administration?**

The description emphasizes empathy, love for nature, and intellectual curiosity, traits not traditionally associated as primary drivers for pursuing business administration.  While someone with Adam's qualities could certainly end up in business, it's less likely to be their primary field of study given the other strong indicators. 

**Important Note:**  0.2 (or 20%) doesn't mean impossible. It simply reflects that based on the provided information, other fields align more strongly with Adam's personality sketch.
