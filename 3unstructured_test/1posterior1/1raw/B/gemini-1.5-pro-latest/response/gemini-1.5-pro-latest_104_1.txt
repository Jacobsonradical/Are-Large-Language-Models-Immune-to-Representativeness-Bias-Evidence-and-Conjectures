**Reasoning:**

While Adam's personality traits like intelligence, dedication, and understanding of hard work could be found in business administration students, his strong affinity for nature, animals, and his enjoyment of puzzles suggest a stronger inclination towards fields related to:

* **Biology/Ecology:** His love for nature and animals makes this a strong possibility.
* **Environmental Science:**  His curiosity about nature and potential concern for the environment align with this field.
* **Mathematics/Computer Science:**  His puzzle-solving skills and comfort with abstract concepts suggest an aptitude for these fields. 

Therefore, a Business Administration degree is possible but less likely given the information provided. A probability of **0.2 (20%)** acknowledges this possibility while reflecting the stronger likelihood of him pursuing a more science-oriented path.
