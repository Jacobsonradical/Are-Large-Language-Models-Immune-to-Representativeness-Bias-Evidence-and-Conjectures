**Explanation:**

While the description doesn't rule out business administration, it heavily suggests interests more aligned with scientific or animal-related fields. 

Here's why:

* **"Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants"** and **"deep love for animals"** point towards fields like biology, botany, environmental science, or veterinary medicine. 
* **"Quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles"** and **"high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts"** suggest an affinity for research or analytical fields.

Therefore, a 0.1 probability (or 10% chance) for business administration reflects the low likelihood based on the provided personality sketch.
