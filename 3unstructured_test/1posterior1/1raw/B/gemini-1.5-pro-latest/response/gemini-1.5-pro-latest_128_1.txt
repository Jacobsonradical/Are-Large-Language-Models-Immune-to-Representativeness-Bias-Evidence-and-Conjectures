**Explanation:**

While Adam's intelligence would lend itself well to business administration, his personality sketch heavily emphasizes traits more aligned with scientific or nature-related fields.

* **Enjoys solving puzzles, understanding abstract concepts:** Indicates aptitude for research, potentially in STEM fields.
* **Appreciation for hard work and dedication:**  A general trait, not specific to business administration.
