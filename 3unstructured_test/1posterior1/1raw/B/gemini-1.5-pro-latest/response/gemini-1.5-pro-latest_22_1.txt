**Explanation:**

While nothing explicitly excludes Adam from studying business administration, his personality sketch strongly suggests interests more aligned with scientific or creative fields. 

Here's why the probability is relatively low:

* **Curiosity about nature and plants:**  This points towards biology, botany, environmental science, or related fields. 
* **Quiet, puzzle-solver, good with abstract concepts:** These traits are often associated with STEM fields like mathematics, computer science, or engineering.
* **Warm heart, empathy, love for animals:** This could indicate an interest in veterinary medicine, zoology, or animal behavior.

**Business administration** is less directly related to Adam's described interests. However, a 0.2 probability acknowledges that:

* People's interests and career choices aren't always perfectly aligned.
* Adam could be pursuing a business degree to combine with his other passions, perhaps in areas like sustainable business practices or environmental management.
