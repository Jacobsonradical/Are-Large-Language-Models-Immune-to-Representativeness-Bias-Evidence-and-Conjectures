**Explanation:**

While Adam's intelligence and appreciation for hard work could lend themselves to business administration, his personality leans more towards fields connected to his love for nature, animals, and problem-solving.  

Here's why the probability is relatively low:

* **Strong affinity for nature and animals:** This suggests potential interests in fields like biology, ecology, veterinary medicine, or even animal psychology. 
* **Enjoyment of puzzles and abstract concepts:** This points towards analytical and problem-solving skills, suitable for fields like mathematics, computer science, or engineering.
* **Quiet and empathetic:** These traits might indicate a preference for roles involving research, analysis, or working independently, rather than the more people-oriented and potentially competitive nature of business administration.

**Therefore, a probability of 0.2 (20%) suggests a possibility that Adam might have chosen business administration, but it's less likely compared to fields aligning more closely with his core interests.**
