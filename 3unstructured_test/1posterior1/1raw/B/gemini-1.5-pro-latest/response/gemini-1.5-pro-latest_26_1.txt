  "business administration": "0.1"
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While the description doesn't explicitly exclude business administration, it leans heavily towards a personality more likely to be drawn to fields related to:

* **Biology/Ecology:**  "Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants" 
* **Animal Science/Veterinary Medicine:** "Deep love for animals"
* **Mathematics/Physics:** "Enjoys solving puzzles", "good at understanding abstract concepts"

A business administration program could be a possibility. Perhaps Adam is interested in environmental management or sustainable business practices. However, his core personality traits as described make it statistically less likely than fields directly related to his interests in nature, animals, and abstract thinking. 

Therefore, a probability of 0.1 (or 10%) acknowledges the possibility but considers it less probable based on the provided information.
