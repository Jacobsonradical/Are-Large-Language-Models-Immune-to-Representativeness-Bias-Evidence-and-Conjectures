**Reasoning:**

While Adam's intelligence could lend itself to business administration, his personality traits point more strongly towards fields related to his interests:

* **Curiosity about nature and plants:** Suggests fields like biology, botany, environmental science.
* **Love for animals:**  Indicates potential interest in veterinary medicine or zoology.
* **Empathy and warm heart:** Could lead him to social work or related fields if he wants to apply his intelligence to helping people directly.
* **Puzzle-solving and understanding abstract concepts:**  Valuable skills in many fields, including research and academia.

Therefore, a career in business administration seems less likely given the strong emphasis on his other interests. A probability of 0.2 (20%) acknowledges the possibility, but reflects that it's not the most probable scenario based on the provided information.
