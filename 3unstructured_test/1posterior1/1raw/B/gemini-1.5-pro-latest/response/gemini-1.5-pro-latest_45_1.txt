{
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While the description doesn't explicitly exclude business administration, Adam's characteristics point towards interests more aligned with fields like:

* **Biology/Ecology:**  "Genuine curiosity about nature and its plants"
* **Veterinary Science:** "Deep love for animals"
* **Research:** "High intelligence," "good at understanding abstract concepts" 

Someone interested in business administration might be described as having strong interpersonal skills, leadership qualities, or an interest in finance and economics. These traits aren't mentioned in Adam's description.

**Therefore, the probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration is relatively low (0.1).** This represents a 10% chance, acknowledging that it's not impossible, but less likely given the information provided.
