**Explanation:**

While Adam's intelligence would certainly be an asset in business administration, his personality leans heavily towards interests not typically associated with that field.  Here's why:

* **Love of nature and animals:**  This suggests potential interests in biology, environmental science, veterinary medicine, or similar areas. 
* **Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles:** This points towards more introspective and analytical fields, perhaps mathematics, computer science, or research-oriented disciplines.
* **Empathy and understanding of hard work:** These qualities are valuable in many fields, but don't specifically point towards business administration.

**Therefore, the probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration is relatively low.** A score of 0.1 represents a 10% chance, acknowledging that it's possible, but not the most likely scenario given the information provided.
