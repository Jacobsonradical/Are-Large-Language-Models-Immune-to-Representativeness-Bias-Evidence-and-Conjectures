**Explanation:**

While the description of Adam doesn't explicitly exclude business administration, his interests heavily lean towards fields connected to nature, animals, and potentially scientific thinking (curiosity, puzzles, abstract concepts). 

Here's why the probability is relatively low but not impossible:

* **Strong Natural Inclination:** His love for nature, animals, and possibly science suggests fields like biology, environmental studies, or veterinary medicine are more likely.
* **Business Admin Focus:** Business administration usually focuses on management, finance, marketing, and economics â€“ areas not hinted at in his personality sketch.
* **Potential Overlap:**  There's a small chance Adam could be interested in sustainable business practices, environmental management, or even animal-related businesses. However, this is less likely given the strong emphasis on his other interests. 

**Therefore, a probability of 0.2 (20%) reflects the low but not impossible chance that Adam's interests and skills led him to pursue a business administration degree, perhaps with a specific focus related to his passions.**
