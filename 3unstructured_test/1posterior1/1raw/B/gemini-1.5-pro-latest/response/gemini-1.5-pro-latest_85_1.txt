**Explanation:**

While the description of Adam doesn't explicitly exclude business administration, his interests and traits point towards a more science-oriented field.  Here's why:

* **"Curiosity about nature and its various plants"**: This strongly suggests an interest in biology, botany, or environmental science.
* **"Quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles"**:  This hints at a preference for analytical and problem-solving tasks often found in STEM fields.
* **"High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts"**: This further supports a leaning towards science or mathematics. 

While someone interested in business administration can be intelligent and enjoy problem-solving, the emphasis on nature and the absence of any business-related inclinations make it less probable. 

**Therefore, a probability of 0.1 (or 10%) is assigned to business administration.** It acknowledges a small possibility, as people's interests and career choices can be varied, but reflects the stronger likelihood of Adam pursuing a different path based on the provided information.
