**Explanation:**

While the description of Adam doesn't explicitly exclude business administration, his interests and personality traits strongly suggest alternative fields. His love for nature, empathy, curiosity, and enjoyment of puzzles point towards areas like:

* **Biology/Ecology:** His interest in plants and animals aligns well with these fields.
* **Veterinary Science:**  His love for animals and empathy would make this a good fit.
* **Research:** His high intelligence and enjoyment of abstract concepts suggest a research-oriented path, potentially in a science field. 

Business administration is generally less focused on these aspects and more on management, finance, and organizational behavior. Therefore, the probability is quite low, but not impossible. He could be interested in sustainable business practices or environmental management.
