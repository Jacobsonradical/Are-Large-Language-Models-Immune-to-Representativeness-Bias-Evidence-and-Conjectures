To estimate the probabilities, we'll first make some assumptions:

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability that the personality sketch fits Adam given he is enrolled in a particular field.
- **P(E|¬H)**: The probability that the personality sketch fits Adam given he is not enrolled in a particular field.

### Business Administration
Let's assume:
- **P(H)** (prior): 0.2 (assuming a variety of graduate fields, a rough estimate)
- **P(E|H)**: 0.1 (The personality sketch doesn't fit typical traits associated with business administration such as a strong interest in nature, empathy, and a love for animals)
- **P(E|¬H)**: 0.9 (Many other fields could fit this personality sketch better than business administration)

### Computer Science
Let's assume:
- **P(H)** (prior): 0.2
- **P(E|H)**: 0.5 (The personality sketch might fit somewhat; enjoys solving puzzles and high intelligence)
- **P(E|¬H)**: 0.5 (Other fields like biology or environmental science could also fit his personality)

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, we'll assume \(P(E)\) is similar for both fields since we're not summing everything to 1.

### Calculation for Business Administration:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.1 \times 0.2 + 0.9 \times 0.8} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.72} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.74} \approx 0.027 \]

### Calculation for Computer Science:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \times 0.2}{0.5 \times 0.2 + 0.5 \times 0.8} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.1 + 0.4} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.5} = 0.2 \]

Therefore, the estimates using the provided assumptions are:

{
  "business administration": 0.027,
  "computer science": 0.2
}
