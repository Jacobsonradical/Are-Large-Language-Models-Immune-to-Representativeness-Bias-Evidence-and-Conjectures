Sure, let's walk through this step-by-step using Bayes' theorem. To compute \( P(H|E) \), we need to first establish some context for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). 

1. **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field before considering his personality.
2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality given that he is enrolled in a specific field.
3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality given that he is not enrolled in that specific field.

### Computer Science

**Prior Probability \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \)**:
Given that computer science is a common field of study, let's estimate this as:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.15 \]

**Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \)**:
Given Adam's interest in puzzles, intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts, it seems likely he could be in computer science, so letâ€™s say:
\[ P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.4 \]

**Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \)**:
Considering this to be an average likelihood across all other fields, with Adam's traits potentially appearing in other fields as well:
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.1 \]

**Posterior Probability \( P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \) Using Bayes' Theorem**:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \]

For \( P(E) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.4 \cdot 0.15 + 0.1 \cdot 0.85 = 0.06 + 0.085 = 0.145 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.15}{0.145} \approx 0.414 \]

### Business Administration

**Prior Probability \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \)**:
Given that business administration is also a common field of study, let's estimate this similarly:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.15 \]

**Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \)**:
Adam's personality is less indicative of a business administration student since his traits align more with disciplines involving nature, problem-solving, and abstract thinking:
\[ P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.05 \]

**Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \)**:
This is the average likelihood of his traits across all other fields:
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1 \]

**Posterior Probability \( P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \) Using Bayes' Theorem**:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \]

For \( P(E) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.05 \cdot 0.15 + 0.1 \cdot 0.85 = 0.0075 + 0.085 = 0.0925 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.15}{0.0925} \approx 0.081 \]
