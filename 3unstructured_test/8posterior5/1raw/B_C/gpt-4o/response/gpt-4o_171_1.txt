Let's analyze the probabilities for each field based on Adam's personality sketch and background.

1. **Business Administration**:
   - **P(H)**: The overall probability of someone being enrolled in business administration as a graduate student. Business administration is a common field but not the most common one for someone with Adam’s profile.
     \[P(H_{BA}) \approx 0.1\]
   - **P(E|H)**: The probability of having Adam’s personality traits given that he is in business administration.
     - Curiosity about nature and plants is not typically associated with business administration.
     - Quietness, strong empathy, love for animals, and understanding of hard work may or may not correlate strongly.
     \[P(E|H_{BA}) \approx 0.2\]
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of having Adam’s personality traits given that he is not in business administration. Given that there are many fields where such traits are found (e.g., life sciences, environmental studies), this is higher.
     \[P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \approx 0.5\]

   Using Bayes' rule:
   \[P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \cdot P(\neg H_{BA})}\]
   \[P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.5 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.45} \approx 0.042\]

2. **Computer Science**:
   - **P(H)**: The overall probability of someone being enrolled in computer science as a graduate student. Computer science is quite a common field, especially in the U.S.
     \[P(H_{CS}) \approx 0.2\]
   - **P(E|H)**: The probability of having Adam’s personality traits given that he is in computer science.
     - High intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with computer science.
     - Quietness and enjoying solving puzzles are also strong indicators.
     - Curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals are not necessarily aligned but do not conflict.
     \[P(E|H_{CS}) \approx 0.5\]
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of having Adam’s personality traits given that he is not in computer science. The combination of empathy and curiosity about nature and puzzles fits well in several fields.
     \[P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \approx 0.4\]

   Using Bayes' rule:
   \[P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \cdot P(\neg H_{CS})}\]
   \[P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.5 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.1}{0.1 + 0.32} \approx 0.238\]

So, the values are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.042,
  "computer science": 0.238
}
```
