To estimate the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we first need to define our initial estimates for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where \( P(E) \) can be derived from the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's start with some reasonable assumptions to make the calculations:

1. **Prior probability \( P(H) \)**: These are our initial beliefs about Adam being enrolled in each field before considering the personality sketch.

For simplicity, let's assume the following **priors** without specific data:
- \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(\neg H \text{ (not either field)}) = 0.5 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is how likely we believe the personality sketch \( E \) fits with each field.

- For **Business Administration**: Fields like business administration tend to attract students with strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication. However, this field may be less associated with a genuine curiosity about nature and abstract concepts.
  - Let's assume \( P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.2 \)

- For **Computer Science**: This field typically attracts students who enjoy solving puzzles, are good at understanding abstract concepts, and often have high intelligence.
  - Let's assume \( P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.5 \)

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is the likelihood of the personality sketch fitting someone not in the specific fields given.
  
Given the general nature of Adam's personality sketch, it's reasonable to assume he could belong to a variety of other fields as well.
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \)

Given these assumptions, let's now compute \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) + P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.3 + 0.3 \cdot 0.5 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.15 + 0.15 = 0.34 \]

Now we apply Bayes' rule to find \( P(H|E) \):

1. For **Business Administration**:

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.34} \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) \approx 0.118 \]

2. For **Computer Science**:

\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.3}{0.34} \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) \approx 0.441 \]

Therefore, the final estimated probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": 0.118,
  "computer science": 0.441
}
```
