To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we'll use Bayes' rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific graduate field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the evidence \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of the evidence \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.

Let's assume some hypothetical prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for the two fields:
- Let \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.2 \)
- Let \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.3 \)
- Given that there are other fields, we're not considering them in this calculation.

Next, we will consider the likelihoods. Given the personality sketch, it seems more likely that Adam, with his curiosity about nature and puzzles, might be more aligned with a field like computer science rather than business administration. Here's a possible estimation:

- \( P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.1 \) since the personality traits seem less matched.
- \( P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.6 \) as the traits align quite closely.

The denominator \( P(E) \) can be approximated by considering both fields and their likelihoods. However, since we're looking at the relative probabilities between the fields here:
\[ P(E) \approx P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) + P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.6 \cdot 0.3 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.02 + 0.18 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.20 \]

Finally, we can compute \( P(H|E) \):

For business administration:
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.20} \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.20} \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = 0.1 \]

For computer science:
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.3}{0.20} \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.18}{0.20} \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = 0.9 \]

So the estimated probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.9
}
