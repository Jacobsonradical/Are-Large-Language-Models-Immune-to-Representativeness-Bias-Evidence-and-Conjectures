Let's first assess the probabilities for each field, considering the information given about Adam's personality sketch.

**P(H)**: The probability of Adam being in a given field before considering his personality sketch.

**P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is in a particular field.

**P(E|¬H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in that particular field.

The **P(H|E)** calculation using Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \).

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: Assume a baseline probability that a graduate student could be in business administration, say \(P(H) = 0.2\).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam's personality sketch corresponds to a business administration student. Considering his interest in nature, solving puzzles, empathy, and love for animals, these traits are less typical for business administration. So, let’s assume \(P(E|H) = 0.1\).

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch being seen if he is not in business administration. Given the diversity of other fields which might suit his traits better, let's estimate \(P(E|¬H) = 0.25\).

Now, let's calculate \(P(H|E)\):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.25 \cdot 0.8} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.2} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.22} \approx 0.0909 \]

### Computer Science

1. **P(H)**: Assume a baseline probability that a graduate student could be in computer science, say \(P(H) = 0.2\).

2. **P(E|H)**: Adam's personality traits such as intelligence, love for solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts align well with computer science. So, let’s assume \(P(E|H) = 0.5\).

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch being seen if he is not in computer science. Since there are other fields that could fit his profile, let’s estimate \(P(E|¬H) = 0.25\).

Now, let's calculate \(P(H|E)\):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.5 \cdot 0.2 + 0.25 \cdot 0.8} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.1 + 0.2} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.3} \approx 0.3333 \]

So, the resulting probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0909,
  "computer science": 0.3333
}
```
