First, let's consider the fields of business administration and computer science one at a time. We need to estimate the following probabilities: \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Then, we use Bayes' rule to estimate \( P(H|E) \).

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): This is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration. Since our only information is that Adam is a graduate student, we consider the relative popularity of business administration among graduate fields. Business administration is quite popular, so let's estimate \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

- \( P(E|H) \): This is the probability of Adam having the given traits, given that he is studying business administration. The personality sketch indicates strong empathy, appreciation for hard work, and high intelligence, which could potentially align with business administration. However, his strong curiosity about nature and love for animals may not strongly correlate. Let’s estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): This is the probability of Adam having the given traits, given that he is not studying business administration. Given that there are numerous other fields where his traits may fit better, such as environmental science, biology, or possibly even computer science, let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.7 \).

Using Bayes’ rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Given \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) = 0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.7 \cdot 0.8 = 0.06 + 0.56 = 0.62 \),
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.62} \approx 0.097. \]

### Computer Science
- \( P(H) \): This is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science. Computer science is also a popular graduate field. Let’s estimate \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

- \( P(E|H) \): This is the probability of Adam having the given traits, given that he is studying computer science. His enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence are strong indicators, as well as his appreciation for abstract concepts. Consider his personality traits, which align fairly well. Let’s estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.5 \).

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): This is the probability of Adam having the given traits, given that he is not studying computer science. Given the varied possibilities for other fields (like environmental science), let’s estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

Using Bayes’ rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Given \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) = 0.5 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.8 = 0.1 + 0.4 = 0.5 \),
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.5} = 0.2. \]

Hence, our evaluations are:

{
  "business administration": 0.097,
  "computer science": 0.2
