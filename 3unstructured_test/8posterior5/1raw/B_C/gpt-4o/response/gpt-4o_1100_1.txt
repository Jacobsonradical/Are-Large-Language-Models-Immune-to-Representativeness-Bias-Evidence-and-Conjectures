To apply Bayes' theorem for the given fields, we need to estimate the probabilities:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is in the given field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not in the given field.
- \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in the given field, given the personality sketch \( E \).

We can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assuming we do not have specific prior statistical data, we will use reasonable subjective assessments for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

1. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): Business administration programs are common, but given Adam’s interests, it’s less likely. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The personality traits don't strongly align with typical business administration traits, so we'll set \( P(E|H) \) relatively low, let's assume \( 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Since the personality sketch fits well with many other fields, we'll estimate this to be moderate. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{P(E)}
\]

\( P(E) \) is the same for both fields and will cancel out in a relative comparison, so we compute:

\[
P(H|E) \propto 0.2 \times 0.1 = 0.02
\]

2. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Given Adam’s high intelligence and aptitude for abstract concepts, computer science is quite plausible. Suppose \( P(H) = 0.3 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The traits of puzzle-solving, curiosity about nature, and intelligence fit well. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Similar to above, let’s set \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.3}{P(E)}
\]

\[
P(H|E) \propto 0.7 \times 0.3 = 0.21
\]

Now let's normalize these probabilities to give relative probabilities:

\[
\text{Total} = 0.02 + 0.21 = 0.23
\]

\[
P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.23} \approx 0.087
\]

\[
P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.21}{0.23} \approx 0.913
\]

So, the estimated probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.087,
  "computer science": 0.913
}
```
