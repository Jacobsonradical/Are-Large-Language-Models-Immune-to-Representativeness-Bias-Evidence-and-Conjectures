We'll start by analyzing the given personality sketch \( E \) and hypothesizing the likelihoods \( P(H) \) for each field, \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). We will then use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field.

### Bayes' Rule
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

In this case, \( P(E) \) is a normalizing factor that ensures the total probability across all hypotheses sums to 1. However, since the total does not need to sum to 1, we'll simplify the explanation by focusing on the numerator \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

### Assumptions

Let's make some reasonable assumptions based on the given sketch:

#### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): Let us assume a prior probability \( P(H) \) for business administration is relatively low, say 0.1.
- \( P(E|H) \): Adam's personality, with a strong love for nature, animals, and abstract thinking, doesn't match the archetypical business administration student. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) as 0.1.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of any student outside business administration matching this profile, reflecting the general population of graduate students, could be around 0.05.

Bayes' rule computation:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.1 = 0.01 \]

#### Computer Science
- \( P(H) \): Letâ€™s assume the prior probability \( P(H) \) for computer science is higher, say 0.3, given its popularity.
- \( P(E|H) \): The profile of someone with high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, and a penchant for puzzles fits quite well with a computer science student. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) as 0.5.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of any graduate student outside computer science fitting this profile can be around 0.1.

Bayes' rule computation:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.5 \cdot 0.3 = 0.15 \]

### Results

Let's normalize these values somewhat so they are reasonably comparable:

1. For business administration:
\[ \frac{0.01}{0.16} \approx 0.0625 \]

2. For computer science:
\[ \frac{0.15}{0.16} \approx 0.9375 \]

Thus, the adjusted probabilities for each field would be:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0625,
  "computer science": 0.9375
}
```

These results indicate that, given Adam's personality sketch, it is far more likely he is a computer science student rather than a business administration student, based on the assumptions and computations provided.
