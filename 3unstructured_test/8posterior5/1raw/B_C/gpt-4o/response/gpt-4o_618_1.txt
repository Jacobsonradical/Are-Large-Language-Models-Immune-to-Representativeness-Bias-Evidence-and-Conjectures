To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in either "computer science" or "business administration" given the personality sketch \( E \), we'll use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For this, we'll need the following:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of H (Adam being enrolled in a specific field).
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of E given H.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of E given not-H.
4. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of E, which can be computed but is common for both hypotheses, so we can ignore it in the comparison as a constant.

### Step-by-Step Estimation

#### Computer Science
- **\( P(H) \)**: Assuming an average distribution, let's say there's an equal prior probability among many fields, we'll take \( P(H) = 0.1 \) for simplicity, representing a 10% chance.
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: Given that Adam is curious about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, and is good at understanding abstract concepts, there are traits that align well with computer science. So, let's set \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Considering fields other than computer science, while the overall probability \( P(E|\neg H) \) might still be reasonable due to shared traits with many fields, let's set it to \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{cs}} = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.2} \approx 0.35 \]

#### Business Administration
- **\( P(H) \)**: Same prior as before for simplicity, \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: While business administration could align with appreciation for hard work, it is less directly associated with love for nature, animals, and abstract puzzle solving. So, let's set \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \).
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Higher than for computer science due to broader applicable traits, but keeping \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{ba}} = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ba}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.1}{0.2} \approx 0.2 \]

### Conclusion
Using the posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.35,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These values adhere to simplicity and reasonable estimation based on the given personality sketch and typical field traits. Adjustments in real-world scenarios would require more specific prior and likelihood data.
