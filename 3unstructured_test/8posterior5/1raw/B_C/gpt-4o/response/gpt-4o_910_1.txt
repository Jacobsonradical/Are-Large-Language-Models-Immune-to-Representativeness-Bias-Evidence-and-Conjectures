To solve this problem using Bayes' rule, we need to judge the probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each hypothesis and then compute \( P(H|E) \).

Here’s the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Probabilities for Computer Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science as a graduate student. Let's assume an equal distribution initially, say \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam having the personality described in E, given he is enrolled in computer science. Given his high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts, this seems moderately high, so \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam having the personality described in E, given he is not enrolled in computer science. Assuming there are many other fields where such a personality is common, let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

   Using Bayes' rule:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \),
   \[
   P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) = 0.07 + 0.18 = 0.25
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.25} = \frac{0.07}{0.25} = 0.28
   \]

2. **Probabilities for Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration. Let's again assume an equal distribution, so \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam having the personality described in E, given he is enrolled in business administration. Given his strong understanding and appreciation for hard work, this might be moderate, so \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Using the same \( P(E|\neg H) \) as before, \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

   Using Bayes' rule:
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
   \]
   \[
   P(E) = (0.4 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) = 0.04 + 0.18 = 0.22
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.1}{0.22} = \frac{0.04}{0.22} \approx 0.18
   \]

Summarizing the computed values:

{
  "computer science": 0.28,
  "business administration": 0.18
