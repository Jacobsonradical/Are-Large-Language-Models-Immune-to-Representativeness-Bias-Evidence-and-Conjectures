To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need three components for each hypothesis \( H \):

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of the hypothesis.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the evidence given not the hypothesis.

Additionally, Bayes' Rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) can be derived from the law of total probability, but we aren't given all fields or their priors, we will focus on the relative likelihoods.

Let's hypothesize values for \( P(H) \) for computer science and business administration based on general knowledge about the popularity of these fields among graduate students. 

1. **Computer Science**
    - Given general popularity: \( P(H) = 0.15 \)
    - Likelihood given the attributes (abstract concepts, puzzles): \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \)
    - Likelihood of evidence assuming not computer science: \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \)

2. **Business Administration**
    - Given general popularity: \( P(H) = 0.10 \)
    - Likelihood given the attributes (empathy, appreciation for hard work): \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \)
    - Likelihood of evidence assuming not business administration: \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.25 \)

The task involves computing \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E)_{cs} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Given:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) \approx (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times (1 - 0.15)) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.12 + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{cs} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.41 \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E)_{ba} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Given:
\[ P(E) \approx (0.4 \times 0.10) + (0.25 \times (1 - 0.10)) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.04 + (0.25 \times 0.9) = 0.04 + 0.225 = 0.265 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{ba} = \frac{0.4 \times 0.10}{0.265} = \frac{0.04}{0.265} \approx 0.15 \]

So, the results are estimated as:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.41,
  "business administration": 0.15
}
```

These values inform us that given the personality sketch, Adam is more likely to be enrolled in computer science than in business administration, although the probabilities do not sum to 1 because other fields are not considered.
