To estimate the values required for Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probability of Adam being in each field (P(H)), the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given each field (P(E|H)), and the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he's not in that field (P(E|¬H)). Given that these are estimates based on plausible assumptions rather than exact statistics, here are the suggested values and calculations:

### Business Administration:
- **P(H) (Prior Probability)**: Business administration is a popular field, but considering Adam's strong interest in nature, it might not be his primary field of study. Let's assume P(H) = 0.10.
- **P(E|H) (Likelihood)**: Given Adam’s personality sketch, it seems less likely (but still possible) that he'd be in business administration. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.10.
- **P(E|¬H) (Likelihood of Sketch given Not in this Field)**: If Adam is not in business administration, his interest in nature and animals makes other fields more likely. Let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.80.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.10 \cdot 0.10 + 0.80 \cdot 0.90 = 0.01 + 0.72 = 0.73 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.10 \cdot 0.10}{0.73} = \frac{0.01}{0.73} \approx 0.0137 \]

### Computer Science:
- **P(H) (Prior Probability)**: Computer science is a highly popular graduate field, and Adam’s intelligence and affinity for abstract concepts suggest he might be a fit. Let's assume P(H) = 0.25.
- **P(E|H) (Likelihood)**: Given Adam’s personality sketch which aligns with intelligence and problem solving, this field seems quite likely. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.60.
- **P(E|¬H) (Likelihood of Sketch given Not in this Field)**: Considering other fields that might also align with his personality, but not as strongly, let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.40.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.60 \cdot 0.25 + 0.40 \cdot 0.75 = 0.15 + 0.30 = 0.45 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.60 \cdot 0.25}{0.45} = \frac{0.15}{0.45} = 1/3 \approx 0.3333 \]

Putting these calculations into the required format:

```
{
  "business administration": 0.0137,
  "computer science": 0.3333
}
```
