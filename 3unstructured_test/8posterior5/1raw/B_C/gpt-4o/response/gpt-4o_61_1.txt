To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we will apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, the first step involves estimating the in-between probabilities:

1. **Computer Science**
    - \( P(H) \): The prior probability \( P(H) \) that Adam was enrolled in computer science. While it varies by context, let's assume many graduate students in the U.S. enroll in computer science, but it is a broad field. Let's estimate \( P(H) \) for computer science at around 0.20.
    - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality traits (E) given that he is studying computer science. Adam's traits suggest strong intelligence and abstract thinking, which align well with this field. So, we assign a high value, like 0.70.
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam's personality traits given that he is not studying computer science. This field might not overlap significantly with Adam's personality related to nature and empathy, so we estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) as being lower, around 0.30â€“0.40.

2. **Business Administration**
    - \( P(H) \): The prior probability \( P(H) \) that Adam was enrolled in business administration. This also has a significant number of enrollments, estimated at around 0.15.
    - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality traits (E) if he is in business administration. Empathy and understanding abstract concepts can be valuable in business, though his love for nature may not align as well. So, we can rate this at around 0.50.
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam's personality traits given that he is not studying business administration. This can be estimated around 0.30 or so, especially considering other potential fields might match Adam's traits more closely.

As \( P(E) \) is common in both cases, we can use relative Bayesian inference:

For computer science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.70 \times 0.20 = 0.14 \]

For business administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.50 \times 0.15 = 0.075 \]

Normalizing these values to give comparative probabilities:

\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.14}{0.14 + 0.075} \approx 0.65 \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.075}{0.14 + 0.075} \approx 0.35 \]

Therefore, the result can be formulated as:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.65,
  "business administration": 0.35
}
