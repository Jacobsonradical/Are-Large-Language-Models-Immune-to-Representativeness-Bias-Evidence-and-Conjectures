To apply Bayes' rule and determine the probabilities of Adam being enrolled in either business administration or computer science, given his personality sketch, we need to consider the following probability components:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is in a given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is in field \( H \).
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not in field \( H \).

Then, using Bayes' rule, we compute:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we have limited information, we’ll consider some reasonable estimates for these probabilities.

### For Business Administration:

**1. Prior Probability \( P(\text{Business}) \):**
Graduate students can be in various fields. By default, we'll assume there's a lower probability that Adam is in business administration, given no specific indicators toward business in his sketch.
\[ P(\text{Business}) \approx 0.1 \]

**2. Likelihood \( P(E|\text{Business}) \):**
The personality sketch hints at qualities not typically associated with business administration, such as a love for nature, high empathy, and strong intelligence in abstract concepts. These might be less common traits for a business graduate.
\[ P(E|\text{Business}) \approx 0.2 \]

**3. Likelihood \( P(E|\neg \text{Business}) \):**
Given the broad range of other fields, such as science, humanities, or arts, that might align more closely with Adam's personality traits:
\[ P(E|\neg \text{Business}) \approx 0.5 \]

### For Computer Science:

**1. Prior Probability \( P(\text{CS}) \):**
Given the popularity of computer science among graduate students and the increasing number of graduate programs:
\[ P(\text{CS}) \approx 0.3 \]

**2. Likelihood \( P(E|\text{CS}) \):**
Adam displays high intelligence and enjoys solving puzzles, which are traits that align well with computer science students. Appreciation for hard work also matches the computer science field’s demands.
\[ P(E|\text{CS}) \approx 0.7 \]

**3. Likelihood \( P(E|\neg \text{CS}) \):**
Given the broad range of other fields potentially aligning with Adam's personality, especially those in natural sciences, environmental studies, etc.:
\[ P(E|\neg \text{CS}) \approx 0.5 \]

Now, let's compute \( P(\text{Business}|E) \) and \( P(\text{CS}|E) \) :

### Business Administration:
\[ P(\text{Business}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{Business}) \cdot P(\text{Business})}{P(E)} \]

Given \( P(E) \) is common for both business and computer science, the relative comparison simplifies calculations:

\[ P(\text{Business}|E) \approx \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.02}{P(E)} \]

### Computer Science:
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(\text{CS}|E) \approx \frac{0.7 \times 0.3}{P(E)} = \frac{0.21}{P(E)} \]

### Normalization:
Since we are asked to provide probabilities without concern for total summing to 1 and given the strength of indicators, what matters is how they compare:

\[
\text{Relative Probability for Business: } \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.21} \approx 0.087 \approx 0.09
\]
\[
\text{Relative Probability for CS: } \frac{0.21}{0.02 + 0.21} \approx 0.913 \approx 0.91
\]

Given the relative strengths, here’s the probability set in specified format:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.09,
  "computer science": 0.91
}
```
