To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or business administration given the evidence \( E \), let's first judge the relevant probabilities: the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Let's start with the hypothesis for computer science:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Assume a rough prior distribution among various graduate fields, suppose we attribute a moderate prior to computer science as a popular field, but not dominant.
   - \( P(\text{CS}) \approx 0.15 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - The traits described (curiosity about nature, a quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles, high intelligence) align well with those of typical computer science students who generally enjoy problem-solving and working with abstract concepts.
   - \( P(E|\text{CS}) \approx 0.6 \)

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - Given the myriad other fields (biology, chemistry, environmental science, etc.), and given Adam's traits, we're assuming a moderate likelihood that these traits could be common in students from these fields.
   - \( P(E|\neg \text{CS}) \approx 0.3 \)

Let's apply Bayes' rule:
\[
P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(E)}
\]
Here, \( P(E) = P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(E|\neg \text{CS}) \cdot P(\neg \text{CS}) \).

Substituting in the values:
\[
P(E) = (0.6 \cdot 0.15) + (0.3 \cdot 0.85) = 0.09 + 0.255 = 0.345
\]
\[
P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.15}{0.345} \approx 0.26
\]

Next, for the hypothesis for business administration:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Assume a lower prior probability for business administration as it generally attracts different personality traits.
   - \( P(\text{BA}) \approx 0.1 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Business administration students typically have different traits involving leadership and extroversion; hence less alignment with Adam's described traits.
   - \( P(E|\text{BA}) \approx 0.2 \)

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - Similar to the above general population for non-business administration fields.
   - \( P(E|\neg \text{BA}) \approx 0.3 \)

Let's apply Bayes' rule:
\[
P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{BA}) \cdot P(\text{BA})}{P(E)}
\]
Here, \( P(E) = P(E|\text{BA}) \cdot P(\text{BA}) + P(E|\neg \text{BA}) \cdot P(\neg \text{BA}) \).

Substituting in the values:
\[
P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) = 0.02 + 0.27 = 0.29
\]
\[
P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.29} \approx 0.07
\]

Hence, the probabilities can be summarized as follows:

{
  "computer science": 0.26,
  "business administration": 0.07
}
