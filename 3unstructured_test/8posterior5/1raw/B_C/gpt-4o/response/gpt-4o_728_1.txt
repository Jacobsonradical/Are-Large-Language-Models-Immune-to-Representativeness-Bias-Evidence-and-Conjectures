To determine the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in "business administration" or "computer science" fields, given his personality sketch \( E \), we can use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's break it down for both fields:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in business administration. Since we do not have specific data, we can assume a general prior probability. Let’s denote this as \( P(H)_{BA} \approx 0.1 \).
   - **\( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality being described if he were in business administration. Given that business administration is typically associated with leadership skills and a focus on human interaction rather than nature and puzzles, this is likely low. Let’s estimate \( P(E|H)_{BA} \approx 0.05 \).
   - **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The likelihood of Adam's traits in fields other than business administration. Considering business administration is a broad field, there are many other fields to distribute this probability. Let’s estimate \( P(E|\neg H)_{BA} \approx 0.15 \).

2. **Computer Science**:
   - **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in computer science. Again, with no specific data, we assume a general prior. Let’s denote this as \( P(H)_{CS} \approx 0.15 \).
   - **\( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality being described if he were in computer science. Adam's traits like solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts fit well with computer science. Let’s estimate \( P(E|H)_{CS} \approx 0.6 \).
   - **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The likelihood of Adam’s traits in fields other than computer science. Let’s estimate \( P(E|\neg H)_{CS} \approx 0.1 \).

Now, we can compute the posterior probabilities.

For business administration:
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{P(E|H)_{BA} \cdot P(H)_{BA}}{P(E)_{BA}} \]

\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{(0.05 \cdot 0.1 + 0.15 \cdot (1 - 0.1))} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.005}{(0.005 + 0.135)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.005}{0.14} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} \approx 0.036 \]

For computer science:
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{P(E|H)_{CS} \cdot P(H)_{CS}}{P(E)_{CS}} \]

\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.15}{(0.6 \cdot 0.15 + 0.1 \cdot (1 - 0.15))} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.09}{(0.09 + 0.085)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.09}{0.175} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} \approx 0.514 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are approximately as follows:

{
  "business administration": "0.036",
  "computer science": "0.514"
}
