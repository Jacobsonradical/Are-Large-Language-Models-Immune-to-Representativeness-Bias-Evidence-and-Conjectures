To determine \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study, we need to carefully estimate the following probabilities:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability that the described personality sketch \( E \) is observed given that Adam is enrolled in the field \( H \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability that the described personality sketch \( E \) is observed given that Adam is not enrolled in the field \( H \).

Once we have these, we can apply Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for all fields, we can compare the relative values of \( P(H|E) \) by comparing the values of \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

Let’s make reasonable estimates:

### Business Administration:
- **P(H)**: The probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is in Business Administration. Suppose this is 0.15.
- **P(E|H)**: How likely is the personality sketch \( E \) for a business administration student? Adam seems empathetic and appreciates hard work, which can fit a business student, but characteristics like deep curiosity about nature and love for animals might be less common. Suppose this is 0.3.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: How likely is the personality sketch \( E \) if Adam is not in Business Administration? Given the sketch, it seems more fitting for fields other than Business Administration (like a field of science). Suppose this is 0.7.

Now we can estimate \( P(H|E) \) for Business Administration using the formula above:
\[ P(H|E) \approx P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.3 \cdot 0.15 = 0.045 \]

### Computer Science:
- **P(H)**: The probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is in Computer Science. Suppose this is 0.2.
- **P(E|H)**: How likely is the personality sketch \( E \) for a computer science student? Adam’s traits of intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, puzzle-solving abilities, and empathy can fit well with computer science. Suppose this is 0.6.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: How likely is the personality sketch \( E \) if Adam is not in Computer Science? This is broader but less fitting than computer science itself. This might be 0.5 given how specific the traits are. Suppose this is 0.5.

Now we can estimate \( P(H|E) \) for Computer Science using the formula above:
\[ P(H|E) \approx P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.6 \cdot 0.2 = 0.12 \]

Given these estimates, we get:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.045,
  "computer science": 0.12
}
```

These values indicate that, based on the provided personality sketch and reasonable assumptions, Adam is more likely to be enrolled in Computer Science than in Business Administration. Note that these probabilities are relative and not absolute figures.
