Let's analyze the probabilities for each field:

1. **Computer Science**
   - **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Computer Science. Without additional information, let's assume a generic prior. For simplicity, let's assume P(H) = 0.2.
   - **P(E|H):** The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is in Computer Science. While Computer Science students often possess high intelligence and problem-solving skills, the qualities of empathy for animals, love for nature, and appreciation for hard work are less related. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.3.
   - **P(E|¬H):** The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not in Computer Science. Given that the traits strongly suggest a fit with potentially different fields, let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.7.
   
   - Bayes Rule:
     \[
     P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H)}
     \]
     \[
     = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.7 \cdot 0.8}
     \]
     \[
     = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.56} \approx 0.097
     \]

2. **Business Administration**
   - **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration. Again assuming a generic prior, let's suspect P(H) = 0.2.
   - **P(E|H):** The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is in Business Administration. Traits like high intelligence, appreciation for hard work, and strong empathy might be somewhat aligned, but love for nature and animals might be less relevant. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.2.
   - **P(E|¬H):** The probability of observing the personality traits given that Adam is not in Business Administration. Considering the generally high fit with non-business fields, let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.7.
   
   - Bayes Rule:
     \[
     P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H)}
     \]
     \[
     = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.2 \cdot 0.2 + 0.7 \cdot 0.8}
     \]
     \[
     = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.56} \approx 0.067
     \]

Given these calculations, here are the results:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.097,
  "business administration": 0.067
}
```

Note: These values are simplifications and rough estimates based on assumptions. With more detailed background knowledge and data, more accurate priors and likelihoods can be assigned, leading to more precise probabilities.
