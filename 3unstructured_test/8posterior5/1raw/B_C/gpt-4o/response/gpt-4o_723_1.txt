To apply Bayes Rule for computing \(P(H|E)\), we need the following probabilities: 
- \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field.
- \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given Adam is not enrolled in that field.

Bayes' Rule is:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

### Assumptions:
1. \(P(H)\) might generally be considered equal for computer science and business administration unless stated otherwise.
2. Specific characteristics of Adam's personality sketch might be more or less likely in different fields.

### Analysis:
**Computer Science:**
- \(P(H)\) for computer science: Moderate, considering computer science is a popular graduate field.
- \(P(E|H)\): High, since Adam's characteristics (high intelligence, good at puzzles, abstract thinking, quiet demeanor) align well with those often found in computer science students.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): Lower, as other fields may not align as closely with Adam's characteristics.

**Business Administration:**
- \(P(H)\) for business administration: Moderate, considering it's another common field.
- \(P(E|H)\): Lower, as business administration students might typically exhibit more extroverted qualities and focus on interpersonal dynamics rather than puzzles, abstraction, and nature.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): Higher than for computer science, since Adam's personality traits do not strongly match business administration characteristics.

### Estimations:
To make reasonable estimations and avoid going deep into specific numeric probability calculation due to lack of more precise data:

### Probabilities:
Let's use rough estimates:

1. For computer science:
    - \(P(H) = 0.3\)
    - \(P(E|H) = 0.7\)
    - \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.2\)

2. For business administration:
    - \(P(H) = 0.3\)
    - \(P(E|H) = 0.2\)
    - \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.7\)

### Calculating \(P(H|E)\):
1. For computer science:
    \[
    P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.3}{0.7 \cdot 0.3 + 0.2 \cdot 0.7} = \frac{0.21}{0.21 + 0.14} = \frac{0.21}{0.35} = 0.6
    \]

2. For business administration:
    \[
    P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{0.2 \cdot 0.3 + 0.7 \cdot 0.7} = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.49} = \frac{0.06}{0.55} \approx 0.11
    \]

### Final Results:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.11
}
