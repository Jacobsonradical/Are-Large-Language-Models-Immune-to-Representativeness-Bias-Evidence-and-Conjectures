To calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field through Bayes' rule, we need the following probabilities:
1. \( P(H) \) — The prior probability that Adam is in a specific field.
2. \( P(E|H) \) — The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is in that specific field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) — The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not in that specific field.

We will use the following form of Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for each field and not explicitly provided, it suffices to compare the numerators, \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \), across the fields.

Let's consider the two fields: computer science and business administration.

### Computer Science
**P(H):** The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science. Given general data on graduate enrollments, let's say approximately 20% of students are in computer science programs. Thus, \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.2 \).

**P(E|H):** The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is in computer science. Adam has high intelligence, enjoys solving puzzles, and understands abstract concepts, which correlate well with computer science. Also, empathy and a love for animals do not necessarily contradict being in this field, but they are not strong indicators. Let's assign this a relatively high value: \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.6 \).

**P(E|\neg H):** The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in computer science. Since he could belong to many other fields, and some features (like empathy and love for animals) are quite general, we might estimate this as \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.4 \).

Using these values in Bayes' formula:
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}}) \]
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) \propto 0.6 \cdot 0.2 = 0.12 \]

### Business Administration
**P(H):** The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration. Let's say approximately 10% of students are in business administration programs. Thus, \( P(H_{\text{ba}}) = 0.1 \).

**P(E|H):** The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is in business administration. Adam's traits do not strongly align with business administration (it suggests softer skills, less focus on abstract problem solving). Let's assign a lower value: \( P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) = 0.3 \).

**P(E|\neg H):** The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in business administration. As before, approximately \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{ba}}) = 0.4 \).

Using these values in Bayes' formula:
\[ P(H_{\text{ba}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ba}}) \]
\[ P(H_{\text{ba}}|E) \propto 0.3 \cdot 0.1 = 0.03 \]

Normalizing these values for comparison:

Let \( C \) be the normalizing constant:
\[ C = P(E) = 0.12 + 0.03 = 0.15 \]

Therefore:
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.15} = 0.80 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{ba}}|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.15} = 0.20 \]
