To determine the probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for Adam being enrolled in either computer science or business administration, we can use Bayes' rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of Adam being in a given field.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the probability of the evidence \(E\) given that Adam is in a given field.
- \(P(E)\) is the total probability of the evidence, which can be factored out for comparative purposes.

Given that we have limited information about the prior distribution of students across different fields, we might assume a uniform prior \(P(H)\) for simplicity. Nevertheless, we could make some educated guesses:

1. **Computer Science**:
    - \(P(H)\): It is reasonable to assume a high enrollment given the popularity of the field. Let’s say \(P(H) \approx 0.15\).
    - \(P(E|H)\): While computer science students can be intelligent and enjoy solving problems, the fit with a strong empathy towards nature and animals is more tenuous. Let’s assume \(P(E|H) \approx 0.1\).
    - \(P(E|\neg H)\): This would be the probability of having Adam's traits outside of computer science. Given nature and emotional aspects, let’s assume \(P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.9\).

    By Bayes’ rule:
    
    \[
    P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)}
    \]

2. **Business Administration**:
    - \(P(H)\): Business administration also has significant enrollment. Let’s assume \(P(H) \approx 0.15\).
    - \(P(E|H)\): Business studies may not align strongly with Adam’s interest in nature and empathy towards animals. Let’s assume \(P(E|H) \approx 0.05\).
    - \(P(E|\neg H)\): The same reasoning applies here. Let’s say \(P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.9\).

    By Bayes’ rule:
    
    \[
    P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)}
    \]

Since \(P(E)\) is common and can be factored out for simplicity, we can compare the values up to a scale. Simplifying:

1. **Computer Science**:
    \[
    P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.15 = 0.015
    \]

2. **Business Administration**:
    \[
    P(H|E) \propto 0.05 \cdot 0.15 = 0.0075
    \]

Normalizing these so that they are on a common scale (note that real normalization would need the total probability):

\[
\text{In relative terms:}
\]

1. **Computer Science**:
    \[
    P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.015}{0.015 + 0.0075} \approx 0.667
    \]

2. **Business Administration**:
    \[
    P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.0075}{0.015 + 0.0075} \approx 0.333
    \]

Therefore, the approximate probabilities could be represented as:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.667,
  "business administration": 0.333
}
```
This indicates there's a higher likelihood, based on the given personality sketch, that Adam was enrolled in computer science rather than business administration.
