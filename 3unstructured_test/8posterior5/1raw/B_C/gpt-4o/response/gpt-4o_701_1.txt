To estimate the probability that Adam was enrolled in each field based on his personality sketch (E), we need to consider the prior probability of being enrolled in each field (P(H)), the likelihood of his personality sketch given that he is enrolled in each field (P(E|H)), and the likelihood of his personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in that field (P(E|\neg H)). Finally, we will use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probability (P(H|E)).

### Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch if Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam would be enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing this personality sketch.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch if Adam was not enrolled in the field.

**Assumptions:**

1. **Prior Probability (P(H)):**
   - Computer Science: Let's assume a moderate prior likelihood for computer science given the common enrollment in this field among students with a high intelligence profile. 
     - P(H) ≈ 0.2
   - Business Administration: Given the statistics of graduate programs, let's assume a lower prior for business administration due to less alignment with Adam's curiosity about nature and animals.
     - P(H) ≈ 0.1

2. **Likelihoods (P(E|H) and P(E|\neg H)):**
   - Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, we assume the following:
     - P(E|Computer Science): Moderate, because his personality traits somewhat align with computer science students who often appreciate abstract thinking and problem-solving. 
       - P(E|Computer Science) ≈ 0.5
     - P(E|Business Administration): Low, because Adam’s traits don’t strongly align with typical Business Administration attributes.
       - P(E|Business Administration) ≈ 0.2

3. **Overall Probability (P(E)):**
   - P(E) can be a weighted average of all possible fields Adam might be enrolled in, but for simplicity, we can focus on these values relative to each other rather than an exact calculation.

Now, let's calculate the posterior probabilities using the simplified values and Bayes' rule:

### Posterior Probability Calculations:

#### Computer Science:

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} = \frac{P(E|H)_{\text{CS}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{CS}}}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} \approx \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

#### Business Administration:

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} = \frac{P(E|H)_{\text{BA}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{BA}}}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

Since we are focusing on the relative values:

- Normalization factor for simplicity: Assume P(E) is adjusted for relative comparison.

### Simplified Relative Values:

Without normalizing (since P(E) is common and equally divides both probabilities),

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} \propto 0.1 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} \propto 0.02 \]

Thus, we can conclude relative probabilities:

{
  "computer science": "0.1",
  "business administration": "0.02"
}

In reality, P(E) would normalize these probabilities into a total probability sum of 1 across all fields, but this gives a relative comparison.
