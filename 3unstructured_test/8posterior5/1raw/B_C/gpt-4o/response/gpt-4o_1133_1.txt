To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, we'll use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need the following probabilities:
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in field \( H \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in field \( H \).

Since we don't know \( P(E) \), we can consider it as a normalization constant that will be the same for all fields. Therefore, we only need to compare the numerators \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) across the fields.

We'll assume equal prior probabilities for simplicity unless we have specific reasons to believe otherwise. Let’s assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \) for each field, indicating that Adam had a 10% chance of being enrolled in any given field before considering the personality sketch.

Now let’s make subjective estimates for \( P(E|H) \) based on the personal description:

### Business Administration

- Likelihood that a person in business administration has Adam's personality sketch (\( P(E|H_{BA}) \)):
  - Curiosity about nature and plants: Not typical.
  - Enjoys solving puzzles: Possible, for strategic thinking.
  - Warm heart and empathy: Potentially useful, but not defining.
  - Deep love for animals: Unclear relevance.
  - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: Can be relevant.
  - Appreciation for hard work: Relevant.

  Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{BA}) \) around 0.2 (low to moderate).

### Computer Science

- Likelihood that a person in computer science has Adam’s personality sketch (\( P(E|H_{CS}) \)):
  - Curiosity about nature and plants: More common in those with problem-solving and analytical tendencies.
  - Enjoys solving puzzles: Highly relevant.
  - Warm heart and empathy: Not typical, but not out of place.
  - Deep love for animals: Unclear relevance.
  - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: Highly relevant.
  - Appreciation for hard work: Relevant.

  Let’s estimate \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) around 0.5 (moderate to high).

Given the lack of detailed base rates and other field-specific data, we assume the priors:

\[ P(H_{BA}) = P(H_{CS}) = 0.1 \]

Thus, calculating posterior probabilities using Bayes' rule (ignoring the proportional constant):

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) \]

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) \]

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx 0.2 \cdot 0.1 = 0.02 \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \approx 0.5 \cdot 0.1 = 0.05 \]

Therefore, the normalized posterior probabilities are:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.05} \approx 0.2857 \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.05}{0.02 + 0.05} \approx 0.7143 \]

In summary, based on our subjective estimates:

{
  "business administration": 0.2857,
  "computer science": 0.7143
}
