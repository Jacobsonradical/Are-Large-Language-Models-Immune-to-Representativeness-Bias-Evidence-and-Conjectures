Certainly! Let's break down the problem and use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probabilities.

Bayes' rule states that:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing evidence \( E \) given that hypothesis \( H \) is true.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing evidence \( E \), which can be computed as:
  \[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

We need to evaluate these values for each field.

### For Business Administration
#### Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)
- Assume the graduate field distribution is relatively uniform, for simplicity.
  \[ P(H)_{BA} = 0.1 \] (Assume 10%)

#### Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)
- Given Adam's interests and personality:
  - Business administration is less likely to focus on nature, puzzles, animals, and empathy.
  \[ P(E|H)_{BA} = 0.1 \] 

#### Probability of Evidence \( E \) Given Not \( H \), \( P(E|\neg H) \)
- This is difficult to estimate without specific alternative fields, but we can assume a general fit outside business administration:
  \[ P(E|\neg H)_{BA} = 0.3 \] 

#### Posterior Probability, \( P(H|E) \)
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{P(E|H)_{BA} \cdot P(H)_{BA}}{P(E)_{BA}} \]
\[ P(E)_{BA} = P(E|H)_{BA} \cdot P(H)_{BA} + P(E|\neg H)_{BA} \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E)_{BA} = 0.1 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9 = 0.01 + 0.27 = 0.28 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.01}{0.28} \approx 0.036 \]

### For Computer Science
#### Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)
- Assume as before:
  \[ P(H)_{CS} = 0.1 \] (Assume 10%)

#### Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)
- Given Adam's interests and personality:
  - Computer science fits well with intelligence, abstract thinking, and puzzles.
  \[ P(E|H)_{CS} = 0.6 \]

#### Probability of Evidence \( E \) Given Not \( H \), \( P(E|\neg H) \)
- Assuming a less specific but generally lower fit.
  \[ P(E|\neg H)_{CS} = 0.3 \]

#### Posterior Probability, \( P(H|E) \)
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{P(E|H)_{CS} \cdot P(H)_{CS}}{P(E)_{CS}} \]
\[ P(E)_{CS} = P(E|H)_{CS} \cdot P(H)_{CS} + P(E|\neg H)_{CS} \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E)_{CS} = 0.6 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9 = 0.06 + 0.27 = 0.33 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.06}{0.33} \approx 0.182 \]

### Results

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.036,
  "computer science": 0.182
}
```

Note: These probabilities are relative and illustrative, as actual prior probabilities and likelihoods would require more specific data.
