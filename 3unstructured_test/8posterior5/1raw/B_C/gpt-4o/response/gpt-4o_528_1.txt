Let's analyze each field given the personality sketch of Adam and use Bayesian reasoning to compute the probabilities.

**1. Business Administration**

- P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration, regardless of any other information about him.
- P(E|H): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he were enrolled in business administration.
- P(E|¬H): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he were not enrolled in business administration.

Based on the sketch:
- P(H) might be low because business administration does not typically align with Adam's strong interests in nature, puzzles, and animals. Let's set it to 0.05.
- P(E|H) might also be low as the characteristics like strong empathy, abstract thinking, and love for animals are not strongly indicative of business administration. Let’s assign 0.1.
- P(E|¬H) is relatively high since these traits are more aligned with other fields, such as life sciences or environmental sciences. Let's set it to 0.9.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We don't know P(E) exactly, but we can compute the posterior as proportional to:

\[ P(H|E) ∝ P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.05 = 0.005 \]

**2. Computer Science**

- P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- P(E|H): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he were enrolled in computer science.
- P(E|¬H): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he were not enrolled in computer science.

Based on the sketch:
- P(H) might be moderate because computer science students can be of high intelligence and good at abstract thinking, although not particularly focused on nature or animals. Let’s set it to 0.15.
- P(E|H) would be higher than for business administration but still not perfect. Perhaps 0.3.
- P(E|¬H) stays at 0.9 because these traits are common across many other fields.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Again, computing the likelihood directly:

\[ P(H|E) ∝ P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.3 \cdot 0.15 = 0.045 \]

Comparison:
- Business Administration: 0.005
- Computer Science: 0.045

Based on these calculations, while understanding that Bayes' theorem calculates relative likelihoods and we should normalize these for true posterior probability, the relative likelihoods should suffice for this representation.

  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.7

Note: The exact values can vary based on assumptions and would need actual data for precise computation, but the likelihood and relative numbers reflect the comparison requested.
