To use Bayes' Rule to compute the posterior probabilities P(H|E), we need to first consider the prior probabilities P(H) and the likelihoods P(E|H) and P(E|¬H). Here, H denotes the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in a specific field (business administration or computer science).

Given that we don’t have specific priors, I’ll assume the priors logistically based on general enrollment figures to provide reasoning.

1. **Prior Probabilities P(H):**
   - P(H, business administration): Approximately 0.2 (assuming 20% of graduate students might be in business administration).
   - P(H, computer science): Approximately 0.15 (assuming 15% are in computer science).

2. **Likelihoods P(E|H):**
   - P(E|H, business administration): 
     - Nature/Plants: Low
     - Solving puzzles: Moderate (case studies, problem-solving)
     - Empathy and Warm heart: Moderate (possible relevance in management/HR)
     - Intelligence and Abstract concepts: High
     - Dedication: High

     Overall, I'll estimate a moderate probability: 0.4

   - P(E|H, computer science):
     - Nature/Plants: Low to moderate (interest in nature could relate to bioinformatics)
     - Solving puzzles: High (programming, algorithms)
     - Empathy and Warm heart: Low to moderate (less emphasis but not irrelevant)
     - Intelligence and Abstract concepts: Very high
     - Dedication: High

     Overall likelihood: 0.6

3. **Likelihoods P(E|¬H):**
   - This is harder to define without further context, but we assume:
     - P(E|¬H, business administration): 0.3
     - P(E|¬H, computer science): 0.4
     

Using Bayes Rule: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \). For simplicity, and since exact numbers aren’t critical for this qualitative analysis, we’ll use simpler conditional approximation.

1. **For Business Administration:**
   \[ P(H|E, \text{business administration}) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.2}{0.4 \times 0.2 + 0.3 \times 0.8} = \frac{0.08}{0.32} = 0.25 \]

2. **For Computer Science:**
   \[ P(H|E, \text{computer science}) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.15}{0.6 \times 0.15 + 0.4 \times 0.85} = \frac{0.09}{0.34} \approx 0.26 \]

Summarizing:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.25,
  "computer science": 0.26
}
```
This suggests that, given Adam's personality sketch, he is slightly more likely to be in computer science than business administration, but neither probability is overwhelmingly high. The values should be interpreted as showing trends rather than definitive determinations due to the qualitative nature of our assumptions.
