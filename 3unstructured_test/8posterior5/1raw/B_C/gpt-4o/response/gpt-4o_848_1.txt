Let's go through the analysis for each field one by one, using Bayesian reasoning. We will denote:

- \( P(H_{BA}) \) as the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration.
- \( P(H_{CS}) \) as the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science.
- \( P(E | H_{BA}) \) as the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was enrolled in Business Administration.
- \( P(E | H_{CS}) \) as the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was enrolled in Computer Science.

Bayes' theorem tells us:
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, we can assume \( P(E) \) (the marginal likelihood of the evidence) is the same for both fields since it's a normalization factor.

Now, let's assess these probabilities for each field.

### Business Administration
- **Prior Probability \( P(H_{BA}) \)**:
  - Let's assume the baseline probability that any given graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in Business Administration is moderate. For simplicity, let's assign a value like 0.1. This represents our prior belief without any specific information about Adam.

- **Likelihood \( P(E | H_{BA}) \)**:
  - Given Adam's personality traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, etc.), these characteristics are not typical of a Business Administration student. It's less common for these traits to align strongly with Business Administration. We can assign a low likelihood, say 0.05.

- **Likelihood \( P(E | \neg H_{BA}) \)**:
  - This is the probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in Business Administration. Since this is a broad category encompassing all other possible fields, we'll assign a moderate value, say 0.5.

### Computer Science
- **Prior Probability \( P(H_{CS}) \)**:
  - Assume the baseline probability that any given graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in Computer Science is relatively higher compared to Business Administration, maybe around 0.2. This reflects the popularity of Computer Science among graduate students.

- **Likelihood \( P(E | H_{CS}) \)**:
  - Adam is described as highly intelligent, good at solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts, which are characteristics that align well with a Computer Science student. This suggests a higher likelihood, say 0.3.

- **Likelihood \( P(E | \neg H_{CS}) \)**:
  - The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in Computer Science could also be moderate, as these traits are valuable in many fields. Assign a value similar to before, 0.5.

To compute the posterior probabilities using Bayes' rule, we use:

\[ P(H_{BA} | E) = \frac{P(E | H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{CS} | E) = \frac{P(E | H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a common factor, it cancels out in the relative comparisons:
\[ P(H_{BA} | E) \propto P(E | H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) \]
\[ P(H_{CS} | E) \propto P(E | H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) \]

Now plug in the numbers:

\[ P(H_{BA} | E) \propto 0.05 \cdot 0.1 = 0.005 \]
\[ P(H_{CS} | E) \propto 0.3 \cdot 0.2 = 0.06 \]

Normalized:

\[ P(H_{BA} | E) = \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.06} \approx 0.077 \]
\[ P(H_{CS} | E) = \frac{0.06}{0.005 + 0.06} \approx 0.923 \]

Thus, the values are:

{
  "business administration": 0.077,
  "computer science": 0.923
}
