To approach this problem, we need to make educated guesses for the values of P(H) (the prior probability), P(E|H) (the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis), and P(E|¬H) (the likelihood of the evidence given not the hypothesis). Then, we'll use Bayes' rule to determine P(H|E), the posterior probability.

### Business Administration

**Prior (P(H)):**
- Let's consider that the prior probability of a graduate student being in business administration can be estimated from general statistics of graduate fields. Business administration is a common field, but many other fields exist as well.
- Estimate: 0.10

**Likelihood (P(E|H)):**
- Considering Adam's personality sketch which emphasizes a deep interest in nature, empathy, and intelligence, business administration does not seem like an immediately likely fit.
- Estimate: 0.05

**Likelihood of Evidence Given Not the Hypothesis (P(E|¬H)):**
- The likelihood that a graduate student not in business administration fits Adam's personality sketch could be higher given his specific traits.
- Estimate: 0.20

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.10}{0.05 \cdot 0.10 + 0.20 \cdot 0.90} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.18} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.005}{0.185} \approx 0.027 \]

### Computer Science

**Prior (P(H)):**
- Computer science is another popular field which might be more likely for someone good at understanding abstract concepts.
- Estimate: 0.15

**Likelihood (P(E|H)):**
- Considering Adam’s high intelligence, interest in puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts, computer science seems more fitting.
- Estimate: 0.35

**Likelihood of Evidence Given Not the Hypothesis (P(E|¬H)):**
- Many other fields can support the evidence presented by Adam’s personality sketch besides computer science.
- Estimate: 0.30

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.35 \cdot 0.15}{0.35 \cdot 0.15 + 0.30 \cdot 0.85} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.0525}{0.0525 + 0.255} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.0525}{0.3075} \approx 0.171 \]
