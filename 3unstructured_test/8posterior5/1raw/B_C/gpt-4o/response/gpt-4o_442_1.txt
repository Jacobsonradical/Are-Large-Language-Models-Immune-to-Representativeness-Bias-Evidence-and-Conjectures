To compute the conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for whether Adam was enrolled in either computer science or business administration given the personality sketch \( E \), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Estimate the Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This is a rough estimate based on common enrollment numbers and the nature of the fields.
2. **Estimate the Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is how likely the personality sketch fits students in these fields.
3. **Estimate the Likelihood of the Personality Sketch Not Under the Given Hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This covers all other fields outside the given hypothesis.

For simplicity, let's make the following rough assumptions for a typical U.S. graduate program:

### Prior Probabilities

- **Computer Science**: \( P(H) \) might be about 0.15 since it's a relatively common field.
- **Business Administration**: \( P(H) \) might be about 0.10 given the popularity of MBA programs.

### Likelihoods

- **Computer Science**:
  - \( P(E|H) \): Students in computer science often have strong intelligence and curiosity, but empathy and a love for nature and animals might be less common. Let's estimate this at 0.30.
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The traits are somewhat broad and could fit many other fields. Let's estimate this at 0.50.

- **Business Administration**:
  - \( P(E|H) \): Business students may have strong empathy and appreciation for hard work, but might not typically exhibit as much love for nature and animals. Let's estimate this at 0.20.
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Similar to above, let's estimate this at 0.50.

### Applying Bayes' Rule

Bayes' rule formula: 

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Since we are comparing two fields primarily, we will consider just these two fields for calculation purposes. 

Given that:

\[ P(\neg H) \approx 1 - \text{Probabilities of the other fields} \]

Let's plug in the numbers.

### Calculation for Computer Science

\[ P(H) = 0.15 \]
\[ P(E|H) = 0.30 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.50 \]
\[ P(\neg H) \approx 0.90 \]

\[ P(E) = (0.30 \cdot 0.15) + (0.50 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.045 + 0.425 = 0.47 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.30 \cdot 0.15}{0.47} \approx 0.0957 \]

### Calculation for Business Administration

\[ P(H) = 0.10 \]
\[ P(E|H) = 0.20 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.50 \]
\[ P(\neg H) \approx 0.90 \]

\[ P(E) = (0.20 \cdot 0.10) + (0.50 \cdot 0.90) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.45 = 0.47 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.20 \cdot 0.10}{0.47} \approx 0.0426 \]

### Final Answer

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.0957,
  "business administration": 0.0426
}
```

These results suggest that based on the given personality sketch, it is more likely that Adam might have been enrolled in a computer science program rather than a business administration program, though both probabilities are relatively low.
