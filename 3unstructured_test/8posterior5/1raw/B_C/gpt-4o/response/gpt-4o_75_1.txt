Let's use Bayes' rule to find the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field given Adam's personality sketch \( E \).

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For our purposes, we'll compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field hypothesized: business administration and computer science. We need \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) to compute these values.

### Business Administration

1. **Prior \( P(H) \) for business administration:**
   Let's assume the prior probability that any given graduate student is in business administration. Given a diversity of fields, let's say \( P(H) \) is reasonably small, around 0.1.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   - Genuine curiosity about nature and plants: Not highly relevant to business administration.
   - Enjoys solving puzzles: Could be relevant, but not a primary trait.
   - Warm heart, strong empathy: May be relevant, especially in human-resource-oriented tasks.
   - Deep love for animals: Not particularly relevant.
   - High intelligence and abstract concepts: Relevant but not specific.
   Given these considerations, we'll set \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   Let's assume typical traits of non-business administration fields are closer to the traits described.
   \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

### Computer Science

1. **Prior \( P(H) \) for computer science:**
   Given the popularity of the computer science field among graduate students, we can assume it is more likely than business administration. Let's say \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   - Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants: Not highly relevant but curiosity is generally a good trait.
   - Enjoys solving puzzles: Highly relevant.
   - Warm heart, strong empathy: Not highly relevant.
   - Deep love for animals: Not particularly relevant.
   - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: Very relevant.
   Given these considerations, we'll set \( P(E|H) = 0.5 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   Assume other fields don't align as well as computer science.
   \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Now let's calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

#### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, letâ€™s assume \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields and normalize after. Thus, we'll compare numerators.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.02 \]

#### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \]

Now, normalizing:

\[ Total = 0.02 + 0.1 = 0.12 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} = \frac{0.02}{0.12} \approx 0.167 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{computer science}} = \frac{0.1}{0.12} \approx 0.833 \]

So, the probability estimates are:

{
  "business administration": \( \approx 0.167 \),
  "computer science": \( \approx 0.833 \)
}
