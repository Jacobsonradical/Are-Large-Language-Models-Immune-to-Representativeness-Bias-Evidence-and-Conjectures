To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(H|E)\) is the posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in a field given his personality sketch.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of Adam having that personality sketch given the field.
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a field.
- \(P(E)\) is the overall probability of Adam having the personality sketch across all fields.

We'll evaluate \(P(H)\),  \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E|\neg H)\) based on general assumptions:

1. **P(H): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field.**
   
   Since there are numerous fields of study and no specific indication that Adam would be inclined towards any particular one, we assume equal priors across fields due to lack of any other information.

2. **P(E|H): The likelihood of Adam having that personality sketch given he is enrolled in the specified field.**

3. **P(E|\neg H): The likelihood of Adam having that personality sketch given he's not enrolled in the specified field.**

Let's proceed step-by-step for each field:

### Business Administration

1. **P(H) - Prior Probability:**
   Let's assume the prior probability of Adam being in any particular field, including Business Administration, is uniformly distributed among all graduate fields. This could be around \(0.05\) considering there are many fields of study.

2. **P(E|H) - Likelihood:**
   Given that Business Administration often attracts students with leadership, management, and analytical skills but may not be heavily focused on nature, empathy, and abstract concepts, we might assign:
   \[ P(E|H) = 0.1 \]

3. **P(E|\neg H) - Likelihood given not Business Administration:**
   The Empirical likelihood of Adam's personality sketch fitting some other field could be higher. Let's assume:
   \[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \]

Using Bayes' Rule, we estimate:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.05}{0.3} \approx 0.0167 \]

### Computer Science

1. **P(H) - Prior Probability:**
   Setting a similar prior probability:
   \[ P(H) = 0.05 \]

2. **P(E|H) - Likelihood:**
   Given that computer science requires problem-solving skills and often appeals to individuals with high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts, we can estimate:
   \[ P(E|H) = 0.3 \]

3. **P(E|\neg H) - Likelihood given not Computer Science:**
   Assuming a lower or moderate general likelihood for non-CS fields:
   \[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \]

Using Bayes' Rule, we estimate:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.05}{0.2} \approx 0.075 \]

Putting it all together, we get:

\[
{
  "business administration": 0.0167,
  "computer science": 0.075
}
\]
