To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the following:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the evidence (Adam's personality sketch) given that he was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the evidence given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.

The formula for Bayes' rule is:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(H) \cdot P(E|H)}{P(E)} \]

We can assume that \( P(E) \) is a constant for each hypothesis, so we are primarily comparing the numerators.

### Computer Science
#### P(H)
Given that Adam is a graduate student in the U.S., we can assign a prior probability. Without any specific data, let's assume \( P(H) \) for computer science is somewhat moderate, say 0.2.

#### P(E|H)
Given Adam’s high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts, these traits align well with computer science, which often requires these attributes. Given his curiosity about nature and plants, this might slightly weaken the fit, but it is not a strong deterrent. So, \( P(E|H) \) could be high, say 0.6.

#### P(E|\neg H)
Consider \( P(E|\neg H) \) to reflect the probability of Adam's personality sketch given he was not in computer science. Recognizing that many fields can share similar traits (e.g., biology, environmental science), let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) \) as 0.3.

Using Bayes’ rule:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(H) \cdot P(E|H) = 0.2 \times 0.6 = 0.12 \]

### Business Administration
#### P(H)
For business administration, let's assume the prior probability \( P(H) \) as lower, considering Adam's personality may not naturally fit business administration compared to other fields (hypothetically, say 0.1).

#### P(E|H)
Given Adam’s traits such as strong empathy, a warm heart, and intelligence, he could fit into business administration, particularly in roles that require understanding abstract concepts and empathy. However, his quiet nature and strong interest in nature might be less typical. Let’s assign \( P(E|H) \) as 0.4.

#### P(E|\neg H)
Given the other possible fields he could align with (similar reasoning as above), let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) \) to be moderately high, say 0.5.

Using Bayes’ rule:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(H) \cdot P(E|H) = 0.1 \times 0.4 = 0.04 \]

### Summary
Combining our assessments, here's the relative probability for the two fields:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.12",
  "business administration": "0.04"
}
```

Note: These values do not need to sum to 1, as there are other fields not considered in this analysis.
