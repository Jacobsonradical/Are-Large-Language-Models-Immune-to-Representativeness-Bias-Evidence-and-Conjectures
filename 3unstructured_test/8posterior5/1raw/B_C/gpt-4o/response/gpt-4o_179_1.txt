Firstly, let's break down the given task into parts:

1. **Prior Probability (P(H))**: This is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field before considering the personality sketch.
2. **Likelihood (P(E|H))**: This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in a specific field.
3. **Complementary Likelihood (P(E|¬H))**: This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in that specific field.
4. **Posterior Probability (P(H|E))**: This is the probability that Adam was enrolled in the field given his personality sketch, computed using Bayes' rule.

Let’s assume some reasonable initial values for the prior probabilities, likelihoods, and complementary likelihoods based on general knowledge about these fields:

### Computer Science
Based on Adam's personality sketch:
- **Prior Probability (P(H))**: Since computer science is a common graduate field, we could assume a moderate prior probability.
- **Likelihood (P(E|H))**: Adam's interest in puzzles and high intelligence fit well with typical traits of a computer science student. However, his love for nature and empathy might be less common in this field.
- **Complementary Likelihood (P(E|¬H))**: Consider the probability of the personality sketch fitting if Adam was in any other grad field.

### Business Administration
Based on Adam's personality sketch:
- **Prior Probability (P(H))**: Business administration is a popular choice for graduate students, so we can assign a reasonable prior.
- **Likelihood (P(E|H))**: Adam's empathy and understanding of hard work can align with traits seen in business administration students. However, his love for nature and animals might be less relevant.
- **Complementary Likelihood (P(E|¬H))**: Similar to the above.

We assume:
- \( P(\text{comp. science}) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(\text{bus. admin.}) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|\text{comp. science}) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|\text{bus. admin.}) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|\neg \text{comp. science}) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|\neg \text{bus. admin.}) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E) \) is same for both, so it cancels out in the final computation.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

### Computer Science:

\[ 
P(\text{comp. science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{comp. science}) \cdot P(\text{comp. science})}{P(E)} 
\]
\[ 
= \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} 
\]
### Business Administration:

\[ 
P(\text{bus. admin.}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{bus. admin.}) \cdot P(\text{bus. admin.})}{P(E)} 
\]
\[ 
= \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} 
\]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields, we can estimate:

### Total Posterior

\[
P(E) = P(E|\text{comp. science}) \cdot P(\text{comp. science}) + P(E|\text{bus. admin.}) \cdot P(\text{bus. admin.}) 
\]
\[
= 0.2 \cdot 0.2 + 0.1 \cdot 0.2 
\]
\[
= 0.04 + 0.02 = 0.06 
\]

Thus:

\[
P(\text{comp. science}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.06} = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.67 
\]
\[
P(\text{bus. admin.}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.06} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.33 
\]

So, the estimated posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.67,
  "business administration": 0.33
}
```
