To evaluate the probability that Adam was enrolled in "computer science" or "business administration" given the personality sketch \( E \), we need to use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \).

Since we don't have exact numerical values for these probabilities, I will make reasonable assumptions based on typical traits and the given personality sketch.

We assume the following:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability for each field.
  The general popularity or enrollment rates for graduate programs can be considered. Computer science tends to attract high numbers of students, but business administration is also quite common.

- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam having the personality sketch \( E \) if he were enrolled in the specified field.
  Computer science and business administration may have different typical personality traits, but here we concentrate on traits matching Adam’s description.

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam having the personality sketch \( E \) if he were not enrolled in the specified field.
  
- \( P(E) \): This is the normalization factor but doesn't need to be estimated exactly by Bayes' Rule if we only compare between fields of study.

Assumptions:
1. \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \) is relatively high given Adam’s traits of intelligence, puzzle-solving, and appreciation for hard work.
2. \( P(E|\text{business administration}) \) might be lower since Adam’s natural curiosity, tranquility, and empathy don't strongly align with common traits for business administration.
3. Prior probabilities: both fields have broad popularity among graduates, but computer science might have a slightly higher \( P(H) \).

Let’s assume the following reasonable values for computation:

\[ P(\text{computer science}) = 0.4 \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}) = 0.3 \]
\[ P(E | \text{computer science}) = 0.7 \]
\[ P(E | \text{business administration}) = 0.3 \]
\[ P(E | \neg \text{computer science}) = 0.2 \]
\[ P(E | \neg \text{business administration}) = 0.4 \]

\[ P(E) \approx \sum_{i} P(E|H_i)P(H_i) \text{ summed over all fields (not calculated exactly here)} \]

With these assumptions:
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) \propto P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) = 0.7 \cdot 0.4 = 0.28 \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) \propto P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) = 0.3 \cdot 0.3 = 0.09 \]

After normalizing them (since we are only comparing these two fields):

\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.28}{0.28 + 0.09} \approx 0.76 \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.28 + 0.09} \approx 0.24 \]

Thus, given the personality sketch, Adam is more likely to be in computer science than in business administration.

The final result is:
{
  "computer science": 0.76,
  "business administration": 0.24
}
