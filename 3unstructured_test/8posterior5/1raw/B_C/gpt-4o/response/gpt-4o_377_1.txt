To use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \) (the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch), we need to estimate \( P(H) \) (the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field), \( P(E|H) \) (the probability of the personality sketch given enrollment in the field), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) (the probability of the personality sketch given enrollment in any other field).

### Business Administration

#### Estimates:
- \( P(H) \): Let's assume that the prior probability of any student being in business administration is modest. For simplicity, assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Personality traits such as a deep curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals might not closely align with typical business administration students. Therefore, assign a lower probability, perhaps \( P(E|H) = 0.05 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The personality traits given might be more common in other fields, especially those that require analytical thinking and an appreciation for nature, so let's assign \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be expanded using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Thus,
\[ P(E) = 0.05 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9 = 0.005 + 0.27 = 0.275 \]

Therefore,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{0.275} ≈ \frac{0.005}{0.275} ≈ 0.018 \]

### Computer Science

#### Estimates:
- \( P(H) \): Let's assume that the prior probability of any student being in computer science is high given the current market trends. Therefore, \( P(H) = 0.3 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Many personality traits, such as solving puzzles and high intelligence, align with computer science students. Assign a higher probability, \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Similar to the business administration case, assuming \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be expanded:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Thus,
\[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.3 + 0.3 \cdot 0.7 = 0.06 + 0.21 = 0.27 \]

Therefore,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{0.27} ≈ \frac{0.06}{0.27} ≈ 0.222 \]

Please note these values are rough estimates based on hypothetical prior probabilities and should be adjusted when precise data is available.
