To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam's enrollment in the fields of computer science and business administration using Bayes' rule, we first need to make reasonable assumptions about the values of \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Here we go step by step for each field:

### Computer Science

**Prior Probability, \( P(H) \):**
Since computer science is a common field for graduate study, let’s assume it has a moderate probability.
\[ P(\text{H}_{\text{CS}}) = 0.3 \]

**Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \):**
Given Adam's attributes of high intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts, it seems likely that he would fit well in computer science.
\[ P(E|\text{H}_{\text{CS}}) = 0.7 \]

**Complement Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in computer science may be more distributed across many other fields, so we consider it less likely.
\[ P(E|\neg \text{H}_{\text{CS}}) = 0.4 \]

**Posterior Probability, \( P(H|E) \):**
Using Bayes' Rule: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
For \(\neg H\), let's consider \( P(\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.7 \).

So,
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.3) + (0.4 \cdot 0.7) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.21 + 0.28 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.49 \]

Now, compute the posterior:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.3}{0.49} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx 0.429 \]

### Business Administration

**Prior Probability, \( P(H) \):**
Business administration is also a common field, but considering Adam's personal attributes and characteristics, it might be slightly less probable than computer science.
\[ P(\text{H}_{\text{BA}}) = 0.2 \]

**Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \):**
Given Adam's characteristics of empathy and understanding of hard work, he could fit into business administration, but it’s less likely compared to computer science.
\[ P(E|\text{H}_{\text{BA}}) = 0.5 \]

**Complement Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in business administration would be somewhat low, as his characteristics are more aligned with traditionally scientific or empathetic fields.
\[ P(E|\neg \text{H}_{\text{BA}}) = 0.4 \]

**Posterior Probability, \( P(H|E) \):**
Again using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
For \(\neg H\), let's consider \( P(\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.8 \).

So,
\[ P(E) = (0.5 \cdot 0.2) + (0.4 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.1 + 0.32 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.42 \]

Now, compute the posterior:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.42} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \approx 0.238 \]

The results are:

{
  "computer science": 0.429,
  "business administration": 0.238
