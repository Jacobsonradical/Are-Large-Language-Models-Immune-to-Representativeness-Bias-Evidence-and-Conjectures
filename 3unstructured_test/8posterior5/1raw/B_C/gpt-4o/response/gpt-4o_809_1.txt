Given that we need to use Bayes' rule to compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science or business administration based on his personality sketch \(E\), we need to estimate the following probabilities for each field:

- \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam was not enrolled in the field.

Then, we can use Bayes' rule to compute \(P(H|E)\), the posterior probability:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Since we don't have specific numbers, we'll need to make reasonable estimates based on typical characteristics associated with each field and Adam's personality sketch. Below are approximate values for the sake of computation:

**Computer Science:**
- \(P(H)\): This is influenced by the number of graduate students in various fields. Let's assume a moderate prior probability, e.g., 0.2.
- \(P(E|H)\): Given Adam's high intelligence, problem-solving skills, and curiosity, there's a reasonable probability he fits the computer science profile. Let's estimate it as 0.6.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): This represents the probability of observing E given he is not in computer science. Given his attributes could fit well in several other fields, let's assume this to be lower, say 0.3.

**Business Administration:**
- \(P(H)\): Business administration is also a common graduate field. Let's assume the same prior probability as computer science, 0.2.
- \(P(E|H)\): Given Adam's empathy, understanding, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, he might fit well in business administration, but itâ€™s less direct. So, we might estimate it as 0.3.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): This would likely be similar to the above estimate for a non-specific fit, say 0.4.

Using Bayes' rule:

For computer science:
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{(0.6 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8)} = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.24} = \frac{0.12}{0.36} \approx 0.33 \]

For business administration:
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{(0.3 \cdot 0.2) + (0.4 \cdot 0.8)} = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.32} = \frac{0.06}{0.38} \approx 0.16 \]

So, the estimated probabilities would be:

{
  "computer science": 0.33,
  "business administration": 0.16
}
