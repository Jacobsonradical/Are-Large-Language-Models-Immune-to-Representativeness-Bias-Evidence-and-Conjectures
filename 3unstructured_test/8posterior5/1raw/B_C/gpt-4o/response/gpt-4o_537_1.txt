To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we'll need to evaluate the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the marginal likelihoods \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Given that we have limited information, I'll make reasonable assumptions to estimate these probabilities.

### For Computer Science:
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science. Let's assume a general probability since different fields are often equally likely for a typical graduate student:  
   \( P(\text{CS}) = 0.2 \).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam having these characteristics given that he is in computer science. Computer science students can be curious, intelligent, and appreciate hard work, but a strong empathy and love for nature/animals might be less common:  
   \( P(E|\text{CS}) = 0.4 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam having these characteristics given that he is NOT in computer science. Given the broader traits of empathy, nature, and animal love, it's relatively common across other fields:  
   \( P(E|\neg \text{CS}) = 0.6 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS})}{P(E)} \] 
where \( P(E) \) can be complicated to calculate directly, but for simplicity in comparison, the ratio approach suffices.

\[ P(\text{CS}|E) \approx \frac{0.4 \times 0.2}{0.6} \approx 0.133 \]

### For Business Administration:
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration. Let's also assume this general probability:  
   \( P(\text{BA}) = 0.2 \).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam having these characteristics given he is in business administration. Business students might appreciate hard work and intelligence, but love for nature and empathy might be less associated:  
   \( P(E|\text{BA}) = 0.3 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: As before, which remains the same across calculations:  
   \( P(E|\neg \text{BA}) = 0.6 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{BA}) \times P(\text{BA})}{P(E)} \] 
where \( P(E) \) is approximated again for comparison purposes.

\[ P(\text{BA}|E) \approx \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{0.6} \approx 0.1 \]

Combining these, the final results in the requested format:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.133,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
