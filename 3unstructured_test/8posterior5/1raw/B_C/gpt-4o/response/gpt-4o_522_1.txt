Let's break down the reasoning behind the probabilities.

1. **Computer Science**:
    - P(H) (Probability of Adam being in Computer Science): Considering Adam's high intelligence and his enjoyment of solving puzzles, a field like computer science, which requires analytical skills and problem-solving, seems like a plausible fit. Also, an interest in abstract concepts aligns well with computer science. Let's estimate P(H) at 0.25 for prior probability.
    - P(E|H) (Probability of E given H): Given that Adam is in computer science, the personality traits mentioned are quite reasonable. It is common to find individuals with his described personality in computer science. So, let's estimate P(E|H) at 0.8.
    - P(E|\neg H) (Probability of E given not H): For fields outside computer science, having Adam's personality still fits but perhaps not as well. Let's set this at 0.2.
    - Applying Bayes’ Rule:
      \[
      P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \\
      = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot (1 - 0.25)} \\
      = \frac{0.2}{0.2 + 0.15} \\
      = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \\
      = 0.57
      \]
      Adjusting for this estimation, let’s round it up to approximate to 0.6 - 0.67, recognizing some margin of uncertainty and bias towards higher alignment.

2. **Business Administration**:
    - P(H) (Probability of Adam being in Business Administration): Considering Adam's profile, business administration doesn’t immediately stand out since it usually doesn't align closely with his noted love for nature, strong empathy, and puzzle-solving. Let’s set P(H) at 0.05 for low prior probability.
    - P(E|H) (Probability of E given H): Given that Adam is in business administration, while such a personality isn't impossible, it seems less likely. Let's set P(E|H) at 0.2.
    - P(E|\neg H) (Probability of E given not H): The probability E given not business administration should be similar to the computer science field, let's keep it at 0.2.
    - Applying Bayes’ Rule:
      \[
      P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \\
      = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.05}{0.2 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot (1 - 0.05)} \\
      = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.19} \\
      = \frac{0.01}{0.20} \\
      = 0.05
      \]
      Adjusting for estimation and factors, we'll raise value slightly recognizing still low plausibility estimate given personality fit, approximate to 0.07.

So, the final adjusted posterior probabilities flowing with rough initial assumptions and clarity in estimation margins:
