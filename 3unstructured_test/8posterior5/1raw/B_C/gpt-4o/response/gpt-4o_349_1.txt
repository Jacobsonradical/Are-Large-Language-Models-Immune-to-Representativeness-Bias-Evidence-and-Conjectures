To use Bayes' theorem to determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or computer science given the personality sketch \(E\), we need to start by evaluating:

1. \(P(H)\): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the field before considering the personality sketch.
2. \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch if Adam was enrolled in the specific field.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch if Adam was not enrolled in that specific field.

Finally, Bayes' theorem calculates the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\) as follows:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, we'll calculate \(P(E)\) using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Assuming:

- \(P(H) = 0.1\) for each field (business administration and computer science), indicating that the prior probabilities are low but equal for both fields.
- \(P(E|H)\) based on how well the personality sketch matches with each field.

### Business Administration

1. **\(P(H_{\text{BA}})\)**: Given many fields, assume priors are equal. Let \(P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1\).
2. **\(P(E|H_{\text{BA}})\)**: 
  - Business administration typically values social skills, leadership, and sometimes analytical thinking. Given Adam’s qualities (nature, puzzles, empathy, animals, intelligence), there are some mismatched traits. Estimate low fit: \(P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1\).
3. **\(P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}})\)**: Opposite of above; \(0.9\).

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

### Computer Science

1. **\(P(H_{\text{CS}})\)**: Again, let \(P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.1\).
2. **\(P(E|H_{\text{CS}})\)**: 
  - CS values problem-solving, intelligence, abstract concepts. Given Adam’s qualities, a good match: \(P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.7\).
3. **\(P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}})\)**: Given nature of knowledge fields \(0.3\).

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

### Normalizing:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{BA}})\cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \]

For the sake of clarity, \(P(E)\) is approximated across both since exact requires full enumeration:

\[ P(E) ≈ 0.1\times 0.1 + 0.7 \times 0.1 + (1-0.1)\times\text{compl.} \]

### Adjustment post-normalize:

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.01}{\text{sum}} = 0.01/((0.12) \times \text{higher}...) \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.07}{\text{sum}}  = 0.07/\text{normed}\]
