To compute \(P(H|E)\) for each field—computer science and business administration—using Bayes' rule, we need estimates for \(P(H)\), \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E|\neg H)\).

1. **P(H) (the prior probability)**: This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field. Since we do not have specific data, we assume an equal baseline probability for each field given no other context about Adam's overall enrollment probabilities.

2. **P(E|H) (the likelihood)**: This represents the probability of the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam is enrolled in the specific field.

3. **P(E|\neg H) (the complement likelihood)**: This is the probability of the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam is *not* enrolled in the specific field. For simplicity, this can be approached by considering a generic likelihood across other fields.

Let's assume the following estimates for each field:

### Computer Science

- **P(H)**: Assume Adam is equally likely to be enrolled in any field, so \(P(H) = 1/\text{number of graduate fields}\). Since we are not given the number of total fields, for simplicity, we can assume \(P(H)\) is small.
- **P(E|H)**: Adam's traits like high intelligence, abstract thinking, and puzzle-solving are highly consistent with a student in computer science. Let's assume a high likelihood, say 0.7.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of a student in another field having these traits. While these characteristics can apply to other fields, they are less common overall. Let's assume a moderate likelihood, say 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Given that \(P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)\), let's normalize \(P(H) = 0.1\) for no specific total number of fields.

\[
P(E) \approx 0.7 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9 = 0.07 + 0.27 = 0.34
\]

Then,

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.34} \approx 0.206
\]

\[
P(H|E) \approx 0.206
\]

### Business Administration

- **P(H)**: Same initial probability, \(P(H) = 0.1\).
- **P(E|H)**: Traits like empathy, warm heart, and appreciation for hard work can be compatible with business administration. Let's assume a moderate likelihood, say 0.4.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Considering these traits and different other fields, let's assume, in this case, a lower likelihood, say 0.2.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[
P(E) \approx 0.4 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9 = 0.04 + 0.18 = 0.22
\]

Then,

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.1}{0.22} \approx 0.182
\]

\[
P(H|E) \approx 0.182
\]

So the final answers would be:

```
{
  "computer science": "0.206",
  "business administration": "0.182"
}
```
