To evaluate the probabilities using Bayes' Rule, let's break down the components as follows:

- P(H) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
- P(E|H) is the probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- P(E|\neg H) is the probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.
- P(H|E) is the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field given the personality sketch E.

Given that I'm asked to judge the probabilities, I'll deploy some reasoned estimates based on the information provided:

### Computer Science
1. **P(H)**: Computer science is a popular field, but given the general population of graduate students, it could be estimated that a smaller subset would align with Adam's personality traits.
   - Let's assume **P(H)** = 0.2

2. **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's curiosity for nature and strong understanding of abstract concepts, there is a reasonable fit, though computer science does not directly align with his love for animals and empathy.
   - Let's assume **P(E|H)** = 0.3

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of the personality traits E occurring in the complement field set.
   - Let's assume **P(E|\neg H)** = 0.4 (since the traits might be more prevalent in non-CS fields like biology or environmental studies)

Using Bayes Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where,
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.06 + 0.32 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.38 \]

Thus,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.38} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.157 \]

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)**: Business Administration is also a relatively common field.
   - Given Adam's traits, he may still be less likely to pursue a business-focused field.
   - Let's assume **P(H)** = 0.15

2. **P(E|H)**: Less likely given his traits which lean toward natural sciences, empathy, and abstract thinking more than typical business skills.
   - Let's assume **P(E|H)** = 0.15

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The broader set of fields among grad students where Adamâ€™s personality might fit better than strictly business.
   - Let's assume **P(E|\neg H)** = 0.35 (somewhat similar to the previous value as nature-focused students may be elsewhere)

Using Bayes Rule:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.15 \cdot 0.15 + 0.35 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.0225 + 0.2975 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.32 \]

Thus,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.15 \cdot 0.15}{0.32} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.070 \]

The final probabilities of Adam being enrolled in the fields given his personality sketch are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.157,
  "business administration": 0.070
}
```
