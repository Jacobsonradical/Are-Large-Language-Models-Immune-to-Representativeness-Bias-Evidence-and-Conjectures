To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the hypotheses \( H \) (i.e., Adam was enrolled in a specific field) given the evidence \( E \) (Adam's personality sketch), we need to use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Below are the steps and judgments for each field:

### Assumptions and Estimates:

For each field, we'll make reasoned assumptions for:
1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a typical graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in that field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he were enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he were NOT enrolled in that field.
4. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing Adam's personality traits in any graduate field.

### Estimates:

\- **Business Administration**:
- \( P(H) \): Suppose approximately 15% of graduate students in the U.S. are in Business Administration. So, \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): A curiosity about nature and a love for animals are less typical for Business Administration students, but empathy and strong intelligence might align with leadership qualities. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.20 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given that Business Administration is not directly related to nature and animals, let's estimate a slightly higher \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.30 \) since these traits might be equally likely in other fields.

\- **Computer Science**:
- \( P(H) \): Suppose approximately 10% of graduate students in the U.S. are in Computer Science. So, \( P(H) = 0.10 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Curiosity about nature and problem-solving skills fit well, though strong empathy and love for animals are less typical. Overall, let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.50 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given that Computer Science is not directly related to nature and animals but problem-solving skills are common, let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.40 \).

### Calculations:

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplification, we'll assume \( P(E) \) is roughly the same for all fields (not calculated exactly but conceptually).

\- **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.20 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} = \frac{0.03}{P(E)} \]

\- **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.50 \cdot 0.10}{P(E)} = \frac{0.05}{P(E)} \]

To compare:
\[ \frac{P(H|E)_{CS}}{P(H|E)_{BA}} = \frac{0.05/P(E)}{0.03/P(E)} = \frac{0.05}{0.03} \approx 1.67 \]

So, Adam is roughly 1.67 times more likely (in this simplified model) to be in Computer Science than Business Administration.

### Conclusion:

\[
\{
  "business administration": 0.03, \\
  "computer science": 0.05 
\}
\]

These are not normalized probabilities but show the relative likelihoods based on the given information.
