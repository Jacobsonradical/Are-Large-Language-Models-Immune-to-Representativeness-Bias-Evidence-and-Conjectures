To compute \( P(H|E) \) (the probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch), we need to use Bayes' theorem which is stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given enrollment in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given not being enrolled in that field.

Let's start with some assumptions for these probabilities:

1. \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \), \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \) - the prior probabilities of Adam enrolling in Computer Science and Business Administration could be assumed equal for simplicity unless otherwise specified. Let's assume they are each 0.1 (10%).

2. \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \) - the probability of the personality sketch given enrollment in Computer Science. Given Adam's profile, which suggests intellectual curiosity, puzzle-solving abilities, and intelligence in understanding abstract concepts, this could be relatively high. Let's assume it as 0.5.

3. \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \) - the probability of the personality sketch given enrollment in Business Administration. Given that the profile emphasizes empathy, warm heart, hard work, and dedication along with intelligence, this also has a likelihood of being reasonably high but possibly not as high as Computer Science. Let's assume it as 0.3.

4. \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \) and \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \) - the probability of the personality sketch given not being in those specific fields. Let's assume that for other fields these probabilities are generally lower. Let's assume these as 0.1 each.

Now, using Bayes' theorem to calculate:

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be calculated as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \]

For simplicity, if we assume \(\neg H \) to be the space containing other fields with lower prior probabilities than CS and BA, we can calculate P(E) in a rough estimation as:

\[ P(E) = (0.5 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.1) + (0.1 \cdot 0.8 + 0.1 \cdot 0.7) = 0.05 + 0.03 + 0.08 + 0.07 = 0.23 \]

Now proceeding with the Bayes' calculations:

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.1}{0.23} = \frac{0.05}{0.23} \approx 0.217 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.23} = \frac{0.03}{0.23} \approx 0.130 \]

So, our final computed probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.217,
  "business administration": 0.130
}
```
