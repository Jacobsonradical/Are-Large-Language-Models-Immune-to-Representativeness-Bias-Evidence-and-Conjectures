To apply Bayes' Rule and find \( P(H|E) \) for the given fields, we need to evaluate the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the background likelihoods \( P(E|\neg H) \). Given that there are other possible fields besides computer science and business administration, the final posterior probabilities do not need to sum to 1.

Let's go through the steps for both fields:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**
   - \( P(\text{comp sci}) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
   - \( P(\text{business admin}) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration.
   
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**
   - \( P(E|\text{comp sci}) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is in computer science.
   - \( P(E|\text{business admin}) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is in business administration.
   
3. **Background Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**
   - This represents how likely the personality sketch is across all other fields of study, which helps normalize the output.

Given Adam's traits (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals), it seems more likely that he might be in a field related to those interests. However, we are asked to calculate for computer science and business administration.

### Computations

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:

Assuming no specific prior information, we might assume an equal prior probability for both fields, but let's consider fields related to curiosity and empathy might be less common in computer science.

Let's assume:
- \( P(\text{comp sci}) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(\text{business admin}) = 0.1 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:

Based on the personality description, the likelihoods could be estimated as:
- \( P(E|\text{comp sci}) \): We might suspect some curiosity and intelligence is present in CS students, so let's set this relatively but not overly high, say \( 0.4 \).
- \( P(E|\text{business admin}) \): It is less likely that such a personality sketch fits a typical business admin student â€“ perhaps \( 0.1 \).

3. **Background Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:

Let's estimate this to check how common such traits are in the general grad student population, say 0.2.

### Applying Bayes' Rule

1. **Computer Science**:
   \[
   P(\text{comp sci}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{comp sci}) \cdot P(\text{comp sci})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{0.2} = 0.6
   \]

2. **Business Administration**:
   \[
   P(\text{business admin}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business admin}) \cdot P(\text{business admin})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.2} = 0.05
   \]

### Results

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.05"
}

These numbers suggest it's more likely that Adam is studying computer science than business administration given his personality sketch, though quite probable he could be in other fields more aligned with nature and empathy not listed here.
