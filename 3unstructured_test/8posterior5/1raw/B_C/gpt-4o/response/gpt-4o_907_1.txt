To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science or business administration in 2021, given the personality sketch \(E\), we use Bayes' rule as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch, which can be broken down as:
  
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Assumptions:
- We need to make estimates for the prior probabilities \(P(H)\) for each field given the general graduate student distribution.
- We need reasonable estimates for \(P(E|H)\) and \(P(E|\neg H)\) based on the fit of the personality sketch \(E\) to each field.

Given these assumptions, here are some hypothetical estimates:

**Computer Science (CS):**
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \) (prior): 0.15 (15% of graduate students might be in CS)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \) (likelihood): 0.2 (Given Adam's characteristics, there is a moderate probability for CS due to his high intelligence and problem-solving skills)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \) (likelihood of E given not CS): 0.05 (Considering many other fields might not fit his quiet and nature-centered personality well)

**Business Administration (BA):**
- \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \) (prior): 0.10 (10% of graduate students might be in BA)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \) (likelihood): 0.05 (Adam's characteristics seem less aligned with typical MBA traits, which often include extroversion and less emphasis on nature)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \) (likelihood of E given not BA): 0.1 (Balanced because nature and empathy could fit into psychology, environmental science, etc.)

Let's calculate posterior probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for each field:

### Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) \approx (0.2 \cdot 0.15) + (0.05 \cdot 0.85) = 0.03 + 0.0425 = 0.0725 \]

Thus,
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{0.0725} \approx \frac{0.03}{0.0725} \approx 0.4138 \]

### Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) \approx (0.05 \cdot 0.10) + (0.1 \cdot 0.9) = 0.005 + 0.09 = 0.095 \]

Thus,
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.10}{0.095} \approx \frac{0.005}{0.095} \approx 0.0526 \]

Therefore, the values are approximately:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4138,
  "business administration": 0.0526
}
```

These computations suggest that Adam's personality sketch fits better with the computer science field compared to business administration.
