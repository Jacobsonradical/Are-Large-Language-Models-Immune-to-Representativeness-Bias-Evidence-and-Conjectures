Sure, let's analyze the given fields using Bayes' Theorem. We'll denote the following:

- \( H_{BA} \): The hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration.
- \( H_{CS} \): The hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science.
- \( \neg H_{BA} \): The hypothesis that Adam was not enrolled in Business Administration.
- \( \neg H_{CS} \): The hypothesis that Adam was not enrolled in Computer Science.
- \( E \): The evidence, which in this case is the personality sketch of Adam.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's assume initial probabilities as follows (these would typically be based on real-world data about the distribution of students in various graduate programs, but we must make assumptions here for demonstration purposes):

- \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.4 \)

These are prior probabilities assuming a higher proportion of students could be in Computer Science given the global trends in technology fields.

Next, we judge \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \):

1. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): The likelihood of Adam having the described personality traits given he is enrolled in Business Administration. Given Adam's traits (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals), it might be less than average for a typical Business Administration student. Let's assume this as 0.1.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \): The likelihood of Adam having the described traits given he is not in Business Administration could be average for other fields. Let's assume this as 0.35.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): The likelihood of Adam having the described traits given he is enrolled in Computer Science. Given his love for solving puzzles and high intelligence for abstract concepts, this could be relatively high. Let's assume this as 0.4.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \): The likelihood of Adam having these traits, given he is not in Computer Science, would include students in all other fields, which might be lower than for Computer Science specifically. Let's assume this as 0.2.

Next, calculate \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \cdot P(\neg H_{BA}) \]
\[ P(\neg H_{BA}) = 1 - P(H_{BA}) = 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.35 \cdot 0.8 = 0.02 + 0.28 = 0.30 \]

Similarly for Computer Science:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \cdot P(\neg H_{CS}) \]
\[ P(\neg H_{CS}) = 1 - P(H_{CS}) = 0.6 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.4 \cdot 0.4 + 0.2 \cdot 0.6 = 0.16 + 0.12 = 0.28 \]

Finally, calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule:

- **Business Administration:**
  \[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.3} \approx 0.067 \]

- **Computer Science:**
  \[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.4}{0.28} \approx 0.571 \]

So, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.067,
  "computer science": 0.571
}
```

These values reflect the likelihood of Adam being in each field given the personality sketch provided.
