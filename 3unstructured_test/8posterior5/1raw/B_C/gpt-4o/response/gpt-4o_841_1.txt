To estimate the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in "business administration" or "computer science" given his personality sketch E, we will apply Bayes' rule. The formula for Bayes' rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to make some reasonable subjective estimates for P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|\neg H) for both fields.

Let's start by stating assumptions for each field:

1. **Business Administration**:
    - P(H): Business administration programs are popular, but given Adam's traits, he might be less likely to enroll in business administration compared to other fields. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
    - P(E|H): The given traits (love for nature, puzzles, animals, etc.) are not typically associated with business administration students, but it is not impossible. We'll estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
    - P(E|\neg H): Given the vast number of disciplines and Adam's strong fit in other possible fields (e.g., biology, environmental science), let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.9 \).

2. **Computer Science**:
    - P(H): Computer science is quite popular and attracts intelligent individuals who enjoy solving puzzles. Given Adam's traits, he could be reasonably likely to enroll. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
    - P(E|H): The traits (puzzles, intelligence, abstract concepts) are highly consistent with computer science students. We'll estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).
    - P(E|\neg H): Given that there are many other fields of study where Adam might fit, such as biological sciences, we'll estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.8 \).

Next, we compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \).

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

Note that \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields and ensures normalization and consistency. However, for the purpose of comparing the two probabilities, the term \( P(E) \) will cancel out, so we can write:

\[ P(H|E)_{BA} \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.1 = 0.01 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} \propto 0.7 \cdot 0.2 = 0.14 \]

By comparing the proportional values:
\[ \frac{P(H|E)_{BA}}{P(H|E)_{CS}} = \frac{0.01}{0.14} \approx 0.0714 \]

So while we cannot determine the exact probabilities without the prior for P(E), we can reasonably state that P(H|E) for Computer Science is considerably higher than for Business Administration.

Let's present it in the required format:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.01,
  "computer science": 0.14
}
```

These values are not exact probabilities but provide a comparative likelihood consistent with the given assumptions and estimates.
