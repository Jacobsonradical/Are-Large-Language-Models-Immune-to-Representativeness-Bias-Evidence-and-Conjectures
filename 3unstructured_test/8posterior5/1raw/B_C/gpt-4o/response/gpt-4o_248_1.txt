To compute \( P(H|E) \), we need to apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( H \) is the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
- \( E \) is the personality sketch of Adam.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood that Adam has the given characteristics if he is in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood that Adam has the given characteristics if he is not in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of Adam having these characteristics.

We will assume that the base rates \( P(H) \) for each field are initially equal (this is a simplification but necessary in the absence of more specific data). Let's denote that each of these prior probabilities is \( P(H) = 0.1 \), assuming there are multiple fields he could have enrolled in (though not necessarily an exhaustive list). 

Now, let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) for each field:
- For computer science, Adam's traits like high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest \( P(E|H) \) is relatively high, say 0.6.
- For business administration, while his appreciation for hard work and dedication might fit, the strong empathy and deep love for animals might be less common, suggesting \( P(E|H) \) is lower, say 0.3.

Next, let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \), the likelihood of Adam having these traits if he is not in the specified field:
- For both fields, letâ€™s assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx \) 0.2, as these traits might still be somewhat common in graduate students in other fields.

Finally, we compute \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.6 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.06 + 0.18 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.24 \]

Now we use Bayes' rule:

For computer science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.1}{0.24} = \frac{0.06}{0.24} = 0.25 \]

For business administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.24} = \frac{0.03}{0.24} = 0.125 \]

So the results are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.25,
  "business administration": 0.125
}
```
