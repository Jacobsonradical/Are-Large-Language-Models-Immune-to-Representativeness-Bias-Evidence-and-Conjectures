To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or computer science, given the personality sketch E, we use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field \( H \), given the sketch \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the sketch \( E \), given that Adam was enrolled in field \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in field \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of the sketch \( E \).

For each field:

### Business Administration

- \( P(H) \): Let's assume the prior probability is fairly moderate, say 0.1, considering the wide range of fields in graduate studies.
- \( P(E|H) \): Business administration may require team work and strategic thinking but less likely someone who enjoys nature, puzzles, and animals, let's assume 0.05.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given the sketch E, which has more inclination towards fields like biology, environmental science, etc., let's say the probability is 0.5.

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E)_{bus\_admin} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

### Computer Science

- \( P(H) \): Prior could be a bit higher, say 0.15, considering skills in puzzles and abstract concepts align well with computer science.
- \( P(E|H) \): Computer science could be a field that suits a problem-solver with high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts, assume 0.4.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Again, let's use 0.5 for other likelier fields.

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E)_{comp\_sci} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \]

Now calculating the ratios without normalizing:

For business administration:
\[ P(H|E)_{bus\_admin} \approx \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = 0.005 / P(E) \]

For computer science:
\[ P(H|E)_{comp\_sci} \approx \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} = 0.06 / P(E) \]

Let's normalize by summing these and creating ratios:

\[ P(E) = 0.005 + 0.06 = 0.065 \]

Now:

\[ P(H|E)_{bus\_admin} \approx \frac{0.005}{0.065} \approx 0.0769 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{comp\_sci} \approx \frac{0.06}{0.065} \approx 0.9231 \]

So, the probabilities for each field are:

{
  "business administration": 0.0769,
  "computer science": 0.9231
}
