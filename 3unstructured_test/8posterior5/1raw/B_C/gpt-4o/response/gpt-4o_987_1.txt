For the given problem, let's analyze the likelihoods and priors before using Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the fields "computer science" and "business administration."

### Analyzing the Fields:
1. **Computer Science:**
   - **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science, considering that it's a common graduate field in the U.S. Let's estimate this roughly.
   - **P(E|H)**: This is the probability that Adam's personality sketch is as described if he were enrolled in computer science. Given his high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts, this is quite plausible.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: This is the probability of Adam's personality sketch if he were not enrolled in computer science. Given the number of potential fields and the overlap in common graduate student traits, this is less specific but still positive.

2. **Business Administration:**
   - **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
   - **P(E|H)**: This is the probability of his traits if he were in business administration. While traits like high intelligence and appreciation for hard work are relevant, the love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles does not strongly align with business administration.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: This is similar to computer science, covering the broad spectrum of other fields.

### Assigning Probabilities:
Let's assign some rough estimates:
- **P(H)** for both fields (assuming equal popularity as a simplification):
  - \( P(\text{CS}) = 0.2 \)
  - \( P(\text{BA}) = 0.2 \)
- **P(E|H)** based on the provided personality sketch:
  - \( P(E|\text{CS}) = 0.8 \) (because traits align well with computer science)
  - \( P(E|\text{BA}) = 0.3 \) (less alignment with business administration traits)
- **P(E|\neg H)** considering the general graduate population:
  - \( P(E|\neg \text{CS}) = 0.5 \)
  - \( P(E|\neg \text{BA}) = 0.5 \)

### Applying Bayes' Rule:
Bayes' Rule is:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

Let's calculate it:
1. For Computer Science:
\[ P(E) = P(E|\text{CS})P(\text{CS}) + P(E|\neg \text{CS})P(\neg \text{CS}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.2) + (0.5 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.16 + 0.40 = 0.56 \]

\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{0.56} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.16}{0.56} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) \approx 0.286 \]

2. For Business Administration:
\[ P(E) = P(E|\text{BA})P(\text{BA}) + P(E|\neg \text{BA})P(\neg \text{BA}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.2) + (0.5 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.06 + 0.40 = 0.46 \]

\[ P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.46} \]
\[ P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.46} \]
\[ P(\text{BA}|E) \approx 0.130 \]

So, based on the given estimates and calculations, the posterior probabilities are:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.286,
  "business administration": 0.130
}
```
