To calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Rule, we'll follow these steps:

Bayes' Rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For each field, we'll need to:
1. Estimate the prior probability \( P(H) \) – the probability that Adam was enrolled in that field without any additional information.
2. Estimate the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) – the probability that Adam's personality sketch \( E \) would be observed if he were enrolled in that specific field.
3. Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) – the probability that Adam's personality sketch \( E \) would be observed if he were not enrolled in that specific field.

Since \( P(E) \) can be decomposed into:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

we'll assume prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and rough estimates for the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

### Estimations:

**Computer Science:**
- \( P(H) \): Graduates in computer science make a significant portion, so let's estimate a prior probability of \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Given the personality sketch, Adam's intelligence and abstract thinking align well with computer science, so let's say \( P(E|H) = 0.5 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability Adam's personality would match the sketch if he wasn't in computer science seems lower, let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

**Business Administration:**
- \( P(H) \): Business administration is a common field but less so for someone with Adam's characteristics, so let's estimate \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): His empathy and understanding of hard work align partially, but not entirely with business administration. Let's say \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability Adam’s personality would match the sketch if he wasn't in business administration seems slightly higher, \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

Using Bayes' Rule to compute \( P(H|E) \):

### Computer Science:
\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) = (0.5 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) = 0.1 + 0.24 = 0.34
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.34} \approx 0.294
\]

### Business Administration:
\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) = (0.3 \cdot 0.1) + (0.4 \cdot 0.9) = 0.03 + 0.36 = 0.39
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.39} \approx 0.077
\]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are:

\[
{
  "computer science": 0.294,
  "business administration": 0.077
}
\]
