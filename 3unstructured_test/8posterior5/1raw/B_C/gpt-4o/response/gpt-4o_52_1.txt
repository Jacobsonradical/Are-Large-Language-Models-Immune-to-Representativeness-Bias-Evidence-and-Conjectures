Sure, let's evaluate each field with the given information and then apply Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probabilities.

### Business Administration

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is studying business administration.
  - Let's assume the prior probability for business administration among all possible graduate fields is \(P(H_{BA}) = 0.2\).

- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is studying business administration.
  - Business administration students might have some diverse interests, but traits like a deep love for animals and strong empathy might not be as closely related. However, the appreciation for hard work and dedication is relevant.
  - Let's estimate \(P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.3\).

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is not studying business administration.
  - Considering he's a quiet boy with a love for nature and animals, these traits may not be as common in business administration but could be typical in other fields like biology or environmental science.
  - Let's estimate \(P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.7\).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[
P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)}
\]
\[
P(E) = P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \cdot P(\neg H_{BA})
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.3 \times 0.2 + 0.7 \times 0.8 = 0.06 + 0.56 = 0.62
\]
\[
P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{0.62} = \frac{0.06}{0.62} \approx 0.097
\]

### Computer Science

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is studying computer science.
  - Let's assume the prior probability for computer science among all possible graduate fields is \(P(H_{CS}) = 0.25\).

- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is studying computer science.
  - Traits like high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts align well with computer science. Solving puzzles is also relevant.
  - Let's estimate \(P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.6\).

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is not studying computer science.
  - Again, considering his interests in nature and animals might prompt people to think of other fields like biology or environmental science rather than computer science.
  - Let's estimate \(P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.5\).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[
P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)}
\]
\[
P(E) = P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \cdot P(\neg H_{CS})
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.6 \times 0.25 + 0.5 \times 0.75 = 0.15 + 0.375 = 0.525
\]
\[
P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.25}{0.525} = \frac{0.15}{0.525} \approx 0.286
\]

### Summary

Based on the calculations and estimations, the probabilities are:

\[
{
  "business administration": 0.097,
  "computer science": 0.286
}
\]

These values reflect the computed posterior probabilities for Adam being enrolled in Business Administration or Computer Science given his personality sketch.
