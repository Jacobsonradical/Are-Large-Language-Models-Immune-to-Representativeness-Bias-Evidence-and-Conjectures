To estimate \( P(H|E) \) for the given fields using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate the probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Here's how we can break it down for each field:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in that field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in that field.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For simplicity, we assume that \( P(\neg H) \) can be given equal prior to all other possible fields.

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)**: The baseline probability of Adam being a student in Business Administration. Let's assign it a value of 0.10 as business administration is a common graduate field but not necessarily the most likely given the personality sketch.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood that Adam's characteristics match a typical Business Administration student. Given Adam's personality sketch (curiosity about nature, puzzles, love for animals), this would likely be low. Let's assign it a value of 0.05.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality characteristics given he is not in Business Administration. This would be relatively higher given the multitude of fields that might also have students who enjoy nature and puzzles. Estimate this as 0.15.

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{Business Administration}} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.10}{0.05 \cdot 0.10 + 0.15 \cdot 0.90} = \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.135} = \frac{0.005}{0.14} \approx 0.036 \]

### Computer Science
1. **P(H)**: The baseline probability of Adam being a student in Computer Science. Given his high intelligence and puzzle-solving skills, let's assign it a higher value, say 0.20.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood that Adam's characteristics match a typical Computer Science student. His problem-solving abilities and intelligence align well, so let's assign it a value of 0.40.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality characteristics given he is not in Computer Science. This is similar to above, estimate it as 0.15.

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{Computer Science}} = \frac{0.40 \cdot 0.20}{0.40 \cdot 0.20 + 0.15 \cdot 0.80} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.12} = \frac{0.08}{0.20} = 0.40 \]

Therefore, the estimated probabilities that Adam was enrolled in these specific fields given his personality sketch are:

{
  "business administration": 0.036,
  "computer science": 0.40
}
