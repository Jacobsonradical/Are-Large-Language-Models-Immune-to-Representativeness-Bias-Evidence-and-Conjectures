In order to calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Rule, we need the following probabilities:
1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was not enrolled in that field.
4. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.

The key formula is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) can be difficult to estimate directly, we often normalize the results so that the relative probabilities are comparable.

### Assumptions:
- Given Adam's characteristics, we need to estimate how likely he is to be in each field.
- Adam seems more compatible with fields that involve analytical thinking, problem-solving, and possibly nature-related studies.

Given that Adam has interests that align strongly with analytical thinking (puzzles), empathy, and intelligence, we might suggest the following interpretations for \( P(E|H) \):

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Computer Science (CS) involves significant problem-solving and abstract thinking.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): Likely high as CS students often have high intelligence and problem-solving skills, though empathy and nature may not be the strongest fit.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.6 \).

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Business Administration might be more people-oriented but less directly associated with nature, puzzles, or abstract thinking.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): Likely lower due to mismatch in nature interest and the focus on empathy might not align perfectly with the nature and puzzle-solving traits.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.3 \).

For priors (\( P(H) \)):
- Let's estimate a prior probability for each field based on the general interest in these fields among graduate students.
- Assume uniform priors if no additional information is provided.
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.2 \)

Without precise data for \( P(E|\neg H) \) and \( P(E) \), we use an approximation where we normalize the results.

### Calculation:
1. **Computer Science**:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)}
   \]
   \[
   P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto 0.6 \times 0.2 = 0.12
   \]

2. **Business Administration**:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)}
   \]
   \[
   P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \propto 0.3 \times 0.2 = 0.06
   \]

To normalize:
\[
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) + P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = 0.12 + 0.06 = 0.18
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.18} = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.67
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.18} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.33
\]

Thus, the normalized results are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.67,
  "business administration": 0.33
}
