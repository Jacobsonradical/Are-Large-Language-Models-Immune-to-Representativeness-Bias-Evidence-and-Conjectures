To evaluate the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in the field of computer science or business administration based on his personality sketch, we need to consider the probabilities \(P(H)\), \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E|\neg H)\), and then use Bayes' rule to compute \(P(H|E)\).

Let's break down the probabilities:

### Probabilities to Estimate

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\):**
    - \(P(H_{\text{CS}})\) (for computer science)
    - \(P(H_{\text{BA}})\) (for business administration)

2. **Conditional Probability \(P(E|H)\):**
    - \(P(E|H_{\text{CS}})\): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is in computer science.
    - \(P(E|H_{\text{BA}})\): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is in business administration.

3. **Conditional Probability \(P(E|\neg H)\):**
    - This is a bit tricky since we need the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is in fields other than the one considered. For simplicity, we can average over all other fields.

4. **Bayes Rule to compute \(P(H|E)\):**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Note that \(P(E)\) is a normalizing constant that ensures the probabilities sum up to 1, but since we are not covering all fields in this scenario, we can focus on the relative probabilities for comparison.

### Assumptions

1. Assuming around 20 graduate fields of specialization, we set:
    - \(P(H_{\text{CS}}) = \frac{1}{20} = 0.05\)
    - \(P(H_{\text{BA}}) = \frac{1}{20} = 0.05\)

2. **Estimation of Conditional Probabilities:**
    - Given Adam's personality:
        - Quiet, puzzle-solving, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, nature-loving, empathetic.
    - These traits might be more aligned with computer science (analytical skills) than business administration (typically more extroverted and leadership-oriented).

Let's assign:
- \(P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.6\)
- \(P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.2\)
- Assume \(P(E|\neg H)\) is the baseline average for other fields, which might be \(= 0.05\).

### Posterior Probabilities using Bayes Rule

Now calculate:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \]

Since we're not normalizing fully, we compute the numerator for comparison:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.6 \cdot 0.05 = 0.03 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \approx P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.2 \cdot 0.05 = 0.01 \]

### Result

Thus, for a relative comparison:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.03,
  "business administration": 0.01
}
```

### Note
These values do not sum to 1 because we are only computing relative probabilities for two fields, not a complete partition of all possible fields.
