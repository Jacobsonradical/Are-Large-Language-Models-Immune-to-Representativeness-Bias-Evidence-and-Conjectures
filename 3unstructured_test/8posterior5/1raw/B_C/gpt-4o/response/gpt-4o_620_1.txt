To compute \(P(H|E)\) for each field of study, let's outline the steps required using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the given field.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in the field.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\) is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in the field.
- \(P(E)\) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch.

For simplicity and lack of specific numerical data, I'll assume rough probabilities and focus more on the relative likelihoods given the personality sketch.

### Business Administration

**P(H) for Business Administration:**
Students in business administration programs don't typically have a strong association with curiosity about nature or a deep love for animals. These fields often attract individuals with interests in economics, management, and organizational leadership.

Let's assume \(P(H)\) for Business Administration is relatively low. For simplicity, we can set it to 0.1.

**P(E|H) for Business Administration:**
The traits described (curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, empathy) don't align strongly with typical business administration students.

Let's set this value to 0.2.

**P(E|\neg H) for Business Administration:**
Given the sketch, if Adam were not in business administration, he’d more likely have those qualities. Thus, \(P(E|\neg H)\) would be higher, perhaps 0.8.

### Computer Science

**P(H) for Computer Science:**
Students in computer science often have interests in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, which align well with Adam's traits. 

Let's assume \(P(H)\) for Computer Science is reasonably high. Let's set it to 0.4.

**P(E|H) for Computer Science:**
Adam's curiosity, puzzle-solving skill, intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts fit quite well.

Let's set this value relatively high at 0.7.

**P(E|\neg H) for Computer Science:**
Given the sketch, if Adam were not in computer science, these qualities would still be common, as they could apply to many other fields like natural sciences.

Let’s set this to 0.5.

### Applying Bayes’ Rule

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.8 \cdot (1-0.1)} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.72} \approx 0.0278 \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.4}{0.7 \cdot 0.4 + 0.5 \cdot (1-0.4)} = \frac{0.28}{0.28 + 0.3} \approx 0.4828 \]
