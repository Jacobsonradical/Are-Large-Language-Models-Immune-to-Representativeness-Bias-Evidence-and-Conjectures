Given the personality sketch of Adam and the description provided, we can use Bayes' Rule to calculate the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field, based on his personality traits. Let's outline our reasoning and assumptions step-by-step:

### Business Administration

**Prior Probability, P(H):**
- Let's assume business administration is moderately likely for any given graduate student. We'll arbitrarily set this to 0.15, knowing it could be higher or lower.

**Likelihood, P(E|H):**
- Adam does not fit the typical profile of someone in business administration, as it often requires skills in management, finance, and competitiveness, which are not highlighted in his personality sketch.
- Given this mismatch, we'll set P(E|H) relatively low, say 0.05.

**Complement Likelihood, P(E|\neg H):**
- Given that there are many fields more aligned with Adam’s interests in nature, puzzles, empathy, and intelligence, we'll set this comparatively high. Let's arbitrarily set this to 0.50.

### Computer Science

**Prior Probability, P(H):**
- Let’s assume computer science is quite common among U.S. graduate students. We'll set this prior probability to 0.25.

**Likelihood, P(E|H):**
- Adam’s liking for solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts fit well with computer science. However, his love for nature and animals is less typical.
- Given this somewhat mixed alignment, we'll set P(E|H) moderately high, say 0.40.

**Complement Likelihood, P(E|\neg H):**
- Given that many fields outside computer science better suit Adam’s passion for nature and animals, let's set this moderately high. Let's arbitrarily set this to 0.60.

Now, we'll use **Bayes' Rule** to calculate the posterior probabilities:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where the normalizing constant \(P(E)\) is given by:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.15}{0.05 \times 0.15 + 0.50 \times 0.85} \approx \frac{0.0075}{0.0075 + 0.425} \approx \frac{0.0075}{0.4325} \approx 0.017 \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.40 \times 0.25}{0.40 \times 0.25 + 0.60 \times 0.75} \approx \frac{0.10}{0.10 + 0.45} \approx \frac{0.10}{0.55} \approx 0.182 \]

Putting these into the requested format, we get:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.017,
  "computer science": 0.182
}
```

These probabilities indicate that, based on the given personality traits, Adam is more likely to be enrolled in computer science than in business administration.
