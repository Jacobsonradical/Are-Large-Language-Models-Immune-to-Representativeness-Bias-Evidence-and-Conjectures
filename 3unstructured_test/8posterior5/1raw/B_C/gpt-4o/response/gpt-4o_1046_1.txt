To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field based on his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For the purpose of this exercise:
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in that field.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in that field.
- \(P(E)\) can be computed as \(P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)\).

Given that we don't have exact statistics, I'll make reasonable assumptions based on the typical attributes and interests associated with each field.

### Computer Science
1. **P(H)**: Assume the prior probability of any random graduate student being in computer science is 0.2 (20%).
2. **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's high intelligence, curiosity, and love for solving puzzles, which aligns well with the field of computer science, let's assume P(E|H) = 0.6.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Let's estimate the probability of observing someone like Adam in a non-computer science field. Given the specificity of the traits towards scientific inquiry, assume P(E|\neg H) = 0.2.

Using Bayes’ theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)**: Assume the prior probability of any random graduate student being in business administration is 0.15 (15%).
2. **P(E|H)**: The traits of strong empathy and appreciation for hard work and dedication may partly align with business administration, but not as strongly as with computer science. Assume P(E|H) = 0.3.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Use the same general estimate for non-business fields, P(E|\neg H) = 0.2.

Using Bayes’ theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.15}{P(E)} \]

To calculate \(P(E)\):
\[ P(E) = (0.6 \times 0.2) + (0.3 \times 0.15) + \text{other fields} \]

Assuming the influence of other unidentified fields is negligible, we can simplify our calculations to get a rough estimate.

Now, putting it all together:

For **computer science**:

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.6 \times 0.2}{(0.6 \times 0.2) + (0.3 \times 0.15)} = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.045} = \frac{0.12}{0.165} \approx 0.727 \]

For **business administration**:

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.3 \times 0.15}{(0.6 \times 0.2) + (0.3 \times 0.15)} = \frac{0.045}{0.12 + 0.045} = \frac{0.045}{0.165} \approx 0.273 \]

So, in conclusion:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.727,
  "business administration": 0.273
}
