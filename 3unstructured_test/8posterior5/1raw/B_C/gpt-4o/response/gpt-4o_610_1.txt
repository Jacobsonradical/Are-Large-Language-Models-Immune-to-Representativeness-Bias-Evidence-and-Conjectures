Given the data provided and using Bayes' Rule, we calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \), i.e., the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific graduate field given his personality sketch \( E \). To achieve this, we require:

1. Prior probability \( P(H) \): The initial guess for the probability of being enrolled in a given field.
2. Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the personality sketch given the field of enrollment.
3. Marginal likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the personality sketch given other fields of specialization.

Let's make some educated guesses for these probabilities.

### Computer Science

#### Prior Probability \( P(H) \)
Let’s assume the overall proportion of students enrolling in Computer Science among graduate students is around 15%.
\[ P(\text{H}_{CS}) = 0.15 \]

#### Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)
Given Adam's traits — high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, puzzle-solving tendencies, and interest in nature which might align with algorithmic thinking or biological data processing — the probability that these traits fit a Computer Science student can be reasonably assumed to be moderate.
\[ P(E|\text{H}_{CS}) = 0.4 \]

#### Marginal Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)
Considering other fields, Adam’s traits may also be common in fields like biology, environmental sciences, or psychology, making the sketch somewhat less discriminative.
\[ P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.2 \]

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(\text{H}_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{H}_{CS}) \cdot P(\text{H}_{CS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.15}{0.2} = 0.3 \]

### Business Administration

#### Prior Probability \( P(H) \)
Assume the proportion of students enrolling in Business Administration is around 20%.
\[ P(\text{H}_{BA}) = 0.2 \]

#### Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)
Given Adam's empathy, warm heart, and appreciation for dedication, these traits could potentially fit, but the technical and abstract inclinations do not strongly suggest Business Administration.
\[ P(E|\text{H}_{BA}) = 0.1 \]

#### Marginal Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)
As before, the marginal likelihood remains the same for other fields.
\[ P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.2 \]

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(\text{H}_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{H}_{BA}) \cdot P(\text{H}_{BA})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.2} = 0.1 \]

### Results

Given these calculations:
\[ P(\text{H}_{CS}|E) = 0.3 \]
\[ P(\text{H}_{BA}|E) = 0.1 \]

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

Please note that these probabilities are approximations based on the given descriptions and broad assumptions. Actual data from admissions or other sources would provide more accurate prior probabilities and likelihoods.
