Sure, let me break down the process.

We have:
- \( E \): Adam's personality sketch.
- \( H \): Hypothesis in question (e.g., Adam was enrolled in computer science).
- \( \neg H \): Adam was not enrolled in the given field.

Given the personality sketch and field hypotheses, we need to evaluate the following for each field:
1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the specified field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given enrollment in the specified field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given enrollment in a different field.

Using these, we can compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
However, since we are interested in comparing between multiple fields and \( P(E) \) is the same across hypotheses, we can focus on comparing the numerators \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for each field.

Let's reason through this for "computer science" and "business administration":

### Computer Science
- \( P(H) \): Let's assume a moderate prior probability given the popularity of computer science. Say \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's intelligence, problem-solving skills, and interest in abstract concepts, this personality aligns relatively well with a field like computer science. Let's assign a high probability. Say \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.7 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): This is tricky, but since Adam's attributes align somewhat generally with intelligence and problem-solving abilities which could fit several fields, let's assume a moderate value. Say \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.5 \).

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): Business Administration is also a common field, but maybe slightly less common in this kind of personality fit compared to computer science. Say \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.15 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): This field typically requires strong interpersonal skills and understanding in operations, which is less of a direct match to the given personality sketch focused on puzzles, empathy, and nature. Give a lower likelihood. Say \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.4 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): This is the same as explaining the sketch given any other field, assume it's the same as earlier. Say \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.5 \).

Plugging these into the Bayesian framework:

For Computer Science:
\[
P(H_{CS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) = 0.7 \cdot 0.2 = 0.14
\]

For Business Administration:
\[
P(H_{BA}|E) \propto P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) = 0.4 \cdot 0.15 = 0.06
\]

These values can be normalized, but since we are comparing the fields, the ratios provide a good comparative measure.

Thus, our answer in the required format:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.14,
  "business administration": 0.06
}
```
