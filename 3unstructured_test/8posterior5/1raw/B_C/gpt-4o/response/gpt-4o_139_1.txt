To determine the likelihood that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or computer science based on the given personality sketch and using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate the relevant probabilities.

Given:
- \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the fields.
- \(P(E|H)\): The probability of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam was enrolled in each of the fields.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam was not enrolled in each of the fields.
- \(P(H|E)\): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the fields given the personality sketch \(E\).

Let’s assign these probabilities subjectively based on typical graduate student distributions and the described characteristics.

### For business administration:

1. **P(H) - Prior Probability:**
   - Let's assume graduate students are distributed reasonably across popular fields such as business administration and computer science.
   - If we loosely assume an equal distribution over a number of common fields, \(P(H)\) for business administration could be roughly 1/10 or 0.1 as an initial estimate.

2. **P(E|H) - Likelihood:**
   - Adam’s traits (interest in nature, solving puzzles, empathy for animals) are less commonly associated with business administration.
   - Let's assign this a lower likelihood, say 0.05.

3. **P(E|\neg H) - Probability of observing \(E\) given not in business administration:**
   - Since the environment and other non-business fields may include fields like biology or environmental science, where his traits fit better, this might be somewhat higher.
   - Let's assign this a higher value, such as 0.15.

Using Bayes' Rule: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) \) is the normalization factor.

We approximate:
\[ P(E) \approx \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{0.15 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.005}{0.135} \approx 0.037 \]

### For computer science:

1. **P(H) - Prior Probability:**
   - Assume similar distribution as before, \(P(H)\) for computer science could be approximately 1/10 or 0.1.

2. **P(E|H) - Likelihood:**
   - Adam’s traits such as curiosity for nature, solving puzzles, high intelligence, and interest in abstract concepts fit reasonably well with computer science.
   - Let's assign this a moderate likelihood, say 0.2.

3. **P(E|\neg H) - Probability of observing \(E\) given not in computer science:**
   - Traits fit moderately well with a range of other fields.
   - We'll assign this a value like 0.15.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.15 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.02}{0.135} \approx 0.148 \]

So using this approach, the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) become:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.037,
  "computer science": 0.148
}
```

These values reflect the higher likelihood that Adam's personality sketch fits better with computer science than business administration, as inferred through the reasoning process and applying Bayes' rule.
