To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each of the fields, we need the following values:
1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in that specific field.

Bayes' Rule states that:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( P(E) \) can be computed as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's analyze each field:

### For Computer Science:
1. \( P(H) \): Given the proportion of graduate students in various fields, let's assume a generic prior probability of 0.2 for being in computer science.
2. \( P(E|H) \): Given the personality sketch, a strong understanding of abstract concepts fits well with computer science, as does high intelligence and problem-solving abilities. Let's assume this is relatively high, say 0.6.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not in computer science. Since these traits can also be common in other fields, let's assume this to be 0.3.

Using Bayes’ Rule:
\[
P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} = \frac{0.6 \times 0.2}{(0.6 \times 0.2) + (0.3 \times 0.8)} = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.24} = \frac{0.12}{0.36} \approx 0.33
\]

### For Business Administration:
1. \( P(H) \): Assume a slightly lower generic prior probability, say 0.1, for being in business administration.
2. \( P(E|H) \): Given the personality sketch, it does not strongly align with typical characteristics associated with business administration, such as negotiation and management skills; let's assume this is relatively low, say 0.2.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not in business administration. Given it's less likely, let's assume this to be 0.5 as the traits fit other fields better than business.

Using Bayes’ Rule:
\[
P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{(0.2 \times 0.1) + (0.5 \times 0.9)} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.45} = \frac{0.02}{0.47} \approx 0.043
\]

Now we can provide the answers in the required format.
