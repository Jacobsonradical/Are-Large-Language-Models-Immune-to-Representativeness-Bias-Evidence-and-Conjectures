To solve this problem using Bayes' rule, we need to follow the proper steps and make reasonable judgments about the probabilities involved. Here's a refresher on Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in the field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the evidence (the personality sketch) given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence, which can be computed using \[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's start with the given fields of study:

### Computer Science
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is in computer science – let's assume it's reasonably high due to the popularity and broad spectrum of the field. Let's assign \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
2. **P(E|H)**: The personality traits such as high intelligence, problem-solving abilities (like solving puzzles), and understanding abstract concepts align well with computer science. Let's assign \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: For the complement of H (not studying computer science), Adam could still have these traits, but let's assume it's slightly less probable. We can assign \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.2) + (0.4 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.14 + 0.32 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.46 \]

So,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.46} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.14}{0.46} \approx 0.304 \]

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is in business administration – let's assign it a plausibility, but not as high as computer science. Let's choose \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
2. **P(E|H)**: The personality traits such as strong empathy, appreciation for hard work, and dedication could fit, but problem-solving and understanding abstract concepts are not primary traits for business administration. Let's assign \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Still, these traits could be found among students in general, so let's assign \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.4 \cdot 0.1) + (0.5 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.45 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.49 \]

So,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.1}{0.49} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.49} \approx 0.082 \]

Therefore, the calculated conditional probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.304,
  "business administration": 0.082
}
```

Remember, these values are based on the assumptions and probabilities we've assigned, and they are estimations. The total does not need to add up to 1, as there are other fields of study not considered here.
