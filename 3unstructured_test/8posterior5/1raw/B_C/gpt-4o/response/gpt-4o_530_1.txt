To apply Bayes' theorem for this problem, let's denote the following probabilities:

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the evidence (Adam's personality sketch) given that he is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of the evidence given that he is not enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in that field, given the evidence.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant which does not affect the relative comparison of different fields conditioned on the same evidence, we can compare the relative values:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

### Assumptions:
- We will assume \( P(H) \) (the prior probability of Adam being in any given field) is similar for both fields, as we don't have evidence suggesting one is significantly more likely than the other. We will denote these as 0.5 each for simplicity but recognize they could be different.
- \( P(E|H) \) will be evaluated based on how well Adam's personality and interests match each field.
- \( P(E | \neg H) \) is implicitly considered across all other fields, and since we are only focused on relative likelihoods, we will simplify our assumption to equal probabilities for fields other than the one in question.

### Evaluation:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): Assume 0.5
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's personality does not strongly align with the typical traits associated with business administration, which often emphasizes leadership, management, and interpersonal skills. Thus, \( P(E|H) \) might be lower.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given that Adam exhibits traits strongly linked to other fields such as science or nature-related studies, this probability will be relatively higher.

   Let’s estimate:
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \)
   - Normalized \( P(H|E) \propto 0.2 \times 0.5 = 0.1 \)

2. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Assume 0.5
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam enjoys solving puzzles (an attribute aligned with problem-solving skills in computer science), shows high intelligence, and understands abstract concepts well. Thus, \( P(E|H) \) would be relatively higher.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): This would be lower due to many fields not aligning as well with his personality traits.

   Let’s estimate:
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.7 \)
   - Normalized \( P(H|E) \propto 0.7 \times 0.5 = 0.35 \)

Using these rough estimates, we arrive at the following relative probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.35
}
```

Again, the values are relative and simplified based on the provided personality sketch. Different priors or interpretations might adjust these results.
