To compute \( P(H|E) \), we'll use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the sketch, let's estimate the probabilities for each hypothesis.

### Fields of Study

1. **Computer Science**
   - **P(H_CS)**: The prior probability that a random graduate student in the U.S. is in computer science. Computer science is a common graduate program, so let's say \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.15 \).
   - **P(E|H_CS)**: Given Adam's traits (curiosity, intelligence, love for solving puzzles, understanding abstract concepts), it's reasonable to think he might be in computer science. Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.5 \).
   - **P(E|\neg H_CS)**: The probability that Adam's traits match if he is not in computer science. Nature and animals lean against computer science, so \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.2 \).

Calculating for computer science:

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is constant for both calculations and mainly \( P(\neg H) \) values are considered,

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) \]

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx 0.5 \times 0.15 = 0.075 \]

2. **Business Administration**
   - **P(H_BA)**: The prior probability that a random graduate student in the U.S. is in business administration. Business administration is also common, so let's say \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.15 \).
   - **P(E|H_BA)**: Given Adam's traits, business administration seems less likely because it doesn't align strongly with curiosity about nature, animals, and solving puzzles. Letâ€™s estimate \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.1 \).
   - **P(E|\neg H_BA)**: The probability that Adam's traits match if he is not in business administration. \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.3 \).

Calculating for business administration:

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) \]

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \approx 0.1 \times 0.15 = 0.015 \]

### Normalizing the Probabilities

Let's normalize to get relative values (since we are only comparing these two probabilities):

\[
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx 0.075
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \approx 0.015
\]

Normalize by dividing by the sum \(0.075 + 0.015 = 0.09\):

\[
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.075}{0.09} = \frac{75}{90} = \frac{5}{6} \approx 0.833
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.015}{0.09} = \frac{15}{90} = \frac{1}{6} \approx 0.167
\]

### Final Result

\[
{
  "computer science": 0.833,
  "business administration": 0.167
}
\]
