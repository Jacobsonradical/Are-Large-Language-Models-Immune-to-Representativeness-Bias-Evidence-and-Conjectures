To utilize Bayes' rule, we need to calculate the probability \( P(H|E) \), which is the probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch \( E \). Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Though calculating exact probabilities is challenging without specific data, we can make reasoned estimates based on the provided sketch. Let's break down each hypothesis.

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in business administration. Given the multitude of graduate fields, let's assume:
   - \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.2 \)
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in business administration. Adam has traits more aligned with fields that require empathy, curiosity, and abstract thinking rather than the typical traits emphasized in business (e.g., extroversion, networking). Let's assume:
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1 \)
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not enrolled in business administration. Given that the traits align more closely with fields like computer science, this might be:
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.2 \)

### Computer Science
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in computer science. Given the popularity of computer science, let's assume:
   - \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.3 \)
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in computer science. His traits like puzzle-solving, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts fit well within computer science. Let's assume:
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.4 \)
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not enrolled in computer science. Given the alignment, this might be:
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.1\)

Now, let's compute the posterior probabilities:

### Business Administration
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \]

Assuming \( P(E) \approx P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{\text{BA}})) \):
\[ P(E) \approx 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.2 \cdot 0.8 = 0.18 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.18} \approx 0.111 \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \]

Assuming \( P(E) \approx P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{\text{CS}})) \):
\[ P(E) \approx 0.4 \cdot 0.3 + 0.1 \cdot 0.7 = 0.19 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{0.19} \approx 0.632 \]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately:

{
  "business administration": 0.111,
  "computer science": 0.632
}
