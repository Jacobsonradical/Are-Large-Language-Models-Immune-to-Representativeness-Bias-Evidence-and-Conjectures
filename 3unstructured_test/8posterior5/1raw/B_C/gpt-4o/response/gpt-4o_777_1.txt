Sure, I'll use Bayes' theorem to estimate \( P(H|E) \), the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch \( E \).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we need to estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) based on the information given about Adam and common characteristics associated with students in those fields.

### Business Administration

1. **\(\mathbf{P(H)}\)**: The prior probability that any given graduate student is studying business administration. Let’s assume:

\[ P(H_{BA}) = 0.2 \]

2. **\(\mathbf{P(E|H)}\)**: The likelihood of Adam having the described personality if he is in business administration. Given that most business students might be more socially inclined and less focused on abstract concepts:

\[ P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.1 \]

3. **\(\mathbf{P(E|\neg H)}\)**: The likelihood of Adam having the described personality independent of him studying business administration. This is the complement proportion of the personality in other fields (e.g., natural sciences, humanities):

\[ P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.3 \]

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA})P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]

We won't calculate \( P(E) \) directly since \( P(E|\neg H) \) provides a relative measure for comparison. Bayes' theorem becomes:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto P(E|H_{BA})P(H_{BA}) \]

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02 \]

### Computer Science

1. **\(\mathbf{P(H)}\)**: The prior probability that any given graduate student is studying computer science. Let’s assume:

\[ P(H_{CS}) = 0.3 \]

2. **\(\mathbf{P(E|H)}\)**: The likelihood of Adam having the described personality if he is in computer science. Computer science students often might have interest in abstract concepts and problem-solving:

\[ P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.5 \]

3. **\(\mathbf{P(E|\neg H)}\)**: The likelihood of Adam having the described personality independent of him studying computer science. The complement proportion can be smaller, considering other varied fields:

\[ P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.3 \]

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS})P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]

Again, we'll use relative comparison:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{CS})P(H_{CS}) \]

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto 0.5 \times 0.3 = 0.15 \]

### Final Comparison

Based on the relative proportions:

{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.15
}

From these estimations, Adam is more likely to be a graduate student in computer science than in business administration.
