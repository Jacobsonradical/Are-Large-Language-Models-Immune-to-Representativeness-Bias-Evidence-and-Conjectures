To apply Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \) (the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch), we need to estimate the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field (before considering his personality sketch).
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in that field.
4. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch, which can be calculated using the law of total probability.

Let's start with some reasonable assumptions and estimates:

**Business Administration:**
- \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): Assume that the prior probability of any given graduate student being enrolled in Business Administration is moderate, say 0.10.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he studies Business Administration might be low, considering business administration students might be more inclined towards social interaction, teamwork, and leadership; let's assume 0.05.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch, given he is not in Business Administration, might be higher since he is more likely in some other field that values curiosity about nature, intelligence, and empathy; assume 0.30.

**Computer Science:**
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): Assume that the prior probability of any given graduate student being enrolled in Computer Science is slightly higher, say 0.20.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he studies Computer Science might be higher, considering that computer scientists often enjoy solving puzzles and abstract concepts; let's assume 0.40.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \): Again, the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in Computer Science might be moderate; assume 0.20.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(E_{\text{BA}}) = P(E|H_{\text{BA}})P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}})P(\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \]
\[ P(E_{\text{BA}}) = (0.05)(0.10) + (0.30)(0.90) = 0.005 + 0.27 = 0.275 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{(0.05)(0.10)}{0.275} \approx 0.018 \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(E_{\text{CS}}) = P(E|H_{\text{CS}})P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}})P(\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \]
\[ P(E_{\text{CS}}) = (0.40)(0.20) + (0.20)(0.80) = 0.08 + 0.16 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{(0.40)(0.20)}{0.24} = \frac{0.08}{0.24} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.333 \]

So, the results are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.018,
  "computer science": 0.333
}
```
