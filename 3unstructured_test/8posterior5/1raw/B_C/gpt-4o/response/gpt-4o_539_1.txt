Let's use Bayes' theorem to compute \( P(H|E) \):
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
Here, \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field, \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in that field, and \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in that field. 

We don't have exact values for these probabilities, so we will make reasonable assumptions based on the given information.

### Assumptions
#### Computer Science
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): Let's assume it's moderately likely given many students choose this field.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): Likelihood of these traits aligning with someone in computer science.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \): Likelihood of these traits in the general graduate population outside of computer science.

#### Business Administration
- \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): Let's assume it's less likely given Adam's profound love for nature and animals, which might not align closely with typical MBA traits.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): Likelihood of these traits aligning with someone in business administration.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \): Likelihood of these traits in the general graduate population outside of business administration.

### Prior Probabilities (\(P(H)\))
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.3 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.1 \)

### Likelihoods (\(P(E|H)\))
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.7 \) (Curiosity about nature and puzzles aligns well with characteristics needed in computer science)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.2 \) (Traits like empathy might fit but less so the love for nature and animals)

### Complement Likelihoods (\(P(E|\neg H)\))
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.7 \)

### Calculation
To calculate \( P(E) \):
\[
P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{CS}})
\]
Similarly for \( H_{\text{BA}} \).

#### For Computer Science
\[
P(E)_{\text{CS}} = (0.7 \cdot 0.3) + (0.3 \cdot 0.7) = 0.21 + 0.21 = 0.42
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.3}{0.42} = \frac{0.21}{0.42} = 0.5
\]

#### For Business Administration
\[
P(E)_{\text{BA}} = (0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.7 \cdot 0.9) = 0.02 + 0.63 = 0.65
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.65} = \frac{0.02}{0.65} \approx 0.03
\]

### Results
\[
{
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.03
}
\]
