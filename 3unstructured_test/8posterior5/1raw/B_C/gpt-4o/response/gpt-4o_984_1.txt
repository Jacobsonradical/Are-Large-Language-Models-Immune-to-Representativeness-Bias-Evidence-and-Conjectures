To estimate \( P(H|E) \) for each field (business administration and computer science) using Bayes' rule, we need to input reasonable estimates for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (the field of study).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence.

Since the total probability would encompass all possible fields (more than just business administration and computer science), let's focus on relative comparisons. 

### Business Administration
**Hypothesis (H):** Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(H) \): Let's assume a lower base rate for this graduate field because Adam's traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals) don't strongly align with typical business administration interests. Let's set it at 0.1.
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's high intelligence and appreciation for hard work, it seems plausible but not strongly aligned with business traits. Let's assign it around 0.2.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Considering fields more aligned with Adam’s interests like biology or environmental science, \( P(E|\neg H) \) should be relatively higher. Let's approximate it as 0.7 since most other fields where these interests are more aligned will be prominent.

### Computer Science
**Hypothesis (H):** Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(H) \): Given the prevalence of the field and high intelligence requirement, let's assume this field as fairly common among graduate students. We'll assign it a probability of about 0.2.
- \( P(E|H) \): Given that Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is good with abstract concepts, this field fits well. Let's set it around 0.5.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Considering again that Adam’s interests align more with fields like biology or environmental science rather than technical fields, similar to business administration, let's approximate it around 0.6.

### Calculation
We do not need precise values for \( P(E) \) for comparisons since we are typically interested in relative probabilities:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

For business administration:
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.1 = 0.02 \]

For computer science:
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) \propto 0.5 \cdot 0.2 = 0.1 \]

Given these proportional values, the likelihood that Adam was in computer science is relatively higher.

### Final Answer
{
  "business administration": "0.02",
  "computer science": "0.1"
}
