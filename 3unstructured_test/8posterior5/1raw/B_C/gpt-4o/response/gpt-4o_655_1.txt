To apply Bayes' Rule, we need to use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence given the hypothesis is true.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence given the hypothesis is false.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of observing the evidence, which can be computed as \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

To determine \( P(H|E) \) for both business administration and computer science, we need to make some reasonable assumptions about \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \):

1. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): Let's assume the prior probability of a graduate student being in business administration is relatively common, but not the majority. Let's say \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given the personality traits described, it seems less likely for someone with a strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, and solving puzzles to be in business administration. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.05 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Since we're considering all other fields, it's quite possible that such traits are represented elsewhere. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.15 \).

2. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Given the increasing popularity and demand for computer science, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.30 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): A graduate student in computer science could easily exhibit high intelligence and an aptitude for solving puzzles and abstract concepts. While nature and animals might not be typical, they are not exclusive. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.25 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Again, given the range of other fields, these traits might be common. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.15 \).

Now, let's compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

For Business Administration:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.05 \cdot 0.15 + 0.15 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.0075 + 0.1275 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.135 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.15}{0.135} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.0075}{0.135} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0556 \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.25 \cdot 0.30 + 0.15 \cdot 0.70 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.075 + 0.105 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.18 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.25 \cdot 0.30}{0.18} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.075}{0.18} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.4167 \]

So, based on these calculations:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0556,
  "computer science": 0.4167
}
```

These values indicate that it's more likely for Adam, based on his personality sketch, to have been enrolled in a computer science program over a business administration program, though other fields could also potentially match his profile.
