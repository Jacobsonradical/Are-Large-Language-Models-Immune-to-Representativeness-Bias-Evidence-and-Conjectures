Given the personality sketch of Adam, let's evaluate the probabilities for him being in the fields of business administration and computer science.

We'll start by assigning rough values based on the information provided:

1. **Business Administration (H = Business Administration)**
   - P(H): The base rate probability of a graduate student being in business administration. Let's assume this is 0.2 (20%).
   - P(E|H): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in business administration. Given Adam's traits, such as a love for nature, animals, and puzzles, this seems less likely. Let's estimate it as 0.1 (10%).
   - P(E|\neg H): The probability of his personality sketch given that he is not in business administration. Since Adamâ€™s traits align less with business-related profiles, this could be 0.4 (40%).

Using Bayes' Rule: 

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(Business|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.32} \]

\[ P(Business|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.34} \approx 0.06 \]

2. **Computer Science (H = Computer Science)**
   - P(H): The base rate probability of a graduate student being in computer science. Let's assume this is 0.3 (30%).
   - P(E|H): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in computer science. Given Adam's high intelligence and love for solving puzzles, this seems more likely. Let's estimate it as 0.4 (40%).
   - P(E|\neg H): The probability of his personality sketch given that he is not in computer science. Estimating this as 0.3 (30%).

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(CS|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{0.4 \cdot 0.3 + 0.3 \cdot 0.7} = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.21} \]

\[ P(CS|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.33} \approx 0.36 \]

So, the final probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.06,
  "computer science": 0.36
}
```
