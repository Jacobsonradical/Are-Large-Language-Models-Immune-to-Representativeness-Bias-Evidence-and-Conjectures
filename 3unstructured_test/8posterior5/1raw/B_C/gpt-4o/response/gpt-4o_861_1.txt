To solve this problem using Bayes' theorem, we need to assess the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the probability of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H) \). Then we apply these values to calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \).

We start by estimating these probabilities.

### Hypothesis: Business Administration
- **Prior probability \( P(H_\text{BA}) \)**: Let's assume a generic prior for reference. Business Administration is a common field, but less common for someone with Adam's described personality traits.
  - \( P(H_\text{BA}) = 0.1 \)

- **Likelihood \( P(E|H_\text{BA}) \)**: The likelihood of having Adam's personality traits if he is in Business Administration is probably low, given his interests and characteristics.
  - \( P(E|H_\text{BA}) = 0.1 \)

- **Probability of evidence given negation \( P(E|\neg H_\text{BA}) \)**: The probability of Adam having these characteristics if he is not in Business Administration is higher since other fields like biology or environmental science might suit him better.
  - \( P(E|\neg H_\text{BA}) = 0.9 \)

Now we apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H_\text{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_\text{BA}) \cdot P(H_\text{BA})}{P(E)} \]

Here \( P(E) \) can be expressed as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_\text{BA}) \cdot P(H_\text{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_\text{BA}) \cdot P(\neg H_\text{BA}) \]

Given the assumptions:
\[ P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.1 + 0.9 \cdot 0.9 = 0.01 + 0.81 = 0.82 \]

Now calculate \( P(H_\text{BA}|E) \):
\[ P(H_\text{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.82} = \frac{0.01}{0.82} \approx 0.012 \]

### Hypothesis: Computer Science
- **Prior probability \( P(H_\text{CS}) \)**: Let's assume another generic prior, recognizing that Computer Science is a common field.
  - \( P(H_\text{CS}) = 0.1 \)

- **Likelihood \( P(E|H_\text{CS}) \)**: The likelihood of having Adam's personality traits if he is in Computer Science seems higher considering his high intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles.
  - \( P(E|H_\text{CS}) = 0.5 \)

- **Probability of evidence given negation \( P(E|\neg H_\text{CS}) \)**: The probability of Adam having these characteristics if he is not in Computer Science is moderately high, as fields like biology might still be relevant.
  - \( P(E|\neg H_\text{CS}) = 0.7 \)

Now we apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H_\text{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_\text{CS}) \cdot P(H_\text{CS})}{P(E)} \]

Here \( P(E) \) can be expressed as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_\text{CS}) \cdot P(H_\text{CS}) + P(E|\neg H_\text{CS}) \cdot P(\neg H_\text{CS}) \]

Given the assumptions:
\[ P(E) = 0.5 \cdot 0.1 + 0.7 \cdot 0.9 = 0.05 + 0.63 = 0.68 \]

Now calculate \( P(H_\text{CS}|E) \):
\[ P(H_\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.1}{0.68} = \frac{0.05}{0.68} \approx 0.074 \]

### Summary of Probabilities
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.012,
  "computer science": 0.074
}
```

These probabilities suggest that Adam is more likely to be enrolled in Computer Science than in Business Administration based on the provided personality traits.
