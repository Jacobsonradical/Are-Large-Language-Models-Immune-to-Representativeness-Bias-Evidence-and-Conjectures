To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for all fields when comparing relative probabilities, we can simplify to:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

We need to estimate the following for each field:
1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in this field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in the field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in the field.

### Computer Science

- **P(H)**: The prior that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Suppose the probability is moderate because itâ€™s a common field of study among graduate students.
  \[ P(H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.25 \]
- **P(E|H)**: Given that Adam is in computer science, the likelihood of having these attributes. Adam has high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts, which fits well with computer science.
  \[ P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.7 \]
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Given that Adam is not in computer science, what is the likelihood of observing his personality sketch. Considering other graduate fields, this might still be somewhat likely but lower than if he were in CS.
  \[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.3 \]

### Business Administration

- **P(H)**: The prior that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Suppose the probability is slightly lower compared to computer science.
  \[ P(H_{\text{ba}}) = 0.20 \]
- **P(E|H)**: Given that Adam is in business administration, the likelihood of having these attributes. Business administration may not be as closely aligned with puzzle-solving or nature curiosity, but empathy and understanding dedication fit well.
  \[ P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) = 0.5 \]
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Given that Adam is not in business administration, what is the likelihood of observing his personality sketch. This likelihood might be higher here because empathy and dedication can fit into many other fields.
  \[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{ba}}) = 0.4 \]

Let's compute the relative probabilities using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.7 \cdot 0.25 = 0.175 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{ba}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ba}}) = 0.5 \cdot 0.20 = 0.1 \]

Finally, we normalize these values for simplicity (although the problem does not require it):

- For computer science: \( 0.175 / (0.175 + 0.1) \)
- For business administration: \( 0.1 / (0.175 + 0.1) \)

So updated values might look as follows for direct comparison (although normalizing isn't strictly needed per your request):

{
  "computer science": 0.175,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
