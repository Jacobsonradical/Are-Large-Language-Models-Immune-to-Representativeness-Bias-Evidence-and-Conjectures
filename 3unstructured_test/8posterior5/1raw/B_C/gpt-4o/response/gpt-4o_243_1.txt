Let's start by estimating the various probabilities needed for the computation using Bayes' theorem.

### Computer Science

1. **P(H_computer_science)**:
   - This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a computer science field. Without specific data, we'll assume a baseline. Let's assume P(H_computer_science) = 0.20.

2. **P(E|H_computer_science)**:
   - Adam's traits do suggest some alignment with a field like computer science (high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, enjoys solving puzzles). Let's assume P(E|H_computer_science) = 0.70.

3. **P(E|\neg H_computer_science)**:
   - The probability that Adam exhibits these traits given he is not in computer science. Given students in other fields may also exhibit some of these traits, let's say P(E|\neg H_computer_science) = 0.20.

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{0.70 \times 0.20}{(0.70 \times 0.20) + (0.20 \times 0.80)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.14}{0.14 + 0.16} \]
\[ = \frac{0.14}{0.30} \]
\[ = 0.47 \]

### Business Administration

1. **P(H_business_administration)**:
   - The prior probability for business administration, let's assume P(H_business_administration) = 0.15.

2. **P(E|H_business_administration)**:
   - Adam's traits have some mismatch with those typically associated with business administration (empathy and love for animals more than business skills). Let's say P(E|H_business_administration) = 0.40.

3. **P(E|\neg H_business_administration)**:
   - The probability that Adam exhibits these traits given he is not in business administration. Let's say P(E|\neg H_business_administration) = 0.25.

Using Bayes' Rule again for business administration:

\[ P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{0.40 \times 0.15}{(0.40 \times 0.15) + (0.25 \times 0.85)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.2125} \]
\[ = \frac{0.06}{0.2725} \]
\[ = 0.22 \]

Now, let's format these results:

{
  "computer science": 0.47,
  "business administration": 0.22
}
