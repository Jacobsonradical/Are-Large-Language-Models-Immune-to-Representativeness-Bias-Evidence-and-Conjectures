To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the hypotheses (H) that Adam was enrolled in business administration or computer science based on the personality sketch (E), we need to apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence.

Let's estimate these probabilities for both fields:

### Business Administration

- **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Let's assume a rough estimate based on the diversity of graduate fields, say \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

- **P(E|H):** The likelihood that a business administration student would match the personality sketch. Business administration students might have strong empathy and appreciation for hard work. However, the deep love for animals, high intelligence in understanding abstract concepts, and deep curiosity about nature might be less common. Estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).

- **P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood that a student not in business administration would match the personality sketch. Considering Adam's interests, it might be medium-high, as these traits could match with many fields in science and humanities. Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

### Computer Science

- **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Again, let's assume a rough estimate based on the diversity of graduate fields, say \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

- **P(E|H):** The likelihood that a computer science student would match the personality sketch. High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts fit well with computer science. Solving puzzles is also a good fit, but the strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature might be slightly less common. Estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \).

- **P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood that a student not in computer science would match the personality sketch. Considering Adam's interests, it might be medium-high, as these traits could match with many fields in science and humanities. Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

### Compute P(H|E)

#### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assume \( P(E) \) can be approximated using the Law of Total Probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \times 0.2) + (0.5 \times 0.8) = 0.04 + 0.4 = 0.44 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.2}{0.44} = \frac{0.04}{0.44} ≈ 0.0909 \]

#### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(E) = (0.4 \times 0.2) + (0.5 \times 0.8) = 0.08 + 0.4 = 0.48 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.2}{0.48} = \frac{0.08}{0.48} ≈ 0.1667 \]
