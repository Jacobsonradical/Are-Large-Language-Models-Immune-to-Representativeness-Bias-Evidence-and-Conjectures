To compute \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' Rule, we need the following probabilities:
- \(P(H)\): Prior probability of hypothesis \(H\) (i.e., the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field before knowing the personality sketch).
- \(P(E|H)\): Likelihood of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given that hypothesis \(H\) is true.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): Likelihood of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given that hypothesis \(H\) is false.
- \(P(E)\): Overall probability of observing the personality sketch \(E\).

Bayes' Rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since the denominator \(P(E)\) is common for both hypotheses, it can be simplified by comparing the numerators directly for relative probabilities. Therefore, for relative comparison, we use:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Let's address each field step-by-step.

### Computer Science
#### Prior Probability (\(P(H)\)):
Given no specific information about Adam's likelihood of being in any field, we can assume the prior probability is equally probable among graduate fields. But computer science is a popular field, so we might give it a slightly higher prior.
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.2 \]

#### Likelihood (\(P(E|H_{\text{CS}}\))):
Given the personality sketch, Adam has high intelligence and enjoys solving puzzles. These traits align well with computer science.
\[ P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.7 \]

#### Complement Likelihood (\(P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}\))):
The likelihood of such a personality sketch in other fields might not be as high but still possible, especially in technical or analytical fields.
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.3 \]

### Business Administration
#### Prior Probability (\(P(H)\)):
Business administration is also a common field, but given Adam's personality traits, it might not be the most aligned.
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1 \]

#### Likelihood (\(P(E|H_{\text{BA}}\))):
Adam's traits like empathy and understanding hard work could be a fit, but elements like a deep love for animals and interest in nature are less aligned.
\[ P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.4 \]

#### Complement Likelihood (\(P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}\))):
Considering that business personalities might vary widely, the likelihood of observing the personality sketch in non-business fields is relatively higher.
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.6 \]

### Calculation of \(P(H|E)\)
Using the simplified form of Bayes' Rule:

#### For Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.7 \cdot 0.2 = 0.14 \]

#### For Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.4 \cdot 0.1 = 0.04 \]

Since we now have relative probabilities, we normalize these to obtain probabilities between 0 and 1:

#### Normalization:
\[ P(H_{\text{total}}) = 0.14 + 0.04 = 0.18 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.14}{0.18} \approx 0.78 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.18} \approx 0.22 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.78,
  "business administration": 0.22
}
```

Note: These values are calculated based on assumed priors and likelihoods and could vary with different assumptions.
