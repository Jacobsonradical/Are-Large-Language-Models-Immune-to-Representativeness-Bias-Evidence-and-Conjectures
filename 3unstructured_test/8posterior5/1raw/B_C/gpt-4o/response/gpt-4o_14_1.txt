To solve this problem using Bayes' rule, we need to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis \( H \) (the field of study) given the evidence \( E \) (the personality sketch of Adam). Bayes’ theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant and will be the same for all hypotheses, we can simplify the comparison by calculating the proportional relation:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given there are other fields of specialization, let's not normalize the values. We'll estimate:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the evidence given not being in the hypothesis field.

Let's assume that in a typical U.S. graduate school, the priors for each field are equal, so:

\[ P(\text{computer science}) = P(\text{business administration}) = 0.5 \]

### Computer Science
**P(H): Prior probability**
- Given our assumption: \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.5 \)

**P(E|H): Likelihood**
- Adam has high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts, which are relevant to computer science. His puzzle-solving interest aligns well with problem-solving in computer science.
- Estimate \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \approx 0.7 \)

**P(E|\neg H): Likelihood given not being in this field**
- Since not all students in other fields necessarily have Adam's profile, this value would be moderately lower.
- Estimate \( P(E|\neg \text{computer science}) \approx 0.3 \)

### Business Administration
**P(H): Prior probability**
- Given our assumption: \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.5 \)

**P(E|H): Likelihood**
- Adam’s empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work might suggest some fit in business administration, but abstract problem-solving and strong curiosity in nature/plants are less relevant.
- Estimate \( P(E|\text{business administration}) \approx 0.3 \)

**P(E|\neg H): Likelihood given not being in this field**
- Likelihood in other fields might be similar or slightly higher.
- Estimate \( P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) \approx 0.4 \)

We will now calculate and compare \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

### Computer Science

\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) \propto P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) \propto 0.7 \cdot 0.5 = 0.35 \]

### Business Administration

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) \propto P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) \propto 0.3 \cdot 0.5 = 0.15 \]

So in proportional terms, we get:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.35,
  "business administration": 0.15
}
