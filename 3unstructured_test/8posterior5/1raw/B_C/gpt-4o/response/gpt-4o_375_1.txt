To assess the probabilities for Adam's graduate field, we'll need to evaluate the prior probability \(P(H)\), the likelihood \(P(E|H)\), and the likelihood of the evidence given the negation of that field \(P(E|\neg H)\). Using Bayes' rule, we'll then calculate the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\).

1. **Computer Science (CS)**:
   - **Prior Probability (P(H))**: Let's assume a prior probability for simplicity. Typically, computer science is a common graduate field. So, let’s use \(P(\text{CS}) = 0.2\).
   
   - **Likelihood (P(E|H))**: We are given that Adam has a strong understanding of abstract concepts, enjoys solving puzzles, and is of high intelligence. These qualities are often associated with computer science students. So, we'll give this a high likelihood, say \(P(E|\text{CS}) = 0.8\).

   - **Likelihood of Evidence Given Negation (P(E|\neg H))**: We need to consider how likely the personality traits would be in graduate fields other than computer science. These traits can be found in several other fields (e.g., mathematics, physics, cognitive sciences). Let’s use a moderate value \(P(E|\neg \text{CS}) = 0.5\).
   
   Using Bayes' Rule:
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(E|\neg \text{CS}) \cdot P(\neg \text{CS})}
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{0.8 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.16}{0.16 + 0.4} = \frac{0.16}{0.56} \approx 0.286
   \]

2. **Business Administration (BA)**:
   - **Prior Probability (P(H))**: Business Administration is another common graduate field. For simplicity, let’s use \(P(\text{BA}) = 0.2\) as well.
   
   - **Likelihood (P(E|H))**: Adam’s traits of warmth, empathy, and appreciation for hard work could be found in business administration students, especially in areas like organizational behavior or human resources but are not typically dominant traits for the field. So, we'll give it a moderate value, say \(P(E|\text{BA}) = 0.3\).
   
   - **Likelihood of Evidence Given Negation (P(E|\neg H))**: Similarly, these traits could be more common in other fields than in business administration. Let’s use a moderate value again, \(P(E|\neg \text{BA}) = 0.5\).

   Using Bayes' Rule:
   \[
   P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{BA}) \cdot P(\text{BA})}{P(E|\text{BA}) \cdot P(\text{BA}) + P(E|\neg \text{BA}) \cdot P(\neg \text{BA})}
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.4} = \frac{0.06}{0.46} \approx 0.130
   \]

To summarize:
{
  "computer science": 0.286,
  "business administration": 0.130
}
These values provide a rough estimate of the likelihood that Adam is enrolled in either of these fields based on his personality sketch.
