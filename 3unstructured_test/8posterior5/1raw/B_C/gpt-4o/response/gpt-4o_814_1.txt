To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( P(H) \) represents the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field, \( P(E|H) \) is the probability that Adam's personality sketch \( E \) is observed given that he is in a specific field, and \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability that Adam's personality sketch \( E \) is observed given that he is not in that specific field. Since \( P(E) \) is the same for all fields and cancels out in the final comparison, we can focus on the relative values.

Let's evaluate the probabilities for the given fields:

### Computer Science
1. \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): Prior probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in computer science.
2. \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): Likelihood of observing Adam’s personality sketch if he is a computer science student.

Given that Adam has a high intelligence, enjoys solving puzzles, and understands abstract concepts, these traits are fairly common among computer science students:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): High, let's estimate around 0.8.
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): Assume a decent proportion of graduate students are in computer science, say 0.15.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \): Moderate to low likelihood compared to computer science, let's say 0.5.

### Business Administration
1. \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): Prior probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in business administration.
2. \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): Likelihood of observing Adam’s personality sketch if he is a business administration student.

Adam’s traits such as a strong understanding of hard work and dedication, empathy, and a warm heart can relate to business administration, but other traits like love for animals and curiosity about nature might not be as relevant:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): Let's estimate around 0.4.
- \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): Assume a reasonable proportion of graduate students are in business administration, say 0.1.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \): Higher likelihood compared to business administration, say 0.6.

Using these estimates, we can compute the relative probabilities:

\[
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{CS}})}
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{BA}})}
\]

For simplification:

\[
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.5 \cdot 0.85} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.425} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.545} \approx 0.22
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \approx \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.1}{0.4 \cdot 0.1 + 0.6 \cdot 0.9} \approx \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.54} \approx \frac{0.04}{0.58} \approx 0.07
\]

So the relative probabilities would be:

{
  "computer science": 0.22,
  "business administration": 0.07
}

Note that these values are approximate and depend on the assumed priors and likelihoods which can vary.
