Sure, let's use Bayes' Theorem to determine the probabilities. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since the total probability of all hypotheses (fields) doesn't need to sum to 1, we'll compute the unnormalized posterior probability:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

We'll need to estimate:
1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given the enrollment in each field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given not enrolled in each field (we won't directly use this, but it informs our intuition).

These probabilities are subjective, educated estimates based on the sketch provided.

### Business Administration

- **P(H)**: Business Administration is a common field, but Adam's deep love for nature, animals, and abstract concepts might make it less likely. Let’s give it a modest prior of 0.2.
- **P(E|H)**: Business Administration students might not typically have a strong interest in nature and empathy towards animals. Let's estimate this as 0.1.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: This is just to understand the contrast. People not in business could have all sorts of interests including those Adam has. Let's estimate it as 0.5.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

### Computer Science

- **P(H)**: Computer Science is another common field and aligns better with his interest in puzzles and abstract concepts. Let's give it a higher prior, say 0.3.
- **P(E|H)**: Computer Science students might well have the traits listed (puzzle solving, abstract thinking). Let’s estimate this as 0.4.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: This is just to understand the contrast. People not in computer science might or might not have these traits. Let's estimate it as 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.4 \cdot 0.3 = 0.12 \]

After calculating the unnormalized probabilities, to make them relative to each other, we would compare the values directly.

### Results
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.12
}
```

These values indicate that, based on the personality sketch, Adam is more likely to be enrolled in Computer Science than Business Administration.
