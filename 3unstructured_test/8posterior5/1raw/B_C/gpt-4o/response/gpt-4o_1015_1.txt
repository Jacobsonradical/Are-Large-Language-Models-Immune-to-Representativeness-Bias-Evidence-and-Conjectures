Sure, I'll walk through this step by step for each field. Bayes' Rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we have no specific prior probabilities for each hypothesis field (computer science and business administration), we'll make educated estimates based on typical factors. For simplicity, we'll assume \( P(H) \) is the same for each field, but we should note that this is a simplification; in reality, different fields have different enrollment probabilities.

Let's evaluate the values one by one for each field.

### Computer Science

#### P(H) - Initial Probability
Without detailed data, let's assume \( P(H) = \frac{1}{10} \) since many different graduate fields exist and this is a simplification.

#### P(E|H) - Probability of E given H
Adam has high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts, both of which are highly relevant to computer science. However, his strong empathy and love for animals seem less relevant. We'll estimate \( P(E|H) \) as 0.6 based on significant alignment but not a perfect fit.

#### P(E|\neg H) - Probability of E given not H
This would be the probability of his traits fitting the general population of non-computer science majors. Given his empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for nature, these might be more common in non-CS fields. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.7 \).

### Business Administration

#### P(H) - Initial Probability
We'll stick to \( P(H) = \frac{1}{10} \) for consistency.

#### P(E|H) - Probability of E given H
Except for his intelligence and understanding of hard work, very few of his other traits align with typical business administration characteristics. It's less likely he fits this field well, so \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).

#### P(E|\neg H) - Probability of E given not H
Given the broader realm of non-business fields, we'd assume a higher probability for his characteristics fitting elsewhere. \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.75 \).

### Calculations

Now let's plug these into Bayes' Rule for each:

For **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) \approx P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \)
\[ P(\neg H) = 0.9 \]

\[ P(E) \approx 0.6 \cdot 0.1 + 0.7 \cdot 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.06 + 0.63 = 0.69 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.1}{0.69} \approx \frac{0.06}{0.69} \approx 0.087 \]

For **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Similarly, \( P(E) \approx 0.3 \cdot 0.1 + 0.75 \cdot 0.9 \)
\[ P(E) = 0.03 + 0.675 = 0.705 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.705} \approx \frac{0.03}{0.705} \approx 0.043 \]
