To use Bayes' rule, we need to determine the probabilities of P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|\neg H) for each field of specialization, and then use these values to compute P(H|E). Let's break this down:

### Assumptions:

1. **P(H)**: The probability that Adam was enrolled in each field, without any additional information.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he was enrolled in that field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he was not enrolled in that field.

### Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E|H) P(H) + P(E|\neg H) P(\neg H)} \]

### Field 1: Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Let's assume it to be fairly low because the personality sketch aligns more closely with fields that involve natural curiosity and understanding of abstract concepts.
   - Estimate: 0.10

2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he was studying business administration. Less likely because business administration might not attract individuals with strong empathy for nature and love for animals as a primary motive.
   - Estimate: 0.05

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he was not studying business administration. Higher because Adam's characteristics fit better into other fields.
   - Estimate: 0.30

### Calculation for Business Administration:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.10}{0.05 \cdot 0.10 + 0.30 \cdot 0.90} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.27} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.275} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.018 \]

### Field 2: Computer Science

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Fairly high, given his high intelligence, abstract thinking skills, and proficiency in solving puzzles.
   - Estimate: 0.30

2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he was studying computer science. High because the field often appeals to individuals with problem-solving skills and abstract thinking.
   - Estimate: 0.70

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he was not studying computer science.
   - Estimate: 0.20

### Calculation for Computer Science:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.70 \cdot 0.30}{0.70 \cdot 0.30 + 0.20 \cdot 0.70} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.21}{0.21 + 0.14} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.21}{0.35} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.60 \]

### Summary
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.018,
  "computer science": 0.60
}
```

These results suggest that based on Adam's personality sketch, he is significantly more likely to have been enrolled in computer science than in business administration.
