Let's first analyze Adam's personality sketch and see how it aligns with the stereotypical traits of students in each field:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - P(H): The probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration among all graduate students. Business administration is a common field, but let's assume the prior probability is moderate, say around 0.2.
   - P(E|H): The probability of observing Adam's traits if he were enrolled in business administration. Business administration students might possess some empathy and appreciation for hard work, but a genuine curiosity about nature and love for animals isn't typically associated with this field. Let's assume a lower value, say around 0.1.
   - P(E|¬H): The probability of observing Adam's traits if he were not a business administration student. Given that there are many other fields that align more closely with his interests, P(E|¬H) might be relatively higher, say around 0.5.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Computer science is another common and broad field; let's assume a prior probability similar to business administration, around 0.2.
   - P(E|H): The probability of observing Adam's traits if he were enrolled in computer science. Computer science students often have high intelligence and an interest in solving puzzles, aligning well with some of Adam's traits. However, the deep love for nature and animals is not a typical trait. Let's assign it a moderate value, say around 0.3.
   - P(E|¬H): The probability of observing Adam's traits if he were not a computer science student. Given the same logic as above, P(E|¬H) might be higher, around 0.5.

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We can estimate \(P(E)\) as a normalization factor. For the sake of simplicity, we assume \(P(E) \approx 0.4\) as an average based on our earlier probabilities.

Let's calculate:

1. **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.4} = 0.05 \]

2. **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.4} = 0.15 \]

So, our results are:

{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.15
}
