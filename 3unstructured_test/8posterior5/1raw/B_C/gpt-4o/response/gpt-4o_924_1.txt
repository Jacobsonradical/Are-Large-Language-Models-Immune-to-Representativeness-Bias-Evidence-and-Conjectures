To solve this using Bayes' rule, we need to reason about the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \), and use them to determine the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \). 

For each field, let's set some reasonable values based on the provided personality sketch.

### Business Administration

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Let's assume that the likelihood of being in any graduate field is approximately equal, but business administration might be a bit less common. Suppose this is 0.10.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was in business administration. Business programs may value different traits (e.g., leadership, persuasive skills) rather than a focus on nature, animals, and puzzles. Let's say this is relatively low, around 0.02.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was not in business administration. Since there are many fields outside business administration that might suit his personality (e.g., biology, environmental science), let's say this is relatively higher, at 0.20.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.02 \cdot 0.10}{0.02 \cdot 0.10 + 0.20 \cdot 0.90} \\ \]
\[ = \frac{0.002}{0.002 + 0.18} \\ \]
\[ = \frac{0.002}{0.182} \\ \approx 0.011 \]

### Computer Science

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Suppose this is more common, so we estimate it at 0.15.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was in computer science. Computer science students often enjoy solving puzzles and have high intelligence. Let’s assume this is higher, around 0.25.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was not in computer science. This includes all other fields, so let’s estimate it at 0.10.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.25 \cdot 0.15}{0.25 \cdot 0.15 + 0.10 \cdot 0.85} \\ \]
\[ = \frac{0.0375}{0.0375 + 0.085} \\ \]
\[ = \frac{0.0375}{0.1225} \\ \approx 0.306 \]

Therefore, the probabilities using the provided personality sketch are approximately:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.011,
  "computer science": 0.306
}
```

These probabilities are indicative and depend heavily on the assumed prior probabilities and likelihoods. In a real scenario, accurate values derived from data would be preferred.
