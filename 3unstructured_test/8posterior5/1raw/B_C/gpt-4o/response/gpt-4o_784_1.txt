In order to compute P(H|E) (the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch), we follow Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the initial probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field (prior probability).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability that Adam's personality type would be observed if he were in the given field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability that Adam's personality type would be observed if he were not in the given field.

We do not have exact values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), or \( P(E|\neg H) \), so we will have to estimate them based on the information provided. 

### Estimations:

1. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H) \) (A commonly estimated prior for any graduate program could be around 0.1, but let's consider business administration might attract 0.1 of graduate students).
   - \( P(E|H) \) (Given business administration, a curiosity for nature, empathy, and love of animals might be less common, so let's estimate it as 0.2).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \) (For non-business students, the traits described seem more common, so let's estimate it as 0.7).

   Using these estimations:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.7 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.63} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.65} \approx 0.031
   \]

2. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(H) \) (Similarly, we consider the prior to be around 0.1).
   - \( P(E|H) \) (Given computer science, Adam's traits such as high intelligence, puzzle-solving, and understanding abstract concepts are more common, so let's estimate it as 0.5).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \) (For non-computer science students, traits could be less represented in other fields, let's estimate it as 0.6).

   Using these estimations:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.1}{0.5 \cdot 0.1 + 0.6 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.05}{0.05 + 0.54} \approx \frac{0.05}{0.59} \approx 0.085
   \]

Final results:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.031,
  "computer science": 0.085
}
```
These estimated probabilities suggest that Adam would be more likely enrolled in a graduate program in computer science compared to business administration based on his personality sketch.
