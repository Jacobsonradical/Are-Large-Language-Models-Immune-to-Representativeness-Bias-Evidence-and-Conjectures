To solve this problem using Bayes' Rule, let's denote the following terms:

- \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field.
- \(P(E|H)\): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch \(E\) given that he is enrolled in the field \(H\).
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch \(E\) given that he is not enrolled in the field \(H\).
- \(P(H|E)\): The posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in the given field given his personality sketch \(E\).

Bayes' Rule states:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where \(P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)\).

For simplicity, letâ€™s assume:

1. \(P(H)\) for each field will be approximated based on the general distribution of students between various fields.
2. \(P(E|H)\) and \(P(E|\neg H)\) will be approximated based on how aligned Adam's personality sketch is with the typical characteristics of students in the specified field.

### Business Administration

1. \(P(H)\):
   Business administration is a relatively common graduate field. Let's assign a prior probability:
   \[
   P(\text{business administration}) = 0.15
   \]

2. \(P(E|H)\):
   Adam's interests in nature, animals, and puzzles don't strongly align with typical business administration characteristics, but might still be present. Let's assume:
   \[
   P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.10
   \]

3. \(P(E|\neg H)\):
   The probability of Adam having personality traits \(E\) given that he is not in business administration:
   \[
   P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) = 0.05
   \]

### Computer Science

1. \(P(H)\):
   Computer science is another common graduate field. Let's assign a prior probability:
   \[
   P(\text{computer science}) = 0.20
   \]

2. \(P(E|H)\):
   Adam's interest in puzzles and abstract concepts is strongly aligned with the field of computer science, but his other interests somewhat less so. Let's assume:
   \[
   P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.30
   \]

3. \(P(E|\neg H)\):
   The probability of Adam having personality traits \(E\) given that he is not in computer science:
   \[
   P(E|\neg \text{computer science}) = 0.10
   \]

Now, calculate the posterior probabilities:

### Business Administration

\[
P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \times P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)}
\]

Where \(P(E)\) can be simplified as:

\[
P(E) = P(E|\text{business administration})P(\text{business administration}) + P(E|\neg \text{business administration})P(\neg \text{business administration})
\]

\[
P(E) = (0.10 \times 0.15) + (0.05 \times 0.85) = 0.015 + 0.0425 = 0.0575
\]

\[
P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.10 \times 0.15}{0.0575} \approx 0.2609
\]

### Computer Science

\[
P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \times P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)}
\]

Where \(P(E)\) can be simplified as:

\[
P(E) = P(E|\text{computer science})P(\text{computer science}) + P(E|\neg \text{computer science})P(\neg \text{computer science})
\]

\[
P(E) = (0.30 \times 0.20) + (0.10 \times 0.80) = 0.06 + 0.08 = 0.14
\]

\[
P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.30 \times 0.20}{0.14} \approx 0.4286
\]

Thus, we have:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2609,
  "computer science": 0.4286
}
```
