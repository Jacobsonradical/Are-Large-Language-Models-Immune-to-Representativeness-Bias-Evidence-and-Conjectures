Let's evaluate each hypothesis using the information available.

### For Business Administration

1. **P(H):** The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in Business Administration. Let's assume it's a fairly popular field, but not as common as some others. We might estimate this as 0.25.

2. **P(E|H):** The probability of Adam's personality traits given that he is in Business Administration. His traits—curiosity about nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, empathy, love for animals, appreciation for hard work—don't strongly align with typical business administration traits, but it’s not completely inconsistent. We'll estimate this as moderately low, say 0.2.

3. **P(E|¬H):** The probability of Adam's personality traits given that he is not in Business Administration. Considering the wide variety of other fields that could match his traits better (like environmental science, biology, etc.), we might estimate this as higher than P(E|H), say 0.5.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Noting \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|¬H)P(¬H) \):

\[ P(E) = 0.2 \times 0.25 + 0.5 \times 0.75 = 0.05 + 0.375 = 0.425 \]

Thus,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.25}{0.425} \approx 0.1176 \]

### For Computer Science

1. **P(H):** The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in Computer Science. This is a highly popular field. We might estimate this as 0.3.

2. **P(E|H):** The probability of Adam's personality traits given that he is in Computer Science. His traits—solving puzzles and high intelligence—strongly align with typical computer science traits, though others (like the love for nature) might slightly reduce this. We'll estimate it as fairly high, say 0.6.

3. **P(E|¬H):** The probability of Adam's personality traits given that he is not in Computer Science. Again, considering there's a wide variety of fields out there, we might estimate this as moderate, say 0.4.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Noting \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|¬H)P(¬H) \):

\[ P(E) = 0.6 \times 0.3 + 0.4 \times 0.7 = 0.18 + 0.28 = 0.46 \]

Thus,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.3}{0.46} \approx 0.3913 \]

So, in summary:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1176,
  "computer science": 0.3913
}
