To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration or computer science given his personality sketch, we need to evaluate the prior probability \(P(H)\), the likelihood \(P(E|H)\), and the marginal likelihood \(P(E | \neg H)\) for each field. 

Let's start with business administration.

**Business Administration:**

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\):**
   Graduate students often enroll in a variety of fields, but let's assume that at a typical U.S. university, about 10% of graduate students might be in business administration.
   
   \(P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.10\)

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\):**
   The personality sketch describes a person with strong empathy, intelligence, and problem-solving skills, which are valuable in business administration. However, his strong curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals do not strongly align with business administration.
   
   To estimate, we might give this a moderate value:
   
   \(P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.2\)

3. **Marginal Likelihood \(P(E | \neg H)\):**
   Considering all other fields (like natural sciences, engineering, and humanities), we assume there is a higher probability for these traits:
   
   \(P(E | \neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.5\)

**Computer Science:**

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\):**
   Assuming popularity, let's say about 15% of graduate students are in computer science.
   
   \(P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.15\)

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\):**
   The traits described are consistent with skills valued in computer science like puzzle solving, high intelligence, and abstract thinking. However, certain traits like a deep love for animals are not strongly aligned.
   
   This could be estimated with a higher value due to alignment with key skills:
   
   \(P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.4\)

3. **Marginal Likelihood \(P(E | \neg H)\):**
   This is similar to the previous calculation for business administration, with a general high probability for traits described across academic fields:
   
   \(P(E | \neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.5\)

**Applying Bayes Rule:**

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where \(P(E)\) = \(P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)\)

For Business Administration:

\[ 
P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{BA}})P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E |\neg H_{\text{BA}})P(\neg H_{\text{BA}})
\]
\[ 
= (0.2 \times 0.1) + (0.5 \times 0.9) 
\]
\[ 
= 0.02 + 0.45 
\]
\[ 
= 0.47 
\]

\[ 
P(H_{\text{BA}} | E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{0.47} 
\]
\[ 
= \frac{0.02}{0.47} 
\]
\[ 
= 0.0426 \approx 0.043 
\]

For Computer Science:

\[ 
P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{CS}})P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E |\neg H_{\text{CS}})P(\neg H_{\text{CS}})
\]
\[ 
= (0.4 \times 0.15) + (0.5 \times 0.85) 
\]
\[ 
= 0.06 + 0.425 
\]
\[ 
= 0.485 
\]

\[ 
P(H_{\text{CS}} | E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.15}{0.485} 
\]
\[ 
= \frac{0.06}{0.485} 
\]
\[ 
= 0.1237 \approx 0.124 
\]

Thus, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.043",
  "computer science": "0.124"
}
```
