To calculate the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' Rule, we'll use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \(H\).
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of the evidence \(E\) given hypothesis \(H\).
- \(P(E|\neg H)\) is the likelihood of the evidence \(E\) given the negation of hypothesis \(H\).
- \(P(E)\) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence \(E\).

We need to judge these probabilities for each field: business administration and computer science.

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**
   - Assuming an average distribution among fields, let's assign \(P(H) = 0.1\).

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**
   - The traits described in \(E\) (curiosity about nature, love for animals) are not strongly associated with business administration. Thus, \(P(E|H)\) might be low; let's set it at 0.1.

3. **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)**
   - If Adam wasn’t in business administration, he could still have these traits. Thus, \(P(E|\neg H)\) can be relatively high, say 0.5.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \times 0.1}{P(E)}  \]

Since \(P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)\):

\[ P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.1) + (0.5 \times 0.9) = 0.01 + 0.45 = 0.46 \]

So:

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.01}{0.46} \approx 0.0217 \]

### Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**
   - Assuming an average distribution among fields, let's assign \(P(H) = 0.1\).

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**
   - The intelligence, love for puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts align well with computer science. Thus, \(P(E|H)\) might be higher; let's set it at 0.4.

3. **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)**
   - If Adam wasn’t in computer science, he could still have these traits, but they might be less common outside this field. Thus, \(P(E|\neg H)\) could be lower, say 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.4 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \]

Where \(P(E)\):

\[ P(E) = (0.4 \times 0.1) + (0.3 \times 0.9) = 0.04 + 0.27 = 0.31 \]

So:

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.04}{0.31} \approx 0.129 \]

Based on the calculations, the results are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0217,
  "computer science": 0.129
}
