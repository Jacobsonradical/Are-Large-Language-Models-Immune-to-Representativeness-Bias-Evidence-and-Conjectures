Sure, let's use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in either business administration or computer science based on his personality sketch.

**Given:**
- \( E \): Personality sketch of Adam.
- \( H \): Hypothesis that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.
- \( \neg H \): Hypothesis that Adam is not enrolled in that particular field.

**Bayes' Rule:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality given he is in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality given he is not in that field.

We assume:
- \( P(H) \) is the same for any specific field of study (e.g., business administration or computer science).
- \( P(E) \) is constant across all fields since it’s the same personality sketch for any hypothesis (though it can affect proportional scaling).

Let's assign some reasonable probabilities based on Adam's characteristics.


### For Business Administration:

- **\( P(H) \)**: Assume this is 0.2 (assuming he is equally likely to be enrolled in one of five main fields, though this is a simplification).
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: How likely is his personality given he's in business administration? Given his love for nature and strong empathy, he might be less likely - let's say 0.1.
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Assuming all other fields equally, we might say 0.2 (since he has interests that don't align strongly with a business administration personality).

### For Computer Science:

- **\( P(H) \)**: Again, assume this is 0.2.
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: His traits of enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts are a strong match for computer science - let's say 0.4.
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Given his specific traits, we might say the average likelihood for other fields is 0.15.

Now, applying Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

We don’t need to calculate \( P(E) \) because we are only comparing the posterior values relative to each other.

### Business Administration:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \times P(H) \]
\[ \propto 0.1 \times 0.2 \]
\[ = 0.02 \]

### Computer Science:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \times P(H) \]
\[ \propto 0.4 \times 0.2 \]
\[ = 0.08 \]

After normalizing:

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.08} = 0.2 \]

\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.02 + 0.08} = 0.8 \]

Therefore, the results would be:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}
