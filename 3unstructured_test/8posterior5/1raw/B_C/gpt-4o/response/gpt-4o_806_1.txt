To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for business administration and computer science, we first need to evaluate the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood for the negation \( P(E|\neg H) \). Then we will apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's define our field hypotheses:
- \( H_{BA} \): Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( H_{CS} \): Adam was enrolled in computer science.

We need the following probabilities for each field:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - \( P(H_{BA}) \): Prior probability that Adam was in business administration.
   - \( P(H_{CS}) \): Prior probability that Adam was in computer science.

These will depend on the overall distribution of graduate students in these fields. For simplicity, let’s assume:
\[ P(H_{BA}) = 0.15 \]
\[ P(H_{CS}) = 0.20 \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): Probability of Adam's personality sketch being this detailed given he was in business administration.
   - \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Probability of Adam's personality sketch being this detailed given he was in computer science.

Given Adam’s high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, curiosity, and love for animals, it seems more likely he would fit into a science-related field like computer science than business administration, which may not typically emphasize such qualities.

\[ P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.05 \]
\[ P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.25 \]

3. **Likelihood for the negation \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   This will be the probability of Adam’s personality sketch conditioned on him being enrolled in any other graduate field other than the specified ones.

Given that we do not know other fields explicitly, let's assume a value based on general fit:

\[ P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.20 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.10 \]

Now, let's compute \( P(H|E) \) for both fields using Bayes' rule:

### Business Administration
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]

We need \( P(E) \) which is the total probability of E across all possible fields:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \cdot P(\neg H_{BA}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.05 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]

\[ P(E) = 0.0075 + 0.17 = 0.1775 \]

So:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.15}{0.1775} \approx 0.042 \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]

We use the same \( P(E) \) value:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \cdot P(\neg H_{CS}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.25 \cdot 0.20 + 0.10 \cdot 0.80 \]

\[ P(E) = 0.05 + 0.08 = 0.13 \]

So:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.25 \cdot 0.20}{0.13} \approx 0.385 \]

Thus, the values for \( P(H|E) \) are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.042,
  "computer science": 0.385
}
```
