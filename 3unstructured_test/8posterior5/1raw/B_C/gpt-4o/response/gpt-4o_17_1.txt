To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Rule, we need to estimate the following probabilities:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in each field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in each field.

Bayes' Rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

To simplify our computations, we can assume certain values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) based on the provided description and our general knowledge about the fields.

### Business Administration

#### Estimates
- \( P(H) \): Let's assume a prior probability of 0.15 (15%) for business administration, considering the wide variety of graduate programs.
- \( P(E|H) \): Given that Adam's interests and personality traits (curiosity about nature, empathy, abstract thinking) are not strongly aligned with the typical business administration profile, we could assign a lower probability, say 0.1 (10%).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Let's assume the probability of the personality traits \( E \) for students not in business administration is higher, perhaps 0.3 (30%).

### Computer Science

#### Estimates
- \( P(H) \): Let's assume a prior probability of 0.2 (20%) for computer science, given its popularity among graduate programs.
- \( P(E|H) \): Adam's high intelligence, appreciation for solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts align well with computer science, so let's assign a higher probability, say 0.6 (60%).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): For students not in computer science, the probability of observing these traits might be lower, say 0.2 (20%).

### Calculations

1. **Business Administration:**
   \[
   P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.15) + (0.3 \cdot 0.85) = 0.015 + 0.255 = 0.27
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{0.27} = \frac{0.015}{0.27} \approx 0.0556
   \]

2. **Computer Science:**
   \[
   P(E) = (0.6 \cdot 0.2) + (0.2 \cdot 0.8) = 0.12 + 0.16 = 0.28
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{0.28} = \frac{0.12}{0.28} \approx 0.4286
   \]

Thus, the approximate probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0556,
  "computer science": 0.4286
}
```
