To calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the prior probability \( P(H) \), which is the initial probability that Adam was enrolled in each field without considering the personality sketch \( E \).

2. Calculate \( P(E|H) \), the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in that field.

3. Assess \( P(E|\neg H) \), the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in that field.

4. Apply Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For simplicity, we can assume that \( P(H) \) for both computer science and business administration fields is 0.25, assuming there are four main fields he could be enrolled in equally likely.

Based on the personality sketch provided:
- Adam has strong empathy, a deep love for animals, and enjoys solving puzzles.
- He has a high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts.

Let's assign some probability values based on these observations:

### For Computer Science:
- \( P(H) = 0.25 \)
- \( P(E|H) \): Computer science often attracts people who like solving puzzles and have high intelligence and an understanding of abstract concepts. However, the deep love for animals and strong empathy are less specific to this field. So let's assign a value of 0.6.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Since the traits can be found across many fields but are less likely to be perfectly matched outside computer science, let's assume this value is 0.2.

### For Business Administration:
- \( P(H) = 0.25 \)
- \( P(E|H) \): Business administration may attract people with high intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication. Empathy can be a valuable trait in business. However, the strong curiosity about nature and love for animals are less relevant. So, let's assign a value of 0.3.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Similar to above, but since these traits are generally not a perfect match with this field, letâ€™s assume this value is 0.2.

### Calculating \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}}) + P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ba}}) +  \dots \]
\[ P(E) = 0.6 \cdot 0.25 + 0.3 \cdot 0.25 + \dots \]

We'll simplify this by focusing only on the two fields in question, recognizing this will not give the complete probability but will allow for comparison.

### For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{cs}} = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.6 \cdot 0.25 + 0.3 \cdot 0.25 (considering only these two fields) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.15 + 0.075 = 0.225 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{cs}} = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.25}{0.225} = \frac{0.15}{0.225} \approx 0.67 \]

### For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{ba}} = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ba}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{ba}} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.25}{0.225} = \frac{0.075}{0.225} \approx 0.33 \]

Thus, the results of the calculations based on the assumptions and approximations are:

{
  "computer science": 0.67,
  "business administration": 0.33
}
