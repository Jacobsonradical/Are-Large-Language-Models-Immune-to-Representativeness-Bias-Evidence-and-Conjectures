In order to apply Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probability \( P(H) \), which is the initial probability of Adam being enrolled in either business administration or computer science. We also need \( P(E|H) \), the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in a particular field, and \( P(E|\neg H) \), the probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given he is not enrolled in that field.

Let's assume some reasonable base rates (priors) for graduate students in the U.S. to be enrolled in business administration and computer science:

- Business Administration: \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.15 \)
- Computer Science: \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.20 \)

These are hypothetical priors and can be adjusted based on more accurate data if available.

Next, let's evaluate \( P(E|H) \) based on Adam's personality traits:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - It's generally thought that business students might have less emphasis on nature, puzzles, and animals, and more on leadership, finance, and organizational behavior.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \) might be relatively low. Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.05 \).

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Computer science students often enjoy solving puzzles and may appreciate abstract thinking, aligning relatively well with Adam’s traits.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \) might be moderate to high. Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.30 \).

Then, let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \), the probability of Adam's personality given he is not enrolled in that specific field. We need an assumption here about the general population of graduate students not in business administration or computer science fitting Adam's description.

- For business administration: Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.20 \)
- For computer science: Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.15 \)

Now, using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where \( P(E) \) can be found through the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

For business administration:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.05 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.0075 + 0.17 = 0.1775 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.15}{0.1775} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \approx 0.042 \]

For computer science:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.30 \cdot 0.20) + (0.15 \cdot 0.80) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.06 + 0.12 = 0.18 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.30 \cdot 0.20}{0.18} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx 0.333 \]

Thus, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.042,
  "computer science": 0.333
}
```
