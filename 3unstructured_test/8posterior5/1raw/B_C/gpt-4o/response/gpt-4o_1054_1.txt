Sure, let's analyze the given fields using Bayesian inference. 

### Step-by-Step Analysis

- **P(H)**: Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the field.
- **P(E|H)**: Likelihood of the evidence (personality sketch) given the field.
- **P(E|¬H)**: Likelihood of the evidence given he is not in that field.
- **P(H|E)**: Posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in the field given the evidence.

### For Business Administration:

1. **P(H)**: Let's assume an arbitrary prior probability that any given graduate student might be in Business Administration. Let's set it relatively low because Business Administration might not strongly correlate with Adam's personality sketch. Let's say \( P(H) = 0.05 \).

2. **P(E|H)**: Given the personality sketch, it's less likely for someone with strong empathy, love for animals, deep curiosity about nature, and abstract understanding to choose Business Administration. The likelihood, \( P(E|H) \), is relatively low, perhaps around 0.1.

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood of the personality sketch given he is not in Business Administration should be higher: \( P(E|¬H) = 0.5 \).

Now, applying Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.05) + (0.5 \cdot 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.005 + 0.475 = 0.48 \]

Therefore:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.05}{0.48} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.48} \approx 0.0104 \]

### For Computer Science:

1. **P(H)**: Let's assume a higher prior probability for Computer Science, say \( P(H) = 0.3 \), given the fields of graduate students in the U.S.

2. **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's interest in puzzles, high intelligence, and abstract thinking, the likelihood that he might be in Computer Science is quite high: \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood of the personality sketch given he is not in Computer Science, is likely around the same, say \( P(E|¬H) = 0.5 \).

Now, applying Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \):
This needs to be re-calculated with the updated prior \( P(H) \) of Computer Science:
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.3) + (0.5 \cdot 0.7) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.21 + 0.35 = 0.56 \]

Therefore:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.3}{0.56} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.21}{0.56} \approx 0.375 \]

### Conclusion:

{
  "business administration": 0.0104,
  "computer science": 0.375
