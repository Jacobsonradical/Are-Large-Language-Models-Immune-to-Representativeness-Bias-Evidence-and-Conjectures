To solve for \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to calculate:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the personality sketch (sum of probabilities for all fields).

Given that \(\ P(E)\) is common for both hypotheses and we don't need an exact probability but rather a relative likelihood, we can simplify comparison calculations by using normalized values without determining \(\ P(E)\).

Let’s estimate the probabilities step-by-step for each field.

### Computer Science
1. **\(P(H_{cs})\) (prior probability):**
   - Computer Science is a common graduate field.
   - Without specific data, we might assume a balanced prior probability.
   - Let’s assume \(P(H_{cs}) = 0.35\).

2. **\(P(E|H_{cs})\) (likelihood):**
   - Adam has high intelligence, enjoys solving puzzles, and understands abstract concepts: traits likely associated with Computer Science.
   - Let’s estimate \( P(E|H_{cs}) = 0.5\).

3. **\(P(E|\neg H_{cs})\) (probability of personality sketch given not computer science):**
   - Broadly, Adam's traits can fit in several other fields as well.
   - For simplicity, assume it is less likely than within Computer Science.
   - Let’s estimate \(P(E|\neg H_{cs}) = 0.3\).

### Business Administration
1. **\(P(H_{ba})\) (prior probability):**
   - Business Administration is also a common graduate field.
   - Without specific data, assume a balanced prior probability.
   - Let’s assume \(P(H_{ba}) = 0.3\).

2. **\(P(E|H_{ba})\) (likelihood):**
   - Traits like empathy, warm heart, and understanding dedication can be relevant for Business Administration, but traits such as solving puzzles and high abstract concept understanding are less closely associated.
   - Let’s estimate \( P(E|H_{ba}) = 0.2\).

3. **\(P(E|\neg H_{ba})\) (probability of personality sketch given not business administration):**
   - Broadly, Adam's traits can fit into several other fields.
   - For simplicity, assume it is more likely than within Business Administration.
   - Let’s estimate \(P(E|\neg H_{ba}) = 0.35\).

### Applying Bayes' Rule

Now let's compute relative \(P(H|E)\) values for each field:

- For Computer Science:
  \[
  P(H_{cs}|E) \propto P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs}) = 0.5 \times 0.35 = 0.175
  \]

- For Business Administration:
  \[
  P(H_{ba}|E) \propto P(E|H_{ba}) \cdot P(H_{ba}) = 0.2 \times 0.3 = 0.06
  \]

### Normalizing

We can compare the probabilities directly, but normalizing will give:
- Total: \(0.175 + 0.06 = 0.235\)

Normalized probabilities:
- Computer Science: \(\frac{0.175}{0.235} \approx 0.745\)
- Business Administration: \(\frac{0.06}{0.235} \approx 0.255\)

So, our final answer in your requested format:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.745,
  "business administration": 0.255
}
```
