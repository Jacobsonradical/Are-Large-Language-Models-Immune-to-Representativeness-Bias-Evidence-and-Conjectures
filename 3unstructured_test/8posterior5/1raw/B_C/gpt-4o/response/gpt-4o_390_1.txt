To calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field given Adam's personality sketch \( E \), we need to apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the field \( H \),
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in the field \( H \),
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in the field \( H \),
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \).

Given the information, let's judge these probabilities qualitatively first.

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Let's assume the prior probability of Adam being in Business Administration is moderate because there are many fields he could be enrolled in.
   - \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.2 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Business Administration students might not necessarily have a strong love for nature, puzzles, or animals. Thus, the likelihood is relatively low.
   - \( P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.1 \)

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - This would be higher as Adam’s traits might align better with other fields, like natural sciences or technology.
   - \( P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) = 0.5 \)

4. **Posterior Probability \( P(H|E) \)**:
   \[
   P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)}
   \]
   Since \( P(E) \) is a normalization constant, we'll focus on the numerators of each posterior probability.

### Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Assume this is moderate,  considering many students enroll in computer science.
   - \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.2 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Adam’s traits like solving puzzles and high intelligence align well with computer science.
   - \( P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.7 \)

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - This would be relatively moderate to low since Adam’s personality traits might better fit natural sciences.
   - \( P(E|\neg \text{computer science}) = 0.6 \)

4. **Posterior Probability \( P(H|E) \)**:
   \[
   P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E| \text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)}
   \]

Let's compute the unnormalized posterior probabilities:
- For Business Administration:
  \[
  P(\text{business administration}|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02
  \]
- For Computer Science:
  \[
  P(\text{computer science}|E) \propto 0.7 \times 0.2 = 0.14
  \]

These unnormalized values should be normalized to get the final posterior probabilities, but since we don't have \( P(E) \), we can just compare the values.

Thus:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.14
}
```
