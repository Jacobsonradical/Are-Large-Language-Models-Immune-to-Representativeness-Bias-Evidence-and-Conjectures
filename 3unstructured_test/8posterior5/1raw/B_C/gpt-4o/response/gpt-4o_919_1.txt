To use Bayes' theorem, we need the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H) \). Here's the detailed reasoning for each field:

### For Business Administration:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \)**:
   - Let's assume a prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration. Since there are many graduate fields, we'll consider this a modest prior probability, let's say \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \)**:
   - Adam's curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals don't strongly suggest Business Administration, but they do not rule it out either. These traits are less common but possible in Business Administration students. A reasonable likelihood could be \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.2 \).

3. **Likelihood of Evidence Given Negation \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \)**:
   - If Adam is not in Business Administration, he would be in one of many other fields. Given his interests, there are other fields that fit better. We could have \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.5 \).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}} | E) = \frac{ P(E | H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) }{ P(E) } \]

Where

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \]

Assuming \( P(\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.9 \):

\[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.5 \cdot 0.9 = 0.02 + 0.45 = 0.47 \]

Then,

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}} | E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.47} \approx 0.0426 \]

### For Computer Science:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \)**:
   - Let's assume a slightly higher prior for Computer Science because it's a popular field, say \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.15 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \)**:
   - Adam's skills in puzzles, intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts align well with attributes beneficial for Computer Science. A high likelihood could be \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.7 \).

3. **Likelihood of Evidence Given Negation \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \)**:
   - If Adam is not in Computer Science, he could still be in fields like Biology, Environmental Sciences, etc., that align with his personality. Assume \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.4 \).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}} | E) = \frac{ P(E | H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) }{ P(E) } \]

Where

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \]

Assuming \( P(\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.85 \):

\[ P(E) = 0.7 \cdot 0.15 + 0.4 \cdot 0.85 = 0.105 + 0.34 = 0.445 \]

Then,

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}} | E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.15}{0.445} \approx 0.235 \]

So, the final probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0426,
  "computer science": 0.235
}
```
