To calculate the probability of Adam being enrolled in either computer science or business administration given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' rule as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam is in that field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of Adam's personality sketch.

Let's assume generic values for the calculations because the actual probabilities are subjective and depend on specific data, which we don't have. However, we can make some educated guesses based on typical student profiles in these fields.

### Computer Science
- \( P(E|H) \): Adam's love for solving puzzles and high intelligence are consistent with qualities desired in computer science. However, his strong empathy and love for animals are less typical. We might estimate \( P(E|H) \) to be moderately high but not very high. Let's say 0.6.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability that someone with Adam's interests and traits would not be in computer science might still be reasonably high because his traits also fit other fields. We may assign a value of 0.5.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability might be moderate due to the popularity of the field among graduate students. Let's assume 0.2.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.2}{0.5}\]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.5}\]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.24 \]

### Business Administration
- \( P(E|H) \): Adam's empathy, appreciation for hard work, and intelligence might fit business administration, but his love for nature, animals, and puzzles are less closely related. Let's set \( P(E|H) \) to be lower, say 0.3.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given Adam's traits, it's more probable that someone with his profile is not in business administration. Let's assume 0.7.
- \( P(H) \): For business administration, given that it is a common field, we might estimate a moderate prior probability of 0.2.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{0.7} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.7} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \approx 0.086 \]

Based on these calculations, the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) can be summarized as:

{
  "computer science": 0.24,
  "business administration": 0.086
