To solve this, we need to estimate the probabilities and then apply Bayes' rule. We'll proceed with the following notation:
- \( P(H_{CS}) \) and \( P(H_{BA}) \) are the prior probabilities that Adam was enrolled in computer science or business administration, respectively.
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) and \( P(E|H_{BA}) \) are the probabilities of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in computer science or business administration, respectively.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \) and \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \) are the probabilities of the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in computer science or business administration, respectively.

### Estimating Prior Probabilities:
We assume:
- \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.2 \) (20% likelihood of a graduate being in computer science)
- \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.15 \) (15% likelihood of a graduate being in business administration)

### Estimating Likelihood Probabilities:
Based on Adam's personality sketch, it looks like:
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.3 \): Adam's traits, such as high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, align reasonably well with those needed for computer science, but his strong empathy and love for animals do not align very strongly.
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.1 \): Adam’s traits such as strong empathy, quietly solving puzzles, and love for animals are less aligned with business administration, which might value different skillsets more prominently.

Given that Adam’s traits include a love for nature, animals, and puzzles, we can assume:
- \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.5 \): It’s quite probable that these traits could be present in someone not in computer science.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.7 \): It's highly probable that these traits could be present in someone not in business administration.

### Applying Bayes' Rule:
Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) (the normalizing constant) is the same for both fields, we can ignore it when comparing the probabilities:

For computer science:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \approx 0.3 \times 0.2 = 0.06 \]

For business administration:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \approx 0.1 \times 0.15 = 0.015 \]

Converting these to the desired format:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.06,
  "business administration": 0.015
}
```

Note that these values do not sum to 1 because they are not exclusive and exhaustively covering all possible fields of study, and they represent relative likelihoods given the personality sketch.
