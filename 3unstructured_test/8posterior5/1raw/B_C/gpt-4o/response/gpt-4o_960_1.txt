Sure, to compute \( P(H | E) \) for each field, we'll need to apply Bayes' rule. Here's a step-by-step breakdown and assumptions made for ease of calculation:

Given:
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability of a student being enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E | H) \): Likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he were in that field.
- \( P(E | \neg H) \): Likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he were not in that field.
- \( P(H | E) \): Posterior probability of Adam being in that field given his personality sketch.

Applying Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E | H) \cdot P(H) + P(E | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's make the following assumptions for the sake of this calculation:
1. Prior (\( P(H) \)): Assume equal priors for simplicity since no information about the overall distribution is provided.
2. Likelihood (\( P(E | H) \) and \( P(E | \neg H) \)): These can be based on how well Adam’s personality traits align with typical characteristics of students in these fields.

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: Assume a general prior probability for any graduate field, say 0.1.
- **P(E | H)**: The personality traits of curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and solving puzzles may not be strongly aligned with the stereotypical traits of business administration students. This may be lower, say 0.2.
- **P(E | \neg H)**: The traits Adam has could broadly fit many non-business fields. Let's use 0.8 for this.

\[ P(E) = P(E | H) \cdot P(H) + P(E | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.8 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.72 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.74 \]

\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.74} \]
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{0.02}{0.74} \]
\[ P(H | E) \approx 0.027 \]

### Computer Science
- **P(H)**: Assume the same general prior probability for any graduate field, say 0.1.
- **P(E | H)**: His traits of solving puzzles and high intelligence fit well with computer science, which might be higher, say 0.7.
- **P(E | \neg H)**: The traits Adam has could broadly fit many non-computer science fields as well. Let’s use the same, 0.8, for simplicity.

\[ P(E) = P(E | H) \cdot P(H) + P(E | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.1) + (0.8 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.07 + 0.72 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.79 \]

\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.79} \]
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{0.07}{0.79} \]
\[ P(H | E) \approx 0.089 \]

### Conclusion

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.027,
  "computer science": 0.089
}
```

Note: These values are based on simplifying assumptions and hypothetical likelihoods. The actual probabilities might differ with more precise data.
