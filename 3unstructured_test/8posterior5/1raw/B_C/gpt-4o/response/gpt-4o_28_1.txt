To apply Bayes' Rule, we need to break down the probabilities as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let’s start with estimating the probabilities.

### Computer Science
**P(H)**: 
The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science. Considering the general proportion of students in various fields, let's assume a baseline prior probability (this can vary based on additional data, but we’ll use a rough estimate).

\[ P(H_{CS}) \approx 0.2 \]

**P(E|H)**:
The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in Computer Science. While Computer Science students can indeed have a wide range of personalities, the given traits (nature curiosity, love for animals, appreciation for hard work) might be less directly aligned with the stereotypical interests and skills associated with the field. However, his intelligence and abstract thinking align well.

\[ P(E|H_{CS}) \approx 0.3 \]

**P(E|\neg H)**:
The probability of the personality sketch given Adam is not in Computer Science. This covers all other graduate fields, and given the traits fit well under certain other disciplines (like environmental science or biology), this probability could be higher.

\[ P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \approx 0.8 \]

Now calculate \(P(H_{CS}|E)\):

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

### Business Administration
**P(H)**:
The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration. Again, we'll use a baseline estimate.

\[ P(H_{BA}) \approx 0.2 \]

**P(E|H)**:
The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in Business Administration might be lower, considering the fields typically emphasize different traits (e.g., more extroversion, interest in business dynamics). But his appreciation for hard work is somewhat aligned.

\[ P(E|H_{BA}) \approx 0.2 \]

**P(E|\neg H)**:
The probability of the personality sketch given Adam is not in Business Administration. Given the traits, this is likely higher, as before.

\[ P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \approx 0.8 \]

Now calculate \(P(H_{BA}|E)\):

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

To simplify comparison, we can assume \(P(E)\) as a normalizing constant that can be left out in this contrast:

{
  "computer science": \( \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{c_{norm}} \approx \frac{0.06}{c_{norm}} \),
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{c_{norm}} \approx \frac{0.04}{c_{norm}} \)
}

Since both estimates need \(P(E)\) as a denominator, we only provide relative scores:

{
  "computer science": 0.06,
  "business administration": 0.04
}

Hence, it is somewhat more likely based on the sketch that Adam, if choosing between these two fields, would be enrolled in Computer Science given his personality traits.
