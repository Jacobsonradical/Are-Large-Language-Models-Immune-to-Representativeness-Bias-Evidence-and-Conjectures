Let's analyze the probabilities for each field based on the provided personality sketch of Adam.

### Computer Science
**P(H)**: The overall probability that a graduate student is studying computer science (prior probability). Let's assume it's a moderate probability, say 0.2.

**P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam's personality sketch (E) is observed if he is enrolled in computer science. Given his high intelligence and interest in solving puzzles, he might be well-suited for computer science. Let's say this probability is 0.6.

**P(E|¬H)**: The probability that Adam's personality sketch (E) is observed if he is not enrolled in computer science. Given the broad nature of his interests and traits, let's assume it's still moderately likely he could be in another field that values intelligence and problem-solving skills. Let's assume this is 0.4.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \)

\[ P(E) = 0.6 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8 = 0.12 + 0.32 = 0.44 \]

Thus,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{0.44} = \frac{0.12}{0.44} \approx 0.273 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.273.

### Business Administration
**P(H)**: The overall probability that a graduate student is studying business administration (prior probability). Let's assume a slightly lower probability, say 0.1.

**P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam's personality sketch (E) is observed if he is enrolled in business administration. Given his empathy, warmth, and understanding of hard work, these traits might be less strongly correlated with business administration than with some other fields. Let's say this probability is 0.3.

**P(E|¬H)**: The probability that Adam's personality sketch (E) is observed if he is not enrolled in business administration. Similar to before, given the broad nature of his traits, let's assume this is 0.5.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \)

\[ P(E) = 0.3 \cdot 0.1 + 0.5 \cdot 0.9 = 0.03 + 0.45 = 0.48 \]

Thus,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.48} = \frac{0.03}{0.48} \approx 0.063 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch is approximately 0.063.

Here is the answer in the requested format:
