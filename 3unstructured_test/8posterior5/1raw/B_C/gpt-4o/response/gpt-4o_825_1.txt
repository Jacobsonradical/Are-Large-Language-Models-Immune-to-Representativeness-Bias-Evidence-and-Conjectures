To determine the probabilities \( P(H|E) \), we can use Bayes' Theorem, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's break down the values for each field:

### Business Administration

1. **P(H) (Prior Probability of Adam being in Business Administration)**
   - Given that there are many graduate fields (e.g., business administration, computer science, biology, environmental science), the prior probability isn't particularly high or low.
   - Let's assume a modest prior:
   \[ P(H) \approx 0.1 \]

2. **P(E|H) (Probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is studying Business Administration)**
   - Business administration might not typically align with a deep love for nature, plants, and animals, though the skills like intelligence and abstract thinking could somewhat fit.
   - Let's give this a lower value due to the mismatch with nature-related interests:
   \[ P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \]

3. **P(E|\neg H) (Probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is not in Business Administration)**
   - If Adam is not in business administration, his love for nature, plants, and animals might suggest other fields.
   - Assume this to be slightly higher:
   \[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \]

4. **P(E) (Probability of observing the personality sketch E overall)**
   - This can be considered a normalization factor, but we only need relative values for comparison.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a constant for normalization across fields:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.2 \times 0.1 = 0.02 \]

### Computer Science

1. **P(H) (Prior Probability of Adam being in Computer Science)**
   - Computer science is fairly common among graduate fields.
   - Estimate a bit higher than business administration:
   \[ P(H) \approx 0.15 \]

2. **P(E|H) (Probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is studying Computer Science)**
   - Computer science appeals to those who enjoy solving puzzles and abstract thought, aligning well with Adam's described interests.
   - Assuming a better fit:
   \[ P(E|H) \approx 0.6 \]

3. **P(E|\neg H) (Probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is not in Computer Science)**
   - Assume this to be the average alignment with other non-CS fields:
   \[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \]

4. **P(E) (Probability of observing the personality sketch E overall)**
   - Same as for business administration. We need relative values.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Similarly:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.6 \times 0.15 = 0.09 \]

### Relative Probabilities

For normalization, the exact \( P(E) \) is not necessary; we can compare the relative weights:

- Business Administration: \( 0.02 \)
- Computer Science: \( 0.09 \)

Thus, the resulting probabilities become:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.09
}
```
