To determine the likelihood that Adam was enrolled in specific graduate fields based on his personality sketch (E), we can utilize Bayes' Rule. Bayes' Rule is formulated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For each field, we'll estimate:

1. \( P(H) \) - the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in that field.
2. \( P(E|H) \) - the probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he's enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - the probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he's not enrolled in that field.
4. \( P(E) \) - the overall probability of Adam's personality sketch (this can be expressed as a sum of all possible fields, but since we're comparing relative likelihoods, we'll use the same value for both fields to simplify).

Let's start with the assessments for each field:

### Business Administration

- **\( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \)**: Business Administration is a relatively common graduate field but not necessarily the most likely given Adam's personality sketch. Let's estimate \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1 \) (10%).
  
- **\( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \)**: Business Administration students might also have strong empathy and appreciation for hard work, but curiosity about nature and love for animals might be less relevant. Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.2 \) (20%).

- **\( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \)**: Given that Adam is not in Business Administration, the probability of his personality sketch matches a general graduate student quite well. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.3 \) (30%).

### Computer Science

- **\( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \)**: Computer Science is a common field for high-intelligence students who enjoy solving puzzles. Let's estimate \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.2 \) (20%).

- **\( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \)**: Computer Science students often have the traits of problem-solving skills and abstract thinking. Curiosity about nature and love for animals might be less directly relevant. Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.5 \) (50%).

- **\( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \)**: Again, the probability of Adam's personality sketch fitting a general graduate student. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.3 \) (30%).

### Applying Bayes' Rule

Now, we apply these values to Bayes' Rule for each field:

For **Business Administration**:

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

For **Computer Science**:

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both and just serves as a normalizing factor, we can compare the numerators directly:

- Business Administration: \( 0.2 \cdot 0.1 = 0.02 \)
- Computer Science: \( 0.5 \cdot 0.2 = 0.1 \)

### Relative Likelihoods

We conclude:
- Computer Science has a higher relative likelihood than Business Administration.

So, our final answer is:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.1
}
```

These values reflect the relative likelihoods based on the given personality sketch.
