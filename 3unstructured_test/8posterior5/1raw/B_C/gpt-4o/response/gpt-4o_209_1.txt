To assess the likelihood that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or business administration by using Bayes' Theorem, we'll start by estimating the probabilities \(P(H)\), \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E|\neg H)\) based on the given personality sketch.

### Hypothesis 1: Computer Science
1. **Prior Probability, \(P(H_{\text{CS}})\)**:
   - This depends on general enrollment statistics and might typically be moderate since computer science is a common graduate field. Let's assume \(P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.2\).

2. **Likelihood, \(P(E|H_{\text{CS}})\)**:
   - Adam's characteristics such as high intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts are highly compatible with traits of a computer science student. Let's estimate \(P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.9\).

3. **Complementary likelihood, \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}})\)**:
   - Given the diversity of graduate fields, some students in non-computer science fields might also share these traits, but less likely. Let’s estimate \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.4\).

Applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \times P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)}\]

Since \(P(E)\) is unknown, we use the proportional approach:

\[P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \times P(H_{\text{CS}})\]

\[P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto 0.9 \times 0.2 = 0.18\]

### Hypothesis 2: Business Administration
1. **Prior Probability, \(P(H_{\text{BA}})\)**:
   - Business administration is also a common graduate field, so let's assume \(P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.15\).

2. **Likelihood, \(P(E|H_{\text{BA}})\)**:
   - The traits described do not strongly align with typical business administration qualities like management and organizational skills. Let's estimate \(P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.3\).

3. **Complementary likelihood, \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}})\)**:
   - Similar reasoning as before, let’s estimate \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.5\).

Applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \times P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)}\]

Since \(P(E)\) is unknown, we use the proportional approach:

\[P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \times P(H_{\text{BA}})\]

\[P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \propto 0.3 \times 0.15 = 0.045\]

### Normalizing these probabilities:
For normalization, let's calculate the total of the proportional probabilities for both fields and divide each by this sum.

Sum of proportional probabilities:
\[0.18 + 0.045 = 0.225\]

Normalized probabilities:
\[P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.18}{0.225} = 0.8\]

\[P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.225} = 0.2\]

### Final Answer:

{
  "computer science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
