To solve this problem using Bayes' rule, we need to calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the hypotheses that Adam was a graduate student in each of the specified fields, given the personality sketch \( E \).

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis.

Let’s break down our approach for each field mentioned (business administration and computer science):

1. **Prior probability \( P(H) \)**: This is the initial probability of Adam being in each field before considering the personality sketch (commonality of these fields among U.S. graduate students):
   - Business administration is common, so let’s assume \( P(H_{\text{business\_administration}}) = 0.2 \).
   - Computer science is also common, so let’s assume \( P(H_{\text{computer\_science}}) = 0.2 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of observing the evidence if Adam is in the specific field:
   - Business administration may not have a strong emphasis on nature, plants, animals, or solving puzzles but might value empathy and understanding hard work. Therefore, let’s assume \( P(E|H_{\text{business\_administration}}) = 0.1 \).
   - Computer science might align more with solving puzzles and high intelligence but less with nature and animals. However, abstract thinking fits well, so let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{computer\_science}}) = 0.3 \).

3. **Likelihood for negation \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is the probability of the evidence if Adam is not in the specified field:
   - Given the nature of U.S. graduate programs, let’s assume the marginal likelihood of observing the evidence across all other fields sums up for arguments between 0.2 and 0.4. To simplify, considering that evidence doesn’t so strongly connect with either field, let’s say the global probability is \( P(E) = 0.2 \).

Now, we apply these assumptions:

For business administration:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{business\_administration}} = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business\_administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business\_administration}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.2} = 0.1 \]

For computer science:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{computer\_science}} = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{computer\_science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer\_science}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.2} = 0.3 \]

Thus, based on the assumptions provided:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
