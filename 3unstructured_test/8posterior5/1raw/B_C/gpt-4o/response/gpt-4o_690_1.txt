To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' theorem, we need to determine the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). Here, we will estimate these probabilities for each field based on the given personality sketch.

Let's start with the field of computer science and business administration:

### Computer Science
1. **P(H):** The probability that a given graduate student is enrolled in computer science. Considering the high market demand and interest in the field, we may estimate this value somewhat high.
   - Estimate: \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.25 \)

2. **P(E|H):** The probability of observing the traits described in the sketch given that the student is in computer science. Considering Adam's intelligence and love for solving puzzles, there is a moderately high likelihood.
   - Estimate: \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.6 \)

3. **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of observing the traits described in the sketch given that the student is **not** in computer science. This needs to be evaluated considering other fields and how these traits might appear.
   - Assume that across all other fields, these traits are slightly less common.
   - Estimate: \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.4 \)

We apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.6 \cdot 0.25 + 0.4 \cdot 0.75 = 0.15 + 0.3 = 0.45 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.25}{0.45} \approx 0.33 \]

### Business Administration
1. **P(H):** The probability that a given graduate student is enrolled in business administration. This can also be considered high considering the popularity of the field.
   - Estimate: \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.2 \)

2. **P(E|H):** The probability of observing the traits described in the sketch given that the student is in business administration. Considering Adam's empathy and appreciation for hard work, there is some moderate likelihood but not as high given his other interests.
   - Estimate: \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.4 \)

3. **P(E|\neg H):** The overall probability of observing these traits regardless of the specific field. This should ideally be the same as what we calculated before for consistency.
   - Estimate: \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.45 \)

We apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.45 \cdot 0.8 = 0.08 + 0.36 = 0.44 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.44} \approx 0.18 \]

Taking these calculations into account, the final results we provide are estimates:

  "computer science": 0.33,
  "business administration": 0.18
