Let's break down the probabilities step by step for both fields: Computer Science (CS) and Business Administration (BA).

### Probabilities and Bayes' Rule
Bayes' Rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of Adam having the given personality traits given that he was enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \).

Given that we are looking at two specific fields, we can assume \( P(H) \) to be equal for both fields for simplicity, unless we have specific knowledge otherwise.

**1. Computer Science (CS)**

- **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in CS. Given no additional specific data, let's assume:
  \[ P(H_{CS}) = 0.2 \] (assuming a reasonable prior because many students enroll in CS).

- **P(E|H):** The probability of Adam having the given personality traits if he were a CS student.
  \[ P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.4 \] (Curiosity and intelligence align with CS, but the empathy and love for animals is less typical of the average CS profile).

- **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of Adam having the personality traits considered in fields other than CS.
  \[ P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.6 \]

**2. Business Administration (BA)**

- **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in BA. Again, let's assume:
  \[ P(H_{BA}) = 0.1 \] 

- **P(E|H):** The probability of Adam having the given personality traits if he were a BA student.
  \[ P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.2 \] (As the personality sketch may not align as strongly with typical BA profile).

- **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of Adam having the personality traits considered in fields other than BA.
  \[ P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.7 \]

### Calculation of P(H|E)

Let's use Bayes' Rule to calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[
P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)}
\]

\[
P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)}
\]

Since \( P(E) \) is common for both fields and won't affect the relative probabilities, the comparison boils down to the numerators:

For CS:
\[
P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.08}{P(E)}
\]

For BA:
\[
P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.02}{P(E)}
\]

Since we're interested in the relative values:

\[
P(H_{CS}|E) = 0.08
\]

\[
P(H_{BA}|E) = 0.02
\]

Normalizing these to represent probabilities, let's divide by the total:

\[
P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.02} = \frac{0.08}{0.1} = 0.8
\]

\[
P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.08 + 0.02} = \frac{0.02}{0.1} = 0.2
\]

### Final Answer
\[
\{
  "computer science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
\}
\]
