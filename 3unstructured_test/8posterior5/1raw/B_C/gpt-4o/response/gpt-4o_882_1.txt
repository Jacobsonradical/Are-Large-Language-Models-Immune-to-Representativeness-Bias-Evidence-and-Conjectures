To solve this using Bayes' theorem, we need to estimate the probabilities as follows:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in each field.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in each field.
4. **P(H|E)**: The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field given his personality sketch.

We will use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the normalizing constant and can be written as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

Now let's estimate these probabilities for each field:

### Business Administration

- **P(H)** for business administration: Graduate students are distributed among many fields, but business administration is a common field. Let's assume this is moderately likely. Suppose \( P(H_{\text{bus}}) = 0.1 \).
  
- **P(E|H)** for business administration: Considering Adam's described personality, the traits are not directly indicative of a business administration focus; it's more neutral. Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{bus}}) = 0.2 \).

- **P(E|¬H)** for business administration: Since "¬H" includes other fields, we will assume that Adam's personality matches another field better. We estimate \( P(E|¬H_{\text{bus}}) = 0.1 \).

### Computer Science

- **P(H)** for computer science: Computer science is also a common choice for graduate studies. Again, assuming moderately likely, \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.1 \).
  
- **P(E|H)** for computer science: Adam's interests in nature, puzzles, high intelligence, appreciation for hard work, and abstract thinking align well with computer science. Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.4 \).

- **P(E|¬H)** for computer science: This includes other fields where Adam's personality might be less well-matched. Let's estimate \( P(E|¬H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.2 \).

Now, calculate \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{bus}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{bus}}) + P(E|¬H_{\text{bus}}) \cdot P(¬H_{\text{bus}}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.1 \cdot 0.9 = 0.02 + 0.09 = 0.11 \]

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}}) + P(E|¬H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(¬H_{\text{cs}}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.4 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9 = 0.04 + 0.18 = 0.22 \]

Finally, use Bayes' theorem to get \( P(H|E) \):

For business administration:
\[ P(H_{\text{bus}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{bus}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{bus}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.11} \approx 0.1818 \]

For computer science:
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.1}{0.22} \approx 0.1818 \]

 Thus, the result is approximately:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1818,
  "computer science": 0.1818
}
```

Note: These values are hypothetical and based on subjective estimates of the probabilities. Actual values might differ if more specific data were available.
