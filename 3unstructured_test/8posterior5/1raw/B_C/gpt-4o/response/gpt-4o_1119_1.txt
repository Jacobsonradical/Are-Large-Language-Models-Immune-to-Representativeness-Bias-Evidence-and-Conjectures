To estimate the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam in the fields of computer science and business administration, using Bayes' rule, we need to assess the following probabilities:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given his field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in the field.

Bayes' rule formula is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, for practical purposes, we often express this in a comparative form without needing to explicitly calculate \( P(E) \), as we are comparing multiple hypotheses.

### Computer Science

**P(H)**: Given that computer science is a popular field of study for high-achieving graduate students in the U.S., but not dominant, let's estimate \(P(\text{CS}) = 0.2\).

**P(E|H)**: The personality traits listed suggest strong analytical skills and interest in puzzles, which align well with computer science. There is a moderate correlation, so let's say \(P(E|\text{CS}) = 0.4\).

**P(E|\neg H)**: This is the probability of having Adam's traits if he were not in computer science. Given that these traits are quite broad and could fit several fields, let's estimate \(P(E|\neg \text{CS}) = 0.2\).

Using these values in Bayes' rule:

\[ P(\text{CS}|E) \propto P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) = 0.4 \times 0.2 = 0.08 \]

### Business Administration

**P(H)**: Business administration is also a common field among graduate students, though the specific traits don't strongly suggest this field. Let's estimate \(P(\text{BA}) = 0.15\).

**P(E|H)**: The traits listed are less indicative of business administration, which typically prioritizes leadership and social skills. Let's say \(P(E|\text{BA}) = 0.1\).

**P(E|\neg H)**: Similar to before, traits could align with various other fields, so \(P(E|\neg \text{BA}) = 0.2\).

Using these values in Bayes' rule:

\[ P(\text{BA}|E) \propto P(E|\text{BA}) \cdot P(\text{BA}) = 0.1 \times 0.15 = 0.015 \]

Finally, normalizing these values will give us relative probabilities:

### Normalization and Final Values:

To make these comparable, you could normalize them relative to the sum of non-normalized probabilities if you wanted absolute values. However, since we are comparing the relative likelihoods, the raw numbers indicate the relative strength.

Thus, the approximate values without normalization (since absolute values not required) are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.08,
  "business administration": 0.015
}
```

These numbers suggest that, given Adam's personality sketch, it is more likely he'll be enrolled in computer science rather than business administration. However, note that these are relative probabilities and other fields not considered might have higher or lower likelihoods.
