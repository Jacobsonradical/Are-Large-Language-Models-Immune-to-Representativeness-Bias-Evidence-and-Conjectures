To solve this problem using Bayes' rule, we'll denote:

- P(H) as the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field of study.
- P(E|H) as the probability of observing the personality sketch (E) given that Adam is enrolled in a particular field (H).
- P(E|\neg H) as the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is **not** enrolled in that particular field.
- P(H|E) as the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field given the personality sketch.

Since we don't have actual empirical data, we'll make reasonable estimations based on typical characteristics and inclinations of students in the mentioned fields. 

1. **Business Administration**:
   - P(H) (prior for business admin): Let's assume a moderate prior of 0.1 since many students might study business administration.
   - P(E|H) (how well the profile matches business admin): Adam's profile doesn't strongly match the typical traits associated with business administration (like a focus on human interactions, management skills, etc.). Let's estimate it as 0.1.
   - P(E|\neg H) (how well the profile matches other fields in general): This is harder to estimate without specifics but let’s assume 0.5 as an average likelihood.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\( P(E) \) is challenging to compute directly, but we'll focus on the ratio comparisons. Also, by comparing other fields, we can normalize our values later.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - P(H) (prior for computer science): Given Adam's analytical and abstract thinking traits, let's assume a higher prior of 0.3.
   - P(E|H) (how well the profile matches computer science): Adam’s characteristics seem to align well with typical computer science traits such as high intelligence and problem-solving skills. Let’s estimate it as 0.6.
   - P(E|\neg H) (how well the profile matches other fields in general): We estimated it as an average of 0.5.

Using the same Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To compare them proportionally:
\[ P(H|E)_{business} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.5} = 0.02 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{comp science} = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.3}{0.5} = 0.36 \]

Therefore, the relative probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.02",
  "computer science": "0.36"
}
```

These values don't need to sum to 1 because there are other possible fields of study not considered here. They show that given Adam's profile, he is more likely to be enrolled in computer science than business administration.
