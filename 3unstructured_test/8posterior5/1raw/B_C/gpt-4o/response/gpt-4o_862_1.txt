To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we'll follow these steps for each field:

1. Assess \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being in that field, based on general information or assumptions.
2. Assess \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in that field.
3. Assess \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in that field.
4. Apply Bayes' Rule: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assume \( P(E) \) is some positive constant that normalizes the probabilities (not needed if we are just comparing relative probabilities).

Here we'll provide estimated values based on the given personality sketch and general knowledge about typical fields.

### Business Administration

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of any given graduate student being in business administration might be moderate. Let's estimate \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
2. \( P(E|H) \): The typical traits of business administration students do not usually align with a strong curiosity for nature, warm-hearted empathy, or a deep love for animals. Thus, let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.05 \).
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's traits given he is not in business administration might be higher, since these traits are more typical in other fields such as environmental science or psychology. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.25 \).

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \]

### Computer Science

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of any given graduate student being in computer science might be higher, given that it's a common field. Let's estimate \( P(H) = 0.3 \).
2. \( P(E|H) \): The traits mentioned align reasonably well with a computer science student, especially the high intelligence and abstract thinking. Thus, let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's traits given he is not in computer science might be somewhat lower since these traits are more specialized. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.15 \).

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.3}{P(E)} \]

Given that we are comparing \( P(H|E) \) for different hypotheses, we can decide the relative magnitude without calculating \( P(E) \).

### Calculations:
- For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.05 \times 0.1 = 0.005 \]

- For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.2 \times 0.3 = 0.06 \]

### Normalization (Optional, just for understanding)

To find the relative values, we'd normalize them:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{normalized}} = \frac{P(H|E)}{\sum P(H|E)} \]

But since we're only comparing, we can see that the probability for computer science is higher.

Here's the final answer in the required format:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.005,
  "computer science": 0.06
}
```

Note: These values are illustrative and based on rough estimates from the traits provided. They demonstrate the computation method rather than precise probabilities.
