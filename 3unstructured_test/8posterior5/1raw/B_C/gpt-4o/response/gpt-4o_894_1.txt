To solve this problem using Bayes' rule, we need to determine the following probabilities:

- \(P(H)\): Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
- \(P(E|H)\): Likelihood of the evidence given that Adam was in the given field.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): Likelihood of the evidence given that Adam was not in the given field.
- \(P(H|E)\): Posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field, given the evidence.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since the absolute values for \(P(E)\) are not provided, we will do a comparative analysis based on the given probabilities.

### Computer Science

1. **P(H)**: The base rate of students enrolled in computer science. Let's assume this probability is reasonably high, say 0.1, because computer science is a popular field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood that Adam exhibits the described traits (interest in nature, solving puzzles, high intelligence, empathy, appreciation for hard work) if he is a computer science student. Given that computer science students typically possess high intelligence and puzzle-solving skills but may not necessarily have a strong interest in nature and animals, let's estimate this at about 0.3.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood that Adam exhibits these traits if he is not a computer science student. Given the specificity of his traits, this might be relatively lower, say 0.2.

Applying these values in Bayes' rule formula:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.3 \times 0.1 = 0.03 \]

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: The base rate of students enrolled in business administration. This might be somewhat common, say 0.05.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood that Adam exhibits the traits if he is a business administration student. Given the traits described, there seems to be a weaker alignment since business administration students don't typically focus on nature and animals; thus, let's estimate this at around 0.1.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood that Adam exhibits these traits if he is not a business administration student is similar to the above case, say 0.2.

Applying these values in Bayes' rule formula:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \times 0.05 = 0.005 \]

### Final Answer

We normalize these comparative values (0.03 for computer science and 0.005 for business administration) so they make sense on the 0-1 scale, acknowledging that there are additional fields:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.03 / (0.03 + 0.005) = 0.86,
  "business administration": 0.005 / (0.03 + 0.005) = 0.14
}
```

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.86,
  "business administration": 0.14
}
```
