To estimate \( P(H|E) \), the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field \( H \) given his personality sketch \( E \), we use Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given \( H \) (a hypothesis that Adam is in a specific field), we need to estimate:
1. \( P(H) \) – the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
2. \( P(E|H) \) – the likelihood of observing the personality sketch if Adam is in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) – the likelihood of observing the personality sketch if Adam is not in that field.

Let's set some rough estimates.

For **business administration**:

1. **Prior probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Business administration is a fairly common field among graduate students, so let's estimate \( P(H) \) to be around 0.1 (10%).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Business administration students might be interested in abstract concepts and hard work, but empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature are less defining. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) to be relatively low, maybe 0.2.

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - Considering the wide range of other fields and personality alignments, let's estimate this to be around 0.05.

Now let’s calculate \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.02}{P(E)} \]

For **computer science**:

1. **Prior probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Computer science is also a very common field, so \( P(H) \) might similarly be around 0.1 (10%).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Computer science students might match more closely with problem-solving, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts. Given the empathetic and nature-centric traits, let’s estimate \( P(E|H) \) to be higher, perhaps 0.4.

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - Again, estimating this to be around 0.05.

Now let’s calculate \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.4 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.04}{P(E)} \]

Given these estimates and simplifying assuming \( P(E) \) remains comparable in both scenarios (although ideally, this would represent the total probability of observing \( E \) over all fields), we get:

{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.04
