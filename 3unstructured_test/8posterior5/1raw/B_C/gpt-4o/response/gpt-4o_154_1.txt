To compute \( P(H|E) \) for both computer science and business administration, we need to start with estimating the relevant probabilities: the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \).

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - \( P(H) \) for both fields: Graduate students are distributed across many fields. Letâ€™s assume the prior probability of choosing any single field is roughly equal among many popular fields. Suppose there are 10 equally likely popular fields, then \( P(H) \) for one specific field might be roughly 0.1.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - For "computer science," the likelihood of having a student who is curious about nature, has a warm heart, and loves animals might be relatively lower. However, the traits of being good at solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts fit reasonably well. So, we might estimate \( P(E|H) \) for computer science to be around 0.3.
   - For "business administration," having traits such as a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication might be common. However, the link between curiosity about nature, and love for animals may be weaker. So, we might estimate \( P(E|H) \) for business administration to be around 0.2.

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - This is a bit more challenging, as it is the likelihood of the observed evidence given that Adam is not in the specified field. Given nature-related characteristics might be more common in fields like biology or environmental science, we might set this value around 0.05 for both fields.

### Calculation using Bayes Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since the exact value of \( P(E) \) (the overall probability of the evidence) is difficult to ascertain without more context, let's assume \( P(E) \) is the same for each field (which simplifies to comparing the numerators of Bayes' rule).

### Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(computer\ science|E) \approx \frac{0.3 \times 0.1}{0.05} = 0.6 \]
\[ P(business\ administration|E) \approx \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{0.05} = 0.4 \]

Based on this approach, we can represent the probabilities as:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.4
}
```

This result suggests that based on the personality sketch, it is somewhat more likely that Adam was enrolled in computer science rather than business administration.
