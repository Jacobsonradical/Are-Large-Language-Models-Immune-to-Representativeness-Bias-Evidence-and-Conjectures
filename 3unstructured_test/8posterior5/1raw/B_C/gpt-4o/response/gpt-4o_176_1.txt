To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each of the hypotheses (Adam being enrolled in Computer Science or Business Administration), we utilize Bayes' theorem which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's break down our calculations step-by-step for both fields, considering the provided information about Adam's personality sketch \( E \) and the nature of the fields.

### Hypothesis 1: Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - We'll assume the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) of Adam being enrolled in either Computer Science or Business Administration are relatively uniform, as we don't have explicit information. We can assume a slight preference towards Computer Science considering his described traits.
   - \( P(H_{cs}) = 0.4 \) (assuming a moderate likelihood given his interest in puzzles and intelligence).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{cs}) \)**:
   - Given his curiosity about nature, puzzles, and high intelligence, it's plausible but not definitive that Adam might be in Computer Science. His empathy and love for animals are not direct indicators but don't necessarily conflict either.
   - \( P(E|H_{cs}) = 0.5 \) (moderately likely, but not overwhelmingly so).

3. **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{cs}) \)**:
   - This is the probability that the personality sketch fits if Adam is not in Computer Science.
   - Given the traits, they could quite easily describe someone in other diverse fields. Assign a robust weight to the alternative.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{cs}) = 0.6 \) (relatively broad fit for other fields).

### Hypothesis 2: Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - We'll assume the same uniform prior as before.
   - \( P(H_{ba}) = 0.4 \) (assuming a similar baseline likelihood).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{ba}) \)**:
   - Traits like empathy, understanding, and appreciation for hard work align well with Business Administration, yet his curiosity about nature and puzzles may not be as well-suited.
   - \( P(E|H_{ba}) = 0.3 \) (less likely given specific indicators of field interest).

3. **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{ba}) \)**:
   - Considering Adam's traits, it is somewhat more probable for him to be in many other fields other than Business Administration.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{ba}) = 0.7 \) (fields more aligned with his curiosity beyond BA).

### Computing Posterior Probabilities

Using Bayesâ€™ Rule:

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs})}{P(E)} \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{ba}) \cdot P(H_{ba})}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing factor and same for both hypotheses, it will effectively cancel out for a relative comparison:

### Normalized Feelings:

\[ P(H_{cs}|E) \propto P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs}) = 0.5 \times 0.4 = 0.2 \]
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) \propto P(E|H_{ba}) \cdot P(H_{ba}) = 0.3 \times 0.4 = 0.12 \]

Finally, putting everything together relatively:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.12
}
```

Understanding there're other fields could accommodate Adam's traits, we'd see this as a relative comparison.
