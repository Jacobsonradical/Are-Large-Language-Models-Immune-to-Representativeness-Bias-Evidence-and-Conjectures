To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or business administration given his personality sketch (E), we can use Bayes' Theorem. First, we'll need to estimate prior probabilities (P(H)) and conditional probabilities (P(E|H) and P(E|¬H)) for both fields.

Let’s make some reasonable assumptions and then compute the probabilities accordingly.

### For Computer Science (H = "computer science"):
- **P(H):** Graduate programs in computer science are highly popular. Let's assume P(H) = 0.2 (20%).
- **P(E|H):** Adam’s traits fit quite well with the profile of a CS student, especially intelligence, abstract thinking, and problem-solving skills. Let’s estimate P(E|H) = 0.7.
- **P(E|¬H):** Many graduate fields could have students with Adam’s traits but perhaps less so than computer science. Let’s estimate P(E|¬H) = 0.4.

### For Business Administration (H = "business administration"):
- **P(H):** Business administration is also a popular field. Let’s assume P(H) = 0.2 (20%).
- **P(E|H):** Adam's traits like empathy and understanding of hard work align somewhat with business administration though traits like love for nature don't fit as well. Let’s estimate P(E|H) = 0.4.
- **P(E|¬H):** Again, Adam’s traits are quite common in various graduate fields. Let’s estimate P(E|¬H) = 0.4.

Now, applying Bayes’ rule for each field:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
\]

### Computer Science:
\[
P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.7 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.14}{0.14 + 0.32} = \frac{0.14}{0.46} \approx 0.3043
\]

### Business Administration:
\[
P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.32} = \frac{0.08}{0.4} = 0.2
\]

Therefore, the probabilities, rounded to four decimal places, are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3043,
  "business administration": 0.2000
}
```
