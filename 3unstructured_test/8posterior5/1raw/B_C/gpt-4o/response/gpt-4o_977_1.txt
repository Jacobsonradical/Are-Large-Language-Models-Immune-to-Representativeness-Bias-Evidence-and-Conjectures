To calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we use the formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For each field of study, we need to estimate:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not in that field.

In the absence of detailed statistical data, we will make educated estimates.

### Computer Science

1. \( P(H_{CS}) \): Computer Science is a common graduate field, so let's assume a moderate prior probability. Estimate: 0.25
2. \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Given Adam's traits of high intelligence, puzzle-solving enjoyment, and understanding of abstract concepts, these traits are common in Computer Science students. Estimate: 0.6
3. \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \): For non-Computer Science fields, he still might exhibit these traits, but perhaps less so generally. Estimate: 0.4

### Business Administration

1. \( P(H_{BA}) \): Business Administration is another common graduate field, but let's assume it's a bit less relevant for Adam's traits. Estimate: 0.15
2. \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): Given Adam's traits, there's lower alignment with typical Business Administration traits. Estimate: 0.2
3. \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \): For non-Business Administration fields, these traits might be more common. Estimate: 0.5

Next, we calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field by normalizing (though we won't normalize across different hypotheses since we don't sum to 1).

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(E) \approx (0.6 \cdot 0.25) + (0.4 \cdot 0.75) = 0.15 + 0.3 = 0.45 \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.25}{0.45} \approx 0.33 \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(E) \approx (0.2 \cdot 0.15) + (0.5 \cdot 0.85) = 0.03 + 0.425 = 0.455 \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{0.455} \approx 0.066 \]

Note: The estimates for \( P(E) \) slightly differ due to differing assumptions and should be theoretically coherent for full Bayesian analysis. This analysis provides approximate reasoning under common assumptions.
