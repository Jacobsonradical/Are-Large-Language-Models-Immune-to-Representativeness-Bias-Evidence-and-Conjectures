To apply Bayes' theorem to compute the probability of Adam being enrolled in either Computer Science (CS) or Business Administration (BA), we need to determine three key probabilities for each field:  
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing E given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing E given that Adam is not enrolled in that field.

Bayes' theorem is stated as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the evidence E.

Because we do not have the exact values for each probability, we will base our assumptions on general knowledge and reasoning.

### Computer Science (CS)
- **P(H)**: Let's assume the prior probability of a graduate student being enrolled in CS is 0.2.
- **P(E|H)**: Adam's characteristics include high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and enjoys solving puzzles, which align well with CS. Let's assume this probability is 0.6.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: This represents the probability of Adam's characteristics given he is not in CS. Let's assume this to be 0.3 based on the distribution of these traits in other fields.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{0.6 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot (1 - 0.2)} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.24} = \frac{0.12}{0.36} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.33 \]

### Business Administration (BA)
- **P(H)**: Let's assume the prior probability of a graduate student being enrolled in BA is 0.1.
- **P(E|H)**: Adam's strong empathy and appreciation for hard work might be beneficial for BA, but his interest in nature and solving puzzles are less critical. Let's assume this probability is 0.3.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: This represents the probability of Adam's characteristics given he is not in BA. Considering the same general distribution, let's assume this to be 0.4.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.3 \cdot 0.1 + 0.4 \cdot (1 - 0.1)} \approx \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.36} = \frac{0.03}{0.39} \approx \frac{1}{13} \approx 0.077 \]

### Conclusion
Based on these calculations, the probabilities of Adam being enrolled in either computer science or business administration given his personality traits are:

{
  "computer science": 0.33,
  "business administration": 0.077
}
