To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or computer science given the personality sketch \( E \), we need to estimate several probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality given he is enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality given he is not enrolled in that field.

Given Adam's interests and traits (love for nature, plants, animals, puzzles, empathy), we can make educated estimates for these probabilities.

### Business Administration

1. **\( P(H) \):** Business administration is a common field of study in the U.S. for graduate students, but given Adam’s interests, we might consider it less likely than some other fields such as environmental science or biology. Let’s assume a conservative estimate of \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
   
2. **\( P(E|H) \):** Adam’s personality does not strongly match typical business administration students, who might be more focused on business, finance, leadership, and marketing. Given this mismatch, let’s assign \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
   
3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \):** This is the likelihood of observing Adam’s personality given he is not in business administration. Because many other fields fit Adam’s personality better, we can assign a higher probability, say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

Using Bayes’ Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.1}{(0.1 \times 0.1 + 0.5 \times 0.9)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01}{(0.01 + 0.45)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.46} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0217 \]

### Computer Science

1. **\( P(H) \):** Computer science is a popular field of study in the U.S., especially for intelligent individuals with a knack for solving puzzles. Let’s estimate \( P(H) = 0.3 \).
   
2. **\( P(E|H) \):** While computer science matches Adam's intelligence and puzzle-solving aspects, it doesn't perfectly align with his deep empathy and love for nature. Hence, this could be moderately likely: \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).
   
3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \):** Given the broad range of other fields that might fit Adam’s personality, we assign \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

Using Bayes’ Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.3}{(0.3 \times 0.3 + 0.5 \times 0.7)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.09}{(0.09 + 0.35)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.44} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.2045 \]
