To solve this, let's go through the steps one by one for each field of study. We use the following notations:
- \( H \) denotes the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in the specified field.
- \( \neg H \) denotes the hypothesis that Adam was not enrolled in the specified field.
- \( E \) denotes the personality sketch of Adam.

Bayes' theorem tells us that:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant and the same for all fields, we ignore it for relative comparison purposes.

Bayes' theorem simplifies to:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

### Business Administration
- \( P(H_{BA}) \): Prior probability of being enrolled in Business Administration. Let's assume some common sense prior, say 10%.
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in Business Administration.
  - Curiosity about nature and plants: Low relevance.
  - Solving puzzles: Moderate relevance.
  - Warm heart and strong empathy: Relevant for leadership but not unique.
  - Love for animals, high intelligence, abstract concepts: Not particularly relevant.
  - Understanding and appreciation for hard work: Moderately relevant.

  Overall, \( P(E|H_{BA}) \) seems low. Let's assign it a 0.2 for relative comparison.

- \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \): Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not in Business Administration. Assume this to be around 0.8 given his interdisciplinary traits.

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) = 0.2 \times 0.1 = 0.02 \]

### Computer Science
- \( P(H_{CS}) \): Prior probability of being enrolled in Computer Science. Let's assume some common sense prior, say 10%.
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in Computer Science.
  - Curiosity about nature and plants: Moderate relevance for fields like bioinformatics.
  - Solving puzzles: High relevance.
  - Warm heart and strong empathy: Not highly relevant but not irrelevant.
  - Love for animals, high intelligence, abstract concepts: High relevance for intelligence and abstract concepts.
  - Understanding and appreciation for hard work: Relevant but not unique.

  Overall, \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) seems relatively high. Let's assign it a 0.7 for relative comparison.

- \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \): Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not in Computer Science. Assume this to be around 0.8.

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) = 0.7 \times 0.1 = 0.07 \]

### Combining
For the sake of interpretation, we don't need to normalize since we are comparing the probabilities relatively.

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.07
}
```

This suggests that, given Adam's personality traits, it is more likely he was enrolled in Computer Science than in Business Administration.
