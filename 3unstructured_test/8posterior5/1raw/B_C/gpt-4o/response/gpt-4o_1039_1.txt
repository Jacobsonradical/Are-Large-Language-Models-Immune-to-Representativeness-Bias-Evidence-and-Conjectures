To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayesâ€™ rule, we need to determine the following probabilities:

**Bayes' rule:**

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where: 
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.

Assume that \( P(E) \) remains constant for both fields for normalization. Here, we provide estimates based on the given information:

### Business Administration

1. **Judging the priors:**
   - \( P(\text{Business Administration}) = P(H) \):
     Enrollments in business administration programs are quite typical, but doesn't strongly align with Adam's characteristics.
     Estimated value: 0.1
     
2. **Judging the likelihoods:**
   - \( P(E|\text{Business Administration}) \):
     Business students could have varied personalities, but Adam's love for nature, animals, and characteristics like solving puzzles aren't usually the primary focus.
     Estimated value: 0.05
     
   - \( P(E|\neg \text{Business Administration}) \):
     This is generally higher as Adam's characteristics may align better with non-business fields.
     Estimated value: 0.95

### Computer Science

1. **Judging the priors:**
   - \( P(\text{Computer Science}) = P(H) \):
     Enrollments in computer science programs are common, and the field typically attracts individuals with interests similar to Adam's characteristics mentioned.
     Estimated value: 0.2
     
2. **Judging the likelihoods:**
   - \( P(E|\text{Computer Science}) \):
     Adam's traits like high intelligence, solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts fit well with typical computer science students.
     Estimated value: 0.7
     
   - \( P(E|\neg \text{Computer Science}) \):
     This encapsulates other fields where Adam's personality could fit, given his broad interests.
     Estimated value: 0.3

### Calculate Posteriors Using Bayes' Rule

#### Business Administration

\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.005}{P(E)} \]

#### Computer Science

\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.14}{P(E)} \]

Normalize for comparison:

Let \( P(E) = k \) (a constant for comparison purpose):

\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.005}{k} \]

\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.14}{k} \]

Since \( k \) is common across both, we can compare their relative proportions:

\[ \frac{P(\text{Business Administration}|E)}{P(\text{Computer Science}|E)} = \frac{0.005}{0.14} \approx 0.036 \]

Thus, \( P(\text{Business Administration}|E) \) is about 3.6% of \( P(\text{Computer Science}|E) \):

For normalization:

\[
\text{Let } P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = 1 \implies P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = 0.036
\]

So, final estimates might be approximately:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.95
}
```
