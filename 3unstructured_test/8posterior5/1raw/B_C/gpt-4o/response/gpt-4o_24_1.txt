Let's break this down step by step using Bayes' rule.

Bayes' Rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) * P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in the field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of Adam having such a personality sketch given he is in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of Adam having such a personality sketch.

To solve this, we need to estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for both fields, "business administration" and "computer science".

### Business Administration

1. **P(H):** The prior probability of Adam being in business administration. This is typically low as the majority of students might be in other fields.
   \[ P(H_{\text{business}}) \approx 0.1 \]

2. **P(E|H):** The likelihood of observing Adam's personality if he is in business administration. Business administration students might not typically exhibit a deep love for animals or nature (though it's not impossible), but they might have strong empathy and appreciate hard work.
   \[ P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \approx 0.2 \]

3. **P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood of observing Adam's personality if he is not in business administration. This would be the combined likelihood across all other fields.
   \[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}}) \approx 0.8 \]

### Computer Science

1. **P(H):** The prior probability of Adam being in computer science. Given the popularity of computer science, this might be higher.
   \[ P(H_{\text{cs}}) \approx 0.3 \]

2. **P(E|H):** The likelihood of observing Adam's personality if he is in computer science. Computer science students often exhibit high intelligence and an affinity for solving puzzles, which matches Adam's personality well.
   \[ P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \approx 0.6 \]

3. **P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood of observing Adam's personality if he is not in computer science, which we approximate similarly as before.
   \[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}}) \approx 0.7 \]

### Calculation using Bayes' Rule

Now we apply Bayes' rule for both fields.

1. **Business Administration**

\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business}}) * P(H_{\text{business}})}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, let's assume \( P(E) \) remains constant for comparison.

\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{0.2 * 0.1}{0.2 * 0.1 + 0.8 * (1-0.1)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.72} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) \approx \frac{0.02}{0.74} \approx 0.027 \]

2. **Computer Science**

\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) * P(H_{\text{cs}})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{0.6 * 0.3}{0.6 * 0.3 + 0.7 * (1-0.3)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{0.18}{0.18 + 0.49} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) \approx \frac{0.18}{0.67} \approx 0.269 \]

### Final Result

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.027,
  "computer science": 0.269
}
```

These values suggest that based on Adam's personality sketch, it is more likely that he was enrolled in computer science than in business administration.
