Sure, to use Bayes' Rule to find the probability \( P(H|E) \), we need three values: \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Bayes' Rule is:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality given that he was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality given that he was not enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing Adam's personality, which can be described as:
  \[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For simplicity, we'll assume the prior probabilities for enrolling in each field are equal, and abstractly assign values for these, as realistic values would need detailed statistics. 

### Computer Science

1. **P(H):** Prior probability for Computer Science enrollment 
   - We'll assume a rough prior probability: \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.1 \)

2. **P(E|H):** Likelihood of having Adam's characteristics if enrolled in Computer Science
   - Given that Computer Science often attracts people who enjoy puzzles and abstract thinking, though not necessarily nature and plants:
     \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.3 \)

3. **P(E|\neg H):** Likelihood of having Adam's characteristics if not enrolled in Computer Science
   - This would be the average likelihood among all other fields. Let's approximate:
     \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.2 \)

### Business Administration

1. **P(H):** Prior probability for Business Administration enrollment 
   - We'll assume a rough prior probability: \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.1 \)

2. **P(E|H):** Likelihood of having Adam's characteristics if enrolled in Business Administration
   - Business Administration might not particularly attract people with Adam's profile:
     \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.1 \)

3. **P(E|\neg H):** Likelihood of having Adam's characteristics if not enrolled in Business Administration
   - This would be the average likelihood among all other fields. Let's approximate:
     \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.3 \)

Now, we can compute \( P(H|E) \):

### Computer Science:

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be approximated as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{CS})) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.3 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.03 + 0.18 = 0.21 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.21} = \frac{0.03}{0.21} \approx 0.143 \]

### Business Administration:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be approximated as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{BA})) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.01 + 0.27 = 0.28 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.28} = \frac{0.01}{0.28} \approx 0.036 \]

Finally:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.143,
  "business administration": 0.036
}
```

These probabilities reflect the likelihood that Adam is enrolled in either field, given his personality sketch.
