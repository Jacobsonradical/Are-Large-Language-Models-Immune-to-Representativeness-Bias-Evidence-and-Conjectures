To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood for the complement \( P(E|\neg H) \). Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is common across all fields, we can compare the values directly using the numerator of Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Let's assess these quantities for each field:

### Computer Science
- **P(H)**: Prior probability of Adam being in computer science. Given the popularity of computer science, let's assume a moderate prior, say 0.2.
- **P(E|H)**: Likelihood of Adam's personality sketch if he were in computer science. High intelligence and puzzle-solving skills are a good fit, but empathy and deep love for animals might be less typical. Let's estimate it as 0.5.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Likelihood of Adam's personality sketch if he were in other fields. Given Adam's specific traits, they might be more common in other fields. Let's estimate it as 0.4.

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.5 \cdot 0.2 = 0.1 \]

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: Prior probability of Adam being in business administration. This field is also quite common, so let's assume a similar prior, say 0.2.
- **P(E|H)**: Likelihood of Adam's personality sketch if he were in business administration. Traits like empathy and understanding hard work fit, but curiosity about nature and love for animals may not align perfectly. Let's estimate it as 0.3.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Likelihood of Adam's personality sketch if he were in other fields. Since Adam's traits might fit better outside business, let's estimate it as 0.45.

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.3 \cdot 0.2 = 0.06 \]

Now, using these proportional values, we have:

\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) \propto 0.1 \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) \propto 0.06 \]

Normalizing them to fit a comparative scale:

\[ \text{Sum} = 0.1 + 0.06 = 0.16 \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.16} = 0.625 \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.16} = 0.375 \]

Thus:

{
  "computer science": 0.625,
  "business administration": 0.375
}
