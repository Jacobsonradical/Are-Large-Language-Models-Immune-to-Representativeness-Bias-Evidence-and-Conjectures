To compute the probabilities, we need to make educated estimates for each field. We'll use Bayesian reasoning, considering Adam's personality sketch in relation to the typical profiles found in these fields. Here's a step-by-step estimation:

### Assumptions and Estimations:

1. **P(H):** Prior probability of Adam being in each field.
2. **P(E|H):** Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in that field.
3. **P(E|\neg H):** Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is not in that field.

### Business Administration:

- **P(H):** Graduate students commonly study diverse fields, but let's suppose 20% opt for business-related fields.
- **P(E|H):** The personality sketch of Adam aligns moderately with business administration due to empathy and appreciation for hard work, so let's say 0.3.
- **P(E|\neg H):** Given many fields, the likelihood of such a personality sketch if not in this field is about 0.1.

### Computer Science:

- **P(H):** Considering the popularity of computer science, we assume 25% of graduate students are in this field.
- **P(E|H):** Adam's interest in puzzles, abstract thinking, and intelligence is highly relevant to computer science, let's estimate 0.5.
- **P(E|\neg H):** Given the diverse nature of academia, let's set this at around 0.1.

### Bayesian Calculations:

Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

#### Business Administration:

- **P(H|E)** estimation:
    \[ P(E) = (0.3 \times 0.2) + (0.1 \times 0.8) = 0.06 + 0.08 = 0.14 \]
    \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.14} \approx 0.429 \]

#### Computer Science:

- **P(H|E)** estimation:
    \[ P(E) = (0.5 \times 0.25) + (0.1 \times 0.75) = 0.125 + 0.075 = 0.2 \]
    \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.125}{0.2} = 0.625 \]

### Result:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.429,
  "computer science": 0.625
}
```

These values reflect our best estimates based on the given information and reasoning about typical graduate student profiles in the respective fields.
