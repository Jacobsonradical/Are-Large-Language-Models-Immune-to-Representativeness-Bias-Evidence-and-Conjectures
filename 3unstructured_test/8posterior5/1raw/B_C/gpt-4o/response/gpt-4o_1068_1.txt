To apply Bayes' Rule and compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to first evaluate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

### 1. Business Administration
#### Evaluation of Probabilities:
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Let's assume this is moderate because business administration is a common field.
  - \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.2 \)
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is in business administration. Business administration doesn't strongly correlate with a deep love for nature, animals, empathy, or solving puzzles.
  - \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.2 \)
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits regardless of field but excluding business administration. Let's assume the other fields collectively align better with his traits.
  - \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.7 \)

### Application of Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \cdot P(\neg H_{BA}) \]
\[ \neg H_{BA} \text{ implies the probability is divided among many other fields.} \]
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.2) + (0.7 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) \approx (0.04) + (0.56) = 0.60 \]

Therefore,
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.60} = \frac{0.04}{0.60} \approx 0.067 \]

### 2. Computer Science
#### Evaluation of Probabilities:
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science, a common field for graduate students.
  - \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.3 \)
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is in computer science. His intelligence and love for puzzles align well with this field.
  - \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.6 \)
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits excluding computer science. There are other fields that could align but possibly less strongly.
  - \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.6 \)

### Application of Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \cdot P(\neg H_{CS}) \]
\[ \neg H_{CS} \text{ implies the probability is divided among many other fields.} \]
\[ P(E) = (0.6 \cdot 0.3) + (0.6 \cdot 0.7) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.18 + 0.42 = 0.60 \]

Therefore,
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.3}{0.60} = \frac{0.18}{0.60} = 0.3 \]

### Results:

Thus, the calculated probabilities are:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.067,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```
