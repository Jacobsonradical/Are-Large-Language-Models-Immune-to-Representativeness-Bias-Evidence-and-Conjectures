First, let's analyze the probabilities correctly.

### Business Administration
- **P(H_business_admin):** The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration. Grad programs in business admin are fairly common but less aligned with Adam's described characteristics.
  - Let's assign P(H_business_admin) a value: 0.2
- **P(E|H_business_admin):** The likelihood of seeing E given that Adam is enrolled in business administration. Business administration typically doesn't involve direct interaction with nature, empathy for animals, or a deep appreciation for hard work in such an abstract way.
  - Let's assign P(E|H_business_admin) a value: 0.1
- **P(E|¬H_business_admin):** The likelihood of seeing E given that Adam is not enrolled in business administration. This could be anything other than business admin. Since his characteristics align more with other fields, let's assume a higher chance.
  - Let's assign P(E|¬H_business_admin) a value: 0.5

### Computer Science
- **P(H_computer_science):** The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science. Computer science is a fairly common field, and it requires high intelligence and an appreciation for abstract concepts, which aligns with Adam's profile.
  - Let's assign P(H_computer_science) a value: 0.3
- **P(E|H_computer_science):** The likelihood of seeing E given that Adam is enrolled in computer science. Although he might not engage directly with nature and animals, his curiosity, intelligence, and appreciation for solving puzzles fit quite well.
  - Let's assign P(E|H_computer_science) a value: 0.4
- **P(E|¬H_computer_science):** The likelihood of seeing E given that Adam is not enrolled in computer science. Since his traits also fit well with other fields apart from business administration, let's assign a moderate probability.
  - Let's assign P(E|¬H_computer_science) a value: 0.6

Now, we can use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probabilities.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we are not given P(E), we can use the expressions to calculate relative posterior probabilities.

### Business Administration:

\[ P(H_business_admin|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{(0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.5 \cdot 0.8)} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.4} = \frac{0.02}{0.42} \approx 0.048 \]

### Computer Science:

\[ P(H_computer_science|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{(0.4 \cdot 0.3) + (0.6 \cdot 0.7)} = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.42} = \frac{0.12}{0.54} \approx 0.222 \]

Based on this assessment, here is the final answer in the requested format:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.048,
  "computer science": 0.222
}
