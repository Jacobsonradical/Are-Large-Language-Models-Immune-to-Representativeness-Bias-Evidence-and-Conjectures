To estimate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field (business administration and computer science), we need to use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given the hypothesis \( \neg H \) (not enrolled in that specific field).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \).

Since we don't have exact numbers, let's assume some reasonable estimates based on the given personality sketch and general distribution of interests. 

### Business Administration

- **\( P(H)_{\text{BA}} \)**: Around, say \( 0.1 \), assuming there is a wide array of majors and not focusing on one specific field.
- **\( P(E|H)_{\text{BA}} \)**: Moderate likelihood because empathy, understanding abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work do align somewhat but not strongly with business administration. Let's assume \( 0.3 \).
- **\( P(E|\neg H)_{\text{BA}} \)**: Likelihood of the personality sketch being observed in another field. Since there are many other fields that fit this description, let's assume \( 0.2 \).

### Computer Science

- **\( P(H)_{\text{CS}} \)**: Say \( 0.1 \), following the same assumption as above that there are many possible fields.
- **\( P(E|H)_{\text{CS}} \)**: High likelihood because problem-solving, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and a love for nature (possibly linked to AI, computational biology) can align well with computer science. Let's assume \( 0.6 \).
- **\( P(E|\neg H)_{\text{CS}} \)**: Likelihood of the personality sketch being observed in another field. Let’s assume \( 0.2 \) for the same reason as above.

### Calculation

Given Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, assume \( P(E) \) is consistent across fields and use it as a normalizing factor, hence focusing on the numerators:

1. **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} \propto P(E|H)_{\text{BA}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{BA}} = 0.3 \cdot 0.1 = 0.03 \]

2. **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} \propto P(E|H)_{\text{CS}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{CS}} = 0.6 \cdot 0.1 = 0.06 \]

Now we normalize these probabilities to get a proper probability distribution (even though total doesn’t need to sum to 1 when considering only two fields, normalization helps in understanding their relative likelihood):

Sum of proportional probabilities \( 0.03 + 0.06 = 0.09 \).

Normalized:

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} = \frac{0.03}{0.09} \approx 0.333 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} = \frac{0.06}{0.09} \approx 0.667 \]

Thus, the result can be:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.333,
  "computer science": 0.667
}
