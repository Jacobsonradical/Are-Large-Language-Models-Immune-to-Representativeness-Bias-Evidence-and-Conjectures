To apply Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate the probabilities involved.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For each field, we need to:
1. Assess \( P(H) \) – the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
2. Assess \( P(E|H) \) – the probability of observing E given that Adam is in that field.
3. Assess \( P(E|\neg H) \) – the probability of observing E given that Adam is not in that field.
4. Use the above values to calculate \( P(H|E) \) – the probability that Adam is enrolled in the field given his personality sketch.

Let's start with computer science:

1. \( P(H_{CS}) \): The prior probability for computer science. Graduate students in the U.S. have a decent representation in computer science. Let's assume \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.2 \).

2. \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): The likelihood that someone with Adam's personality sketch is in computer science. Quiet, good at solving puzzles, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work are traits that fit computer science well. Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.7 \).

3. \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \): The probability of Adam's traits occurring in other fields. Since there are many fields where these traits are present, let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.4 \).

Now, we calculate \( P(H_{CS}|E) \):

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \cdot P(\neg H_{CS})} \]

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.7 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8} \]

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.14}{0.14 + 0.32} \]

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.14}{0.46} \approx 0.304 \]

Next, for business administration:

1. \( P(H_{BA}) \): The prior probability for business administration. While business administration is a common graduate field, it might be less probable given Adam's traits. Let's assume \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.15 \).

2. \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): The likelihood of these traits in business administration. Adam's traits are less typical but not unheard of in business administration. Let’s estimate \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.3 \).

3. \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \): The probability of Adam's traits occurring in other fields. Given the specific traits, let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.5 \).

Now, we calculate \( P(H_{BA}|E) \):

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \cdot P(\neg H_{BA})} \]

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.15}{0.3 \cdot 0.15 + 0.5 \cdot 0.85} \]

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.425} \]

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.47} \approx 0.096 \]

So, the probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": 0.304,
  "business administration": 0.096
}
