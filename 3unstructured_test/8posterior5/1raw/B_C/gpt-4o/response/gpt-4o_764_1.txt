Sure, let's evaluate the probabilities considering Adam's personality sketch (E) and then apply Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field.

Firstly, let’s assign reasonable prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for Adam being enrolled in each field, as well as \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

### Computer Science
- **P(H)**: Assume there is a likelihood of about 0.2 for any graduate student to be enrolled in computer science.
- **P(E|H)**: Given Adam’s traits such as high intelligence, good at abstract concepts, enjoyment in solving puzzles, and curiosity, it's reasonable to assign a high probability that these traits fit a computer science student—let’s say 0.8.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of having these traits in fields other than computer science (considering a wide range of other fields) might be lower—say, 0.3.

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: Let’s assume there is a likelihood of about 0.1 for any graduate student to be enrolled in business administration.
- **P(E|H)**: Given these traits, which include strong empathy, warm-heartedness, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, the fit is not as strong as computer science but still relevant—let’s say 0.4.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of having these traits in fields other than business administration might be slightly higher due to the broader distribution of such traits—say, 0.35.

Now we apply Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where \( P(E) \) can be calculated as:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

But for simplicity, since we are only comparing two fields and not the whole universe of possible fields, we will use the ratio approach assuming priors combine to 1 and only adjust comparatively.

### For Computer Science:
1. Prior: \( P(H_\text{cs}) = 0.2 \)
2. Likelihood: \( P(E|H_\text{cs}) = 0.8 \)
3. \(\neg H_\text{cs}\):
    - Prior: \( P(\neg H_\text{cs}) = 0.8 \)
    - Likelihood: \( P(E|\neg H_\text{cs}) = 0.3 \)
4. Joint and marginal probabilities:
    - \( P(E \cap H_\text{cs}) = 0.8 \times 0.2 = 0.16 \)
    - \( P(E \cap \neg H_\text{cs}) = 0.3 \times 0.8 = 0.24 \)
    - Total: \( P(E) = 0.16 + 0.24 = 0.4 \)

\[
P(H_\text{cs}|E) = \frac{0.16}{0.4} = 0.4
\]

### For Business Administration:
1. Prior: \( P(H_\text{ba}) = 0.1 \)
2. Likelihood: \( P(E|H_\text{ba}) = 0.4 \)
3. \(\neg H_\text{ba}\):
    - Prior: \( P(\neg H_\text{ba}) = 0.9 \)
    - Likelihood: \( P(E|\neg H_\text{ba}) = 0.35 \)
4. Joint and marginal probabilities:
    - \( P(E \cap H_\text{ba}) = 0.4 \times 0.1 = 0.04 \)
    - Total: Using same \( P(E) = 0.4 \)

\[
P(H_\text{ba}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.4} = 0.1
\]

So, we have the following posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

This calculation shows that given Adam’s personality traits, he is more likely to be enrolled in computer science than in business administration.
