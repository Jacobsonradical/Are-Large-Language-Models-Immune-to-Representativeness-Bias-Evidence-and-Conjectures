To estimate the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field based on his personality sketch, let's compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule for each field. 

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given this, let's analyze the probabilities for each hypothesis \( H \):

### Business Administration:
1. **\( P(H) \)**: This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Since we don't have specific prior information, let's assume a moderate prior, say \( 0.2 \) (You can adjust based on any prior belief you might have).
2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: This is the likelihood that Adam exhibits these personality traits if he were in business administration. Given the nature-related traits and a strong empathy, this seems less likely for a typical business student, so let’s assume \( 0.1 \).
3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is the probability of observing these traits if Adam was not in business administration. Since there are many other fields likely aligning more with his traits (e.g., biology, psychology), let’s assume \( 0.7 \).

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.1 \times 0.2 + 0.7 \times 0.8} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.56} = \frac{0.02}{0.58} \approx 0.0345 \]

### Computer Science:
1. **\( P(H) \)**: Let’s again assume a moderate prior probability, say \( 0.2 \).
2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: This is the likelihood that Adam exhibits these traits if he were in computer science. Since he enjoys solving puzzles and is good at understanding abstract concepts, this seems more likely, so let’s assume \( 0.6 \).
3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is the likelihood of these traits if Adam was not in computer science. Given the overall alignment with various other fields (like biology), let’s assume \( 0.5 \).

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.2}{0.6 \times 0.2 + 0.5 \times 0.8} = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.4} = \frac{0.12}{0.52} \approx 0.2308 \]

### Summary:
{
  "business administration": "0.0345",
  "computer science": "0.2308"
}
