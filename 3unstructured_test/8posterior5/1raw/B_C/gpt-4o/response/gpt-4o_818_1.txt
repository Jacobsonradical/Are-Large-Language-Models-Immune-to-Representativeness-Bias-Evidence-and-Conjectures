To apply Bayes' Theorem, we need to understand each probability involved:

1. \(P(H)\): The prior probability of Adam being in a given field (e.g., computer science, business administration).
2. \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is in a specific field.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in the specific field.
4. \(P(H|E)\): The posterior probability of Adam being in a specific field given his personality sketch.

Since we do not have exact values, we'll make reasonable assumptions based on typical characteristics.

### For Computer Science
- **P(H) (Prior Probability):** Computer science is a popular field, so let's say \(P(H) = 0.2\).
- **P(E|H) (Likelihood):** People in computer science may have high intelligence and enjoy abstract concepts but may not always align with the empathy and love for animals. Therefore, let's assume a moderate likelihood: \(P(E|H) = 0.3\).
- **P(E|\neg H) (Likelihood Invalidity):** People in other fields could also fit Adam's description, so let's set \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.1\).

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.1 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.08} = \frac{0.06}{0.14} \approx 0.4286 \]

### For Business Administration
- **P(H) (Prior Probability):** Business administration is also a common field, so let's assume \(P(H) = 0.15\).
- **P(E|H) (Likelihood):** People in business administration might value empathy and appreciate hard work but may not align strongly with curiosity about nature and solving puzzles. Therefore, we might assign: \(P(E|H) = 0.2\).
- **P(E|\neg H) (Likelihood Invalidity):** Similar as above, let's set \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.1\).

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{0.2 \cdot 0.15 + 0.1 \cdot 0.85} = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.085} = \frac{0.03}{0.115} \approx 0.2609 \]
