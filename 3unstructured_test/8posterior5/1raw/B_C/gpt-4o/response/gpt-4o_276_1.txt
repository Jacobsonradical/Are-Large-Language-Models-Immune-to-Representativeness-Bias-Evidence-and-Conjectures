To solve the problem, we need to use Bayes' Theorem, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam is enrolled in the field given his personality sketch (E).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch (E).

Let's break down the calculation for each field by estimating each component:

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration could be considered fairly common among graduate studies, but perhaps not as high as other fields for someone with Adam's characteristics. Let's assume a prior probability of \( P(BusinessAdministration) = 0.2 \) (i.e., 20%).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given enrollment in business administration. Business typically involves a lot of people skills and extroversion, and is less focused on nature, animals, and puzzles. Therefore, let's estimate \( P(E|BusinessAdministration) = 0.1 \) (i.e., 10%).

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in business administration. There are many other fields where his characteristics could fit well. Let's estimate \( P(E|¬BusinessAdministration) = 0.3 \) (i.e., 30%).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(BusinessAdministration|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

To find \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|BusinessAdministration) \cdot P(BusinessAdministration) + P(E|¬BusinessAdministration) \cdot P(¬BusinessAdministration) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.24 = 0.26 \]

Now plug it back in:

\[ P(BusinessAdministration|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.26} \approx 0.077 \]

### Computer Science

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science could be considered quite common given his interest in puzzles and high intelligence. Let's assume \( P(ComputerScience) = 0.25 \) (i.e., 25%).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given enrollment in computer science. His characteristics align well with traits often found in computer science students. Let's estimate \( P(E|ComputerScience) = 0.7 \) (i.e., 70%).

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in computer science could still be fairly high due to many other compatible fields. Let's estimate \( P(E|¬ComputerScience) = 0.3 \) (same as before).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(ComputerScience|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.25}{P(E)} \]

To find \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|ComputerScience) \cdot P(ComputerScience) + P(E|¬ComputerScience) \cdot P(¬ComputerScience) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.25) + (0.3 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.175 + 0.225 = 0.4 \]

Now plug it back in:

\[ P(ComputerScience|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.25}{0.4} = \frac{0.175}{0.4} = 0.4375 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.077,
  "computer science": 0.4375
}
