To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) that Adam could be enrolled in either business administration or computer science given his personality sketch \( E \), we will use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam having the personality traits \( E \) if he is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of Adam having the personality traits \( E \) if he is not enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of Adam having these personality traits.

Since \( P(E) \) is a constant for comparing different fields, we will focus on \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

### Assumptions:
- Assume prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for business administration and computer science are equal if there is no other information suggesting one field is more likely than the other.
- Assess the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) based on how well Adam's personality fits the typical characteristics for each field.

#### Business Administration:

- **P(H)**: Prior probability. Let's assume a neutral prior because we don't have specific data. We set \( P(H) = 0.5 \).
- **P(E|H)**: Likelihood. Considering Adam’s traits (curiosity about nature, empathy, abstract thinking), these seem less aligned with typical business administration traits which might focus more on leadership, management, and strategy. We can estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Likelihood for not business admin. This would be marginally higher, considering his traits do not perfectly exclude him from other fields. We estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.7 \).

#### Computer Science:

- **P(H)**: Prior probability. Assuming neutral prior: \( P(H) = 0.5 \).
- **P(E|H)**: Likelihood. Considering Adam’s traits such as puzzle-solving, high intelligence, appreciation for hard work, and understanding abstract concepts—these are highly consistent with attributes often seen in computer science students. We estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.7 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood for not computer science would be smaller due to a better match with computer science. Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \).

### Calculations:

- For business administration:
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} \propto P(E|H)_{BA} \cdot P(H)_{BA} \approx 0.3 \times 0.5 = 0.15 \]

- For computer science:
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} \propto P(E|H)_{CS} \cdot P(H)_{CS} \approx 0.7 \times 0.5 = 0.35 \]

Normalization is not strictly needed for comparison purposes, but we acknowledge the higher likelihood for computer science.
