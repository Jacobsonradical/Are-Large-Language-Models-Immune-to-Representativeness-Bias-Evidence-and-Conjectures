To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) through Bayes' Rule, we need the following components:
1. \( P(H) \): Prior probability of Adam being in the given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): Probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is in this field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not in this field.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since the normalizing term \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields and unknown here, we will only compare the relative values of \( P(H|E) \). This means we can simplify to:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

### Analysis

#### Computer Science
1. **P(H)**: There is a relatively high number of students enrolled in computer science.
2. **P(E|H)**: Adam's characteristics align moderately well with computer science:
   - High intelligence: Matches well.
   - Enjoyment of solving puzzles: Matches well.
   - Quiet and curious: These traits don't necessarily exclude this field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: We assume other fields where these traits align might be a high probability too.

#### Business Administration
1. **P(H)**: There is also a high number of students in business administration.
2. **P(E|H)**: Adam's characteristics align moderately but less so than with computer science:
   - Strong empathy and warm heart: Matches to some extent, given the human relation aspect of business.
   - Deep love for animals and nature: Less relevant.
   - Enjoyment of puzzles and high intelligence: Some alignment, but less pronounced.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Assuming still other fields might fit these traits better.

### Probability Assignment

Given the personality traits and the alignment analysis above:

#### Computer Science
- \( P(H) \): 0.3  (reflecting high enrollment and reasonably good fit)
- \( P(E|H) \): 0.4  (traits align well but not uniquely well)

\[ P_{\text{cs}}(H|E) \propto 0.4 \cdot 0.3 = 0.12 \]

#### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): 0.3  (high enrollment but traits fit less well)
- \( P(E|H) \): 0.2  (traits moderately align but not as well as computer science)

\[ P_{\text{ba}}(H|E) \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.3 = 0.06 \]

Thus, comparatively:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.12,
  "business administration": 0.06
}
```
These values reflect that Adam is more likely to be enrolled in computer science compared to business administration, given his personality sketch.
