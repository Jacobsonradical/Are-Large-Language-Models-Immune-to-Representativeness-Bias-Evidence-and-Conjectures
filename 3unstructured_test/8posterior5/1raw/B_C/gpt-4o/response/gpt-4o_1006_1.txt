To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \), then compute \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis (H).

1. **Computer Science**

   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science. Given that computer science is a popular field, we'll assume a moderate prior probability. Let's estimate this as 0.2.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he's a computer science student. While computer science does involve problem-solving and high intelligence, Adam's empathy, love for animals, and nature curiosity are not particularly characteristic of typical computer science students. We'll estimate this as 0.3.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he's not a computer science student. Given that empathy, love for animals, and nature curiosity might indicate fields like environmental science or biology, we'll estimate this as 0.6.
   - \( P(E) \): This is challenging to estimate directly, but for the sake of this exercise, we will use it as a normalization constant. 

   Using Bayes’ rule:
   \[
   P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)}
   \]

2. **Business Administration**

   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration. Business administration is also a popular field, but the personality traits described do not strongly point towards this field. We'll estimate this as 0.1.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he's a business administration student. Given that business administration may not typically involve nature curiosity or empathy for animals, we'll estimate this as 0.1.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Similar to computer science, we'll estimate this as 0.6 because Adam’s personality traits might be indicative of other fields.
   - \( P(E) \): As before, we use this as a normalization constant.

   Using Bayes’ rule:
   \[
   P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)}
   \]

We don't have an exact value for \( P(E) \), but we can still compare relative probabilities:

\[
\text{For Computer Science:} \quad P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.06}{P(E)}
\]
\[
\text{For Business Administration:} \quad P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.01}{P(E)}
\]

Let's normalize these probabilities by considering their sum:

\[
\frac{0.06}{P(E)} + \frac{0.01}{P(E)} = 0.07/P(E)
\]

So,

\[
P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.06/P(E)}{0.07/P(E)} = \frac{0.06}{0.07} \approx 0.86
\]
\[
P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.01/P(E)}{0.07/P(E)} = \frac{0.01}{0.07} \approx 0.14
\]

Thus, the posterior probabilities would be:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.86,
  "business administration": 0.14
}
```
