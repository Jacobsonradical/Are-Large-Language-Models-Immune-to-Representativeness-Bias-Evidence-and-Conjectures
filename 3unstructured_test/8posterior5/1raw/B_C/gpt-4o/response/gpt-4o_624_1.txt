Sure, I'll start by making some reasonable estimations for P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|¬H) for each field, then apply Bayes' rule to compute P(H|E).

**Assumptions:**

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field.
  
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch E fits given that he is enrolled in the field H.
  
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch E fits given that he is not enrolled in the field H.

**Computer Science:**

- **P(H)**: Since computer science is a relatively popular field among graduate students, let's assume a prior probability of 0.2.
- **P(E|H)**: The personality traits such as high intelligence, being good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles are quite compatible with computer science. Let's estimate this at 0.7.
- **P(E|¬H)**: Suppose the likelihood of Adam having these traits but not being in computer science is moderate, at 0.3.

**Business Administration:**

- **P(H)**: Business administration is also a common choice for graduate students. Let's assume a similar prior probability of 0.2.
- **P(E|H)**: Adam's empathy, warmth, and appreciation for hard work might be relevant, but traits like curiosity about nature and love for animals are less directly related. We'll estimate this at 0.4.
- **P(E|¬H)**: Given that the personality sketch is more common in non-business fields, let's estimate the likelihood at 0.6.

Using Bayes' rule: \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \). Since exact P(E) is not given and to simplify, we'll assume it's proportional for each hypothesis.

Performing calculations:

- For Computer Science:
  \[
  P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.7 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.2} 
                                \approx \frac{0.14}{0.14 + 0.08}
                                = \frac{0.14}{0.22}
                                \approx 0.636
  \]
- For Business Administration:
  \[
  P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.7 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.2} 
                                      \approx \frac{0.08}{0.14 + 0.08}
                                      = \frac{0.08}{0.22}
                                      \approx 0.364
  \]

Result:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.636,
  "business administration": 0.364
}
```

These values give a Bayesian estimate of Adam's likelihood of being in each field based on the given personality traits.
