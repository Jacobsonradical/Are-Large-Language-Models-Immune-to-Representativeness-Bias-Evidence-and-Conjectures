To solve this problem using Bayes' rule, we need to set initial probabilities and likelihoods. Let's detail the calculation steps for each field:

1. Define the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field, which represents the overall proportion of students in each field. For simplicity, let's assume equal priors for simplicity (though in practice, these could be informed by data).

2. Define the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), which is the probability of observing personality sketch \( E \) if \( H \) is true (Adam is in that field).

3. Define the likelihoods \( P(E|\neg H) \), which is the probability of observing personality sketch \( E \) given Adam is not in that field.

4. Compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't need to compute \( P(E) \) explicitly for relative comparisons across fields, we can simplify to:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) P(H) \]

Let's assume equal priors \( P(H) = 0.2 \) for both fields, and that \( P(E|\neg H) \) is based on the general distribution of the personality sketch across other fields.

Now estimating the likelihoods:
- For **business administration**, while curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals might indirectly align, strong understanding and appreciation for hard work could be somewhat less indicative.
- For **computer science**, curiosity, problem-solving, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts align closely with typical characteristics.

### Estimation and Calculation

#### Business Administration

- Prior \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.2 \)
- Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1 \) (Assuming less alignment)
- Negation Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.05 \)

#### Computer Science

- Prior \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.2 \)
- Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.5 \) (Assuming strong alignment)
- Negation Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.1 \)

Using Bayesâ€™ rule proportional comparisons:

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.5 \cdot 0.2 = 0.1 \]

Normalization (if we were to use it):

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) + P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = 0.02 + 0.1 = 0.12 \]

Thus,

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.12} \approx 0.83 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.12} \approx 0.17 \]

Putting it in the requested format:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.17,
  "computer science": 0.83
}
```
