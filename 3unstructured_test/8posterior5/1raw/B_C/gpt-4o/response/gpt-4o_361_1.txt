Let's analyze the information and apply Bayes' Rule to compute the required probabilities.

Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence.

We need to estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field.

### Business Administration

#### Estimations:

- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The fraction of graduate students enrolled in business administration programs can be roughly estimated. Let’s assume \( P_{\text{business admin}} = 0.1 \) (10%).

- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The given description of Adam doesn't strongly align with typical characteristics of business administration students (who might be more interested in management, leadership, finance, etc.). Therefore, let's set this to a low value, say \( P(E|H_{\text{business admin}}) = 0.05 \).

- **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Considering the vast number of other fields, this value is the average probability of the evidence occurring across all non-business administration fields. This is higher than \( P(E|H_{\text{business admin}}) \) because Adam's traits might match better with fields like biology, environmental science, or similar. Let's set \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business admin}}) = 0.15 \).

#### Calculation:

By Bayes' Rule:
\[ 
P(H_{\text{business admin}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business admin}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business admin}})}{P(E)} 
\]

Assuming \( P(E) \) is calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ 
P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{business admin}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business admin}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{business admin}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{business admin}})
\]
\[ 
P(E) = 0.05 \cdot 0.1 + 0.15 \cdot 0.9 = 0.05 \cdot 0.1 + 0.135 = 0.14
\]
\[ 
P(H_{\text{business admin}}|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{0.14} = \frac{0.005}{0.14} \approx 0.036
\]

### Computer Science

#### Estimations:

- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The fraction of graduate students enrolled in computer science programs can be roughly estimated. Let’s assume \( P_{\text{computer science}} = 0.2 \) (20%).

- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam’s traits match well with some aspects of computer science students (e.g., high intelligence, problem-solving skills, understanding abstract concepts). So let's set \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.3 \).

- **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: As before, this value is the average probability of the evidence occurring across all non-computer science fields. Let's set \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.10 \).

#### Calculation:

By Bayes' Rule:
\[ 
P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}})}{P(E)} 
\]

Assuming \( P(E) \) is calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ 
P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{computer science}})
\]
\[ 
P(E) = 0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.10 \cdot 0.8 = 0.06 + 0.08 = 0.14
\]
\[ 
P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.14} = \frac{0.06}{0.14} \approx 0.429
\]
