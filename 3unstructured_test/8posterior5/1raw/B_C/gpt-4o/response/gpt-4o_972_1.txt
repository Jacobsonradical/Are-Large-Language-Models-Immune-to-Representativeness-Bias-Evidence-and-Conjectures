To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to follow Bayes' rule, which is expressed as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (that Adam was enrolled in that field).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence (normalized over all possible fields).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis.

Since we are given no specific prior information, we will assume \( P(H) \) to be equal (uniform) for each field. Therefore, we will assume priors \( P(H) = 0.5 \) for simplification, since we're considering only two fields here.

### For Business Administration:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration.
   \[
   P(H) = 0.5
   \]

2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits if he was in Business Administration.
   Given his personality sketch focusing on nature, puzzles, empathy, animals, and high intelligence with abstract concepts, it's unlikely but not impossible for a Business Administration student to have these traits. Therefore:
   \[
   P(E|H) = 0.1
   \]

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of observing these traits if he was NOT in Business Administration.
   Since the personality sketch matches more closely with fields like environmental science, biology, or computer science:
   \[
   P(E|\neg H) = 0.4
   \]

### For Computer Science:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science.
   \[
   P(H) = 0.5
   \]

2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits if he was in Computer Science.
   Given his high intelligence, love for solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts, this is more aligned with a Computer Science student:
   \[
   P(E|H) = 0.6
   \]

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of observing these traits if he was NOT in Computer Science.
   Given the mismatch with Business Administration and potential alignment with other sciences:
   \[
   P(E|\neg H) = 0.2
   \]

### Computing \( P(H|E) \):

#### For Business Administration:
Using Bayes' Rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
Here, \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \) for normalization.

So, for Business Administration:
\[
P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.5) + (0.4 \times 0.5) = 0.05 + 0.2 = 0.25
\]
Then,
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.5}{0.25} = \frac{0.05}{0.25} = 0.2
\]

#### For Computer Science:
Using Bayes' Rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
For Computer Science:
\[
P(E) = (0.6 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) = 0.3 + 0.1 = 0.4
\]
Then,
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.5}{0.4} = \frac{0.3}{0.4} = 0.75
\]

Putting it all together:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.75
}
```
