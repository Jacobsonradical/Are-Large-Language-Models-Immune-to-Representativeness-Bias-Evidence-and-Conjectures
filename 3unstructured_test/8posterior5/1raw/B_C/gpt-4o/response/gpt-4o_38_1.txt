To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Rule, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Define the Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
   - This is the probability of Adam being in a specific field before observing personality sketch \( E \).

2. **Define the Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   - This is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is in the specific field.

3. **Define the Marginal Probability \( P(E) \):**
   - This is the total probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) regardless of the field.

4. **Define the Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   - This is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not in the specific field.

5. **Compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule:**

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant, it's sufficient to compute the numerator for comparison purposes:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

To simplify, we'll make some informed assumptions for each step for both fields.

### Assumptions:
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \) (representing a rough proportion of graduate students in each field):**
   - \( P(H = \text{computer science}) = 0.2 \)
   - \( P(H = \text{business administration}) = 0.1 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)** (based on how well the personality traits fit the field, using a scale from 0 to 1):
   - For computer science: 
     - Adam has high intelligence, abstract thinking skills, and enjoys solving puzzles.
     - \( P(E|H = \text{computer science}) = 0.8 \)
   - For business administration:
     - Adam’s empathy, appreciation for hard work, and dedication could be a fit here.
     - \( P(E|H = \text{business administration}) = 0.4 \)

3. **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)** (based on the overall fit of the personality traits in non-relevant fields):
   - Assuming other fields like environmental biology, psychology, etc., might be a good fit, let’s assume a moderate likelihood:
     - \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \)

Now we compute:

### Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) \propto P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs}) = 0.8 \times 0.2 = 0.16 \]

### Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) \propto P(E|H_{ba}) \cdot P(H_{ba}) = 0.4 \times 0.1 = 0.04 \]

Normalize these values:

\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{0.16}{0.16 + 0.04} = 0.8 \]
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.16 + 0.04} = 0.2 \]

### Final Answer:

{
  "computer science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
