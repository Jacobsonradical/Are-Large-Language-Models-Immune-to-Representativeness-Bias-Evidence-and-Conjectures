First, let's break down the components of Bayes' theorem:

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, for this analysis, we only need to consider the comparative values given for each hypothesis.

Let's assign some reasonable probabilities for P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|¬H) based on the personality sketch of Adam and the general nature of the fields of study:

### Computer Science:
- P(H) (The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science): Suppose that computer science is a relatively common field for graduate students, and considering Adam's high intelligence and abstract thinking, let's assume P(H) = 0.3.
- P(E|H) (The likelihood of observing Adam's personality given that he was in computer science): Adam's genuine curiosity and intelligence fit well with computer science, but his deep love for nature and animals is somewhat less typical. Assume P(E|H) = 0.4.
- P(E|¬H) (The likelihood of observing Adam's personality in other fields): Generally, deep empathy and love for animals seem less common in tech-focused disciplines, so assume P(E|¬H) = 0.2.

### Business Administration:
- P(H) (The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration): Business administration is also a common graduate field, but it often requires more extroverted personality traits, which Adam does not have. Assume P(H) = 0.2.
- P(E|H) (The likelihood of observing Adam's personality given that he was in business administration): Adam's personality with a warm heart and empathy fits well, but his interest in nature and animals is less critical here. Assume P(E|H) = 0.3.
- P(E|¬H) (The likelihood of observing Adam's personality in other fields): His personality is also somewhat less typical in business administration compared to the broader field, so assume P(E|¬H) = 0.25.

Let's compute the posterior probabilities:

### Computer Science
\[ \text{P(H|E)}_{CS} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since P(E) is a normalization constant and is the same for both hypotheses, we can ignore it for the purpose of comparison:

\[ \text{P(H|E)}_{CS} \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ \text{P(H|E)}_{CS} \propto 0.4 \cdot 0.3 \]
\[ \text{P(H|E)}_{CS} \propto 0.12 \]

### Business Administration
\[ \text{P(H|E)}_{BA} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Similarly, ignoring P(E):

\[ \text{P(H|E)}_{BA} \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ \text{P(H|E)}_{BA} \propto 0.3 \cdot 0.2 \]
\[ \text{P(H|E)}_{BA} \propto 0.06 \]

### Normalized Probabilities
To get the final probabilities for comparison, let's normalize:

Sum of unnormalized probabilities = 0.12 + 0.06 = 0.18

\[ \text{P(H|E)}_{CS} = \frac{0.12}{0.18} = 0.6667 \]
\[ \text{P(H|E)}_{BA} = \frac{0.06}{0.18} = 0.3333 \]

Based on these computations, the probabilities are as follows:

{
  "computer science": 0.6667,
  "business administration": 0.3333
}
