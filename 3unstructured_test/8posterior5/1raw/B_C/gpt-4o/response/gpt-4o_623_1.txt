To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \) using Bayes' Rule, we apply the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence, which is calculated by summing over all possible hypotheses. However, for simplicity, considering only the two fields mentioned without normalizing:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

Given that the exact values of \( P(H) \) and \( P(E|H) \) are not explicitly provided in the prompt, I'll make reasonable assumptions based on typical distributions:

1. **Business Administration**
   - Adam’s traits do not strongly align with typical traits sought in business administration, such as leadership, managerial skills, or a focus on economic theory.
   - Prior probability \( P(H)_{\text{biz}} \) could be moderate for a graduate field.
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H)_{\text{biz}} \) could be quite low because the personality traits mentioned fit better into other fields.

2. **Computer Science**
   - Adam’s traits align quite well with computer science, especially his intelligence, problem-solving skills, and love for abstract concepts.
   - Prior probability \( P(H)_{\text{cs}} \) could be relatively higher given the prevalence of students in this field.
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H)_{\text{cs}} \) is relatively high due to the match in traits.

Let's assign some reasonable values:

### Business Administration
- \( P(H)_{\text{biz}} = 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|H)_{\text{biz}} = 0.1 \) 
- \( P(E|\neg H)_{\text{biz}} = 0.4 \)

### Computer Science
- \( P(H)_{\text{cs}} = 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|H)_{\text{cs}} = 0.7 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H)_{\text{cs}} = 0.2 \)

Now compute the posterior probabilities:

### Business Administration
\[ P(E)_{\text{biz}} = P(E|H)_{\text{biz}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{biz}} + P(E|\neg H)_{\text{biz}} \cdot P(\neg H)_{\text{biz}} \]
\[ P(E)_{\text{biz}} = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8 = 0.02 + 0.32 = 0.34 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{biz}} = \frac{P(E|H)_{\text{biz}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{biz}}}{P(E)_{\text{biz}}} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{biz}} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.34} \approx 0.0588 \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(E)_{\text{cs}} = P(E|H)_{\text{cs}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{cs}} + P(E|\neg H)_{\text{cs}} \cdot P(\neg H)_{\text{cs}} \]
\[ P(E)_{\text{cs}} = 0.7 \cdot 0.3 + 0.2 \cdot 0.7 = 0.21 + 0.14 = 0.35 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{cs}} = \frac{P(E|H)_{\text{cs}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{cs}}}{P(E)_{\text{cs}}} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{cs}} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.3}{0.35} = 0.6 \]

Thus:

\[
{
  "business administration": 0.0588,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
\]
