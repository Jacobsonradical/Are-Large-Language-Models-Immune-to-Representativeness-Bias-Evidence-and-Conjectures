Sure, let's start by making an educated guess about the probabilities. Please note that these are illustrative estimates, as precise values would require more specific statistical data. 

### Field: Business Administration
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration. Assuming equal opportunity among many graduate fields, we might estimate this at roughly 1/10 as graduate fields are diverse.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing personality sketch E given that Adam is in business administration. Given Adam's strong empathy, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work, this might not be highly correlated with business students who often focus on finance, leadership, and management. Let's estimate this at 0.2.
- **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing personality sketch E given that Adam is not in business administration. This encompasses all other fields and given the evidence (curiosity about nature, love for animals), it's likely higher. Let's estimate 0.8.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{(0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.8 \cdot 0.9)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.72} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.74} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.027 \]

### Field: Computer Science
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science. Like before, let's assume it's around 1/10.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing personality sketch E given that Adam is in computer science. Attributes like solving puzzles and high intelligence correlate well with this field. Let's estimate this at 0.6.
- **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing personality sketch E given that Adam is not in computer science. This should be higher given the broad spectrum of other fields. Let's estimate 0.65.

Using the same formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.1}{(0.6 \cdot 0.1) + (0.65 \cdot 0.9)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.585} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.645} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.093 \]

Combining these calculations, we get:

{
  "business administration": 0.027,
  "computer science": 0.093
}

These values reflect the likelihoods given the assumptions made about Adam's personality and each specific field. They reveal that, according to our illustrative estimates, it's more likely for Adam to be in computer science than in business administration.
