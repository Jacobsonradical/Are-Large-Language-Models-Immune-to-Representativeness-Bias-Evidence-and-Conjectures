To estimate the probabilities accordingly, we need to use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or business administration.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the evidence given that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or business administration.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of the evidence given that Adam was not enrolled in either field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence.

We will need to make some assumptions and estimate the probabilities based on general knowledge.

### Computer Science:
- **P(H)**: Computer science is a common field in graduate studies. Let’s assume \( P(H) = 0.20 \).
- **P(E|H)**: Given Adam’s intelligence, interest in abstract concepts, puzzles, and quiet disposition, these traits fit someone in computer science quite well. Let’s assume \( P(E|H) = 0.70 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The traits might be found in other fields but less so compared to computer science. Let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.30 \).
- **P(E)**: To simplify the calculation, we’ll use a normalized probability \( P(E) = 1 \) as we're more interested in the relative likelihoods.

\[ P(H|E)_{cs} = \frac{0.70 \cdot 0.20}{1} = 0.14 \]

### Business Administration:
- **P(H)**: Business administration is also a common field. Let’s assume \( P(H) = 0.20 \).
- **P(E|H)**: The traits for Adam fit less perfectly in business administration, which often values extroversion and more direct engagement with people. Let’s assume \( P(E|H) = 0.30 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Since these traits fit less in business administration, they are more likely in other disciplines. Let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.45 \).
- **P(E)**: To simplify the calculation, we’ll use a normalized probability \( P(E) = 1 \).

\[ P(H|E)_{ba} = \frac{0.30 \cdot 0.20}{1} = 0.06 \]

Now, summarizing the results:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.14,
  "business administration": 0.06
}
```

It seems more likely, given Adam's personality sketch, that he was enrolled in computer science compared to business administration.
