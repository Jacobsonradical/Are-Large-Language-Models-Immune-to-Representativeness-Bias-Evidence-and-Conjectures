To apply Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for the hypotheses that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or computer science, we need to consider the following components for each field:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the hypothesis field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch if Adam was enrolled in the hypothesis field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch if Adam was not enrolled in the hypothesis field.

Given the context provided, I will make reasoned assumptions for these values:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - **Hypothesis**: \( H_{ba} \) (Adam was enrolled in business administration)
   - **P(H_{ba})**: Let's assume this to be relatively low, as his personality traits like genuine curiosity about nature, empathy, and deep love for animals are not typically aligned with business administration. Let's set \( P(H_{ba}) \) = 0.05.
   - **P(E|H_{ba})**: The observed personality sketch is less likely for someone in business administration. Let’s assign a lower likelihood, say \( P(E|H_{ba}) \) = 0.1.
   - **P(E|\neg H_{ba})**: This is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch if Adam was in any field other than business administration. Assume it is average, so \( P(E|\neg H_{ba}) \) = 0.4.

   Using Bayes' rule: 
   
   \( P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{ba}) \cdot P(H_{ba})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.05}{0.4} = \frac{0.005}{0.4} = 0.0125 \)

2. **Computer Science**:
   - **Hypothesis**: \( H_{cs} \) (Adam was enrolled in computer science)
   - **P(H_{cs})**: Given Adam's higher intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts, it is somewhat more likely he might be in this field. Let's set \( P(H_{cs}) \) = 0.2.
   - **P(E|H_{cs})**: The personality sketch better matches traits often found in computer science, such as analytical skills and problem-solving abilities. Let’s assign a higher likelihood, say \( P(E|H_{cs}) \) = 0.6.
   - **P(E|\neg H_{cs})**: This is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch if Adam was in any field other than computer science. Assume this to be lower, so \( P(E|\neg H_{cs}) \) = 0.3.

   Using Bayes' rule:
   
   \( P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{0.3} = \frac{0.12}{0.3} = 0.4 \)

Given these calculations:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0125,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

These probabilities show that based on the personality sketch provided, it is much more likely that Adam was enrolled in computer science than in business administration.
