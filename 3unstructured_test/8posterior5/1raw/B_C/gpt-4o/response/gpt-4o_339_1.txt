To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we'll follow these steps:

1. Estimate prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field.
2. Estimate the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of observing the personality sketch given each hypothesis.
3. Estimate the likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \) of observing the personality sketch given the negation of each hypothesis.
4. Use Bayes' rule: 
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} 
   \]

For simplicity, let's assume we're given the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field and the total sum \( P(E) \) which might be consistent across the fields. 
We will then calculate \( P(H|E) \) in a relative manner.

### Business Administration

1. **Prior probability \(P(H)\)**:
   - Assume a typical graduate student pool might have a moderate fraction in this field.
   - \( P(H_{BA}) \approx 0.2 \) (20%)

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**:
   - The personality traits described might be less aligned with a traditional business administration focus, though not impossible.
   - \( P(E|H_{BA}) \approx 0.1 \) (10%)

3. **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)**:
   - We need the combined probability of \( E \) given not being in business administration.
   - Given the specific traits, this could be broader.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \approx 0.01 \) (1%)

### Computer Science

1. **Prior probability \(P(H)\)**:
   - Computer Science is a popular field among graduate students, especially those with a high intelligence and analytical abilities.
   - \( P(H_{CS}) \approx 0.25 \) (25%)

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**:
   - The traits align well with Computer Science, due to the analytical, abstract thinking, puzzle-solving skills.
   - \( P(E|H_{CS}) \approx 0.5 \) (50%)

3. **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)**:
   - We need the combined probability of \( E \) given not being in computer science.
   - Given the specific traits as before, this might be broad but a bit less aligned with CS than with BA.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \approx 0.02 \) (2%)

### Computing Bayes' Rule
Using Bayes' rule:

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} 
\]

We can ignore \( P(E) \) for a relative measure as it's constant across fields.

For Business Administration: 
\[ 
P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \approx 0.02 \, (\text{ignoring} \, P(E)) 
\]

For Computer Science: 
\[ 
P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.25}{P(E)} \approx 0.125 \, (\text{ignoring} \, P(E)) 
\]

Thus, the relative estimates given a constant \( P(E) \):

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.125
}
```

This suggests Adam is more likely to be in computer science based on his personality sketch.
