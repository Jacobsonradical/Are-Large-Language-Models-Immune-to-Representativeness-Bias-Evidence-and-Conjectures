To determine the probabilities \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to make some assumptions about the prior probabilities \(P(H)\), the likelihood \(P(E|H)\), and the evidence \(P(E|\neg H)\). Let's outline the steps clearly here:

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\):** The probability that Adam chose a specific field before considering his personality sketch.
2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\):** The probability of Adam having the traits in the personality sketch if he is indeed in the specific field.
3. **Evidence \(P(E|\neg H)\):** The probability of Adam having the traits in the personality sketch if he is not in the specific field.

Let's assume general prior probabilities of \(P(H)\) for both fields. We'll denote these as follows:
- \(P(H_\text{business administration}) = 0.2\)
- \(P(H_\text{computer science}) = 0.2\)

Now, let's define the likelihood for each field. Given Adam's traits—curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, appreciation for hard work—let's evaluate \(P(E|H)\) subjectively:

- **Business Administration:**
  - Likelihood: Adam's traits are not strongly related to a typical business administration student. Empathy and appreciation for hard work could be relevant, but other traits (e.g., curiosity about nature) are less typical.
  - **Estimate \(P(E|H_\text{business administration})\) = 0.3**

- **Computer Science:**
  - Likelihood: Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts are strongly related to traits often found in computer science students.
  - **Estimate \(P(E|H_\text{computer science})\) = 0.7**

Assuming that the probability of Adam having these traits if he's not in the respective field is equal (or that the ratio of \(P(E|\neg H_\text{business administration})\) to \(P(E|\neg H_\text{computer science})\) is 1):

Let's say \(P(E|\neg H)\) is the same for both fields around 0.1.

Applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For business administration:
\[ P(H_\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]

For computer science:
\[ P(H_\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]

Since \(P(E)\) is the same for both fields, we compare the numerators to find the relative posterior probabilities. Therefore:

For business administration: 
\[ P(H_\text{business administration}|E) = 0.3 \times 0.2 = 0.06 \]

For computer science:
\[ P(H_\text{computer science}|E) = 0.7 \times 0.2 = 0.14 \]

Thus, corrected to maintain values between 0 and 1, we have:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.06,
  "computer science": 0.14
}
