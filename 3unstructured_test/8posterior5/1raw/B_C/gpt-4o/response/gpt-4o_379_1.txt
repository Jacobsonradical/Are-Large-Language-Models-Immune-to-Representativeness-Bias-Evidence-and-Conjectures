Sure! To apply Bayes' Theorem and compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we'll follow these steps:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field without any specific information.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability that the description E fits Adam assuming he was in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability that the description E fits Adam assuming he was not in that field.

Then we use Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assuming that \( P(E) \) (the total probability of E) is constant for comparison purposes, we can focus on \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

### Hypothesis for Business Administration

1. **P(H):** Business Administration is a common field so let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
2. **P(E|H):** The description of Adam's interests and personality seems less likely to fit someone in Business Administration, as this field traditionally focuses more on management, finance, and organizational skills, which are less related to Adam's academic interests and personality traits. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
3. **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of E fitting Adam assuming he is not in Business Administration. Since Business Administration isn't a strong fit, the negation can be broad. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

So, \( P(H|E) \) for Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02 \]


### Hypothesis for Computer Science

1. **P(H):** Computer Science is also a common graduate field. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
2. **P(E|H):** The description of Adam's strong intellect, understanding of abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving skills aligns well with Computer Science. Even though it's not explicitly mentioned, interests in nature and animals do not contradict this field, so let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.5 \).
3. **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of E fitting Adam if he is not in Computer Science. Given the increasing number of fields with interdisciplinary aspects, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

So, \( P(H|E) \) for Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.5 \times 0.2 = 0.1 \]

### Final Calculation Using Bayes' Rule

Even though the total does not need to add up to 1, and since \( P(E) \) is a constant for simplification purposes, we normalize the results if desired:

1. For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.1} = \frac{0.02}{0.12} = \frac{1}{6} \approx 0.167 \]

2. For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.02 + 0.1} = \frac{0.1}{0.12} = \frac{5}{6} \approx 0.833 \]

Hence:

  "business administration": 0.167,
