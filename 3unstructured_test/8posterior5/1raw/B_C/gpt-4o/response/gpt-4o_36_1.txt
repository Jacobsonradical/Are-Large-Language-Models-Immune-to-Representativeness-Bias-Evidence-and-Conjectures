Sure, let's evaluate each hypothesis (H) based on the given personality sketch (E) of Adam:

1. **Business Administration (H)**
   - **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration without knowing his personality sketch. Since there are many fields of study, this value might be relatively low. Let's assume P(H) = 0.1 (10%), as business administration is one of many possible fields.
   - **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is enrolled in business administration. Given his traits like curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy, these traits are not particularly emphasized in business administration. Let's assign a relatively low probability, P(E|H) = 0.2.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in business administration. Given the personality traits that suggest suitability for fields connected to nature, animals, and intelligence, this might be higher. Let's assume P(E|\neg H) = 0.8.

2. **Computer Science (H)**
   - **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science. Given Adam's traits like high intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles, let's assume a slightly higher prior, P(H) = 0.2 (20%).
   - **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing his personality sketch if he is enrolled in computer science. Traits like high intelligence, problem-solving, and abstract thinking can align well with this field. Let's assign a higher probability, P(E|H) = 0.6.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing his personality sketch given that he is not in computer science. Since his personality could fit other fields well too, let's assume a moderate probability, P(E|\neg H) = 0.5.

Now let's calculate P(H|E) using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

### Business Administration:
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \times 0.1) + (0.8 \times 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.72 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.74 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{0.74} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.74} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.027 \] (or 2.7%)

### Computer Science:
\[ P(E) = (0.6 \times 0.2) + (0.5 \times 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.40 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.52 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.2}{0.52} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.52} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.231 \] (or 23.1%)

Thus, the results in the required format are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.027,
  "computer science": 0.231
}
```
