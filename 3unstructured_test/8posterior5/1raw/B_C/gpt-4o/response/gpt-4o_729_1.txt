To use Bayes' rule effectively, we need to estimate the probabilities as described. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we don't have \( P(E) \), we'll use a proportional approach to compare hypotheses. We need to consider:

- \( P(H) \): Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the specified field without any additional information (before considering his personality sketch).
- \( P(E|H) \): Probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is not enrolled in that field.

For simplicity, let's assume \( P(H) \) is the same for each field initially (since the field distribution is not provided, assume uniform priors).

Given Adam's personality sketch, we can infer the following probabilities for each hypothesis:

### Computer Science:
- \( P(H) \): Let's assume a prior probability of 0.1 (since we are assuming uniform distribution among around 10 possible fields).
- \( P(E|H) \):
  - High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts align with computer science.
  - Enjoys solving puzzles.
  - However, a deep love for nature and animals may be less indicative.
  - Overall, say this probability is moderate to high, \( P(E|H) \approx 0.7 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \):
  - Given the mixed interests and other possible fields, letâ€™s say this is moderate, \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \).

### Business Administration:
- \( P(H) \): Assume the same prior probability of 0.1.
- \( P(E|H) \):
  - High intelligence can be relevant.
  - Appreciation for hard work and dedication aligns with business administration.
  - However, empathy and love for nature and animals are less directly related.
  - Overall, say this probability is moderate, \( P(E|H) \approx 0.4 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \):
  - Similar rationale as above fields, \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \).

Using Bayes Rule proportionally:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

So:

- For Computer Science:
  \[ P(H|E) \propto 0.7 \times 0.1 = 0.07 \]

- For Business Administration:
  \[ P(H|E) \propto 0.4 \times 0.1 = 0.04 \]

We then normalize these (proportional values don't need exact normalization here):

The proportional probabilities are:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.07,
  "business administration": 0.04
}
```

This suggests that based on the given information, Adam is more likely to be enrolled in computer science than business administration.
