To answer this question, we need to analyze the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in each specific graduate field, based on his personality traits, and use Bayes' theorem to update our beliefs.

Let's break down the steps to calculate \( P(H|E) \) for both fields:

1. **Base Rate \( P(H) \)**:
   - \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in each field before considering the personality sketch.
   - Let's assume the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field is equal. Hence, for simplicity, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.5 \) for each field, knowing that this would not sum to 1 across all possible fields of study.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - This is the probability of observing the evidence \( E \) (Adam's personality sketch) given that he is enrolled in the specified field \( H \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - This is the probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that he is not enrolled in the specified field.

4. **Posterior Probability \( P(H|E) \)**:
   - Using Bayes' theorem: 
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   - Since \( P(E) \) (the marginal likelihood of the evidence) is the same for both fields, it will cancel out when comparing the two posterior probabilities.

### Computer Science
- \( P(H) \) = 0.5
- Given Adam's traits:
  - Computer science involves solving abstract puzzles, and typically requires high intelligence and dedication, aligning well with Adam's traits.
- \( P(E|H) \) for Computer Science could be considered quite high, let's say 0.7.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) would be somewhat high but not as high, let's approximate it as 0.5.

\[
P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.5}{P(E)} = 0.35/P(E)
\]

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \) = 0.5
- Given Adam's traits:
  - Business Administration typically involves people skills and management, which is somewhat less aligned with Adamâ€™s interest in nature and abstract puzzle solving.
- \( P(E|H) \) for Business Administration might be lower, let's say 0.3.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) would similarly be less aligned, let's approximate it as 0.5.

\[
P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.5}{P(E)} = 0.15/P(E)
\]

Given these conditional probabilities, we can compare the posterior probabilities proportionately:

### Proportional Likelihoods
- Computer Science: \( 0.35/P(E) \)
- Business Administration: \( 0.15/P(E) \)

Normalizing these probabilities:

\[
P(\text{Computer Science}|E) \approx \frac{0.35}{0.35 + 0.15} = \frac{0.35}{0.5} = 0.7
\]
\[
P(\text{Business Administration}|E) \approx \frac{0.15}{0.35 + 0.15} = \frac{0.15}{0.5} = 0.3
\]

So, our final approximate probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
