To answer this question, we'll need to consider the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in computer science (CS) or business administration (BA) based on the description provided in the personality sketch (E).

Assumptions:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the personality sketch given Adam is in a specific field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the personality sketch given Adam is not in that specific field.
- \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability of Adam being in the specific field given the personality sketch (what we're trying to compute).

Given the sketch:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - **P(H)**: Let's assume, based on general statistics, that the probability of a random graduate student being in CS is relatively high compared to many other fields. So let's assume \( P(\text{CS}) \approx 0.2 \).
   - **P(E|H for CS)**: High intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and a curiosity can fit well with CS, even if his love for nature and animals is less common in this field. So let's say \( P(E|\text{CS}) = 0.4 \).
   - **P(E|\neg H for CS)**: To simplify, assume equal distribution over non-CS fields. As 80% of graduate students are not in CS and assuming uniform distribution among these fields for simplicity, let's approximate this as \( P(E|\neg \text{CS}) = 0.2 \).

2. **Business Administration**:
   - **P(H)**: The prior for BA can be assumed lower than CS due to less alignment with Adamâ€™s interests in abstract concepts and nature. Let's assume \( P(\text{BA}) \approx 0.1 \).
   - **P(E|H for BA)**: The fit of his personality sketch with BA seems less strong. Curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals are less typical in BA. So let's assume \( P(E|\text{BA}) = 0.1 \).
   - **P(E|\neg H for BA)**: Similarly, for simplicity, we consider an equal distribution among non-BA fields, \( P(E|\neg \text{BA}) = 0.2 \).

To use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

For **Computer Science**:

\[ \begin{aligned}
P(\text{CS}|E) &= \frac{0.4 \times 0.2}{(0.4 \times 0.2) + (0.2 \times 0.8)} \\
&= \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.16} = \frac{0.08}{0.24} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.33
\end{aligned} \]

For **Business Administration**:

\[ \begin{aligned}
P(\text{BA}|E) &= \frac{0.1 \times 0.1}{(0.1 \times 0.1) + (0.2 \times 0.9)} \\
&= \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.18} = \frac{0.01}{0.19} \approx 0.053
\end{aligned} \]

So, the posterior probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": 0.33,
  "business administration": 0.053
}
