To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes Rule, we'll follow these calculative steps:

1. Establish the prior probability \( P(H) \), which is the probability of Adam being enrolled in each field before considering his personality sketch.
2. Determine \( P(E|H) \), the probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in a particular field.
3. Determine \( P(E|\neg H) \), the probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in that particular field.
4. Apply Bayes Rule: 
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Given the limited information and to maintain a manageable complexity, let's assume uniform priors, assigning equal initial probabilities to each field. These might be adjusted based on real-world data or further context, but assuming uniformity simplifies the problem.

### Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \)**:
   Let's start with an assumption of equal probability among all graduate fields, but we provide more weight to STEM fields for their proportion in overall graduate studies:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.2
   \]
2. **Probability of the Evidence Given Computer Science \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \)**:
   - Adam's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts fits well with computer science (CS).
   - Curiosity, problem-solving (puzzles), and a quiet demeanor may also align well with CS.
   - However, empathy and love for animals are not strong indicators for or against.
   Based on this alignment:
   \[
   P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.7
   \]
3. **Probability of the Evidence Given Not Computer Science \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \)**:
   - Considering many graduate fields might share these personality traits, let's estimate:
   \[
   P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.3
   \]
4. **Application of Bayes Rule**:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{CS}})}
   \]
   \[
   P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.7 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.14}{0.14 + 0.24} = \frac{0.14}{0.38} \approx 0.368
   \]

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \)**:
   - We again start with an assumption of equal probability:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1
   \]
2. **Probability of the Evidence Given Business Administration \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \)**:
   - While Adam's intelligence and understanding align fairly well, his strong empathy and warm heart are more correlated with fields involving social interactions.
   - However, the curiosity about nature, love for plants/animals, and problem-solving aren't strong indicators for Business Administration.
   Based on these:
   \[
   P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.3
   \]
3. **Probability of the Evidence Given Not Business Administration \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \)**:
   - The traits align broadly with many non-BA fields (STEM especially), so we estimate:
   \[
   P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.35
   \]
4. **Application of Bayes Rule**:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{BA}})}
   \]
   \[
   P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.3 \cdot 0.1 + 0.35 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.315} = \frac{0.03}{0.345} \approx 0.087
   \]

Final probabilities:
