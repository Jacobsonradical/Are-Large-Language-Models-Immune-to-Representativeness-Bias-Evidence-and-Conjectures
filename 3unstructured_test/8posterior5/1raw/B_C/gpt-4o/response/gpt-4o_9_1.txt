To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we'll use Bayes' rule. Let's denote the relevant probabilities:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability that Adam's personality sketch \( E \) fits given he is enrolled in the field \( H \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability that Adam's personality sketch \( E \) fits given he is not enrolled in the field \( H \).

Bayes' Rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields, we only need to compute the numerator for each field to compare them.

For simplicity, let's initially assume the following priors for \( P(H) \):
- \( P(business\ administration) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(computer\ science) = 0.3 \)
  
These are subjective priors based on general knowledge of graduate field enrollments which could be updated with better data if available.

Next, let's gauge \( P(E|H) \) based on the fit of the personality sketch \( E \) for each field:

1. **Business administration:**
   - The personality sketch describes Adam as having a strong curiosity about nature and animals, being quiet, empathetic, and intelligent.
   - While business administration students can be intelligent and empathetic, the strong curiosity about nature and love for animals are less immediately relevant to this field.
   - Therefore, \( P(E|business\ administration) = 0.2 \).

2. **Computer science:**
   - The sketch describes Adam as enjoying solving puzzles and being good at understanding abstract concepts, traits which are very relevant to computer science.
   - Therefore, \( P(E|computer\ science) = 0.7 \).

Finally, since we might assume there are many fields not listed that could also be considered, let's use an approximate baseline \( P(E|\neg H) \):

- \( P(E|\neg H_{business\ administration}) = 0.5 \)
   - This represents the likelihood that Adam’s personality fits a field other than business administration.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{computer\ science}) = 0.4 \)
   - This represents the likelihood that Adam’s personality fits a field other than computer science.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(business\ administration|E) = \frac{P(E|business\ administration) \cdot P(business\ administration)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(computer\ science|E) = \frac{P(E|computer\ science) \cdot P(computer\ science)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for each field, we can compare the numerators for ranking purposes:

### Business Administration:
\[ Numerator = P(E|business\ administration) \cdot P(business\ administration) = 0.2 \cdot 0.2 = 0.04 \]

### Computer Science:
\[ Numerator = P(E|computer\ science) \cdot P(computer\ science) = 0.7 \cdot 0.3 = 0.21 \]

Given these results, we can infer that \( P(business\ administration|E) \) and \( P(computer\ science|E) \) should be comparable in relative terms:

### Final Estimates:
\[
\{
  "business administration": \frac{0.04}{0.04+0.21} \approx 0.16,
  "computer science": \frac{0.21}{0.04+0.21} \approx 0.84
\}
\]

{
  "business administration": "0.16",
  "computer science": "0.84"
