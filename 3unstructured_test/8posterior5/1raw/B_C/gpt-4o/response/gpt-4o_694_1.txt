Sure, let's assign initial probabilities (P(H)) and conditional probabilities (P(E|H) and P(E|\neg H)) before computing the posterior probabilities (P(H|E)) using Bayes' Rule.

1. **Computer Science**:
   - P(H) (Initial probability that Adam was in computer science): Let's assume it to be 0.15 (since computer science is a fairly common field, especially for highly intelligent individuals).
   - P(E|H) (Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was in computer science): Given Adam's love for solving puzzles and high intelligence, let's assign it 0.4.
   - P(E|\neg H) (Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was not in computer science): Since other fields might also attract individuals like Adam, let’s assign it 0.2.

Using Bayes' Rule \[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.4 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.06 + 0.17 = 0.23 \]

Now, compute \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.15}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.23} \approx 0.2609 \]

2. **Business Administration**:
   - P(H) (Initial probability that Adam was in business administration): Let's assume it to be 0.1 (as it’s also a common field but perhaps less aligned with Adam's traits).
   - P(E|H) (Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was in business administration): Given Adam’s warm heart and strong empathy, let’s assign this 0.15.
   - P(E|\neg H) (Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was not in business administration): Let’s assume it to be 0.25.

Using Bayes' Rule \[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.15 \cdot 0.1 + 0.25 \cdot 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.015 + 0.225 = 0.24 \]

Now, compute \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.15 \cdot 0.1}{0.24} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.015}{0.24} = 0.0625 \]

Summarizing the results:
{
  "computer science": 0.2609,
  "business administration": 0.0625
}
