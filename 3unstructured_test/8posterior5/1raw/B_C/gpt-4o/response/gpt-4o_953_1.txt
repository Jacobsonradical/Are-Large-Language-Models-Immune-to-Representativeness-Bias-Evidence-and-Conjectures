To calculate \( P(H|E) \) (the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch), we will use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's denote:
- \( P(CS) \) as \( P(H) \) for computer science
- \( P(BA) \) as \( P(H) \) for business administration
- \( P(E|CS) \) as \( P(E|H) \) for computer science
- \( P(E|BA) \) as \( P(E|H) \) for business administration
- \( P(E|\neg CS) \) as \( P(E|\neg H) \) for computer science
- \( P(E|\neg BA) \) as \( P(E|\neg H) \) for business administration

Our goal is to compute:
\[ P(CS|E) \]
\[ P(BA|E) \]

First, let's estimate these probabilities:

### Computer Science

**Prior Probability, \( P(CS) \):**
Graduate programs in computer science are quite common compared to other fields.
\[ P(CS) = 0.2 \]
    
**Probability of E given H (\( P(E|CS) \)):**
Given that Adam has a strong understanding of abstract concepts and high intelligence, it is somewhat likely he would fit into a computer science program, which bridges abstract problem-solving and technical skills.
\[ P(E|CS) = 0.3 \]

**Probability of E given not H (\( P(E|\neg CS) \)):**
If Adam is not in computer science, he still might possess these traits depending on another field that values intelligence and abstract thinking.
\[ P(E|\neg CS) = 0.2 \]

### Business Administration

**Prior Probability, \( P(BA) \):**
Graduate programs in business administration are also quite common, but possibly slightly less among people with Adam's described traits.
\[ P(BA) = 0.1 \]

**Probability of E given H (\( P(E|BA) \)):**
Business administration generally values different traits than those highlighted in Adam's sketch, such as leadership and business acumen.
\[ P(E|BA) = 0.05 \]

**Probability of E given not H (\( P(E|\neg BA) \)):**
If Adam is not in business administration, the likelihood of fitting the personality description might be expected in other fields.
\[ P(E|\neg BA) = 0.3 \]

To apply Bayes' rule, we also need \( P(E) \). However, because we are comparing relative probabilities, we can leverage:
\[ P(E) = P(E|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(E|\neg CS) \cdot P(\neg CS) = P(E|BA) \cdot P(BA) + P(E|\neg BA) \cdot P(\neg BA) \]

Calculations for \( P(CS|E) \):

\[ P(CS|E) = \frac{P(E|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(CS|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.06}{P(E)} \]

Calculations for \( P(BA|E) \):

\[ P(BA|E) = \frac{P(E|BA) \cdot P(BA)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(BA|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.005}{P(E)} \]

Since we are looking at relative probabilities, the actual value of \( P(E) \) is not essential. Therefore, we can compare:
\[ \frac{ P(CS|E) }{ P(BA|E) } = \frac{0.06}{0.005} = 12 \]

So, in relative probability terms:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.12,
  "business administration": 0.01
}
```

To sum up, it is more likely that Adam was enrolled in a computer science program compared to a business administration program, given his personality sketch.
