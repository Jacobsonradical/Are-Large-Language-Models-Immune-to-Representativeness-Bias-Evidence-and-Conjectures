To estimate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field given Adam's personality sketch \( E \), we first need to estimate the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihoods \( P(E|\neg H) \). While exact values cannot be determined without more specific data, reasonable estimates can be made based on the provided personality sketch.

**Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \):**

1. **Business Administration**: This is generally a popular field but less likely for someone with Adam's traits (e.g., genuine curiosity about nature, deep love for animals). Therefore, \( P(H) \) might be low.
2. **Computer Science**: Given Adam's interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence, this suggests a higher probability, but still one of many possible graduate fields. Therefore, \( P(H) \) might be moderate.

**Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \):**

1. **Business Administration**: Given the personality sketch, it seems less likely, but not impossible. A person with empathy and appreciation for hard work could also pursue business. Thus, \( P(E|H) \) is low.
2. **Computer Science**: The traits align well with interests in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts. Hence, \( P(E|H) \) is relatively high.

**Likelihoods \( P(E|\neg H) \):**

1. **Business Administration**: Given the personality sketch, it is likely that many other fields (e.g., biology, environmental science) might fit better. Thus, \( P(E|\neg H) \) could be higher.
2. **Computer Science**: Similar reasoning applies. Many other fields could fit the traits provided. Thus, \( P(E|\neg H) \) is moderate.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that \( P(E) = P(H) \cdot P(E|H) + P(\neg H) \cdot P(E|\neg H) \):

**Estimates (These are qualitative and not precise numbers):**
- Let's denote \( P(H) \) for Business Administration as 0.1 and for Computer Science as 0.3.
- Let's denote \( P(E|H) \) for Business Administration as 0.2 and for Computer Science as 0.6.
- Let's denote \( P(E|\neg H) \) for Business Administration as 0.5 and for Computer Science as 0.4.

For **Business Administration**:
\[ P(E) \approx P(H) \cdot P(E|H) + P(\neg H) \cdot P(E|\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.9 \cdot 0.5 \]

\[ P(E) \approx 0.02 + 0.45 = 0.47 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.47} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.47} \approx 0.043 \]

For **Computer Science**:
\[ P(E) \approx P(H) \cdot P(E|H) + P(\neg H) \cdot P(E|\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.3 \cdot 0.6 + 0.7 \cdot 0.4 \]

\[ P(E) \approx 0.18 + 0.28 = 0.46 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.3}{0.46} \approx \frac{0.18}{0.46} \approx 0.391 \]

So, the output would be:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.043,
  "computer science": 0.391
}
