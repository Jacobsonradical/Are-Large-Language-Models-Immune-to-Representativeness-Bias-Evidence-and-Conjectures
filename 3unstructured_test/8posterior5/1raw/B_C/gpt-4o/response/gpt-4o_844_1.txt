To apply Bayes' rule in this context and compute the probabilities, we need to quantify our initial assessments. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of H (the field in question).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing E given H.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing E.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing E given not H.

Let's assign some values based on the provided personality sketch and typical characteristics associated with students in the given fields:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability of being in computer science. Considering the wide popularity of computer science among graduate students, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that a person like Adam, with his traits, would be in computer science. Given his high intelligence and love for solving puzzles, this seems reasonably high. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that a person like Adam, with his traits, would be in any other field. Since his qualities are not exclusive to computer science but are valuable in many fields, let's set \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).
   - \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing E. This is a normalization constant and can be computed, but for simplicity, we only need to focus on the ratio for comparison. So, let's approximate with the same denominator for both fields.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability of being in business administration. This field is reasonably common among graduates, but slightly less tech-focused. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that a person like Adam, with his traits, would be in business administration. While his empathy and appreciation for hard work can be valuable, the interest in nature and puzzles may be less directly related. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Similar to above, \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Using these values in Bayes' rule:

For **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

For **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is common for comparison:

\[ P(H|E)_{CS} \approx 0.14 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} \approx 0.06 \]

The relative probabilities (normalized for convenience) are approximately:

{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
