To apply Bayes' rule and calculate the probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch (E), we need to evaluate the following probabilities for each hypothesis (H):

1. **P(H)** - The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.
2. **P(E|H)** - The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in the field.
3. **P(E|¬H)** - The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in the field.

Then we use Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assuming \( P(E) \) (the overall probability of observing the personality sketch) is constant for all fields, we can focus on the relative scales instead of the exact values. Here's a plausible evaluation:

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)**: Let's assume a typical probability for enrolling in business administration for a graduate student is moderate. Say, 0.2.
2. **P(E|H)**: Given Adam’s personality sketch, it seems less aligned with business administration, which often emphasizes leadership, collaboration, and strategy. Let's assume a low probability: 0.1.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: Given the broad range of other fields, it's likely that many other fields align better with his personality: let's assume 0.8.

Using Bayes' rule relative scaling:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E_{\text{business}}) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

### Computer Science
1. **P(H)**: Let's assume a typical probability for enrolling in computer science is moderate. Say, 0.2.
2. **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's interest in puzzles, high intelligence, appreciation for abstract concepts, and quiet nature, these traits fit well with typical characteristics of computer science students. Let's assume a higher probability: 0.7
3. **P(E|¬H)**: Like before, given the broad range of other fields, let's assume 0.8.

Using Bayes' rule relative scaling:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E_{\text{computer\_science}}) \propto 0.7 \cdot 0.2 = 0.14 \]

Using these relative scales, we derive the following probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.14
}
```

Note: These values are relative to each other and do not account for the normalization factor \( P(E) \), the overall probability of observing the personality sketch, which is constant across the fields being considered here. The exact values could be different if more precise data were available, but these provide a relative approximation based on the given traits.
