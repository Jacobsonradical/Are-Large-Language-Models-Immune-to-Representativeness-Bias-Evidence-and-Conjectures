To calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' theorem, we need to evaluate the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E|\neg H) \). Here's my reasoning for each field:

### Assumptions:
1. **Prior probabilities \( P(H) \):**
   - Let's denote prior probabilities based on enrollment proportions in general graduate programs. These are hypothetical values: 
     - Business Administration: \( P(H) = 0.1 \)
     - Computer Science: \( P(H) = 0.2 \)
     - Other fields: \( P(\neg H) = 0.7 \) 

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   - Business Administration: Likely values for a person fitting Adam's description in this field might be lower because he seems more inclined towards nature, animals, and puzzles rather than the business aspects.
     - \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1 \)
   - Computer Science: Likely values might be higher due to his affinity for puzzles, intelligence, and abstract concepts.
     - \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.3 \)

3. **Evidence \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   - Estimate the probability of Adam having the described personality sketch if he was in another field. Let's estimate this value to balance the assumptions.
     - \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \) 

### Bayes' Theorem Calculation:
Bayes' theorem states that:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) \) can be broken down as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{BA}})P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E|H_{\text{CS}})P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
Thus:
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.2) + (0.1 \cdot 0.7) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.01 + 0.06 + 0.07 = 0.14 \]

Computing for each field:

### Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.14} = \frac{0.01}{0.14} \approx 0.0714 \]

### Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.14} = \frac{0.06}{0.14} \approx 0.4286 \]

Hence, our results can be summarized as:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0714,
  "computer science": 0.4286
}
```
