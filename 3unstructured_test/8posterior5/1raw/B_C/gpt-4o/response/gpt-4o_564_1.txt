To compute the probabilities, we will use Bayes' Rule, which states that:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given the personality sketch \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in a specific field \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the field \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \), which serves as a normalization constant.

We can simplify our calculation by focusing on the ratios and relative values, as exact probabilities would require extensive data collection.

### Computer Science
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability, assuming no other information, can be considered moderate as Computer Science is a common graduate field.
  
2. **P(E|H)**: Given the personality sketch, Adam's abstract thinking and high intelligence align well with Computer Science, but his strong empathy and love for animals are less typical.
  
3. **P(E|¬H)**: Considering the other fields, personalities fitting the description may be more common in fields such as biology, ecology, or veterinary sciences.

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability can be considered moderate as Business Administration is also a common graduate field.
  
2. **P(E|H)**: Business Administration students may have high intelligence and appreciation for hard work, but the characteristics of empathy, love for animals, and nature curiosity are less typical.
  
3. **P(E|¬H)**: Again, characteristics fitting the description may be more common in other fields such as biology or environmental sciences.

Given these considerations, the values are subjective estimates:

{
  "computer science": 0.25,
  "business administration": 0.10
}

These values reflect a moderate likelihood of Adam being in Computer Science based on his abstract thinking, but lower for Business Administration as his empathy and nature curiosity less align with typical traits needed in that field. These are relative estimates and should be adjusted with more specific data if available, and should be normalized if used in the context where total needs to sum to 1.
