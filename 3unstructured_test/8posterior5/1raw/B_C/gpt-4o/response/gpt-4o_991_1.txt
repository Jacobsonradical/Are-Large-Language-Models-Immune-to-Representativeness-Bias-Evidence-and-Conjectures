To compute the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\) through Bayes' Rule, we need the prior probability \(P(H)\), the likelihood \(P(E|H)\), and the probability of the evidence without the hypothesis \(P(E| \neg H)\).

Bayes' Rule can be stated as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E| \neg H)P(\neg H) \)

Assuming we don't have specific prior information on the fields, we can assign a reasonable guess for \(P(H)\) for each field. Let's assume a uniform prior probability for simplicity, though in practice, this might be different.

Let us begin with the field of business administration based on the traits described:

### Business Administration
1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**:
   - Prior probability might be lower given Adam's curiosity about nature as business administration isn't strongly associated with nature.
   - Assume \(P(H) = 0.1\).

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**:
   - Likelihood of having Adam's traits in business might not be very high given his nature-focused interests.
   - Assume \(P(E|H) = 0.2\).

3. **Probability of Evidence \(P(E| \neg H)\)**:
   - Assume more common among other fields especially those more aligned with nature.
   - Assume \(P(E| \neg H) = 0.8\).

### Computer Science
1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**:
   - Slightly higher due to his intelligence and abstract thinking, though not exclusively fitting his nature-centric traits.
   - Assume \(P(H) = 0.2\).

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**:
   - Higher likelihood given problem-solving nature and intelligence, though curiosity about nature is less directly related.
   - Assume \(P(E|H) = 0.7\).

3. **Probability of Evidence \(P(E| \neg H)\)**:
   - Also high but likely less than when not focusing on computer science.
   - Assume \(P(E| \neg H) = 0.6\).

Computing \(P(E)\):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E| \neg H)P(\neg H) \]

For **business administration**:
\[ P(E) = 0.2 \times 0.1 + 0.8 \times 0.9 = 0.02 + 0.72 = 0.74 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{0.74} = \frac{0.02}{0.74} \approx 0.027 \]

For **computer science**:
\[ P(E) = 0.7 \times 0.2 + 0.6 \times 0.8 = 0.14 + 0.48 = 0.62 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.2}{0.62} = \frac{0.14}{0.62} \approx 0.226 \]

By this computation, we have the posterior probabilities for the hypotheses:

{
  "business administration": 0.027,
  "computer science": 0.226
}
