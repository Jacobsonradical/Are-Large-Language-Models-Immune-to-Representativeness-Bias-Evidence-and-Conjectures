To calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each given field, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \), we will make some informed estimations for the sake of this calculation, using the personality sketch provided.

Let's make reasonable assumptions for the probabilities:
1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's characteristics given that he is in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's characteristics given that he is not in that field.

### Assumptions and Estimates

**Computer Science:**
- \( P(H) \): Since computer science is a common field, let's assume \( P(\text{computer science}) \approx 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Considering Adam's high intelligence, love for puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts, there's a good fit. Let's assume \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \approx 0.8 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Since these characteristics could be reasonably common in other fields too, let's assume \( P(E|\neg \text{computer science}) \approx 0.2 \).

**Business Administration:**
- \( P(H) \): Business administration is also a common field, so \( P(\text{business administration}) \approx 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Considering his love for animals, empathy, and nature, it is less likely for him to be in business administration. Thus \( P(E|\text{business administration}) \approx 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Same as before, since Adam's characteristics are less aligned, \( P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) \approx 0.3 \).

### Bayes' Theorem Calculation

**For Computer Science:**
- \( P(H) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \)
- Let \( P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.2) + (0.2 \times 0.8) = 0.16 + 0.16 = 0.32 \)

\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.2}{0.32} = \frac{0.16}{0.32} = 0.5 \]

**For Business Administration:**
- \( P(H) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \)
- Let \( P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.2) + (0.3 \times 0.8) = 0.02 + 0.24 = 0.26 \)

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.26} = \frac{0.02}{0.26} \approx 0.077 \]

### Final Result

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.077
}
```

These calculations suggest that, given the personality sketch provided, Adam is more likely to be enrolled in computer science rather than business administration.
