To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, we'll need to use Bayes' rule, which is stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We must assign values to \( P(H) \) (the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field), \( P(E|H) \) (the likelihood of Adam having the personality sketch given he is enrolled in a particular field), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) (the likelihood of Adam having the personality sketch given he is not enrolled in that particular field). 

Then, we'll use these to compute \( P(H|E) \).

### 1. Business Administration

#### Prior Probability \( P(H) \)
Let's assume a prior probability for Adam being in business administration. This can be roughly estimated based on general prevalence in graduate programs:

\[ P(H_{\text{business}}) \approx 0.2 \] 

#### Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)
Given Adam's personality sketch, it seems less likely that his deep curiosity about nature and love for animals would align strongly with business administration. However, his high intelligence and appreciation for hard work are relevant skills:

\[ P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \approx 0.3 \]

#### Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)
This would represent how common the personality sketch would be in those not in business administration. Given the abstract qualities and empathy, let's assume it is:

\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}}) \approx 0.5 \]

#### Posterior Probability Using Bayes Rule
Given that specific \( H \) (business admin):

\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{business}}) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.8 = 0.06 + 0.4 = 0.46 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.46} \approx 0.130 \]

### 2. Computer Science

#### Prior Probability \( P(H) \)
Let's assume a prior probability for Adam being in computer science, possibly higher than business administration given the high enrollment rates:

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.3 \]

#### Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)
Given Adam's appreciation for understanding abstract concepts and his interest in puzzles, computer science seems very relevant:

\[ P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.8 \]

#### Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)
How common this personality sketch would be among those not in computer science might be:

\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.4 \]

#### Posterior Probability Using Bayes Rule
Given that specific \( H \) (computer science):

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 + 0.4 \cdot 0.7 = 0.24 + 0.28 = 0.52 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.3}{0.52} \approx 0.462 \]

Here are the calculated posterior probabilities:

{
  "business administration": "approximately 0.130",
  "computer science": "approximately 0.462"
