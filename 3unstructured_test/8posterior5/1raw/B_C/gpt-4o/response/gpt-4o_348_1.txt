Firstly, let us assess the probabilities for each field based on the given personality sketch of Adam and general knowledge about these fields. 

### Business Administration

**P(H):** The prior probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in business administration. Since this is quite a common field, we might assign it a relatively higher generic prior, say 0.2.

**P(E|H):** The probability that Adam's personality sketch is accurate given that he is enrolled in business administration. A graduate in business administration might sometimes have an appreciation for hard work and dedication, but less commonly does this field heavily align with a deep love for nature, animals, solving puzzles, or abstract concepts. Thus, let's estimate it as 0.05.

**P(E|¬H):** The probability that Adam's personality sketch fits someone not enrolled in business administration. Given Adam's traits, he fits quite well into other fields more aligned with an appreciation for nature, empathy, and academia. So P(E|¬H) might be relatively high, perhaps 0.4.

Applying Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.2}{0.05 \times 0.2 + 0.4 \times 0.8} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.32} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.33} \approx 0.0303\]

### Computer Science

**P(H):** The prior probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in computer science. Computer Science is also very popular, though probably a bit less common than business administration. Let's assign it a moderate prior, say 0.15.

**P(E|H):** The probability that Adam's personality sketch is accurate given that he is enrolled in computer science. Given that Adam enjoys solving puzzles, has high intelligence, and understands abstract concepts, this fits relatively well with a computer science student. Let's estimate it as 0.3.

**P(E|¬H):** The probability that Adam's personality sketch fits someone not enrolled in computer science. There are various fields Adam could fit into, so let's retain the same 0.4 as we used for business administration.

Applying Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.15}{0.3 \times 0.15 + 0.4 \times 0.85} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.34} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.385} \approx 0.1169\]

Thus, the answers for the fields given are as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0303,
  "computer science": 0.1169
}
