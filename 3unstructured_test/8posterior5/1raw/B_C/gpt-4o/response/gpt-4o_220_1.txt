To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the probabilities \( P(H) \) (prior probability of each field), \( P(E|H) \) (likelihood of the personality sketch given the field), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) (likelihood of the personality sketch given not being in that field).

Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant, we technically don't need to directly calculate it for comparing probabilities across different hypotheses.

### Computer Science

- **P(H) (prior probability for computer science)**: Moderate given the wide range of specializations in graduate studies.
- **P(E|H) (likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given computer science)**: Moderate to high because Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with computer science.
- **P(E|\neg H) (likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given not computer science)**: Moderate, since the traits can apply to various fields.

\[ P(H|E)_{CS} \approx \frac{0.2 \times 0.6}{0.5} = 0.24 \]

### Business Administration

- **P(H) (prior probability for business administration)**: Moderate given the wide range of specializations.
- **P(E|H) (likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given business administration)**: Low to moderate because Adam's love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles doesn't strongly correlate with business administration.
- **P(E|\neg H) (likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given not business administration)**: Moderate to high since the traits seem to align more with other fields than with business administration.

\[ P(H|E)_{BA} \approx \frac{0.2 \times 0.3}{0.5} = 0.12 \]

Summarizing the answers:
{
  "computer science": 0.24,
  "business administration": 0.12
