To compute the probability of Adam being enrolled in either computer science or business administration given his personality sketch (E), we need to evaluate the following probabilities: \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for both fields. We will then apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Here's a rough estimation of each value:

1. **Computer Science**
   - \( P(H) \) (the prior probability Adam is in computer science): Let's assume computer science is a popular field among graduate students, say around 0.15.
   - \( P(E|H) \) (the likelihood of Adam's personality given he is in computer science): 
     - High intelligence: common in computer science
     - Enjoying solving puzzles: common in computer science
     - Quiet: not unusual in computer science
     - Curiosity about nature and plants: less typical
     - Empathy and love for animals: less typical
     Given this mix, let's estimate this as approximately 0.4.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \) (the likelihood of Adam's personality given he is not in computer science): Let's assume a weaker fit overall due to specific traits favoring other fields. Estimate this at around 0.2.

   Calculations:
   - \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.15}{0.4 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85} = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.17} = \frac{0.06}{0.23} \approx 0.26 \)

2. **Business Administration**
   - \( P(H) \) (the prior probability Adam is in business administration): Assume a moderate popularity, say around 0.1.
   - \( P(E|H) \) (the likelihood of Adam's personality given he is in business administration): 
     - High intelligence: common in business administration
     - Enjoying solving puzzles: less typical in business administration
     - Quiet: not unusual but not predominating
     - Curiosity about nature and plants: less typical 
     - Empathy and love for animals: less typical 
     Given this, estimate this as approximately 0.2.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \) (the likelihood of Adam's personality given he is not in business administration): Similar to above. Estimate this at around 0.2.

   Calculations:
   - \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{0.2 \times 0.1 + 0.2 \times 0.9} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.18} = \frac{0.02}{0.2} = 0.1 \)

Putting it all together:

{
  "computer science": 0.26,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
