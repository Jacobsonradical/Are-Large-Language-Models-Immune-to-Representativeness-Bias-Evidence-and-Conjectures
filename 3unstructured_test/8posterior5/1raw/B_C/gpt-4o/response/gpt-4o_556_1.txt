Sure, let's apply Bayes' Rule to compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in each field based on his personality sketch \(E\).

Bayes' Rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in the specific field.

We will make some reasonable assumptions about these probabilities given the personality sketch:

1. **For Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability might be considered moderate as many students opt for this field, so let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Considering Adam's characteristics such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy, these traits might be less common among business administration students, so let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Since there are many other fields, and assuming that his characteristics are common in other sciences (like biology), let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

2. **For Computer Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): Computer Science is a popular field, so we could assign a higher prior, say \( P(H) = 0.3 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's interest in puzzles and high intelligence might suit this field, but his empathy and love for nature are less aligned, so let's assign \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): As before, considering there are many fields where his traits may better fit, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

To find \( P(E) \), we use the Total Probability Theorem:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's calculate it for each field independently.

### For Business Administration:
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) = 0.02 + 0.24 = 0.26 \]

Thus, applying Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.26} = \frac{0.02}{0.26} \approx 0.077 \]

### For Computer Science:
\[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.3) + (0.2 \cdot 0.7) = 0.09 + 0.14 = 0.23 \]

Thus, applying Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.3}{0.23} = \frac{0.09}{0.23} \approx 0.391 \]

Therefore, the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.077,
  "computer science": 0.391
}
```

These values reflect our reasonable assumptions and the application of Bayes' rule based on the given personality sketch of Adam.
