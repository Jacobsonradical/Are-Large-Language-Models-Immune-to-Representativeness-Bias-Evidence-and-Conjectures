Let's go through the process of estimating \( P(H|E) \) for each field using the information we have.

### Computer Science

1. **P(H) - Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science:** 
   Without any specific information about Adam's preferences or background, we might assume an equal probability distribution across a number of common graduate fields. Thus, we might assign a moderate prior. Let's assume:

   \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.2 \)

2. **P(E|H) - Probability that Adam has the given traits assuming he is in Computer Science:**

   - Intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts: High probability.
   - Enjoys solving puzzles: High probability.
   - Quiet and a strong empathy with a deep love for animals: Not strongly indicative.
   - Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants: Not strongly indicative.
   - Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication: Likely.

   Overall, those traits somewhat align with a Computer Science profile. Let's assign a value:

   \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.6 \)

3. **P(E|¬H) - Probability that Adam has the given traits assuming he is not in Computer Science:**

   This encompasses all other fields, some of which might also align well with these traits, given that empathy and a love for animals might fit fields like biology, psychology, etc. Let's estimate this at a moderate level:

   \( P(E|¬H_{CS}) = 0.4 \)

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]

Given that:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|¬H_{CS}) \cdot P(¬H_{CS}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.6 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8 = 0.12 + 0.32 = 0.44 \]

So:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{0.44} \approx 0.2727 \]

### Business Administration

1. **P(H) - Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration:** 
   Similarly, we might assume:

   \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.2 \)

2. **P(E|H) - Probability that Adam has the given traits assuming he is in Business Administration:**

   - Intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts: Moderate probability.
   - Enjoys solving puzzles: Moderate probability.
   - Quiet and a strong empathy with a deep love for animals: Not strongly indicative.
   - Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants: Low probability.
   - Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication: Likely.

   Overall, these traits do not strongly align with a Business Administration profile. Let's use:

   \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.3 \)

3. **P(E|¬H) - Probability that Adam has the given traits assuming he is not in Business Administration:**

   This is the same as calculated previously for \( non-CS \):

   \( P(E|¬H_{BA}) = 0.4 \)

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]

Given that:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|¬H_{BA}) \cdot P(¬H_{BA}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8 = 0.06 + 0.32 = 0.38 \]

So:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.38} \approx 0.1579 \]

### Result:

{
  "computer science": 0.2727,
  "business administration": 0.1579
}
