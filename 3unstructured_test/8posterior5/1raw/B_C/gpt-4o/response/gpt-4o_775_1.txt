To use Bayes' rule to calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). However, we can simplify by calculating \( P(H|E) \) using proportional values because our model only compares two fields.

Let’s assess each field:

### Computer Science (CS)
- **P(H) (Prior Probability):**
  Based on the information provided, a prior probability could be assumed, let’s say average.
  \[
  P(H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.2
  \]

- **P(E|H) (Likelihood):**
  Adam’s traits fit well with the field of computer science. Strong problem-solving skills, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and the appreciation for hard work and dedication align well with a CS major.
  \[
  P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.7
  \]

- **P(E|\neg H) (Likelihood of E given he is not in CS):**
  For fields other than CS, Adam's traits fit reasonably but less so.
  \[
  P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.3
  \]

### Business Administration (BA)
- **P(H) (Prior Probability):**
  Similarly, prior probability is assumed average for BA.
  \[
  P(H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.2
  \]

- **P(E|H) (Likelihood):**
  Adam’s traits do not align as well with business administration, which often emphasizes social interaction, leadership, and management skills over appreciation of nature and strong empathy for animals.
  \[
  P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.2
  \]

- **P(E|\neg H) (Likelihood of E given he is not in BA):**
  Given the traits, other fields may fit better.
  \[
  P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.5
  \]

### Bayes' Rule
Bayes' rule says:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

However, since we compare two fields proportionally:
\[
P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} \propto P(E|H_{\text{CS}})P(H_{\text{CS}})
\]

\[
P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} \propto P(E|H_{\text{BA}})P(H_{\text{BA}})
\]

By comparing proportional values:

\[
P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}})P(H_{\text{CS}})}{ P(E|H_{\text{CS}})P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|H_{\text{BA}})P(H_{\text{BA}}) }
\]

\[
P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}})P(H_{\text{BA}})}{ P(E|H_{\text{CS}})P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|H_{\text{BA}})P(H_{\text{BA}}) }
\]

Using approximate values for relative comparison:

\[
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto 0.7 \times 0.2 = 0.14
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \propto 0.2 \times 0.2 = 0.04
\]

By normalizing these:

\[
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.14}{0.14+0.04} \approx 0.78
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.14+0.04} \approx 0.22
\]

### Final Output

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.78,
  "business administration": 0.22
}
```
These values indicate the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field, given his personality traits.
