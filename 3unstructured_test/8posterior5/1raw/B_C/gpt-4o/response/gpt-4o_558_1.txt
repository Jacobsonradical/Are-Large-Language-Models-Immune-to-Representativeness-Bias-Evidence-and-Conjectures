Sure, let's start by evaluating some initial probabilities and conditional probabilities. Please note these values are based on general assumptions and typical scenarios:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the given field without knowing his personality sketch. This is typically based on how common these fields are among graduate students in the U.S.

   - Business Administration: Let's assume the prior probability P(H) is 0.2.
   - Computer Science: Let's assume the prior probability P(H) is 0.3.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch E given Adam is in the given field.

   - Business Administration: Given the personality sketch describing curiosity about nature, abstract thinking, empathy, and puzzles, let's assume that P(E|H) is 0.1 for business administration. These traits are not highly typical for that field.
   - Computer Science: Given the intelligence, problem-solving, and understanding of abstract concepts, let's assume P(E|H) is relatively high, say 0.5 for computer science, as these traits are more aligned with the field.

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch E given Adam is not in the given field.

   For simplicity, let's assume P(E|¬H) is constant across other graduate fields not specified and more or less similar for both fields:
   - P(E|¬H) is 0.2.

Now, let's compute P(H|E) using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \(P(E)\) is the total probability of observing the evidence across all fields:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|H_{O}) \cdot P(H_{O}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.5 \cdot 0.3) + (0.2 \cdot (1 - 0.2 - 0.3)) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.15 + 0.1 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.27 \]

Now, let's apply this to our specific fields:

- Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.27} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx 0.074 \]

- Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.3}{0.27} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \approx 0.556 \]

So, based on the personality sketch and the given assumptions, the posterior probabilities are approximately:

{
  "business administration": 0.074,
  "computer science": 0.556
}
