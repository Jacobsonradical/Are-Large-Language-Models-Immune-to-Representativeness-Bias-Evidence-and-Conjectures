To use Bayes' rule, we need to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field based on Adam's personality sketch (E). Bayes' rule is defined as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the fields of "business administration" and "computer science," we will make some educated assumptions based on the information provided:

### Business Administration:

1. **P(H) (Prior Probability) for Business Administration:**
   Let's assume the prior probability of Adam studying business administration is relatively moderate but not overly high, say 0.1 (10%).

2. **P(E|H) (Likelihood) for Business Administration:**
   The likelihood of a student in business administration having Adam's traits might be moderate. Business administration might not typically attract people with a keen interest in nature, solving puzzles, and a strong love for animals. So, let's estimate P(E|H) to be around 0.3 (30%).

3. **P(E|¬H) (Likelihood of not being in Business Administration):**
   The likelihood of not being in business administration for someone with these traits might be higher since these traits could align more commonly with other fields, such as natural sciences. We estimate P(E|¬H) to be around 0.6 (60%).

\[ \text{Business Administration} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

### Computer Science:

1. **P(H) (Prior Probability) for Computer Science:**
   The prior probability of Adam studying computer science can be considered relatively high due to the increasing number of students in this field nowadays. Let's say this is around 0.2 (20%).

2. **P(E|H) (Likelihood) for Computer Science:**
   Solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts are strongly aligned with attributes beneficial in computer science. Hence, we can estimate P(E|H) to be around 0.7 (70%).

3. **P(E|¬H) (Likelihood of not being in Computer Science):**
   The likelihood of not being in computer science given these traits is lower, reflecting how well the traits fit computer science, so we might estimate this to be around 0.4 (40%).

\[ \text{Computer Science} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

### Calculating P(E):

To fully calculate \( P(H|E) \), we need the overall probability \( P(E) \), the total probability of the evidence, which is the weighted sum of likelihoods over all possible fields:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}}) + P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + \ldots \]

However, for unique fields and simplification, if we assume these are the primary fields in consideration:

\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}}) + P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \(cd P(H_{\text{CS}}) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.3 \cdot 0.1 + 0.7 \cdot 0.2 = 0.03 + 0.14 = 0.17 \]

### Final Posterior Calculation:

1. **Business Administration:**

\[ P(\text{business}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.17} \approx 0.176 \]

2. **Computer Science:**

\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.17} \approx 0.824 \]

So, we get:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.176,
  "computer science": 0.824
}
```

These values reflect that given Adam's personality traits and the field's characteristics, it is more likely he is enrolled in computer science than in business administration.
