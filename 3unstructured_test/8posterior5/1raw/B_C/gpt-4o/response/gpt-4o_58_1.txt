Sure, let's go step by step to compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule. Here's the formula we'll use:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both hypotheses, it can be ignored for comparative purposes. Instead, we will focus on \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)** (Prior probability of Adam enrolling in Business Administration): Graduate students in Business Administration are fairly common, but considering Adam has a strong inclination towards nature, animals, and abstract concepts, this might be slightly lower.

   \[ P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.15 \] 

2. **P(E|H)** (Probability of Adam's personality traits given he is in Business Administration): People in Business Administration might be curious and intelligent, but the strong empathy, love for nature, and preference for solving puzzles are less characteristic.

   \[ P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.2 \]

3. **P(E|\neg H)** (Probability of Adam's personality traits given he is not in Business Administration): Given the above, people outside Business Administration might better fit Adamâ€™s profile.

   \[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.5 \]

### Computer Science

1. **P(H)** (Prior probability of Adam enrolling in Computer Science): The interest in solving puzzles, high intelligence, and abstract thinking aligns well with Computer Science.

   \[ P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.25 \]

2. **P(E|H)** (Probability of Adam's personality traits given he is in Computer Science): The personality sketch fits more naturally with someone studying Computer Science.

   \[ P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.6 \]

3. **P(E|\neg H)** (Probability of Adam's personality traits given he is not in Computer Science): This might be lower since Computer Science is a strong match for Adam's profile.

   \[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.3 \]

### Computing Posteriors

#### Business Administration
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \approx  \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} = \frac{0.03}{P(E)} \]

#### Computer Science
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \approx  \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.25}{P(E)} = \frac{0.15}{P(E)} \]

Since these are for comparative purposes, we can ignore \( P(E) \):

\[ \text{Relative probability for Business Administration:} \, 0.03 \]
\[ \text{Relative probability for Computer Science:} \, 0.15 \]

Now, let's normalize:

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.15} = \frac{0.03}{0.18} =  \frac{1}{6} \approx 0.167 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.15}{0.03 + 0.15} = \frac{0.15}{0.18} =  \frac{5}{6} \approx 0.833 \]

The answers are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.167,
  "computer science": 0.833
}
```
