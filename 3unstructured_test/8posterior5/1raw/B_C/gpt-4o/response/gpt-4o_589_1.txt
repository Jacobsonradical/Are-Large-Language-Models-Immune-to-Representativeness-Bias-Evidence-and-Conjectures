To solve this problem, we first need to define our probabilities:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing the personality sketch of Adam given that he is enrolled in a specific field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of observing the personality sketch of Adam given that he is NOT enrolled in that specific field.
4. **P(H|E)**: The posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field given the personality sketch.

Next, I'll give my estimated probabilities and then apply Bayes' Rule.

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration. Since we don't have specific prior probabilities, I'll assume a baseline to start with. For simplicity, I'll assume equal priors for graduate students among common fields.
   - P(H) ≈ 0.1 (This is arbitrary but reasonable assuming there are many graduate fields)

2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing E if H is true.
   - Given Adam's personality (curiosity about nature, quiet, enjoys puzzles, high intelligence, etc.), it seems less typical for a business administration student. Therefore, let's assume it's relatively low.
   - P(E|H) ≈ 0.05

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of E given that H is not true.
   - This depends on how well Adam's traits fit non-business administration fields. Since his traits might align more with fields like biology or environmental science (E|\neg H might be more probable than E|H), let's estimate this.
   - P(E|\neg H) ≈ 0.2

Now we apply Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.05 \times 0.1) + (0.2 \times 0.9) = 0.005 + 0.18 = 0.185 \]

Then,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.1}{0.185} \approx 0.027 \]

### Computer Science

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam enrolling in computer science.
   - Assume a baseline similar to business administration due to lack of specificity.
   - P(H) ≈ 0.1

2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing E if H is true.
   - Given Adam's traits (enjoys puzzles, high intelligence, abstract concepts), computer science seems a more likely fit.
   - P(E|H) ≈ 0.3

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of E given that H is not true.
   - As before for business administration, assume general likeliness of personality traits fitting non-CS fields.
   - P(E|\neg H) ≈ 0.2

Applying Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(E) = (0.3 \times 0.1) + (0.2 \times 0.9) = 0.03 + 0.18 = 0.21 \]

Then,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.1}{0.21} \approx 0.143 \]

Thus, the estimated posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.027,
  "computer science": 0.143
}
```
