Sure, let's evaluate the probabilities for both computer science and business administration using the given information.

### Computer Science

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science before considering the evidence.
    - Since computer science is a common graduate field, let's assume a moderate prior probability, say 0.2.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
    - Computer science students are often curious and intelligent, appreciating problem-solving and abstract concepts. However, they might not necessarily have a strong connection with nature and animals. Still, it is not impossible.
    - Let's estimate this as 0.4.

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was not enrolled in computer science.
    - This involves all other fields. Since this personality sketch fits well with many other fields (like biology), we could set this higher.
    - Let's estimate this as 0.6.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.6 \cdot 0.8} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.48} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.56} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{1}{7} \approx 0.143 \]

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration before considering the evidence.
    - Business administration is another common field. Let's assume a moderate prior, 0.2.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
    - Students in business administration might not typically be associated with deep curiosity about nature and animals or solving abstract puzzles. This seems less likely.
    - Let's estimate this as 0.1.

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was not enrolled in business administration.
    - This is the same as above, for all other fields.
    - Let's estimate this as 0.6.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.6 \cdot 0.8} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.48} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.50} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{1}{25} = 0.04 \]

### Conclusion

Therefore, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.143,
  "business administration": 0.04
}
