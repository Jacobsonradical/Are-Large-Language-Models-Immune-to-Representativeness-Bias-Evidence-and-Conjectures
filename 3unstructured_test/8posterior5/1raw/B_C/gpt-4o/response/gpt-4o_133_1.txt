To evaluate the probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field based on his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' Rule. Here's the step-by-step process for each field:

1. **P(H)**: Probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in the field.
2. **P(E|H)**: Probability of the personality sketch \(E\) given the field \(H\).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability of the personality sketch \(E\) given it is not the field \(H\).

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we can simplify the comparison by only considering the relative likelihoods, as we don't have the exact value for \(P(E)\). For the sake of simplification, we'll assume the priors to be roughly equal for different fields, but you can adjust these based on actual enrollment statistics.

### For Business Administration:
- **P(H)**: Assume an arbitrary prior. Let's set \(P(H)\) roughly equal for both fields for simplicity. So, \(P(H) \approx 0.1\), (assuming business administration is moderately common).
- **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's strong ecological and empathetic traits and his quiet, analytical personality, it might be less likely he'd choose business administration, which often emphasizes interpersonal skills and leadership.
  - **Estimate**: Low. Let's assign a value of 0.05.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability of the personality sketch outside business administration. Assuming the rest are equally likely, for simplicity, let's take 0.6.

### For Computer Science:
- **P(H)**: Assume an arbitrary prior. Roughly equal. Set \(P(H) \approx 0.1\) as computer science is a common field.
- **P(E|H)**: Adam's traits (intelligence, fondness for puzzles, abstract thinking) highly align with computer science.
  - **Estimate**: High. Let's assign it 0.9.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability of the personality sketch outside computer science. Let's use 0.3, given fewer fields are aligned than in.

Now, computing the values using Bayes' Rule (ignoring \(P(E)\) for relative comparison):

### Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.05 \times 0.1}{P(E)} = 0.005 / P(E) \]

### Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.9 \times 0.1}{P(E)} = 0.09 / P(E) \]

Normalization isn't required as we're only comparing the relative likelihoods. Thus, the probabilities don't need to add up to 1 over these two specified fields.

Therefore, in relative terms:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.005,
  "computer science": 0.09
}
```

This suggests that it is far more likely Adam was enrolled in computer science compared to business administration based on his personality sketch.
