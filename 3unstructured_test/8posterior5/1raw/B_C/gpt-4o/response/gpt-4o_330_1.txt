To determine the probabilities of Adam being enrolled in different fields of study based on his personality sketch, we will use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is formulated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis being true.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence given that the hypothesis is true.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence given that the hypothesis is false.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the evidence.

Let's estimate the probabilities for each field:

### Business Administration (H₁)

1. **Prior probability, \( P(H₁) \):**
   - Assume that the likelihood of any given graduate student being in Business Administration is relatively moderate, but not specific to Adam's interests: \( P(H₁) = 0.15 \).

2. **Likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis, \( P(E|H₁) \):**
   - Since Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, empathy, and a love for animals, it seems less likely he would be drawn to a business-focused field.
   - He is more inclined towards abstract concepts and environments that align with his interests in solving puzzles and nature: \( P(E|H₁) = 0.05 \).

3. **Likelihood of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis, \( P(E|\neg H₁) \):**
   - Considering other fields, it seems more natural that fields in sciences or humanities align better with Adam’s traits: \( P(E|\neg H₁) \approx 0.1 \).

### Computer Science (H₂)

1. **Prior probability, \( P(H₂) \):**
   - Computer Science is a popular field with a broad range of applications. We'll give it a similar base rate as Business Administration: \( P(H₂) = 0.15 \).

2. **Likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis, \( P(E|H₂) \):**
   - Adam’s love for solving puzzles and abstract thinking fits particularly well with Computer Science.
   - Also, high intelligence and a methodical approach match well: \( P(E|H₂) = 0.3 \).

3. **Likelihood of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis, \( P(E|\neg H₂) \):**
   - Given that many STEM fields, such as natural sciences and engineering, entertain similar characteristics (but not solely): \( P(E|\neg H₂) = 0.1 \).

Now, using Bayes' Theorem for each field:

### Business Administration (H₁)
\[ P(H₁|E) = \frac{P(E|H₁) \times P(H₁)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H₁) \times P(H₁) + P(E|\neg H₁) \times P(\neg H₁) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.05 \times 0.15 + 0.1 \times (1-0.15) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.0075 + 0.085 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.0925 \]

\[ P(H₁|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.15}{0.0925} \]
\[ P(H₁|E) \approx 0.081 \]

### Computer Science (H₂)
\[ P(H₂|E) = \frac{P(E|H₂) \times P(H₂)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H₂) \times P(H₂) + P(E|\neg H₂) \times P(\neg H₂) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.3 \times 0.15 + 0.1 \times (1-0.15) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.045 + 0.085 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.13 \]

\[ P(H₂|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.15}{0.13} \]
\[ P(H₂|E) \approx 0.35 \]

Finally, we can represent the results in the requested format:

  "business administration": 0.081,
