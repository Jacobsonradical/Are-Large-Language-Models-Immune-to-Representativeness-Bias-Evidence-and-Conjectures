Let's break this down step by step to compute \( P(H|E) \) for each of the fields using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

In this context:
- \( H \) is the hypothesis that Adam is in a specific field (either business administration or computer science).
- \( E \) is the evidence, which is the personality sketch of Adam.
- \( \neg H \) represents all other potential fields Adam could be enrolled in.

We need to estimate the following for each field:
1. \( P(H) \) - the prior probability that Adam could be in that field, given no other information.
2. \( P(E|H) \) - the probability that Adam's personality sketch fits if he were in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - the probability that Adam's personality sketch fits if he were not in that field (this includes all other fields).

Given that exact probabilities are challenging without specific data, we'll make educated guesses based on general graduate enrollment distributions and how well Adam's personality fits typical profiles in these fields.

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**
   - Business administration is a common field, but not necessarily among graduate students with Adam's described interests (nature, puzzles, empathy, animals).
   - Let's estimate \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \).

2. **Probability of Evidence \( P(E|H) \)**
   - His personality sketch does not strongly align with the typical business administration profile.
   - Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \).

3. **Probability of Evidence Not in \( H \) \( P(E|\neg H) \)**
   - Adamâ€™s interests seem more likely to fit many other fields such as biology, ecology, or psychology.
   - Given the number of possible fields, let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \).

### Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**
   - Computer science is quite popular, especially among people good at solving puzzles and abstract concepts.
   - Let's estimate \( P(H) \approx 0.15 \).

2. **Probability of Evidence \( P(E|H) \)**
   - His personality features (solving puzzles, abstract thinking) align well with computer science.
   - Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.6 \).

3. **Probability of Evidence Not in \( H \) \( P(E|\neg H) \)**
   - Similar calculation as for business administration.
   - Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \).

### Calculation

For business administration:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assuming \( P(E) \) is similar for both fields since we don't have exact numbers and it represents the total probability incorporating all possible fields that could match Adam's profile.

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Since total \( P(E) \) is not directly used in comparing the relative likelihoods and only serves to normalize the probabilities:

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.5 \cdot 0.9} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.47} \approx 0.043 \]

For computer science:

\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) \approx \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.15}{0.6 \cdot 0.15 + 0.5 \cdot 0.85} \approx \frac{0.09}{0.515} \approx 0.175 \]

Hence, we get:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.043,
  "computer science": 0.175
}
```
