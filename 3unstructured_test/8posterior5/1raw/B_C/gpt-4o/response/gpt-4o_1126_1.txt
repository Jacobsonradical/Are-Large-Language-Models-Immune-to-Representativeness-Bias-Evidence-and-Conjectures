To determine the probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch, we need to use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we only have hypotheses for two fields, we will focus on comparing these two probabilities.

### Field 1: Computer Science
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science. Since this is a broad field, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is in Computer Science. Given Adam's intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts, let's set \( P(E|H) = 0.6 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in Computer Science. Since this sketch may fit other fields too, we might set \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

Using these values, we calculate:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

We won't compute \( P(E) \) explicitly, just use relative comparison.

### Field 2: Business Administration
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration. This field may generally have fewer people with Adam's specific traits, so let's set \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is in Business Administration. The personality sketch doesn't strongly suggest traits commonly associated with Business Administration. Let's set \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in Business Administration. Since this sketch may fit other fields better, we might set \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Using these values, we calculate:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

By comparing the numerators since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields:

- Computer Science: \( 0.6 \cdot 0.2 = 0.12 \)
- Business Administration: \( 0.1 \cdot 0.1 = 0.01 \)

Now, normalizing these probabilities to make them add up to 1:

- \( P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.01} = \frac{0.12}{0.13} \approx 0.923 \)
- \( P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.12 + 0.01} = \frac{0.01}{0.13} \approx 0.077 \)

Therefore, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.923,
  "business administration": 0.077
}
```
