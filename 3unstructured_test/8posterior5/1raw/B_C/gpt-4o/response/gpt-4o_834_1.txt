To calculate P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need to analyze the likelihoods and priors for each field given the provided personality sketch. Let's use the following notations:

- P(H) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- P(E|H) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- P(E|\neg H) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in that field.
- P(H|E) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field given the personality sketch.

### Computer Science:
- **P(H)**: Let's assume that the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science is reasonable but not the highest. It could be a bit lower than other fields due to his distinct interest in nature and animals. Let's arbitrarily set it at 0.2.
- **P(E|H)**: Given his traits of intelligence and aptitude for abstract concepts, P(E|H) for computer science could be moderately high. However, considering his strong connection to nature and animals, we might reduce this slightly. Set it at 0.3.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: This is tricky, but let's assume that the likelihood of observing his personality traits generally with respect to any field not related to computer science is around 0.1.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E_{\text{CS}}) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \).

For simplicity in this context:
\[ P(H|E_{\text{CS}}) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{(0.3 \cdot 0.2) + (0.1 \cdot 0.8)} \approx \frac{0.06}{0.14} \approx 0.4286 \]

### Business Administration:
- **P(H)**: Given the personality sketch, business administration might be a less likely fit. Let's set the prior probability at 0.15.
- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of matching the personality sketch with a business administration student is lower, considering traits like empathy, curiosity about nature, and love for animals. Set it at 0.1.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Assume this remains the same as above (0.1).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E_{\text{BA}}) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \).

For simplicity:
\[ P(H|E_{\text{BA}}) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{(0.1 \cdot 0.15) + (0.1 \cdot 0.85)} \approx \frac{0.015}{0.1} = 0.15 \]

### Summary:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4286,
  "business administration": 0.15
}
```

Note: The values used for priors and likelihoods are educated guesses based on the personality sketch, and the final probabilities are approximations.
