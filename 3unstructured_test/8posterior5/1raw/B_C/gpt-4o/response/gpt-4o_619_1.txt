To apply Bayes' Rule, we need to calculate the conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch of Adam. Bayes' Rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in the field (which can be used as a proxy for \( P(E) \)).

Since we don't have exact probabilities, we need to estimate these values based on the information provided.


### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
   - Let’s assign a prior probability based on the assumption that graduate students could be spread across many fields.
   - Let's say approximately 1/20 graduate students could be in business administration.
   - \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.05 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   - Based on the personality sketch, it seems less likely that Adam’s interests match business administration, but it's not impossible.
   - Assuming an approximate probability: \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.1 \)

3. **Probability \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   - This is the probability of Adam's personality sketch happening regardless of the field.
   - It seems more likely in fields related to nature and abstract thinking, hence we assume a higher probability compared to business administration.
   - Let's tentatively set: \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.2 \)

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.05}{0.2} = 0.025 \]

### Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
   - Similarly, we assume the same prior probability for computer science students.
   - Let's say approximately 1/20 graduate students could be in computer science.
   - \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.05 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   - Given the sketch, Adam’s high intelligence, puzzle-solving ability, and interest in abstract concepts match well with computer science.
   - Assuming a higher likelihood: \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.6 \)

3. **Probability \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   - This is the same as we estimated above for general likelihood based on the personality sketch.
   - Let’s keep it as: \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.2 \)

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.05}{0.2} = 0.15 \]

Therefore, we have:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.025,
  "computer science": 0.15
}
```
