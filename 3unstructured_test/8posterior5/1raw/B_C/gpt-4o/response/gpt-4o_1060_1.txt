Let's start by setting reasonable assumptions and judgments for the probabilities required to use Bayes' rule for Adam's potential fields of study.

### Computer Science

**P(H_computer_science)**: This represents the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science as a graduate student, without considering the personality sketch. Given the general distribution of fields among graduate students, let's assume P(H_computer_science) = 0.2 (20%).

**P(E|H_computer_science)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in computer science. Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts fit well with computer science, but his love for nature and animals is less typical. Thus, let's estimate P(E|H_computer_science) = 0.3.

**P(E|\neg H_computer_science)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not in computer science. Given the broad range of other fields that align with his interests, let's estimate P(E|\neg H_computer_science) = 0.8.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_computer_science|E) = \frac{P(E|H_computer_science) \cdot P(H_computer_science)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H_computer_science) \cdot P(H_computer_science) + P(E|\neg H_computer_science) \cdot P(\neg H_computer_science) \)

Substituting the values:
\[ P(E) = 0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.8 \cdot 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.06 + 0.64 = 0.7 \]

\[ P(H_computer_science|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.7} = \frac{0.06}{0.7} \approx 0.086 \]

### Business Administration

**P(H_business_administration)**: Let's assume this to be smaller, given the general distribution of students and Adam's specific interests which are less typical for this field. Let's assume P(H_business_administration) = 0.1 (10%).

**P(E|H_business_administration)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in business administration. This is less likely as his personality doesn't align well with typical business administration traits. So, let's estimate P(E|H_business_administration) = 0.1.

**P(E|\neg H_business_administration)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he's not in business administration. This would be higher given that there are many other fields aligning better with his interests. So, let's estimate P(E|\neg H_business_administration) = 0.8.

Again using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H_business_administration|E) = \frac{P(E|H_business_administration) \cdot P(H_business_administration)}{P(E)} \]

Using the same \(P(E) = 0.7\) from earlier, we get:

\[ P(H_business_administration|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.7} = \frac{0.01}{0.7} \approx 0.014 \]

Final results:
