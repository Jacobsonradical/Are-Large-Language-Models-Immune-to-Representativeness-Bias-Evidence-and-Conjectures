To begin applying Bayes' rule for determining the probability that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or business administration based on the provided personality sketch, we need to estimate the relevant probabilities.

### Hypotheses:
- H₁: Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- H₂: Adam was enrolled in business administration.

### Notation:
- P(H₁) and P(H₂) are the prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in computer science and business administration, respectively.
- P(E|H₁) and P(E|H₂) are the likelihoods of the given personality sketch if Adam is enrolled in computer science or business administration, respectively.
- P(E|¬H₁) and P(E|¬H₂) are the likelihoods of the given personality sketch if Adam is not enrolled in computer science or business administration, respectively.
- P(H₁|E) and P(H₂|E) are the posterior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in computer science or business administration, given the personality sketch.

### Estimations:
- **P(H₁):** The prior probability of a graduate student being enrolled in computer science can be reasonably assumed to be moderate due to its popularity. Let's assume P(H₁) = 0.25.
- **P(H₂):** The prior probability of a graduate student being in business administration is also significant. Let's assume P(H₂) = 0.20.

- **P(E|H₁):** Adam's skills in solving puzzles, intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts are strong indicators for computer science. Let's assign P(E|H₁) = 0.70.
- **P(E|H₂):** Business administration doesn't strongly align with Adam's described traits directly. Let's assign P(E|H₂) = 0.30.

- **P(E|¬H₁) and P(E|¬H₂):** These are the probabilities of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in the specified fields. We'll assume P(E|¬H₁) = 0.20 and P(E|¬H₂) = 0.25 due to the general distribution of traits that can apply to other fields.

### Calculation using Bayes' rule:
Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence, computed as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H₁) \cdot P(H₁) + P(E|¬H₁) \cdot P(¬H₁) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.70 \cdot 0.25 + 0.20 \cdot 0.75 \]

Similarly for H₂:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H₂) \cdot P(H₂) + P(E|¬H₂) \cdot P(¬H₂) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.30 \cdot 0.20 + 0.25 \cdot 0.80 \]

Now compute the probabilities:

#### For Computer Science:
\[ P(E) = (0.70 \cdot 0.25) + (0.20 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.175 + 0.15 = 0.325 \]

\[ P(H₁|E) = \frac{0.70 \cdot 0.25}{0.325} \]
\[ P(H₁|E) = \frac{0.175}{0.325} \]
\[ P(H₁|E) ≈ 0.538 \]

#### For Business Administration:
\[ P(E) = (0.30 \cdot 0.20) + (0.25 \cdot 0.80) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.06 + 0.20 = 0.26 \]

\[ P(H₂|E) = \frac{0.30 \cdot 0.20}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H₂|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H₂|E) ≈ 0.231 \]

Thus, the estimates for the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.538,
  "business administration": 0.231
}
```
