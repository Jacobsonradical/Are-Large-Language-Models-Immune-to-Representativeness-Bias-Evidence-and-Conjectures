To solve this problem using Bayes' rule, we need to define some probabilities. Let's denote the following:

- \( P(H_1) \) and \( P(H_2) \) as the prior probabilities that Adam was enrolled in computer science and business administration, respectively.
- \( P(E|H_1) \) and \( P(E|H_2) \) as the probabilities of the evidence given the hypotheses.
- \( P(E|\neg H_1) \) and \( P(E|\neg H_2) \) as the probabilities of the evidence given the negation of the hypotheses.
- \( P(H_1|E) \) and \( P(H_2|E) \) as the posterior probabilities that Adam was enrolled in computer science and business administration given the evidence.

Let's make reasonable assumptions based on the personality sketch for the prior probabilities and the likelihoods. We will estimate:

1. Prior probabilities:
    - \( P(H_1) = 0.2 \): The general prior that a graduate student might be in computer science.
    - \( P(H_2) = 0.15 \): The general prior that a graduate student might be in business administration.

2. Likelihoods:
    - \( P(E|H_1) = 0.5 \): The likelihood that someone in computer science has Adam's characteristics. Since he is intelligent, good at abstract concepts, enjoys solving puzzles, and has empathy, there is a moderate fit.
    - \( P(E|H_2) = 0.2 \): The likelihood that someone in business administration has Adamâ€™s characteristics. Business students are often empathetic and appreciate hard work, but the interest in nature and puzzles is less typical.

3. Probabilities given the negation:
    - \( P(E|\neg H_1) = 0.3 \): The likelihood that someone not in computer science has Adam's characteristics.
    - \( P(E|\neg H_2) = 0.4 \): The likelihood that someone not in business administration has Adam's characteristics.

Next, we use Bayes' rule to calculate the posterior probabilities:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be found using the law of total probability.

### For Computer Science:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E|\neg H_1) \cdot P(\neg H_1) \]
\[ P(\neg H_1) = 1 - P(H_1) = 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.5 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8 = 0.1 + 0.24 = 0.34 \]

\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.34} \approx 0.294 \]

### For Business Administration:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) + P(E|\neg H_2) \cdot P(\neg H_2) \]
\[ P(\neg H_2) = 1 - P(H_2) = 0.85 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.15 + 0.4 \cdot 0.85 = 0.03 + 0.34 = 0.37 \]

\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{0.37} \approx 0.081 \]

Based on these calculations:
