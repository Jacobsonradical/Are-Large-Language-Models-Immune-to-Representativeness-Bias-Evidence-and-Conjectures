To evaluate the probability of Adam being enrolled in either business administration or computer science based on his personality sketch \(E\), I will assign my best estimates of \(P(H)\), \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E|\neg H)\) for each field and use Bayes' rule to compute \(P(H|E)\).

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H_{BA})\)**: The likelihood of any random graduate student being in business administration.
   - Let's assume around 10% of students are in business administration.
   - \(P(H_{BA}) = 0.1\)

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H_{BA})\)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he were in business administration.
   - Curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy are not strongly associated with business administration.
   - Let's estimate \(P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.05\)

3. **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H_{BA})\)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he were not in business administration.
   - It seems more likely that Adam's traits align with fields outside business administration.
   - Let's estimate \(P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.2\)

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{BA}))} \]

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{0.05 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.18} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.185} \approx 0.027 \]

### Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H_{CS})\)**: The likelihood of any random graduate student being in computer science.
   - Assume about 20% of graduate students are in computer science.
   - \(P(H_{CS}) = 0.2\)

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H_{CS})\)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he were in computer science.
   - Enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work fit well with computer science.
   - Let's estimate \(P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.3\)

3. **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H_{CS})\)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he were not in computer science.
   - Since Adamâ€™s personality traits could also apply to fields outside computer science but to a lesser extent.
   - Let's estimate \(P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.15\)

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{CS}))} \]

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.15 \cdot 0.8} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.12} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.18} \approx 0.333 \]

### Result

{
  "business administration": 0.027,
  "computer science": 0.333
}
