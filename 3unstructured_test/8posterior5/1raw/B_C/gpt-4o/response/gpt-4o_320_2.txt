To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to assess \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field of study. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields, we only need to compute the numerator (i.e., \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \)) for comparison.

**1. Computer Science**

- \( P(H) \): Assume a prior \( P(H) \) of 0.2 (since Computer Science is a common field in graduate school).
- \( P(E|H) \): The personality traits such as high intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying puzzles align well with Computer Science. Assume \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): For fields other than Computer Science, we assume the probability of these traits is lower but not impossible. Assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Using Bayes' rule for Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.7 \cdot 0.2 = 0.14 \]

**2. Business Administration**

- \( P(H) \): Assume a prior \( P(H) \) of 0.15 (since Business Administration is also a common field, but less so among those with traits like curiosity about nature).
- \( P(E|H) \): The traits listed do not strongly suggest a fit for Business Administration. Assume \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Again, for fields other than Business Administration, the probability of these traits would be higher than for Business Administration. Assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

Using Bayes' rule for Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.3 \cdot 0.15 = 0.045 \]

Now, normalize these values to obtain probabilities.

For normalization:
\[ P(H|E, \text{comp sci}) + P(H|E, \text{business admin}) \neq 1 \]

Thus:
\[ \text{Normalization factor} = 0.14 + 0.045 = 0.185 \]

Normalized probabilities:
\[ P(H|E, \text{comp sci}) = \frac{0.14}{0.185} \approx 0.757 \]
\[ P(H|E, \text{business admin}) = \frac{0.045}{0.185} \approx 0.243 \]

Finally, rounding these to two decimal places for clarity:

{
  "computer science": 0.76,
  "business administration": 0.24
