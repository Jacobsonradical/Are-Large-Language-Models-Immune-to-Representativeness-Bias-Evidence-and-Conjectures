To answer this question, we'll need to estimate the probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) and then use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \).

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This is the initial assessment of the likelihood that Adam was enrolled in a particular field before considering the personality sketch.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the likelihood that the personality sketch \( E \) would occur if Adam was enrolled in that particular field.

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is the likelihood that the personality sketch \( E \) would occur if Adam was not enrolled in that particular field.

4. **Compute Posterior \( P(H|E) \)**: Using Bayes' rule, we update our belief in the hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).

Bayes' Rule formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) \) can be computed as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's move forward with these steps for each field.

### Field: Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**
    - Let's assume the prior likelihood that any graduate student might be in business administration is \( 0.2 \) (hypothetical).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**
    - A personality that enjoys puzzles, has empathy, and a love for animals doesn't strongly indicate a business administration background. However, appreciation for dedication can somewhat align with business education values.
    - Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**
    - If Adam is not in business administration, the given personality traits might be more likely overall. So, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.8 \).

4. **Compute \( P(H|E) \)**
    \[
    P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
    \]
    \(
    P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.2 + 0.8 \cdot (1 - 0.2) 
    \)
    \(
    P(E) = 0.04 + 0.64 
    \)
    \(
    P(E) = 0.68 
    \)
    \[ 
    P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.68} 
    \]
    \[
    P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.68} 
    \]
    \[
    P(H|E) \approx 0.059 
    \]

### Field: Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**
    - Let's assume the prior likelihood that any graduate student might be in computer science is \( 0.3 \) (hypothetical).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**
    - A personality that enjoys solving puzzles and abstract thinking fits well with computer science. Curiosity about nature might be less relevant but doesn't contradict the field's interests.
    - Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.6 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**
    - If Adam is not in computer science, the given personality traits might be relatively common in other scientific fields. So, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

4. **Compute \( P(H|E) \)**
    \[
    P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
    \]
    \(
    P(E) = 0.6 \cdot 0.3 + 0.5 \cdot (1 - 0.3) 
    \)
    \(
    P(E) = 0.18 + 0.35 
    \)
    \(
    P(E) = 0.53 
    \)
    \[ 
    P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.3}{0.53} 
    \]
    \[
    P(H|E) = \frac{0.18}{0.53} 
    \]
    \[
    P(H|E) \approx 0.34 
    \]

### Results

\[
{
  "business administration": 0.059,
  "computer science": 0.34
}
\]

These values indicate a much higher probability that Adam was enrolled in a computer science program compared to business administration, given his personality sketch.
