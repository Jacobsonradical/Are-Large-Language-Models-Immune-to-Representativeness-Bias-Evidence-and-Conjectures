Let's first consider the fields of "business administration" and "computer science" and assess each step of our calculation methodically.

### Step 1: Determine the Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)
Since no specific prior information about Adamâ€™s field of study distribution is provided, we might assume equal likelihood for simplicity. However, realistically speaking, the probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration versus computer science should be roughly balanced given that these are both common fields.

### Step 2: Determine the Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)
- **Business Administration**: While students in business administration can have empathy and high intelligence, the emphasis on nature, animals, solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts is less directly related. So, \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \) might be lower.
- **Computer Science**: Computer Science aligns well with high intelligence, solving puzzles, understanding abstract concepts, and even curiosity, which can sometimes indirectly extend to nature (e.g., bioinformatics). So, \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \) is potentially higher.

### Step 3: Determine the Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)
This would be the combined probability across all other fields that Adam might be in. Since there are many other potential fields, for simplification, we assume they share similar probability distribution tendencies and average them out.

### Step 4: Use Bayes' Rule
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We assume:
- \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.5 \)
Given no preference, we just split evenly here for simplicity.

Next, we estimate the likelihoods:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.2 \) (low alignment with personality sketch)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.5 \) (moderate alignment with personality sketch)

The denominator \( P(E) \) is a normalization factor combining \( P(E|H)P(H) \) across all hypotheses:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{BA}})P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E|H_{\text{CS}})P(H_{\text{CS}}) + \text{terms for other fields} \]

However, we can still comparatively determine:

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} = \frac{0.25}{P(E)} \]

Thus, the probabilities are relative to each other:

\[ \frac{P(H_{\text{CS}}|E)}{P(H_{\text{BA}}|E)} = \frac{0.25}{0.1} = 2.5 \]

### Final Output (normalized with respect to each other):
```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.25"
}
```

This answer provides a sense of proportional probabilities where Computer Science is more likely for Adam given the stated characteristics.
