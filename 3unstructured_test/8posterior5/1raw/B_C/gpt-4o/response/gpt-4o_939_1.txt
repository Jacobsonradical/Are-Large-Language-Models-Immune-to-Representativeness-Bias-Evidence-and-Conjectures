To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in either Computer Science or Business Administration given his personality sketch, let's approach this using Bayes' theorem. The theorem states that:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's break down the equations for each field:

### 1. Computer Science
- **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science. Given that it's a popular field, we might assume a moderate prior probability. Let's estimate \( P(H) = 0.3 \) (30%).
- **P(E|H)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is studying Computer Science. Given the description, a person studying computer science might have high intelligence, a love for solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts. Despite not directly aligning with empathy or a love for nature, let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.5 \) (50%).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is NOT studying Computer Science. Since his traits are quite general and might suit other fields well, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \) (40%).

Thus,
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \]

### 2. Business Administration
- **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration. Let's estimate this as moderate too, as it’s also a common field. Let’s assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \) (20%).
- **P(E|H)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is studying Business Administration. Business students may value intelligence, empathy, and understanding dedication, but it doesn't strongly align with a love for nature or puzzles. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \) (30%).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Same reasoning as above, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \) (40%).

Thus,
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

To find \( P(E) \), the overall probability of observing the evidence, we can use a weighted sum of the fields and their complements:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{CS} \cup \neg H_{BA}) \cdot P(\neg H_{CS} \cup \neg H_{BA}) \]

For simplicity, assuming a uniform distribution and summing only for the two fields assumed:
\[ P(E) \approx 0.5 \cdot 0.3 + 0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot (1 - (0.3 + 0.2)) \]

\[ P(E) \approx 0.15 + 0.06 + 0.4 \times 0.5 = 0.15 + 0.06 + 0.2 = 0.41 \]

Finally:
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.5 * 0.3}{0.41} \approx 0.366 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.3 * 0.2}{0.41} \approx 0.146 \]

So, the formatted answer is:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.366,
  "business administration": 0.146
}
```
