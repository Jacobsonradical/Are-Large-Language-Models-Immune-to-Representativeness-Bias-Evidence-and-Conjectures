To compute \(P(H|E)\) for both fields using Bayes' Rule, we need to assess the following:

- \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
- \(P(E|H)\): The probability of observing E given that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of observing E given that Adam was not enrolled in the field.

Bayes' Rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \(P(E)\) is a normalizing constant. Without the need to compute \(P(E)\) directly, our goal is to compare the values of \(P(H|E)\) to see which is more likely. Let's proceed with a rough estimation based on the given information.

1. **Business Administration**

- \(P(H)\): Assume that out of the various fields of study, let's hypothesize there is about a 10% chance Adam was enrolled in business administration, given the wide range of possible graduate fields. Hence, \(P(H) \approx 0.1\).
  
- \(P(E|H)\): Considering Adam's personality sketch, which highlights curiosity about nature, empathy, and a love for animals, it seems less aligned with a typical business administration profile. Thus, we can estimate it at around 0.05.

- \(P(E|\neg H)\): Given the wide range of fields excluding business administration, and considering the sketch might better fit other fields like environmental science, biology, or psychology, we can estimate this slightly higher. Let's assume \(P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2\).

Using these estimations:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.05 \times 0.1 = 0.005 \]

2. **Computer Science**

- \(P(H)\): Assume that there's a higher prior probability for computer science due to its popularity among graduate students. Let's hypothesize a 20% chance. Hence, \(P(H) \approx 0.2\).
  
- \(P(E|H)\): Given Adamâ€™s high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts, coding and problem-solving skills, his traits align moderately well with a computer science profile. Hence, \(P(E|H) \approx 0.3\).

- \(P(E|\neg H)\): This remains relatively the same estimate as before, assuming many fields fit his profile better than business administration. Hence, \(P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2\).

Using these estimations:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.3 \times 0.2 = 0.06 \]

Comparing the proportional values:

- Business Administration: \(0.005\)
- Computer Science: \(0.06\)

Since we only need their relative probabilities and not the normalized values, we can conclude that the probability ratio strongly favors computer science over business administration given the personality sketch.

Thus, the likely conclusion is:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.08,
  "computer science": 0.92
}
```

Here, we have reassigned the ratios into a more interpretable format (summing to 1 for simplicity). However, remember the actual probabilities are compared in relation, not absolute values summing to 1.
