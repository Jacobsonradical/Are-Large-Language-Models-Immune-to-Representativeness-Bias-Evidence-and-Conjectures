Let's evaluate the probability \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To apply Bayes' rule, we need to estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field.

### Business Administration

#### \( P(H_{BA}) \)
The base rate or prior probability that Adam is a business administration student (general guess without additional information):
- Since business administration is a common field, let's assume \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.1 \).

#### \( P(E|H_{BA}) \)
The likelihood of observing Adam’s personality traits if he were a business administration student:
- Adam's personality traits don’t align very strongly with typical business administration traits, which might include more focus on leadership, strategic planning, and less on nature and puzzles.
- So, let's estimate \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.05 \).

#### \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \)
The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits if he were not a business administration student:
- We estimate \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \) to reflect the prevalence of these traits in other fields.
- Since Adam's traits could fit various non-business fields, let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.2 \).

### Computer Science

#### \( P(H_{CS}) \)
The base rate or prior probability that Adam is a computer science student (general guess without additional information):
- Computer science is a very common field for graduate studies, particularly in the U.S.
- Let’s assume \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.2 \).

#### \( P(E|H_{CS}) \)
The likelihood of observing Adam’s personality traits if he were a computer science student:
- Adam's love for puzzles and high intelligence aligns well with traits typical of computer science students.
- Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.4 \).

#### \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \)
The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits if he were not a computer science student:
- Many other fields might share these traits, so this will be relatively high.
- Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.2 \).

Next, we will compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

### Business Administration

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is constant for all hypotheses and we only need relative probabilities, we can ignore the denominator:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto 0.05 \cdot 0.1 = 0.005 \]

### Computer Science

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto 0.4 \cdot 0.2 = 0.08 \]

Combining the results, we normalize them (if needed) to ensure they represent probabilities.

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.005,
  "computer science": 0.08
}
```

These values indicate that, based on Adam's personality sketch, he is much more likely to be a computer science student than a business administration student.
