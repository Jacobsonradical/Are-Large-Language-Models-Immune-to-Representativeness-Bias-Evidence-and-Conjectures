To determine the likelihood that Adam was enrolled in specific fields based on the given personality sketch, we can use Bayes' theorem, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

First, let's break down our variables:
- \( H \) represents the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
- \( E \) represents the evidence, which is Adam's personality sketch.
- \( \neg H \) represents the hypothesis that Adam was not enrolled in that specific field.

Since the sketches of Adam's personality are somewhat subjective, we'll use the following reasonable assumptions for P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|¬H):

### For Computer Science:

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that any given graduate student is in computer science. Assuming a reasonable proportion for a major U.S. university, let's estimate this to be 0.2 (or 20%).

- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood that a computer science student would match Adam’s personality sketch. Given that computer science students are often intelligent and enjoy solving puzzles, have curiosity, and an understanding of abstract concepts, I would estimate this to be reasonably high, about 0.5 (or 50%).

- **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood that a non-computer science student would match Adam’s personality sketch. Since the traits described could fit many non-computer science students as well, let’s conservatively estimate this broader group at 0.1 (or 10%).

### For Business Administration:

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that any given graduate student is in business administration. Assuming a reasonable proportion for a major U.S. university, let’s estimate this to be 0.15 (or 15%).

- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood that a business administration student would match Adam’s personality sketch. Business administration students are generally less likely as a group to be deeply into nature and animals, though some might have similar traits. Let’s estimate this to be lower at around 0.3 (or 30%).

- **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood that a non-business administration student would match Adam’s personality sketch. As with computer science, since the traits described could fit many non-business administration students, let’s conservatively estimate this broader group at 0.1 (or 10%).

### Calculate P(H|E) for each field using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(\text{comp. sci.}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{comp. sci.}) \cdot P(\text{comp. sci.})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(\text{business admin.}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business admin.}) \cdot P(\text{business admin.})}{P(E)} \]

While \( P(E) \) isn't known outright, we can compare relative probabilities.

For Computer Science:
\[ P(\text{comp. sci.}|E) \propto P(E|\text{comp. sci.}) \cdot P(\text{comp. sci.}) \]
\[ P(\text{comp. sci.}|E) \propto 0.5 \times 0.2 = 0.1 \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(\text{business admin.}|E) \propto P(E|\text{business admin.}) \cdot P(\text{business admin.}) \]
\[ P(\text{business admin.}|E) \propto 0.3 \times 0.15 = 0.045 \]

Standardizing and normalizing is unnecessary as the total probabilities should not necessarily sum to 1 for unspecific inclusion. Thus, our answers are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.1,
  "business administration": 0.045
}
