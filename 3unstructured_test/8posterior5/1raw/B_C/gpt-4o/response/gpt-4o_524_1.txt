To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' theorem. The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to judge the following probabilities for each field:

1. \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): Probability of observing the personality traits given he is enrolled in the field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of observing the personality traits given he is not enrolled in that field.

By comparing the likelihoods, we can make a qualitative assessment of \( P(H|E) \) for each field. 

Let's start with computer science:

- **P(H) for computer science**: Assume a reasonable prior, say 0.1 (10%), for Adam enrolling in computer science given no other information.
- **P(E|H) for computer science**: Considering Adam has high intelligence and an appreciation for hard work and dedication, this fits well with computer science students. Let's estimate this at 0.7 (70%).
- **P(E|\neg H) for computer science**: Given that Adam's traits (curiosity about nature, empathy) are not typical of only computer science, the probability of these traits is fairly typical across multiple fields. Let's estimate this as 0.3 (30%).

Now, for business administration:

- **P(H) for business administration**: Assume a reasonable prior, say 0.05 (5%), for Adam enrolling in business administration given no other information.
- **P(E|H) for business administration**: Business students also need high intelligence and a good understanding of hard work, but the deep love of nature and animals might be less typical. Let's estimate this at 0.4 (40%).
- **P(E|\neg H) for business administration**: Similar to before, this is relatively typical across multiple fields. Let's also estimate this as 0.3 (30%).

Now we can use Bayes' theorem:

For computer science:
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \]
For business administration:
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.05}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both, we don't need to compute it explicitly to compare the probabilities.

Relative posterior probabilities:
\[ \text{computer science} = 0.7 \times 0.1 / 0.3 \approx 0.233 \]
\[ \text{business administration} = 0.4 \times 0.05 / 0.3 \approx 0.067 \]

Comparing these, we can see that Adam is more likely to be enrolled in computer science than business administration.

So the final probabilities would be:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.233",
  "business administration": "0.067"
}
```
