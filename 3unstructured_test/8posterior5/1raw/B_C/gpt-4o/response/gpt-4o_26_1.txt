To determine the likelihood that Adam is enrolled in either business administration or computer science, we need to use Bayes' rule. The rule is defined as follows:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam is enrolled in the field given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the evidence given that Adam is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

We are given that E is the personality sketch of Adam, and we need to judge the probabilities and apply Bayes' rule to the fields of business administration and computer science. 

### Step-by-Step Calculations:
1. **Assigning Prior Probabilities**:
   - \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration.
   - \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science.

   For simplicity, let's assign equal priors if we assume no other information about the distribution of grad students:
   \[ P(H_{\text{BA}}) = P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.5 \]
   
2. **Assessing Likelihoods**:
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): The probability of Adam's personality (E) given that he is in business administration.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): The probability of Adam's personality (E) given that he is in computer science.

   Based on Adam's personality traits (love of nature, puzzles, empathy, love for animals, high intelligence):
   - Business Administration: While students in this field could have these traits, they are not particularly indicative of business administration.
   - Computer Science: Traits like solving puzzles, high intelligence, and love for abstract concepts fit better with computer science.

   Thus, we might assign:
   \[ P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.2 \]
   \[ P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.6 \]
   
3. **Calculating Marginal Probability \( P(E) \)**:
   \[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) \]
   \[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.5) + (0.6 \cdot 0.5) \]
   \[ P(E) = 0.1 + 0.3 \]
   \[ P(E) = 0.4 \]

4. **Applying Bayes Rule**:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)}
   \]
   \[
   P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)}
   \]
   
   So:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.5}{0.4} = \frac{0.1}{0.4} = 0.25
   \]
   \[
   P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.5}{0.4} = \frac{0.3}{0.4} = 0.75
   \]

Therefore, based on the given personality traits and the assumptions made, the probabilities that Adam is enrolled in each of the fields are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.25,
  "computer science": 0.75
}
```
