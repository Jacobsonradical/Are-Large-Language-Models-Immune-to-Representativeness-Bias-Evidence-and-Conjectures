To compute \( P(H|E) \) (the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch), we follow Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here are the probabilities we need:

1. \( P(H) \) - Prior probability of being enrolled in the field.
2. \( P(E|H) \) - Probability of Adam's personality sketch given enrollment in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - Probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is not enrolled in that field.
4. \( P(E) \) - Total probability of the personality sketch.

### Assumptions

- \( P(H) \): Both fields are equally likely initially since we have no other information.
- \( P(E|H) \): How well Adam's personality fits the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): How well Adam's personality fits any other field.

#### For Computer Science

- \( P(H) \): Let's assume the prior probability is 0.5.
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's high intelligence, curiosity about nature (which overlaps with computational biology), and enjoyment of puzzles, this is moderately high: 0.6.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given Adam's warm heart and empathy, traits that might be less emphasized in other fields, we might set this slightly lower: 0.4.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields, it helps us focus on the numerator for comparison.

For computer science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.5}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3}{P(E)} \]

#### For Business Administration

- \( P(H) \): Prior probability 0.5.
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adamâ€™s profile, it's lower because business administration might not align as well (traits like strong empathy might help but others like love of nature might not be as indicative): 0.3.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Comparable to the likelihood of being in a non-business, non-CS field: 0.4.

For business administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.5}{P(E)} = \frac{0.15}{P(E)} \]

### Results
Given that without loss of generality, considerations of \( P(E) \) normalization is not mandatory here (since it is the same for each computation), we focus on the computed numerators for a comparative probability:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.15
}
```

These simplified calculations (ignoring normalization) show that based on his personality sketch, Adam is more likely to be enrolled in computer science than business administration.
