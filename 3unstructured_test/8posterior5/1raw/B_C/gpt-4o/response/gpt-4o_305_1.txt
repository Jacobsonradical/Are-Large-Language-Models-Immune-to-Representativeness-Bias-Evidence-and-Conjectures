To apply Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the various probabilities as follows:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the evidence given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the evidence given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.

Based on the personality sketch provided (denoted as E), we can make educated guesses about these probabilities.

1. **Business Administration**
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration. Considering the vast number of graduates in different fields, let's assign a prior probability of 0.1 (10%).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given business administration, the likelihood that Adam has the described traits of curiosity about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work. While these traits are not typical of a business administration student, they are still possible. Let's assume a low likelihood, perhaps 0.05 (5%).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the described traits for someone not in business administration. Given that Adam's traits more commonly align with other fields, let’s put this at 0.2 (20%).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{0.05 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.18} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.185} \approx 0.027 (2.7\%) \]

2. **Computer Science**
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science. Let's assign a prior probability of 0.1 (10%).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given computer science, the likelihood that Adam has the described traits is higher, as these could be more common in this field (curiosity, puzzle-solving, high intelligence). Let’s assume a likelihood of 0.4 (40%).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the described traits for someone not in computer science. This remains the same as above: 0.2 (20%).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.1}{0.4 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.18} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.22} \approx 0.182 (18.2\%) \]

So the final probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field, given the personality sketch, are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.027,
  "computer science": 0.182
}
```
