Let's use Bayes' theorem to compute \( P(H|E) \), the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given the personality sketch provided. According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that, let's first assume the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) as a rough estimate, and we'll also need to consider how likely the personality sketch is given each field of study, \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood of the sketch given the complement of each hypothesis, \( P(E|\neg H) \).

### Computer Science

1. **P(H):** The probability that a given graduate student is in computer science is relatively high, let's assume this to be around 0.2.
2. **P(E|H):** Adam's high intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles fit well with a computer science field, but his deep love for nature, animals, and empathy seems less directly related. A rough estimate for this would be 0.3.
3. **P(E|\neg H):** This is the probability of the personality sketch occurring in fields other than computer science. Given that the sketch denotes qualities also fitting other fields such as biology, psychology, environmental studies, etc., let’s estimate 0.7.

### Business Administration

1. **P(H):** The probability that a given graduate student is in business administration, let's assume this to be around 0.15.
2. **P(E|H):** Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication might fit a business administration field, but other traits like deep love for nature, empathy, love for animals are less strongly aligned. Let’s assume this to be 0.1.
3. **P(E|\neg H):** Same as above, let's assume 0.7.

### Normalizing Factor \( P(E) \)
Since \( P(E) \) will be the same for all fields when normalizing the posteriors, we can save some steps by comparing the numerators directly and normalizing them at the end.

### Calculations Using Bayes' Rule

#### Computer Science

\[ P(H|E) \text{ for computer science} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) \text{ for computer science} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

#### Business Administration

\[ P(H|E) \text{ for business administration} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) \text{ for business administration} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, ignoring the normalizing factor \( P(E) \) and just comparing the numerators:

1. Computer Science: \( 0.3 \times 0.2 = 0.06 \)
2. Business Administration: \( 0.1 \times 0.15 = 0.015 \)

Now normalize these:

1. Sum of values: \( 0.06 + 0.015 = 0.075 \)

Normalized probabilities:

1. Computer Science: \( \frac{0.06}{0.075} = 0.8 \)
2. Business Administration: \( \frac{0.015}{0.075} = 0.2 \)

So, the final normalized probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```
