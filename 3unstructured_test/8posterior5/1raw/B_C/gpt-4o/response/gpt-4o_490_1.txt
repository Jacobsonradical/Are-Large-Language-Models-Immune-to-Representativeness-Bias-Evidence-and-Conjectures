To use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study given Adam's personality sketch, we'll need to consider the following probabilities for each hypothesis H (i.e., each field):

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in that field of study.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in that field.

The formula for Bayes' rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is constant for both fields, we can compare the relative values of each field's \( P(H|E) \) by examining the numerator \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

Let's give each probability a reasonable estimation based on the given personality sketch and typical graduate fields.

### Probability Estimations:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - **P(H) (Prior)**: Given that computer science is a common graduate field, we can assume a moderate prior probability. Let's say \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.20 \).
   - **P(E|H) (Likelihood)**: Adam's intelligence and interest in solving puzzles are aligned with computer science. However, his strong empathy and deep love for animals are not particularly relevant. We'll give this a moderate likelihood: \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.60 \).
   - **P(E|\neg H) (Complement likelihood)**: This would be an overall likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given any field other than computer science. Given that education fields have diverse personality matches, we assume \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.40 \).

2. **Business Administration**:
   - **P(H) (Prior)**: Business administration is also a common field, so we'll use a similar moderate prior probability: \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.20 \).
   - **P(E|H) (Likelihood)**: Adam's personality sketch doesn't strongly match the typical traits for business administration students (e.g., focus on people management, finance). So, let’s assign a lower value: \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.30 \).
   - **P(E|\neg H) (Complement likelihood)**: This should be the likelihood of his personality sketch under alternative fields. We use the same value as for computer science: \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.40 \).

### Computing \( P(H|E) \):

Using the simplified comparison:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

For **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto 0.60 \times 0.20 = 0.12 \]

For **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto 0.30 \times 0.20 = 0.06 \]

Now we can normalize these values to compare them directly (although not necessary for relative comparison):

Total proportion sum: \( 0.12 + 0.06 = 0.18 \)

Thus, normalized probabilities (for comparative purposes):

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.18} = 0.67 \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.18} = 0.33 \]

However, since you don't need the actual normalized likelihoods and can keep the proportions consistent for relative comparison, we’ll present them directly as estimates:

  "computer science": 0.12,
