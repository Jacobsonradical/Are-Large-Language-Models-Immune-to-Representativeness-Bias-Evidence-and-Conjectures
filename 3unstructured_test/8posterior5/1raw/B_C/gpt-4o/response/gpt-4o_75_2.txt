To determine the likelihood that Adam was enrolled in specific graduate fields based on his personality sketch, we need to calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of enrolling in each field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch given enrollment in the specific field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch given enrollment in another field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch, which can be decomposed as \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \).

Here's the approach in a structured format for each field:

### For Business Administration

#### 1. Prior Probability (\(P(H)\)):
Let's assume there is no initial information, so we treat all fields equally. Thus, \( P(H) \) might be around 1/10, as one potential field among many possible fields (for simplicity).

#### 2. Likelihood (\(P(E|H)\)):
The personality sketch indicates a love for nature, animals, solving puzzles, empathy, and understanding abstract concepts. These traits are less commonly associated with business administration.
Let's assign a lower likelihood for this field, e.g., 0.1.

#### 3. Likelihood of non-membership (\(P(E|\neg H)\)):
This is the conditional probability if Adam is not in business administration. Since we need it but don't have detailed information, let's say \( P(E|\neg H) \sim 0.2 \), assuming less match but slightly higher odds simply because there are many non-business fields he could be in.

\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) = 0.1 \times 0.1 + 0.2 \times 0.9 = 0.01 + 0.18 = 0.19 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.1}{0.19} \approx 0.0526 \]

### For Computer Science

#### 1. Prior Probability (\(P(H)\)):
Assume fair initial probability, so similar to above \( P(H) \) might be 1/10.

#### 2. Likelihood (\(P(E|H)\)):
The personality sketch describes qualities like intelligence, solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts, which are strongly associated with computer science.
Let's assign a higher likelihood for this field, e.g., 0.7.

#### 3. Likelihood of non-membership (\(P(E|\neg H)\)):
This is the conditional probability if Adam is not in computer science. Let's say \( P(E|\neg H) \sim 0.2 \), similar as above.

\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) = 0.7 \times 0.1 + 0.2 \times 0.9 = 0.07 + 0.18 = 0.25 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \times 0.1}{0.25} = 0.28 \]

Based on these calculations, the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being in business administration or computer science are:

  "business administration": 0.0526,
  "computer science": 0.28
