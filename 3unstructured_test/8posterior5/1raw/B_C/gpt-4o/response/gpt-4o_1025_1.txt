Let's analyze the situation:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of being enrolled in each field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam having the described personality sketch if he is enrolled in the particular field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam having the described personality sketch if he is not enrolled in the particular field.
4. **P(H|E)**: The posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in the particular field given his personality sketch.

Let's consider the two fields: computer science and business administration.

### Computer Science (CS)
1. **P(H)**: Computer Science is a common graduate field in the U.S., so we might assume a moderate prior probability that a random graduate student is in CS. Let's assume P(H) = 0.2.
2. **P(E|H)**: The traits described (curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, empathy, solving puzzles) might not be strongly associated with CS, so this might be relatively low. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.1.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Since these traits are more associated with other fields (e.g., biology, environmental science), and CS is quite different, this might be higher than P(E|H). Let's assume P(E|\neg H) = 0.3.
4. Applying Bayes' rule:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
   \]
   Here, \(P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H)\).
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.1 \times 0.2 + 0.3 \times 0.8} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.24} = \frac{0.02}{0.26} \approx 0.077
   \]  

### Business Administration (BA)
1. **P(H)**: Business Administration is also a common field, so we might assume a moderate prior probability. Let's assume P(H) = 0.15.
2. **P(E|H)**: The traits described do not strongly align with typical business administration students, so this might be low. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.05.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Because the traits might be more aligned with other fields, this could be higher. Let's assume P(E|\neg H) = 0.3.
4. Applying Bayes' rule:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.15}{0.05 \times 0.15 + 0.3 \times 0.85} = \frac{0.0075}{0.0075 + 0.255} = \frac{0.0075}{0.2625} \approx 0.029
   \]  

Here is the computed posterior probability for each field:

\{
  "computer science": 0.077,
  "business administration": 0.029
\}
