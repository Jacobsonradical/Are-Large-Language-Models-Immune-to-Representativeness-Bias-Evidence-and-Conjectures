To estimate the probability that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or computer science given the personality sketch \( E \), we will apply Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem is represented as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in the field \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

Given the context, let's estimate the necessary probabilities.

### Business Administration:
#### 1. Prior Probability \( P(H) \):
Business administration is a common graduate field, but not typically associated with high interest in nature, puzzles, animals, and abstract concepts. We estimate a lower prior probability:
\[ P(\text{H})_{\text{BA}} \approx 0.1 \] 

#### 2. Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):
Given \( H \) is business administration, it's less likely to observe the traits in \( E \):
\[ P(E|H)_{\text{BA}} \approx 0.2 \]

#### 3. Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):
For non-business fields, Adam's characteristics are fairly common in fields like biology, environmental science, or other STEM fields. We estimate:
\[ P(E|\neg H)_{\text{BA}} \approx 0.5 \]

#### Posterior Probability \( P(H|E) \):
Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} = \frac{P(E|H)_{\text{BA}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{BA}}}{P(E)} \]

Assuming \( P(E) \) is the average likelihood given all hypotheses, we use it as a normalizing constant. However, to keep it simple, we just compare relative terms:

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.5} = \frac{0.02}{0.5} \approx 0.04 \]

### Computer Science:
#### 1. Prior Probability \( P(H) \):
Computer science is also a common field, fitting well with high intelligence and abstract concepts, though not perfectly with nature and animals. We use a moderate prior probability:
\[ P(H)_{\text{CS}} \approx 0.25 \] 

#### 2. Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):
Given \( H \) is computer science, it's somewhat likely to observe traits in \( E \):
\[ P(E|H)_{\text{CS}} \approx 0.4 \]

#### 3. Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):
Same as in the business administration context:
\[ P(E|\neg H)_{\text{CS}} \approx 0.5 \]

#### Posterior Probability \( P(H|E) \):
Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} = \frac{P(E|H)_{\text{CS}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{CS}}}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} \approx \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.25}{0.5} = \frac{0.1}{0.5} \approx 0.2 \]

So based on these assumptions, we have the following estimates for the posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.04,
  "computer science": 0.2
}
```
