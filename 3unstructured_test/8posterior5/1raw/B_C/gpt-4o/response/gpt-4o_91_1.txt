To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific graduate field given his personality sketch, we need to follow these steps:

1. Estimate \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
2. Estimate \( P(E | H) \): The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
3. Estimate \( P(E | \neg H) \): The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.
4. Apply Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H | E) \).

Here are some educated estimates:

### Business Administration

1. **P(H\_BA)**: The prior probability of a student being enrolled in business administration. Let's assume roughly uniform distribution across various fields, but there might be fewer people in specialized areas like botany compared to business, so we assign a moderate value:
   
   \( P(H\_BA) \approx 0.2 \)

2. **P(E | H\_BA)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality characteristics if he were enrolled in business administration. Given Adam's deep love for nature and empathy, this seems less likely but not impossible:

   \( P(E | H\_BA) \approx 0.1 \)

3. **P(E | \neg H\_BA)**: The likelihood of observing those characteristics regardless of the field of business administration. Someone outside business administration is more likely to have such a personality:

   \( P(E | \neg H\_BA) \approx 0.5 \)

### Computer Science

1. **P(H\_CS)**: The prior probability of a student being enrolled in computer science. Given that computer science is a very common field for graduate students, we assign a higher prior:

   \( P(H\_CS) \approx 0.25 \)

2. **P(E | H\_CS)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits if he were enrolled in computer science. Given his interest in puzzles and abstract concepts, this seems reasonably high:
   
   \( P(E | H\_CS) \approx 0.3 \)

3. **P(E | \neg H\_CS)**: The likelihood of observing those characteristics regardless of the field of computer science. A similar reasoning to above, likely higher:

   \( P(E | \neg H\_CS) \approx 0.4 \)

### Applying Bayes' Rule

**Bayes' Rule**: \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \)

Since \( P(E) = P(E | H)P(H) + P(E | \neg H)P(\neg H) \), for calculating \( P(H|E) \), we will approximate \( P(E) \) as a normalizing constant.

So, calculating \( P(H|E) \) for each:

#### Business Administration

\[ P(H\_BA | E) \approx \frac{P(E | H\_BA) \cdot P(H\_BA)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

#### Computer Science

\[ P(H\_CS | E) \approx \frac{P(E | H\_CS) \cdot P(H\_CS)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.25}{P(E)} \]

Since we essentially compare the numerators (proportionality):

For Business Administration:

\[ \frac{0.02}{0.02 + \sum...} \]

For Computer Science:

\[ \frac{0.075}{0.075 + \sum...} \]

Clearly, 

\[ P(H\_CS | E) > P(H\_BA | E) \]

We normalize within the context:

So:
```json
{
  "business administration": "0.117",
  "computer science": "0.441"
}
```

These values indicate the relative likelihoods given the initial assumptions and the characteristics described. Note that these probabilities are based on relative comparisons and partial proportional calculations. An exhaustive calculation would adjust based on more fields not considered here.
