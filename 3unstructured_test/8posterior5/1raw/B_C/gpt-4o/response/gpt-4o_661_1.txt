To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in specific fields based on his personality sketch, we will use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem describes the probability \( P(H|E) \) (the posterior probability) in terms of \( P(E|H) \) (likelihood), \( P(H) \) (prior probability), and \( P(E) \) (evidence), where \( E \) denotes the personality sketch.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll estimate integer values for the needed probabilities:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This can be seen as the overall probability that Adam is in each field, without considering the specific evidence \( E \). This can roughly be approximated by the distribution of students in various fields:
   - Computer Science: High demand and common field (\( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.2 \))
   - Business Administration: Also common but different focus (\( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.2 \))

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability that a person in a particular field has Adam's personality traits.
   - Computer Science: Given Adam's high intelligence and interest in solving puzzles, this seems moderately likely (\( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.6 \))
   - Business Administration: Given Adam's empathy and appreciation for dedication, this is somewhat unlikely for the seen personality sketch (\( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.3 \))

3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: The overall likelihood of the personality sketch, which is less context-specific and hard to quantify directly, but since we don't need to compute the exact value, it will cancel out in relative comparison. For simplicity, we'll treat \( P(E) \) as constant for both fields.

Using these estimates, we can proceed with the following calculations:

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.6 \cdot 0.2 = 0.12 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.3 \cdot 0.2 = 0.06 \]

To normalize these for comparative purposes (recognizing they don't need to sum to 1):

Normalized probabilities:

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx 0.12 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \approx 0.06 \]

Now converting these into final estimates between 0 and 1:

{
  "computer science": 0.67,
  "business administration": 0.33
}

These computed values reflect the relative likelihoods based on the given probabilities and Bayes' rule.
