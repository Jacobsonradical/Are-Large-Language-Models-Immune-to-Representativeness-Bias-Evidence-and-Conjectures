To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) through Bayes' Rule, we need to use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a common normalizing factor for both hypotheses, we can focus on computing the numerator for a comparison of relative probabilities without needing the exact value of \( P(E) \). Let's assume the following estimates for the purposes of this analysis:

### 1. Computer Science (H = Computer Science)
- **P(H)**: Probability of being enrolled in computer science.
  \(\approx 0.15\) (Assuming a higher likelihood because it's a popular field)
- **P(E|H)**: Probability of the evidence given being in computer science.
  \(\approx 0.3\) (Good fit for high intelligence and puzzle-solving)
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability of the evidence given not being in computer science.
  \(\approx 0.1\) (Assuming less fit without the specific traits)

### 2. Business Administration (H = Business Administration)
- **P(H)**: Probability of being enrolled in business administration.
  \(\approx 0.1\) (Less popular compared to science/engineering)
- **P(E|H)**: Probability of the evidence given being in business administration.
  \(\approx 0.05\) (Less direct fit with traits like love for nature and animals)
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability of the evidence given not being in business administration.
  \(\approx 0.1\) (Assuming similar likelihood without considering specific traits)

### Calculations:
For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.3 \times 0.15 = 0.045 \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.05 \times 0.1 = 0.005 \]

Finally, the comparison shows that the likelihood is higher for computer science. Here is the representative JSON format based on these relative calculations:

{
  "computer science": "0.9",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

Note that these probabilities are estimations for relative comparison rather than exact values.
