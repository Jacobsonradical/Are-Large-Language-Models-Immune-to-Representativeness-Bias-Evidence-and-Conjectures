To answer this question, we need to assign probabilities for each of the hypotheses (H: Adam was enrolled in a specific field, like business administration or computer science) given the evidence (E: the personality sketch of Adam).

Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Assigning Prior Probabilities P(H)
Given no extra information, we'll assume that the probability of Adam enrolling in any particular field (business administration or computer science) might be equal:
- P(H\_business administration) = 0.5
- P(H\_computer science) = 0.5

### Step 2: Assigning Likelihood P(E|H)
We evaluate how well Adam’s personality sketch fits each hypothesis:
- For business administration: The traits described (curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, empathy, appreciation for hard work) are less commonly associated with students studying business administration. Therefore, P(E|H\_business administration) is relatively low.
- For computer science: The traits fit quite well, especially being good at understanding abstract concepts, solving puzzles, and having high intelligence. P(E|H\_computer science) is relatively high.

Let's assign some reasonable but illustrative probabilities:
- P(E|H\_business administration) = 0.2
- P(E|H\_computer science) = 0.8

### Step 3: Assigning P(E|\neg H)
This is the probability of observing the personality sketch if Adam is not enrolled in the given field:
- P(E|\neg H\_business administration) = the probability that someone not in business administration has the traits in the personality sketch. Let's assume this is moderately high, say 0.6.
- P(E|\neg H\_computer science) = the probability that someone not in computer science has the traits in the personality sketch. Let's assume this is moderately low, say 0.4.

### Step 4: Apply Bayes' Rule
Bayes' Rule states that:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
But since we don’t need the exact \( P(E) \) for comparison between the two, we use the proportional form.

#### For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H\_business administration|E) \propto 0.2 \times 0.5 \]
\[ P(H\_business administration|E) \propto 0.1 \]

#### For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H\_computer science|E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.5 \]
\[ P(H\_computer science|E) \propto 0.4 \]

### Normalize to Find Probabilities
Normalize these values so they sum to 1:

\[ P(H\_business administration|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.1 + 0.4} = \frac{0.1}{0.5} = 0.2 \]
\[ P(H\_computer science|E) = \frac{0.4}{0.1 + 0.4} = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

### Conclusion

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.8
}
```

These values represent the probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration or computer science given his personality sketch.
