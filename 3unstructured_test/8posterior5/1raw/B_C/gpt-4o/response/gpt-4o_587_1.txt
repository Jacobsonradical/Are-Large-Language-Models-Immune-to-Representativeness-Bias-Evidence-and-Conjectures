To estimate the likelihood that Adam was enrolled in each graduate field based on his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in the respective field given his personality.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of Adam's personality sketch (not field-specific).

## Assumptions and Estimates

1. **P(H)**: Prior Probability of Enrollment
   - Estimating based on typical graduate student distributions:
     - Computer Science: High enrollment rate (0.3).
     - Business Administration: Moderate enrollment rate (0.25).

2. **P(E|H)**: Likelihood of Personality Given Field
   - Based on Adam's personality:
     - Computer Science: High probability as traits like high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, puzzle-solving correlate well (0.6).
     - Business Administration: Moderate probability since empathy and appreciation for hard work fit but less directly connected to personality sketch (0.4).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Likelihood of Personality Given Other Fields
   - Generally considering fields outside the given options:
     - These traits are somewhat common among various fields but less defined, say uniformly distributed (0.5).

4. **P(E)**: Overall Probability of Personality Sketch
   - Assuming data given will eventually normalize to factor 1 after considering all specialization fields.

## Calculations

### Computer Science
\[ P(H) = 0.3 \]
\[ P(E|H) = 0.6 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.6 \cdot 0.3 + 0.5 \cdot 0.7 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.18 + 0.35 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.53 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.3}{0.53} \approx 0.34 \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(H) = 0.25 \]
\[ P(E|H) = 0.4 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.4 \cdot 0.25 + 0.5 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.1 + 0.375 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.475 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.25}{0.475} \approx 0.21 \]
