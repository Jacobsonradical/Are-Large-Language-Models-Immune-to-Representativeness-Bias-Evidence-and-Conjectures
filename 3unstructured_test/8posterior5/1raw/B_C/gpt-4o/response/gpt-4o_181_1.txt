To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \), we need to use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have concrete values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \), we'll make educated estimates based on the personality sketch and the typical characteristics of students in each field.

1. **Business Administration**
   - \( P(H) \): Assume there is a moderate base rate of students in business administration. Let's estimate this at 0.2.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The personality traits provided (love for nature, solving puzzles, empathy, love for animals) are not strongly indicative of business administration. They are somewhat neutral or even less typical for someone in this field. Let's estimate this at 0.1.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Considering that there are many other fields for graduate students, some of which are more likely to align with Adam's personality, let's estimate this at 0.3.

   Bayes Rule calculation:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)}
   \]

2. **Computer Science**
   - \( P(H) \): Given the high rate of enrollment in this field, let's estimate this at 0.3.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The traits mentioned (solving puzzles, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts) are typical of many in computer science, despite not all of them loving nature or animals specifically. Estimate this at 0.4.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): As above, let's estimate this at 0.3.

   Bayes Rule calculation:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)}
   \]

Without the exact value of \( P(E) \), we can compare relative likelihoods.

For Business Administration:
\[ 
  P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02 
\]

For Computer Science:
\[ 
  P(H|E) \propto 0.4 \times 0.3 = 0.12 
\]

Thus, relatively speaking, Adam is significantly more likely to be in Computer Science than Business Administration.

The comparative values can be normalized (though not necessary unless adding up to 1) but offer a clear indication of stronger likelihoods.
