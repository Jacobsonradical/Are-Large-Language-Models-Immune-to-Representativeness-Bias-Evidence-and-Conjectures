To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or computer science given his personality sketch (E), we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Here's the approach we'll follow:

1. **P(H):** The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the field.
2. **P(E|H):** The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in the field.
3. **P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in the field.
4. Compute **P(H|E)** using Bayes' rule:  
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]

Let's analyze the two fields: business administration and computer science.

### 1. Business Administration
- **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Assuming all fields are equally probable, let's say the prior is 0.1 (It's a plausible initial assumption).
- **P(E|H):** Probability of Adam’s personality sketch given that he is in business administration. Given his love for nature, empathy, and intelligence, this could be somewhat relevant but not highly specific to business administration. We might assign a likelihood of 0.2.
- **P(E|\neg H):** Probability of Adam’s personality sketch given he is not in business administration. His interests in nature, animals, and puzzles do not strongly correlate with business administration, so this might be higher. We could assign a value around 0.7.

Given this:

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

### 2. Computer Science
- **P(H):** Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Let's assume the same prior: 0.1.
- **P(E|H):** Given the traits (high intelligence, solving puzzles, abstract concepts), this personality sketch has a stronger alignment. We might assign a likelihood of 0.7.
- **P(E|\neg H):** Assuming he is not in computer science, his characteristics might fit somewhat into other fields but less so. We might assign 0.4.

Given this:

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, we will normalize both probabilities so that we have a comparable context. Let's assume **P(E)** is approximately average across contexts for a while:

### Calculations
1. **Business Administration:**
   \[
   P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.02}{P(E)}
   \]

2. **Computer Science:**
   \[
   P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.07}{P(E)}
   \]

Normalizing these:
- Total = \(0.02 + 0.07 = 0.09\)

Finally:
1. **Business Administration:**
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.09} \approx 0.22
   \]

2. **Computer Science:**
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.07}{0.09} \approx 0.78
   \]

### Simplified Probabilities:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.22,
  "computer science": 0.78
}
```

These values represent the relative likelihood of Adam being enrolled in either of the specified fields given his personality sketch.
