Given the personality sketch of Adam, let's analyze the fields of study - computer science and business administration using Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) = The prior probability of the hypothesis (the likelihood of a randomly chosen graduate student being in that field).
- \( P(E|H) \) = The likelihood of evidence given the hypothesis (the likelihood of Adam having this personality sketch if he were in that field).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) = The likelihood of evidence given not the hypothesis (the likelihood of Adam having this personality sketch if he were not in that field).

For each field:

### Computer Science
- \( P(H) \): Let’s assume the prior probability of a graduate student being in computer science is relatively high due to its popularity, say 0.2 (20%).
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's high intelligence, abstract thinking, and enjoyment of puzzles, it is quite likely he might be in computer science. Let’s assume it to be 0.7 (70%).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given that not all graduate fields align with Adam's traits, let's assign a lower probability, say 0.3 (30%).

Using Bayes’ theorem to compute \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.14}{P(E)} \]

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): The likelihood of a randomly chosen graduate student being in business administration might be moderate, say 0.1 (10%).
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication, he might be suitable for business administration; let's assume a moderate likelihood of 0.4 (40%).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of him having this personality sketch while not being in business administration can be assumed similar to the non-CS field, let’s say 0.3 (30%).

Using Bayes’ theorem to compute \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.04}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields and we are comparing the relative probabilities, we can normalize them later if needed.

Evaluating relative probabilities:
- For Computer Science: \( 0.14 \)
- For Business Administration: \( 0.04 \)

We can now normalize these values (if needed) to sum to 1 for relative comparison:
- Normalizing factor = \( 0.14 + 0.04 = 0.18 \)
- Normalized for Computer Science: \( \frac{0.14}{0.18} \approx 0.777 \)
- Normalized for Business Administration: \( \frac{0.04}{0.18} \approx 0.222 \)

Thus, relative probabilities, not necessarily summing to 1 for computing comparison, let’s present the values between 0 and 1 as requested:

  "computer science": 0.777,
  "business administration": 0.222
