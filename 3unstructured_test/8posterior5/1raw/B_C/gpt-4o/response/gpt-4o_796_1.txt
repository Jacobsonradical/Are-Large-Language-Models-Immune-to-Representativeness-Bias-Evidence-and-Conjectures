To utilize Bayes' Rule for this problem, let's outline the details:

**P(H)**: Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the field.
**P(E|H)**: Probability of observing the evidence (personality sketch) if Adam was in that field.
**P(E|\neg H)**: Probability of observing the evidence if Adam was not in that field.
**P(H|E)**: Posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in the field given the personality sketch.

Let's start by making some educated guesses for P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|\neg H) for each field of study.

### Computer Science

**P(H):** 
- A reasonable prior might assume there are many graduate fields and computer science is a common one. Let's assume P(H) = 0.1.

**P(E|H):**
- Given Adam's traits of high intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts, this fits well with characteristics often associated with computer science students. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.7.

**P(E|\neg H):**
- Given that many fields could match his traits (e.g., biology, environmental science, math), let's assume P(E|\neg H) is moderately high, say 0.3.

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where,

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]

Substituting the values for computer science:

\[ P(E) = (0.7 \times 0.1) + (0.3 \times 0.9) = 0.07 + 0.27 = 0.34 \]

Now, compute P(H|E):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.1}{0.34} \approx 0.206 \]

### Business Administration

**P(H):** 
- Business administration is another common graduate field. Let's assume P(H) = 0.1.

**P(E|H):**
- Given Adam's empathy, warm heart, and understanding of hard work and dedication, these could fit a business administration profile, but less directly fitting abstract concepts and puzzle-solving. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.4.

**P(E|\neg H):**
- Again, given multiple fields could fit his personality traits, let's assume P(E|\neg H) = 0.3.

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(E) = (0.4 \times 0.1) + (0.3 \times 0.9) = 0.04 + 0.27 = 0.31 \]

Now, compute P(H|E):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.1}{0.31} \approx 0.129 \]

So, the answers are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.206,
  "business administration": 0.129
}
```
