To compute \( P(H|E) \), we'll utilize Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant, we can focus on the proportion of \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for each hypothesis. Let's assign the values for each term based on reasonable assumptions given Adam's personality and interests. First, I will estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for both fields.

**Business Administration**

- \( P(H) \) (prior): Business administration is a common field, so let's assume \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|H) \) (likelihood given hypothesis): As a field more oriented towards leadership, finance, and management, Adam's traits seem less aligned with this field, and more with sciences or environmental studies. Let's estimate \( P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) (likelihood given not the hypothesis): Given Adam's profile, it's more likely he fits into other academic fields more closely associated with his interests. So, let's assume \( P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) = 0.6 \).

**Computer Science**

- \( P(H) \) (prior): Computer Science is also a common field, so let's assume \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|H) \) (likelihood given hypothesis): His high intelligence, ability to solve puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts align well with computer science. Let's estimate \( P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.7 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) (likelihood given not the hypothesis): Again, taking other fields that fit Adamâ€™s characteristics into account, let's assume \( P(E|\neg \text{computer science}) = 0.5 \).

Now compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

For Business Administration:
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.2 \times 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.04}{P(E)} \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.7 \times 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.14}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is used to normalize this, we focus on the relative values:
\[ \frac{P(\text{business administration}|E)}{P(\text{computer science}|E + \text{other fields})} = \frac{0.04}{0.14 + P(\text{other fields}|E)} \]

To keep it straightforward, we consider relative probabilities rather than absolute ones. Therefore, the probability distribution is proportional to:

{
  "business administration": 0.04,
  "computer science": 0.14
}

Please note that these values are based on general estimates and the assumptions provided. The normalization step shows that Computer Science is more likely based on the personality sketch given.
