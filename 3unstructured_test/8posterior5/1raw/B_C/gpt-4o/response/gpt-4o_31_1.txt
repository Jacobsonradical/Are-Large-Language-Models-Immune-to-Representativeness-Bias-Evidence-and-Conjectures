To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch \(E\), we will use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:  
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \(H\) given evidence \(E\).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \(E\) given hypothesis \(H\).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \(H\).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of evidence \(E\) under all hypotheses.

Given the qualitative nature of the problem, we will make reasonable assumptions for these probabilities and provide a comparative analysis:

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. 
   - Let's estimate this as \(0.1\) because it's less common for highly empathetic and nature-oriented individuals to choose business administration compared to other fields, but still possible.

2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam having the given personality sketch if he is studying business administration.
   - Attributes like empathy and appreciation for hard work might align somewhat, but other traits such as interest in nature and puzzles are less aligned. Let's estimate this as \(0.2\).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of Adam having the given personality sketch if he is not studying business administration.
   - Since there are many other fields where this sketch fits better, this could be higher. Let's estimate this as \(0.5\).

4. **P(E)** is the overall probability of the personality sketch, but we won't need to calculate it explicitly, as it cancels out in the Bayes' rule formula.

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \]

### Computer Science
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
   - Given Adam's high intelligence and interest in abstract concepts and solving puzzles, computer science seems more likely. Let's estimate this as \(0.2\).

2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam having the given personality sketch if he is studying computer science.
   - Many traits align well with computer science, such as solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts. Let's estimate this as \(0.6\).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of Adam having the given personality sketch if he is not studying computer science.
   - This could be similar to the overall likelihood in other fields, so we will estimate it around \(0.4\).

\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.6 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]

### Final Probabilities
Without knowing the exact value of \(P(E)\), the probabilities will be relative to each other. Here's the comparison:

\[ 
\begin{aligned}
P(\text{business administration}|E) & = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.02}{P(E)}, \\
P(\text{computer science}|E) & = \frac{0.6 \times 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.12}{P(E)}.
\end{aligned} 
\]

Thus, the relative probabilities, normalized (assuming \(P(E)\) cancels out), are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.12
}
```

This indicates that based on the given personality sketch, Adam is more likely to have been studying computer science than business administration.
