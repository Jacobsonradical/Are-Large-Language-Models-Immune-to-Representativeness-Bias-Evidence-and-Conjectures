To estimate the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in either business administration or computer science, let's break it down using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

### For Business Administration

1. **\( P(H) \):** The prior probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in business administration. Because business administration is a commonly pursued graduate field, let's estimate it at 0.2.

2. **\( P(E|H) \):** The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is in business administration. Business administration students may have varied personalities, but someone with strong empathy, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work could fit, although it is not strongly typical. Let's estimate this at 0.3.

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \):** The likelihood of observing Adam's traits given that he is NOT in business administration. This includes all other fields. Given the traits provided, we might assume fields like environmental science or biology are more likely, so we'll estimate this at 0.7.

### For Computer Science

1. **\( P(H) \):** The prior probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in computer science. Computer science is also a very popular graduate field, so let's estimate this at 0.2 as well.

2. **\( P(E|H) \):** The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is in computer science. Computer science students typically have high intelligence and enjoy solving puzzles, which fits Adam's description well. Nevertheless, empathy and a deep love for nature are less stereotypical. So, let's estimate this likelihood at 0.5.

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \):** The likelihood of observing Adam's traits given that he is NOT in computer science. Like before, we'll consider that Adam's traits align better with some fields other than computer science, so we'll estimate this at 0.6.

### Computing the Probabilities

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we are only interested in comparing the relative likelihoods and don't have the exact value of \( P(E) \), we can simplify by comparing the numerators of Bayes' rule for each hypothesis.

For business administration (\( P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} \)):

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.3 \cdot 0.2 = 0.06 \]

For computer science (\( P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} \)):

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.5 \cdot 0.2 = 0.1 \]

Comparing these relative probabilities:

\[ \frac{P(H|E)_{\text{BA}}}{P(H|E)_{\text{CS}}} = \frac{0.06}{0.1} = 0.6 \]

Now, converting to a scale between 0 and 1:

\[ \text{Normalized \ } P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.1} = \frac{0.06}{0.16} \approx 0.375 \]
\[ \text{Normalized \ } P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} = \frac{0.1}{0.06 + 0.1} = \frac{0.1}{0.16} \approx 0.625 \]

So, the approximate probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.375,
  "computer science": 0.625
}
```
