To use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \) — the probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch — we need to consider the following probabilities for each field:

1. \( P(H) \) — the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the field.
2. \( P(E|H) \) — the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) — the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in that field.

Given:
Bayes' rule formula is:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) \) is the normalization factor across all possible fields (but we don't need it since we're comparing relative probabilities).

### Assumptions and Values

#### 1. Computer Science
- \( P(H) \) — Since Computer Science is a common field for graduate studies, let's assume \( P(\text{H}) = 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|H) \) — For a Computer Science student, attributes like "high intelligence" and "good at understanding abstract concepts" are likely, but "genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants" and "strong empathy" might be less common. Let's assume \( P(E|\text{H}) = 0.3 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) — This is harder to judge, but given that Adam's personality sketch is somewhat specific, let's assume a moderate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

#### 2. Business Administration
- \( P(H) \) — Business Administration is also a common field, so let's assume \( P(\text{H}) = 0.15 \).
- \( P(E|H) \) — Attributes like "warm heart" and "strong empathy" might align with Business Administration students focusing on leadership and human resources, but the specific interest in nature and puzzles might not. Let's assume \( P(E|\text{H}) = 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) — Let's use the same value as before, \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

Now we compute \( P(H|E) \).

### Calculation

1. **Computer Science**
\[ P(\text{H}|\text{E}) = \frac{P(\text{E}|\text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.06}{P(E)} \]

2. **Business Administration**
\[ P(\text{H}|\text{E}) = \frac{P(\text{E}|\text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} = \frac{0.03}{P(E)} \]

To compare the relative probabilities, we can drop the common denominator \(P(E)\):

- For Computer Science: \(0.06\)
- For Business Administration: \(0.03\)

Converting these into probabilities relative to each other (by normalization):

1. Summing the values: \(0.06 + 0.03 = 0.09\)
2. Normalizing:
   - Computer Science: \( \frac{0.06}{0.09} \approx 0.67 \)
   - Business Administration: \( \frac{0.03}{0.09} \approx 0.33 \)

### Final Answer
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.67,
  "business administration": 0.33
}
```
Note that these values indicate relative probabilities given the personality sketch and our assumptions about the probabilities.
