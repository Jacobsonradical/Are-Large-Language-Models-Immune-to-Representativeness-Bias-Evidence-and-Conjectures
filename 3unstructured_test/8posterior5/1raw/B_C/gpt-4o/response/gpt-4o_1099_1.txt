Alright, let's analyze the given information and compute the probabilities:

### Hypotheses:
- **H(CS)**: Adam was enrolled in Computer Science.
- **H(BA)**: Adam was enrolled in Business Administration.

### Given Information:
- **E**: Personality sketch of Adam.

### Prior Probabilities:
- **P(H(CS))**: Estimated prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science.
- **P(H(BA))**: Estimated prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration.

Since there are many fields Adam could be enrolled in, let's assume these are just two possible careers and use reasonable priors for graduate fields in the U.S.:

- Let’s assume **P(H(CS)) = 0.2** as Computer Science is a popular field.
- And **P(H(BA)) = 0.15** for Business Administration.

### Likelihoods:
- **P(E|H(CS))**: Probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is in Computer Science.
- **P(E|H(BA))**: Probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is in Business Administration.

Given the personality sketch:
- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and various plants – aligns with fields like biology, environmental sciences more than computer science or business administration.
- Enjoys solving puzzles – this aligns with Computer Science due to problem-solving elements.
- Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals – less strong connection to Computer Science and Business Administration.
- High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts – aligns with both fields, but the other traits make CS more likely.

Let’s estimate:
- **P(E|H(CS)) = 0.3**: Some alignment with puzzles and high intelligence make the fit plausible but not perfect.
- **P(E|H(BA)) = 0.1**: Less alignment with the traits given.

### Complementary Likelihoods:
- **P(E|\neg H(CS))**: Probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in Computer Science. Estimated as supplementary likelihoods spread across all other fields.
- **P(E|\neg H(BA))**: Probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in Business Administration.

Assume:
- **P(E|\neg H(CS)) = 0.7**
- **P(E|\neg H(BA)) = 0.9**

### Bayesian Update:

1. **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H(CS|E)) = \frac{P(E|H(CS)) * P(H(CS))}{P(E|H(CS)) * P(H(CS)) + P(E|\neg H(CS)) * P(\neg H(CS))} \]
\[ P(H(CS|E)) = \frac{0.3 * 0.2}{0.3 * 0.2 + 0.7 * 0.8} \]
\[ P(H(CS|E)) = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.56} \]
\[ P(H(CS|E)) = \frac{0.06}{0.62} \]
\[ P(H(CS|E)) = 0.097 \]

2. **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H(BA|E)) = \frac{P(E|H(BA)) * P(H(BA))}{P(E|H(BA)) * P(H(BA)) + P(E|\neg H(BA)) * P(\neg H(BA))} \]
\[ P(H(BA|E)) = \frac{0.1 * 0.15}{0.1 * 0.15 + 0.9 * 0.85} \]
\[ P(H(BA|E)) = \frac{0.015}{0.015 + 0.765} \]
\[ P(H(BA|E)) = \frac{0.015}{0.78} \]
\[ P(H(BA|E)) = 0.019 \]

### Final Answer:
{
  "computer science": 0.097,
  "business administration": 0.019
}
