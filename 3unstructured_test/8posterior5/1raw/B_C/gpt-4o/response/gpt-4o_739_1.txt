To estimate the posterior probability P(H|E) that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or computer science given his personality sketch (E), we'll use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in a certain field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in a certain field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch (can be considered as a normalizing constant).

Assumptions:
1. The priors \(P(H)\) for business administration and computer science are assumed to be equal and reasonably probable for a graduate student, say \(P(H) = 0.1\) for business administration and \(P(H) = 0.1\) for computer science.
2. The likelihoods \(P(E|H)\) and \(P(E|\neg H)\) must be estimated based on Adam's personality sketch.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\) will be used for normalization but exact values can be complex to compute directly without data. We will assume \(P(E|\neg H)\) to assign reasonable guessing.

Given Adam's characteristics, it's plausible that his love for nature, intelligence, and problem-solving might align better with fields like biology, environmental science, or even computer science over business administration.

### Estimations

- \(P(E|H_{ba})\): Likelihood of Adam being in business administration is relatively low because his traits do not strongly align with business administration.
- \(P(E|H_{cs})\): Likelihood that Adam's traits (love for problem-solving, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts) fit well for computer science is high.

So, we can roughly estimate:

- \(P(E|H_{ba}) \approx 0.2\)
- \(P(E|H_{cs}) \approx 0.7\)
- To compute \(P(E)\), we simplify and use normalization but estimate \(P(E) = 0.3\) for convenience.

### Calculations

For business administration:
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{ba}) \cdot P(H_{ba})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.3} \approx 0.067 \]

For computer science:
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.3} \approx 0.233 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities can be approximated as:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.067,
  "computer science": 0.233
}
