To calculate the probability that Adam was enrolled in each field based on the personality sketch provided, we'll need to use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's break down the terms:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the evidence given that Adam is enrolled in the specific field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the evidence given that Adam is not enrolled in the specific field.
- \( P(E) \): The total probability of the evidence, which can be difficult to calculate directly but can be inferred relative to other fields.

Let's estimate these probabilities qualitatively:

### Computer Science
- \( P(H_{cs}) \) (Prior for Computer Science): This can be relatively common among graduate students, so let's assume a moderate prior probability. Let's set it at 0.2.
- \( P(E|H_{cs}) \) (Evidence given Computer Science): Adam is highly intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, both of which are characteristics beneficial for computer science. Therefore, \( P(E|H_{cs}) \) could be high, say 0.8.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{cs}) \) (Evidence given not Computer Science): Given Adam's characteristics, they could fit other fields as well. Let's estimate the probability that his personality traits align with fields other than computer science to be moderately low, say 0.4.

### Business Administration
- \( P(H_{ba}) \) (Prior for Business Administration): This field is also common among graduate students, so we can assume a similar prior probability to computer science. Let's set this also at 0.2.
- \( P(E|H_{ba}) \) (Evidence given Business Administration): Adam has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication but factors like love for nature, plants, and animals do not particularly align with business administration. Let's estimate this probability to be lower, say 0.2.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{ba}) \) (Evidence given not Business Administration): As with computer science, his traits could fit other fields. Since he has traits that do not strongly align with business administration, we'll set this slightly higher, at 0.6.

Now, let's plug these into Bayes' theorem:

### Computer Science
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{ba}) \cdot P(H_{ba})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

Since we are comparing two probabilities, and \( P(E) \) is the same for both calculations, we can ignore \( P(E) \) and simply compare the numerators for a relative likelihood.

### Relative Comparisons
For computer science:
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.2 = 0.16 \]

For business administration:
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.2 = 0.04 \]

Now, normalize them to get probabilities between 0 and 1. The sum of these relative probabilities will be our normalizing factor:

\[ \text{Sum} = 0.16 + 0.04 = 0.2 \]

\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{0.16}{0.2} = 0.8 \]
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.2} = 0.2 \]

The final answer is:

{
  "computer science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
