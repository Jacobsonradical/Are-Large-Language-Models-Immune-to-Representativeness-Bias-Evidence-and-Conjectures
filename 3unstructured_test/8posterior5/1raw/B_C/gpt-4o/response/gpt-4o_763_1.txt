To determine \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). Here's a detailed breakdown of the steps:

1. **Priors \( P(H) \)**
   - **Computer Science**: Considering the popularity of this field among graduate students and its relevance to high intelligence and abstract thinking, let's assign a prior probability of 0.2.
   - **Business Administration**: Considering this is also a popular field but maybe less aligned with Adam’s interests and personality as described, let's assign a prior probability of 0.1.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**
   - **Computer Science**: High intelligence and an enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with this field. However, the love for nature, plants, and animals might not be as strong a fit. Let's assign \( P(E|H) \) a value of 0.4.
   - **Business Administration**: The traits mentioned (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals) don't align very well with what one typically associates with Business Administration. Let’s assign \( P(E|H) \) a value of 0.1.

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**
   - For fields other than Computer Science or Business Administration, we consider how well the personality sketch fits other potential graduate fields (like biology, environmental science, etc.), which might be a better fit. This could be relatively high.
   - Assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \) for both Computer Science and Business Administration since these fields are not the most obvious fits compared to fields related to nature or animals.

We can then calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Assuming \( P(E) \) is the normalization constant, we don't need the exact value as we are comparing proportions, so we use proxy values to set up the ratio.

### Calculations

#### Computer Science
\[
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H)P(H) = 0.4 \times 0.2 = 0.08
\]

#### Business Administration
\[
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H)P(H) = 0.1 \times 0.1 = 0.01
\]

We'll list these as simplified (relative) probabilities:

\[
P(H|E)_{\text{Computer Science}} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.01} = \frac{0.08}{0.09} \approx 0.89
\]
\[
P(H|E)_{\text{Business Administration}} = \frac{0.01}{0.08 + 0.01} = \frac{0.01}{0.09} \approx 0.11
\]

### Results
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.89,
  "business administration": 0.11
}
```

These values are proportional probabilities, indicating that given the personality sketch and the priors, Adam is much more likely to be enrolled in Computer Science than in Business Administration.
