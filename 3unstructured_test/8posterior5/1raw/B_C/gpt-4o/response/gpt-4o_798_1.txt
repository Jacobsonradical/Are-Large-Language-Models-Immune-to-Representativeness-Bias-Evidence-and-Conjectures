To compute the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\) for each field using Bayes' Rule, we first need to establish the prior probabilities \(P(H)\), the likelihoods \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E|\neg H)\). Note that these values are based on reasonable estimates given Adam's personality sketch and the general characteristics of each field.

### Assumptions:
- Prior probabilities \(P(H)\) are the relative likelihoods of Adam enrolling in each field based on their general popularity among graduate students.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is enrolled in the specified field.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\) is the probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is not enrolled in the specified field.

### Estimations:

#### Computer Science:
- **Prior \(P(H_{CS})\):** Let's assume that 10% of graduate students choose to study computer science.
- **Likelihood \(P(E|H_{CS})\):** Computer science students often have high intelligence and enjoy solving puzzles. However, strong empathy and a love for nature are less common traits. So, let's estimate \(P(E|H_{CS})\) at 0.4.
- **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H_{CS})\):** Given Adam's traits, excluding computer science leaves fields where empathy and nature interest are more common. Let's estimate \(P(E|\neg H_{CS})\) at 0.6.

Using these values, we can compute the posterior \(P(H_{CS}|E)\).

#### Business Administration:
- **Prior \(P(H_{BA})\):** Let's assume that 15% of graduate students choose to study business administration.
- **Likelihood \(P(E|H_{BA})\):** Students in business administration might be good at understanding abstract concepts and appreciating hard work, but the personality traits related to nature and empathy are less common. So, let's estimate \(P(E|H_{BA})\) at 0.2.
- **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H_{BA})\):** Similarly, excluding business administration, we find fields aligning more with Adam's traits. Let's estimate \(P(E|\neg H_{BA})\) at 0.7.

Using these values, we can compute the posterior \(P(H_{BA}|E)\).

### Calculations:
Bayes' Rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \)

For each field:

#### Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.1}{(0.4 \times 0.1) + (0.6 \times 0.9)} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.54} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.58} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \approx 0.069 \]

#### Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.15}{(0.2 \times 0.15) + (0.7 \times 0.85)} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.595} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.625} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx 0.048 \]

Here is the final answer in the specified format:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.069,
  "business administration": 0.048
}
```

Note: These values are approximate and based on assumed likelihoods and priors.
