To address the problem using Bayes' rule, we need to assess the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence probabilities \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each hypothesis \( H \).

Let \( H_1 \) represent "Adam was enrolled in computer science" and \( H_2 \) represent "Adam was enrolled in business administration." E is the personality sketch of Adam.

### Computer Science (H₁)
- **P(H₁):** The prior probability that any given graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in computer science. Let's assume a reasonable prior probability of 0.15 (15%), as computer science is a relatively common field for graduate students.
- **P(E|H₁):** The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in computer science. While curiosity about nature and a love for plants is less typical for computer science students than for other fields, his high intelligence, problem-solving skills, and appreciation for hard work align well with this field. We could place this likelihood at 0.3.
- **P(E|¬H₁):** The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in computer science. Considering that biology, environmental science, or psychology might fit his personality better, let's set this at 0.6.

### Business Administration (H₂)
- **P(H₂):** The prior probability that any given graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in business administration. Let's assume a reasonable prior probability of 0.1 (10%).
- **P(E|H₂):** The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in business administration. This field seems less compatible with his strong empathy, love for nature, and animals, but partially compatible due to his abstract thinking and intelligence. We could estimate this at 0.1.
- **P(E|¬H₂):** The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in business administration. Here, we assume similar to above that non-business fields might be a better match. Let's set this at 0.7.

Now, using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \).

For computer science:
\[ P(H₁|E) = \frac{P(E|H₁) \cdot P(H₁)}{P(E|H₁) \cdot P(H₁) + P(E|¬H₁) \cdot P(¬H₁)} \]
\[ P(H₁|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.15}{(0.3 \times 0.15) + (0.6 \times 0.85)} \]
\[ P(H₁|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.51} \]
\[ P(H₁|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.555} \]
\[ P(H₁|E) \approx 0.0811 \]

For business administration:
\[ P(H₂|E) = \frac{P(E|H₂) \cdot P(H₂)}{P(E|H₂) \cdot P(H₂) + P(E|¬H₂) \cdot P(¬H₂)} \]
\[ P(H₂|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.1}{(0.1 \times 0.1) + (0.7 \times 0.9)} \]
\[ P(H₂|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.63} \]
\[ P(H₂|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.64} \]
\[ P(H₂|E) \approx 0.0156 \]

Therefore, the probabilities are:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.0811,
  "business administration": 0.0156
}
```
