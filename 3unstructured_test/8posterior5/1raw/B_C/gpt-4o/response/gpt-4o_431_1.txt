To solve this, we'll use Bayes' Theorem, which is defined as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( H \) is the hypothesis that Adam is in a specific field.
- \( E \) is the evidence, which in this case is the personality sketch of Adam.

We need to estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field, then compute \( P(H|E) \).

### Given Information
- \( E \): The personality sketch of Adam.
- We don't have exact probabilities but can make educated estimations based on the provided information and common trends.

### Estimations

#### Computer Science
- **P(H)**: The prior probability of a graduate student being in computer science. Given many graduate students are in CS, let's estimate \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \) (i.e., 20%).
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he's in computer science. Adam's empathy, love for nature, and animals are somewhat related to what many people in CS might have (problem-solving). Let’s estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's traits if he is not in computer science. Given that these traits are wide-ranging and can fit many other fields, let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.15 \).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.2} = 0.3 \]

#### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: The prior probability of a graduate student being in business administration. It's less common compared to CS in some contexts, let's estimate \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \) (i.e., 10%).
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in business administration. The empathy and appreciation for hard work fit well here, so let’s estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's traits if he is not in business administration. Again, due to the wide-ranging nature of his traits, let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.15 \).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.2} = 0.1 \]

Summarizing:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
