To solve this problem, we need to use Bayesian statistics. Bayes' theorem in this context can be written as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence \( E \).

Let’s assess the hypotheses for the fields of business administration and computer science.

1. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H_{BA}) \): The prior probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in business administration. Let’s assume it’s relatively common, although not as common as STEM fields. We might assign this a prior of about 0.15 or 15%.
   - \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): The likelihood that Adam’s personality sketch fits a business administration student. Since Adam has traits like empathy and strong appreciation for hard work which might fit MBA students, but other traits like a deep love for nature and animals and solving puzzles are less typical, we might estimate this to be lower, say 0.05 or 5%.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \): The likelihood of the evidence considering all students who are not in business administration. This may be relatively high since Adam’s traits fit well with other fields, particularly in natural sciences or psychology, which often value curiosity about nature and empathy.
   - \( P(E) \): This can be computed but is complex; for simplicity, we'll focus on the ratios.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H_{CS}) \): The prior probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in computer science. Given the popularity of computer science courses, we might assign this a higher prior, say 0.25 or 25%.
   - \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): The likelihood that Adam’s personality sketch fits a computer science student. Given Adam's high intelligence and love for solving puzzles, this fits quite well. However, traits like deep love for nature and animals might be less common, so we might estimate this to be around 0.20 or 20%.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \): The likelihood of the evidence considering all students who are not in computer science. Similar to the previous case, this is high.
   - \( P(E) \): As before, we'll focus on the ratios.

Let’s simplify the calculations to find \( P(H_{BA}|E) \) and \( P(H_{CS}|E) \):

\[
P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)}
\]
\[
P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)}
\]

For the likelihoods and priors:
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.05 \)
- \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(E) \) (normalized)
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.25 \)

Now calculate the normalized posterior probabilities:

Normalized for simplicity:
\[
P(H_{BA}|E) \approx \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.15}{0.05 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.25} = \frac{0.0075}{0.0575} \approx 0.13
\]
\[
P(H_{CS}|E) \approx \frac{0.20 \cdot 0.25}{0.05 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.25} = \frac{0.05}{0.0575} \approx 0.87
\]

Thus, the approximate posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.13,
  "computer science": 0.87
}
```
