First, let's analyze the probabilities required for Bayes' theorem:

Bayes' theorem formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch being true given Adam is in that specific field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that specific field.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the personality sketch, which can be broken down as \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Since we donâ€™t have specific numerical values for these probabilities, we'll make reasonable estimates based on the personality sketch and general knowledge about common traits in these fields.

### Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - The general enrollment distribution among graduate students in the U.S. does not heavily favor computer science over other fields. P(H) might be around 0.2 (assuming there are five major fields).
  
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - The traits described (high intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts) are moderately common in computer science students.
   - Traits such as strong empathy and love for animals are less common among computer science students.
   - We might estimate \( P(E|H) \) around 0.4.

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - For fields other than computer science, the probability of having this personality profile might be somewhat lower, say 0.2.
  
#### Calculation:
\[ P(H|E)_{cs} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.2 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.08}{0.16 + 0.16} = \frac{0.08}{0.32} = 0.25 \]

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Enrollment in business administration has a similar general likelihood to computer science. P(H) might be around 0.2 as well.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Business administration students may have strong appreciation for hard work, dedication, and potentially strong empathy, but the connection to high intelligence and abstract concepts is less clear.
   - We might estimate \( P(E|H) \) around 0.3.

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - Similar to the above, the probability for non-business administration fields may be around 0.2.
  
#### Calculation:
\[ P(H|E)_{ba} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.2 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.16} = \frac{0.06}{0.22} \approx 0.27 \]

### Final Results

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.25,
  "business administration": 0.27
}
```

These values represent the probability, given the provided personality sketch, that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or business administration as a graduate student in 2021.
