To compute the probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science or business administration given his personality sketch, we need to use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem is calculated as follows:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's consider each field separately:

### Computer Science
1. **P(H):** The general probability that a graduate student is enrolled in computer science. For simplicity, let's assume this is 0.3 (30%), as computer science is a popular field but not the most common one.

2. **P(E|H):** The probability of observing Adam’s personality traits given that he is a computer science student. Given that Adam has high intelligence and enjoys solving puzzles, and has an understanding of abstract concepts, these traits align well with computer science. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.7.

3. **P(E|¬H):** The probability of observing Adam’s personality traits given that he is not a computer science student. Given that these traits can also be present in other fields but might be less strongly aligned compared to computer science, let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.4.

### Business Administration
1. **P(H):** The general probability that a graduate student is enrolled in business administration. For simplicity, let's assume this is 0.2 (20%).

2. **P(E|H):** The probability of observing Adam’s personality traits given that he is a business administration student. While empathy and understanding of hard work might align with business administration, the love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles less so. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.3.

3. **P(E|¬H):** The probability of observing Adam’s personality traits given that he is not a business administration student. Let’s assume P(E|¬H) = 0.4.

Next, we use Bayes' theorem to compute \( P(H|E) \):

### Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]
Since \( ¬H \) covers all other fields except computer science:
\[ P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.7 \]

\[ P(E) = 0.7 \cdot 0.3 + 0.4 \cdot 0.7 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.21 + 0.28 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.49 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.3}{0.49} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.21}{0.49} \]
\[ P(H|E) ≈ 0.428 \]

### Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]
Since \( ¬H \) covers all other fields except business administration:
\[ P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.8 \]

\[ P(E) = 0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.06 + 0.32 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.38 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.38} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.38} \]
\[ P(H|E) ≈ 0.158 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities that Adam is enrolled in computer science or business administration given his personality sketch are:

{
  "computer science": 0.428,
  "business administration": 0.158
}
