To compute the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in computer science (H_cs) or business administration (H_ba), we use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

First, let’s assign prior probabilities and likelihoods based on the provided sketch and general information about these fields.

### Step-by-Step Calculation

1. **Prior Probability, P(H)**:
   - **Computer Science (P(H_cs))**: Given the rise in demand for computer science graduates and Adam's intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts, let's assume a prior probability of 0.2.
   - **Business Administration (P(H_ba))**: Considering business administration might be less aligned with Adam's quiet nature and love for animals, but not impossible, let's assign a prior probability of 0.1.

2. **Likelihood, P(E|H)**:
   - **Computer Science (P(E|H_cs))**: Adam’s intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts fit well with computer science. Thus, let's assign a likelihood of 0.7.
   - **Business Administration (P(E|H_ba))**: Adam's qualities like a warm heart and strong empathy could be useful in business administration, although not as closely aligned with the sketch. Assign a likelihood of 0.3.

3. **Complementary Likelihood, P(E|¬H)**:
   - **Computer Science (P(E|¬H_cs))**: We assume the complementary likelihood should be lower as fewer non-CS fields align so well with the sketch, so let’s assign 0.4.
   - **Business Administration (P(E|¬H_ba))**: Non-business fields could align better with Adam’s nature-based and animal-oriented qualities. Let’s assign 0.6.

4. **Bayes' Rule Calculation**:

   \[
   P(H_cs|E) = \frac{P(E|H_cs) \cdot P(H_cs)}{P(E|H_cs) \cdot P(H_cs) + P(E|¬H_cs) \cdot P(¬H_cs)}  
   \]
   \[
   P(H_ba|E) = \frac{P(E|H_ba) \cdot P(H_ba)}{P(E|H_ba) \cdot P(H_ba) + P(E|¬H_ba) \cdot P(¬H_ba)}  
   \]

   For computer science:
   \[
   P(H_cs|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{(0.7 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8)} = \frac{0.14}{0.14 + 0.32} = \frac{0.14}{0.46} \approx 0.304 
   \]

   For business administration:
   \[
   P(H_ba|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{(0.3 \cdot 0.1 + 0.6 \cdot 0.9)} = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.54} = \frac{0.03}{0.57} \approx 0.053 
   \]

⁉️ Total might not sum to 1 because other fields might be considered.
