To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' theorem, we need to consider both prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood of the evidence under the hypothesis's complement \( P(E|\neg H) \).

### Business Administration
**P(H)**: Let's assign \( P(H) \), the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration, as 0.1 (since fewer graduate students are generally expected to be in this field compared to STEM fields).

**P(E|H)**: Given the field of business administration, it seems less compatible with Adam's described interests and personality traits such as his empathy for animals, love for nature, and solving puzzles. While it's not impossible, it's less likely. We can assign a low value, say 0.05.

**P(E|\neg H)**: This represents the probability of observing the traits in Adam's sketch if he is in a field other than business administration. Adam's traits seem more compatible with other fields (like environmental science or related fields), we can assign a relatively high value, say 0.6.

Applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Since \( P(E) \) can be expanded as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
Substituting the values for the business administration:
\[ P(E) = 0.05 \cdot 0.1 + 0.6 \cdot 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.005 + 0.54 = 0.545 \]
Now calculate \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{0.545} \approx 0.0092 \]

### Computer Science
**P(H)**: Let’s assign \( P(H) \), the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science, as 0.2 (since it's a fairly common field for graduate students).

**P(E|H)**: Given the field of computer science, his enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence fits well, though his empathy and love for nature are less directly applicable. Let’s assume a value of 0.2.

**P(E|\neg H)**: This indicates the likelihood of observing his personality traits if he is not in computer science. Given that his traits align better with fields like environmental science or biology, compared to computer science, we should assign it a slightly higher probability than for business administration but lower than for fields more aligned with his interests. Say 0.5.

Applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H)) \]
Substituting the values:
\[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.4 = 0.44 \]
Now calculate \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.44} \approx 0.0909 \]

### Final Answers
Combining these calculations, we get:
