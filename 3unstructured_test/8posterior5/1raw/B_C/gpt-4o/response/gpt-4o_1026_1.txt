Let's use the following notation:

- \( P(H_{cs}) \): The prior probability that Adam is a graduate student in computer science.
- \( P(E|H_{cs}) \): The probability of Adam's personality traits given that he is a graduate student in computer science.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{cs}) \): The probability of Adam's personality traits given that he is not a graduate student in computer science.
- \( P(H_{ba}) \): The prior probability that Adam is a graduate student in business administration.
- \( P(E|H_{ba}) \): The probability of Adam's personality traits given that he is a graduate student in business administration.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{ba}) \): The probability of Adam's personality traits given that he is not a graduate student in business administration.

### Computer Science
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H_{cs}) \)**: Suppose the probability that a graduate student is in computer science is fairly common. Let's estimate it around 0.2.
2. **Probability \( P(E|H_{cs}) \)**: A person with an appreciation for solving puzzles and high intelligence might fit well in computer science. Let's estimate this around 0.4.
3. **Probability \( P(E|\neg H_{cs}) \)**: The traits could also apply to other fields but maybe less so. Let's take this as 0.2.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs})}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be expressed as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs}) + P(E|\neg H_{cs}) \cdot P(\neg H_{cs}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.2 \cdot 0.8 = 0.08 + 0.16 = 0.24 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.24} \approx 0.33 \]

### Business Administration
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H_{ba}) \)**: Suppose the probability that a graduate student is in business administration is less common compared to computer science. Let's estimate it around 0.1.
2. **Probability \( P(E|H_{ba}) \)**: A person with a warm heart, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could fit in business administration. Let's estimate this around 0.3.
3. **Probability \( P(E|\neg H_{ba}) \)**: As before, these traits could apply to other fields but maybe less so. Let's take this as 0.2.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{ba}) \cdot P(H_{ba})}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) (combined for all fields) stays the same:
\[ P(E) = 0.24 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.24} \approx 0.125 \]

Finally, the results are:

```
{
  "computer science": 0.33,
  "business administration": 0.125
}
```
