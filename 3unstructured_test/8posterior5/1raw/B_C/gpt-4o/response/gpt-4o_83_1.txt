To compute the posterior probabilities using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the overall probabilities \( P(E|\neg H) \). Here \(\neg H\) represents Adam being in any other field except \( H \).

Here are the steps:

1. **Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)**: Let's assume some rough priors for Adam being in each field of specialization.
   - P(computer science): There are many graduate fields, but computer science is a popular one. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
   - P(business administration): Business administration is also a popular field, but Adam's interests don't immediately align with it. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).

2. **Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \)**: How likely is E given H?
   - P(E|computer science): While computer science can interest people with curiosity and puzzle-solving skills, love for nature and animals is less typical. Let's assign a middling likelihood: \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \).
   - P(E|business administration): Adam's traits don't strongly align with traditional business administration roles. We'll assign a lower likelihood: \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).

3. **Overall Probability \( P(E|\neg H) \)**
   - This is more complex; we've assumed that Adam has many fields that could fit his personality traits better than the above two. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.7 \).

With these assumptions, we can calculate the posterior probabilities using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We don't need to calculate \( P(E) \) directly. Instead, we can compare the relative measures for each field of study:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

4. **Calculate posterior for each field:**
- For computer science:
  \[
  P(H|E)_{\text{computer science}} \propto 0.4 \times 0.1 = 0.04
  \]
- For business administration:
  \[
  P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} \propto 0.2 \times 0.05 = 0.01
  \]

5. **Normalize if necessary (optional, for a relative comparison we don't have to):**
Since we are asked for a value between 0 and 1 but not a probability, our figures represent the proportional likelihood.

Here's the formatted answer:

{
  "computer science": 0.04,
  "business administration": 0.01
}
