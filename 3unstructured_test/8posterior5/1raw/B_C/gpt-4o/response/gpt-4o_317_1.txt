To compute the probabilities, we need to make reasonable estimates for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field. These estimates will help us apply Bayes' rule to determine \( P(H|E) \).

1. **Business Administration**
    - \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Assuming Adam could be enrolled in various fields with a reasonable spread, let's estimate \( P(H) \) for business administration as 0.1 (10%).
    - \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood that Adam's personality sketch would fit someone in business administration. Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love of animals, and appreciation for hard work, business administration doesn't clearly align with these traits. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) as 0.1 (10%).
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in business administration. Considering the number of fields that might better match his traits, we'll estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) as 0.3 (30%).

Using Bayes’ rule, \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \), where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H)) \).

    - \( P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) = 0.01 + 0.27 = 0.28 \)
    - \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.28} \approx 0.036 \) (approximately)

2. **Computer Science**
    - \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Similarly, let's estimate \( P(H) \) for computer science as 0.1 (10%).
    - \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood that Adam's personality sketch would fit someone in computer science. Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which aligns well with computer science. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) as 0.4 (40%).
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in computer science. We'll use the same estimate as above, which is 0.3 (30%).

Again, using Bayes’ rule:

    - \( P(E) = (0.4 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) = 0.04 + 0.27 = 0.31 \)
    - \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.1}{0.31} \approx 0.129 \) (approximately)

Therefore, the computed probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": 0.036,
  "computer science": 0.129
