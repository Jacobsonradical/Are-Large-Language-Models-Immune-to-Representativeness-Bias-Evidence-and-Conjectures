To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch, we will use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field.
-  \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in that specific field.

Because \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields, we focus on comparing the numerators \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

#### Assumptions
- \( P(H) \): For simplicity, let's assume the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in any given field is equal across all possible fields of study. Without additional information, we can use uniform priors.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): This requires assumptions about other fields Adam might be enrolled in and their fit to the sketch. This helps understand how unique the personality sketch is to each field.

Let's assign subjective probabilities based on the given personality sketch.

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: Assuming equal probability across many fields, let's estimate a general prior probability \( P(H) \) for business administration around 0.1 (since there are many fields of study).
- **P(E|H)**: Business administration might correlate moderately with high intelligence and understanding of hard work, but less directly with love for nature, animals, or puzzles. This might be considered lower. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The baseline probability of finding this personality sketch among non-business administration students assuming there are many fields equally likely could be lower. Let's say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.05 \).

\[ P(H|E)_{business\ administration} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = 0.02 / P(E) \]

### Computer Science
- **P(H)**: Assuming equal probability across many fields, same prior \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
- **P(E|H)**: Computer science might have a good fit with high intelligence, puzzle-solving, and abstract thinking. Although not directly tied to nature or animals, the rest fits well. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.6 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The baseline probability of finding this personality sketch in non-computer science fields could be lower as the fit with puzzle-solving and abstract thinking is more specific. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

\[ P(H|E)_{computer\ science} = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = 0.06 / P(E) \]

### Relative Comparisons
To normalize and compare posterior probabilities:

\[ P(H|E)_{business\ administration} = \frac{0.02}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{computer\ science} = \frac{0.06}{P(E)} \]

Since these need to be relative values without P(E):

\[
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.06
}
\]

Note: These values are subjectively-assigned probabilities for illustrative purposes; actual probabilities require domain-specific data.
