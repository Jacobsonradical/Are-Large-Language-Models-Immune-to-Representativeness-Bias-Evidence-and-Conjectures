To solve this problem using Bayes' rule, we need to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field (business administration and computer science), given the personality sketch \( E \). Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

### Step 1: Estimating \( P(H) \) (the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field)
- **business administration:**
  Let's assume the prior probability \( P(H) = 0.2 \). This is a reasonable estimate assuming that business administration is one possible field among many in a graduate school.
  
- **computer science:**
  Let's assume the prior probability \( P(H) = 0.3 \). This is again an estimate considering that computer science is a common field among graduate students.

### Step 2: Estimating \( P(E|H) \) (the likelihood of observing the personality sketch if Adam is enrolled in each field)
- **business administration:**
  Considering the personality traits like a genuine curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals, it seems less likely for a typical business administration student compared to some other attributes. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

- **computer science:**
  Considering traits like high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, solving puzzles, and being quiet, these align more closely with a typical computer science student. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \).

### Step 3: Estimating \( P(E|\neg H) \) (the likelihood of observing the personality sketch if Adam is not enrolled in each field)
- **business administration:**
  If Adam is not enrolled in business administration, the probability of observing the personality sketch (curiosity about nature, empathy, puzzle-solving, etc.) could be higher. Suppose \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

- **computer science:**
  For computer science, the common graduate field has a personality sketch alignment. Suppose \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

### Step 4: Computing \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule

**For business administration:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

**For computer science:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a constant for both cases:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{business}) \cdot P(H_{business}) + P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs}) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For simplicity in comparison, letâ€™s focus on the numerator:
\[ \text{business administration: } 0.02 \]
\[ \text{computer science: } 0.12 \]

Evaluating proportionality:
\[ P(H|E) \propto \frac{0.02}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto \frac{0.12}{P(E)} \]

The relative probabilities are as follows:
\[ \text{business administration: } \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.12} = \frac{0.02}{0.14} \approx 0.14 \]
\[ \text{computer science: } \frac{0.12}{0.02 + 0.12} = \frac{0.12}{0.14} \approx 0.86 \]

Therefore the output is:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.14,
  "computer science": 0.86
}
