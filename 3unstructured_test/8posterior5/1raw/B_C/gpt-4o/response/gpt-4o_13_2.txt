To determine the probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for Adam being enrolled in business administration or computer science using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the following probabilities for each field:
1. \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field.
2. \(P(E|H)\): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in that field.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in that field.

Here, we assess each field independently:

### Business Administration
1. **Prior Probability \(P(H_{ba})\) for Business Administration**:
   - Assuming a range of fields are equally likely, suppose there are 10 common fields. Prior might be 0.1 (10%).
   
2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H_{ba})\) for Business Administration**:
   - Business administration typically involves leadership, decision-making, and interpersonal skills. Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and preference for quiet activities might not strongly favor business administration.
   - Hence, we assign a lower likelihood, say 0.05.

3. **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H_{ba})\)**:
   - If Adam's personality traits do not match business administration well, the likelihood of these traits across other fields might be higher. A conservative approach could be to place this at around 0.2.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{ba}) \times P(H_{ba})}{P(E)} \]

Without \(P(E)\)'s exact value, we compare relative terms:

\[ P(H_{ba}|E) \propto P(E|H_{ba}) \times P(H_{ba}) \]
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) \propto 0.05 \times 0.1 = 0.005 \]

### Computer Science
1. **Prior Probability \(P(H_{cs})\) for Computer Science**:
   - If the assumption of 10 common fields holds, the prior might be 0.1 (10%).
   
2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H_{cs})\) for Computer Science**:
   - Adam's high intelligence, abstract thinking, and penchant for puzzles fit well with computer science. Assigning this a higher likelihood, say 0.7.

3. **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H_{cs})\)**:
   - Traits like intelligence and solving puzzles might have lower likelihood outside fields like computer science. Assign this 0.1.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{cs}) \times P(H_{cs})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_{cs}|E) \propto P(E|H_{cs}) \times P(H_{cs}) \]
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) \propto 0.7 \times 0.1 = 0.07 \]

### Normalized Comparison (without exact \(P(E)\)):
To directly compare:
\[ \text{business administration: } 0.005 \]
\[ \text{computer science: } 0.07 \]

Thus, the probability estimates \(P(H|E)\) are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.005,
  "computer science": 0.07
}
```

These values suggest that, based on Adam's personality sketch, he is considerably more likely to have been enrolled in computer science than in business administration.
