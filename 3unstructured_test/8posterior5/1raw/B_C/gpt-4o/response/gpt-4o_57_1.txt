To calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the probability \( P(E|\neg H) \). 

In general terms, Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

For both fields, let's estimate these probabilities:

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   Business administration is a common field for graduate study, but perhaps higher for others like engineering or sciences. Let's assign a prior of:
   \[ P(H_{BA}) = 0.1 \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
    - The traits described in Adam's personality sketch (curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, empathy) don't strongly suggest business administration. Assign a likelihood:
    \[ P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.2 \]

3. **Probability \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
    - Given the general nature of Adam's traits, many fields could match his profile. Assign:
    \[ P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.7 \]

### Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   Computer science is a popular field for graduates, especially those with skills in abstract thinking and problem-solving. Assign a prior of:
   \[ P(H_{CS}) = 0.2 \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
    - Adam's intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and interest in the abstract might align well with computer science. Assign:
    \[ P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.7 \]

3. **Probability \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
    - Considering that other fields are also likely, we'll use a similar value as above:
    \[ P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.7 \]

Next, using these values with Bayes' theorem:

### Business Administration
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]

Given:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \cdot P(\neg H_{BA}) \]
Where:
\[ \neg H_{BA} = 0.9 \]

Therefore:
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.7 \cdot 0.9) = 0.02 + 0.63 = 0.65 \]

So:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.65} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.65} \approx 0.0308 \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]

Given:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \cdot P(\neg H_{CS}) \]
Where:
\[ \neg H_{CS} = 0.8 \]

Therefore:
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.2) + (0.7 \cdot 0.8) = 0.14 + 0.56 = 0.70 \]

So:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.70} = \frac{0.14}{0.70} \approx 0.2 \]

So, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0308,
  "computer science": 0.2
}
```
