To apply Bayes' theorem, we need to evaluate the following probabilities for each field, \(H\):

1. \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the given field.
2. \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood of the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam is enrolled in the field \(H\).
3. \(P(E)\): The overall probability of the evidence, which can be decomposed as \(P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)\).

Given data:
- \(E\): The personality sketch of Adam.

### For Computer Science

1. **\(P(H_{\text{cs}})\)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science. Let's assume this hypothetically as a baseline since we don't have exact data. Let's set it as 5%.  
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.05 \]

2. **\(P(E|H_{\text{cs}})\)**: The likelihood that if Adam is in computer science, he has the given personality sketch. Adam's qualities like high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts might be more common among computer science students. Let's estimate this as fairly high.
\[ P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.7 \]

3. **\(P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}})\)**: The likelihood of Adam having the given personality sketch, assuming he is not in computer science. Without specific data, let's assume the weighted probability across all other fields similar to the prior. 
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.3 \]

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}} | E) = \frac{P(E | H_{\text{cs}}) \times P(H_{\text{cs}})}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E | H_{\text{cs}}) \times P(H_{\text{cs}}) + P(E | \neg H_{\text{cs}}) \times P(\neg H_{\text{cs}}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.7 \times 0.05 + 0.3 \times 0.95 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.035 + 0.285 = 0.32 \]

So:
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}} | E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.05}{0.32} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}} | E) = \frac{0.035}{0.32} \approx 0.109 \]

### For Business Administration

1. **\(P(H_{\text{ba}})\)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration. Let's assume this as another baseline. Let's set it as 10%.
\[ P(H_{\text{ba}}) = 0.1 \]

2. **\(P(E|H_{\text{ba}})\)**: The likelihood that if Adam is in business administration, he has the given personality sketch. The qualities like empathy and appreciation for hard work might be common. Let's set this as moderate.
\[ P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) = 0.5 \]

3. **\(P(E|\neg H_{\text{ba}})\)**: The likelihood of Adam having the given personality sketch, assuming he is not in business administration. Without specific data, let's assume the weighted probability across all other fields similar to the prior.
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{ba}}) = 0.3 \]

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_{\text{ba}} | E) = \frac{P(E | H_{\text{ba}}) \times P(H_{\text{ba}})}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E | H_{\text{ba}}) \times P(H_{\text{ba}}) + P(E | \neg H_{\text{ba}}) \times P(\neg H_{\text{ba}}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.5 \times 0.1 + 0.3 \times 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.05 + 0.27 = 0.32 \]

So:
\[ P(H_{\text{ba}} | E) = \frac{0.5 \times 0.1}{0.32} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{ba}} | E) = \frac{0.05}{0.32} \approx 0.156 \]

Given this, the calculations yield the following probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.109,
  "business administration": 0.156
}
```
Again, note these probabilities are rough estimates and would benefit from actual field-specific data and distribution.
