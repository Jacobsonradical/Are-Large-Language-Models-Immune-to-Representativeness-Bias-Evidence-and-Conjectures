Let's break this down step-by-step for each hypothesis.

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration out of all possible fields. Let's assume this probability is fairly average among all fields for graduate studies.
   \[
   P(H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.1
   \]

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of Adam having the given personality traits if he is indeed in Business Administration. Business Administration students may have different dominant qualities, and Adam's strong empathy and warm heart may be somewhat less emphasized in this field.
   \[
   P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.2
   \]

3. **Complementary Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of Adam having the given personality traits if he is not in Business Administration. This would be compared to all other fields, where his traits might align more closely.
   \[
   P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.4
   \]

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{\text{BA}}))}
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{0.2 \times 0.1 + 0.4 \times 0.9} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.36} = \frac{0.02}{0.38} \approx 0.0526
\]

### Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science out of all possible fields. Let's again assume this is an average probability.
   \[
   P(H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.1
   \]

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of Adam having the given personality traits if he is indeed in Computer Science. CS fields often have students with high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts. His love for solving puzzles also aligns well with CS.
   \[
   P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.6
   \]

3. **Complementary Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of Adam having the given personality traits if he is not in Computer Science.
   \[
   P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.3
   \]

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{\text{CS}}))}
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.1}{0.6 \times 0.1 + 0.3 \times 0.9} = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.27} = \frac{0.06}{0.33} \approx 0.1818
\]
