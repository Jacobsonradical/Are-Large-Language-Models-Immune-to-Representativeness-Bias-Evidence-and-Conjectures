To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to judge:
1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in that field.
4. Use Bayes' rule: \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \), but we'll focus on the comparative results as \( P(E) \) is the same across hypotheses.

Let's break down the fields one by one:

1. **Computer Science**
   - \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): Computer science is a common graduate field, so we might estimate a prior probability of 0.05.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): Adam's interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with skills needed in computer science, so this could be high, perhaps 0.6.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \): The probability of Adam having these traits without being in computer science might be moderate, maybe around 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule (without normalizing):
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.6 \times 0.05 = 0.03 \]

2. **Business Administration**
   - \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): Business administration is also a common field, so we might estimate a prior probability of 0.05.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): Adam's traits don't strongly align with typical traits of those who pursue business administration. Hence, this might be low, around 0.2.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \): The probability of Adam having these traits without being in business administration might be the same as for computer science, around 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule (without normalizing):
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.2 \times 0.05 = 0.01 \]

To give an answer in the required format (not normalized):
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.03,
  "business administration": 0.01
}
```

These values indicate the relative likeliness of Adam being in each field given his personality traits, with computer science being more consistent with his traits than business administration.
