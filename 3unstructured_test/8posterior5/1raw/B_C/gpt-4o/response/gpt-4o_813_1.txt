To compute the probabilities of Adam being enrolled in either Business Administration or Computer Science based on his personality sketch (E), we apply Bayes' Rule. Here's the breakdown of the required values for each hypothesis:

- P(H): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field.
- P(E | H): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given he is in that field.
- P(E | ¬H): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given he is not in that field.
- P(H | E): The posterior probability of Adam being in that field given his personality traits.

Let's make some reasonable assumptions based on typical graduate school demographics and Adam's personality traits.

### Business Administration

- **P(H)**: Probability of being enrolled in Business Administration. Let's assume it is 0.1 (10% of graduate students).
- **P(E | H)**: Probability of observing Adam's traits given he is in Business Administration. While business students can have a variety of traits, Adam's characteristics (empathy, love for animals, interest in nature) seem less typical for business. Let's estimate this as 0.2.
- **P(E | ¬H)**: Probability of observing Adam's traits given he is not in Business Administration. Given the wider variety of other fields, we estimate this as 0.4.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E | H) \cdot P(H) + P(E | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{0.2 \times 0.1 + 0.4 \times 0.9} \]
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.36} \]
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{0.02}{0.38} \approx 0.053 \]

### Computer Science

- **P(H)**: Probability of being enrolled in Computer Science. Let's assume it is 0.1 (10% of graduate students).
- **P(E | H)**: Probability of observing Adam's traits given he is in Computer Science. Adam's interest in puzzles and abstract concepts makes this a bit more probable. Let’s estimate this as 0.5.
- **P(E | ¬H)**: Probability of observing Adam's traits given he is not in Computer Science. Given the broader variety of personality traits across non-CS fields, we estimate this as 0.3.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E | H) \cdot P(H) + P(E | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{0.5 \times 0.1}{0.5 \times 0.1 + 0.3 \times 0.9} \]
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{0.05}{0.05 + 0.27} \]
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{0.05}{0.32} \approx 0.156 \]

Given these calculations, here are the probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.053,
  "computer science": 0.156
