To estimate the probabilities, we'll need to think about the base rates (P(H)), the likelihood (P(E|H)), and the likelihood for the complement (P(E|¬H)) for each field. We'll use Bayes' rule, which is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since this problem involves comparing probabilities rather than calculating exact values, we'll make some educated guesses about each term.

### Business Administration

#### P(H) - Base rate for Business Administration:
The proportion of graduate students in Business Administration is likely significant but not overwhelming. Let's estimate P(H) = 0.15.

#### P(E|H) - Likelihood of Adam having these traits if he is in Business Administration:
While some traits like intelligence and dedication are common in Business Administration, the specific traits of strong empathy and love for animals might be less common. Let's estimate P(E|H) = 0.2.

#### P(E|¬H) - Likelihood of Adam having these traits in other fields:
Empathy and love for animals might be more probable in fields like biology or environmental science. Given Adam’s described traits, these might be more common in non-Business fields. Let's estimate P(E|¬H) = 0.04.

### Computer Science

#### P(H) - Base rate for Computer Science:
The proportion of graduate students in Computer Science is also significant. Let's estimate P(H) = 0.2.

#### P(E|H) - Likelihood of Adam having these traits if he is in Computer Science:
Traits like high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are very common in Computer Science, but empathy and love for animals might be less emphasized. Let's estimate P(E|H) = 0.5.

#### P(E|¬H) - Likelihood of Adam having these traits in other fields:
Empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature might be less emphasized in fields outside of Computer Science. Let's estimate P(E|¬H) = 0.05.

### Posterior Probability Calculation

1. P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|¬H)P(¬H)

   For Business Administration:
   \[
   P(E) = (0.2 \times 0.15) + (0.04 \times 0.85) = 0.03 + 0.034 = 0.064
   \]

   For Computer Science:
   \[
   P(E) = (0.5 \times 0.2) + (0.05 \times 0.8) = 0.1 + 0.04 = 0.14
   \]

2. P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)}

   For Business Administration:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.15}{0.064} \approx 0.46875
   \]

   For Computer Science:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \times 0.2}{0.14} \approx 0.7143
   \]

Here are the final probabilities expressed in a simple format:

```json

  "business administration": 0.46875,
  "computer science": 0.7143
