To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' Rule, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a certain field without any personality information. \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in that field. \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in that field. And finally, \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of observing the personality sketch.

### Hypotheses:
- H_1: Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- H_2: Adam was enrolled in business administration.

For each field, we will estimate the relevant probabilities and then use Bayes' Rule to find \( P(H|E) \):

1. **Computer Science:**

   - \( P(H_1) \): Initial assumption without prior knowledge. Let's assume 1% of graduate students might be in Computer Science as a baseline (though this can vary, we use it for this example). So, \( P(H_1) = 0.01 \).
   - \( P(E|H_1) \): Likelihood that someone in Computer Science has Adam's personality traits.
     - Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants: Less common.
     - Quiet, enjoys solving puzzles: Common.
     - Warm heart, strong empathy: Neutral.
     - Deep love for animals: Less common.
     - High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts: Common.
     - Appreciation for hard work and dedication: Neutral.
     
     Let's estimate \( P(E|H_1) \) to be around 0.40, combining these factors.

   - \( P(E|\neg H_1) \): Probability that someone not in Computer Science has Adam's traits. As these traits are more neutral to specific fields (except for curiosity about nature):
     
     Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H_1) \) to be around 0.30.

2. **Business Administration:**

   - \( P(H_2) \): Initial assumption without prior knowledge. Let's assume 1% of graduate students might be in Business Administration. So, \( P(H_2) = 0.01 \). 
   - \( P(E|H_2) \): Likelihood that someone in Business Administration has Adam's personality traits.
     - Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants: Less common.
     - Quiet, enjoys solving puzzles: Less common.
     - Warm heart, strong empathy: Neutral.
     - Deep love for animals: Less common.
     - High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts: Neutral.
     - Appreciation for hard work and dedication: Common.

     Let's estimate \( P(E|H_2) \) to be around 0.25, combining these factors.

   - \( P(E|\neg H_2) \): Probability that someone not in Business Administration has Adam's traits. 
     
     Similar to Computer Science, let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H_2) \) to be around 0.30.

### Calculation with Bayes' Rule:

#### Computer Science

\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]

Approximating \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E|\neg H_1) \cdot P(\neg H_1) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.40 \cdot 0.01 + 0.30 \cdot 0.99 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.003 + 0.297 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.30 \]

Then,

\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.40 \times 0.01}{0.30} \]
\[ P(H_1|E) \approx \frac{0.004}{0.30} \]
\[ P(H_1|E) \approx 0.013 \]

#### Business Administration

\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E)} \]

Approximating \( P(E) \) should remain roughly the same:

\[ P(E) = 0.25 \cdot 0.01 + 0.30 \cdot 0.99 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.0025 + 0.297 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.2995 \]

Then,

\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.25 \times 0.01}{0.2995} \]
\[ P(H_2|E) \approx \frac{0.0025}{0.2995} \]
\[ P(H_2|E) \approx 0.008 \]

### Final Output:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.013,
  "business administration": 0.008
}
```

These values indicate that based on the provided personality sketch and the assumptions made, Adam is slightly more likely to be in Computer Science than in Business Administration.
