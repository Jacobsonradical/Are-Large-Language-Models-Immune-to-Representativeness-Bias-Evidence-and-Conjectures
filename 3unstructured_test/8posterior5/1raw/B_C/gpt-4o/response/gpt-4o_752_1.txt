Let's evaluate the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in each of the specified fields, using the given personality sketch (E) and applying Bayes' rule. 

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field (business administration or computer science) given his personality sketch (E).
 
First, we need estimates for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \):

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field.
  
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of Adam having his personality traits given that he is enrolled in that field.
  
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of Adam having his personality traits given that he is not enrolled in that field.

For both fields:

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): Since graduate students in business administration are common but not necessarily the majority of all graduate fields, let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.10 \) (10%).
- \( P(E|H) \): Considering the personality sketch, people in business administration might be less likely to have a strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, and understanding of abstract concepts characteristic of the personality sketch. Thus, \( P(E|H) \approx 0.03 \) (3%).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The traits are more common in fields like biology, environmental science, etc., so let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.05 \) (5%).

### Computer Science
- \( P(H) \): Computer science is a very common field among graduate students, let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.15 \) (15%).
- \( P(E|H) \): Computer science students often exhibit high intelligence and strong problem-solving skills, which align well with Adam’s traits. Let's assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.10 \) (10%).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): As above, the traits can appear in other scientific and technical fields. Let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.07 \) (7%).

Now, applying Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E)_{business administration} = \frac{P(E|H)_{business administration} \cdot P(H)_{business administration}}{P(E|H)_{business administration} \cdot P(H)_{business administration} + P(E|\neg H)_{business administration} \cdot (1 - P(H)_{business administration})} \]

\[ = \frac{0.03 \cdot 0.10}{0.03 \cdot 0.10 + 0.05 \cdot 0.90} \]
\[ = \frac{0.003}{0.003 + 0.045} \]
\[ = \frac{0.003}{0.048} \]
\[ = \frac{1}{16} \]
\[ \approx 0.0625 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{computer science} = \frac{P(E|H)_{computer science} \cdot P(H)_{computer science}}{P(E|H)_{computer science} \cdot P(H)_{computer science} + P(E|\neg H)_{computer science} \cdot (1 - P(H)_{computer science})} \]

\[ = \frac{0.10 \cdot 0.15}{0.10 \cdot 0.15 + 0.07 \cdot 0.85} \]
\[ = \frac{0.015}{0.015 + 0.0595} \]
\[ = \frac{0.015}{0.0745} \]
\[ \approx 0.201 \]

Thus, the resulting probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": 0.0625,
  "computer science": 0.201
}

This suggests that, given Adam's personality traits, he is much more likely to be enrolled in computer science than in business administration.
