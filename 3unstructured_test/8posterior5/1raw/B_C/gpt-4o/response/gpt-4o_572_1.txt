To provide a structured approach to this problem, I'll first outline the values of \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field based on the given personality sketch of Adam. Following this, I will use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \).

Given Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \): The total probability of the evidence, \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Let's hypothesize the values based on the personality sketch:

### General Assumptions:
- Let \( P(H) \) for each field be based on the average proportion of graduate students in each field out of a total pool of graduate fields. For simplicity, let's assume an equal distribution or some feasible ratio.
- Adam’s personality traits align more closely with fields oriented around logical, analytical thinking, and possibly nature or empathy-driven subjects.

#### Business Administration (H1)
- \( P(H1) \): Prior probability of Adam being in business administration. Assuming 1 in 10 graduate students is in business administration, \( P(H1) = 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|H1) \): Personality traits compatibility with business administration. Adam's traits such as empathy and strong appreciation for hard work do fit, but his interest in nature and puzzles isn't a strong match. Let's estimate \( P(E|H1) = 0.4 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H1) \): Assuming other fields are more or less equally likely, we estimate \( P(E|\neg H1) = 0.7 \) given that many fields might align more closely with his interests.

#### Computer Science (H2)
- \( P(H2) \): Prior probability of Adam being in computer science. Let’s assume 1 in 8 graduate students is in computer science, so \( P(H2) = 0.125 \).
- \( P(E|H2) \): Personality suitability for computer science. Adam's problem-solving ability, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts are strong indicators. \( P(E|H2) = 0.8 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H2) \): Given many fields may not align so well with such traits, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H2) = 0.6 \).

Now, let’s calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field.

### Business Administration
Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1)}{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1) + P(E|\neg H1) \cdot P(\neg H1)} \]
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.1}{0.4 \cdot 0.1 + 0.7 \cdot 0.9} \]
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.63} \]
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.67} \approx 0.06 \]

### Computer Science
Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2)}{P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2) + P(E|\neg H2) \cdot P(\neg H2)} \]
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.125}{0.8 \cdot 0.125 + 0.6 \cdot 0.875} \]
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.1 + 0.525} \]
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.625} \approx 0.16 \]

Thus, the computed probabilities are as follows:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.06,
  "computer science": 0.16
}
```
