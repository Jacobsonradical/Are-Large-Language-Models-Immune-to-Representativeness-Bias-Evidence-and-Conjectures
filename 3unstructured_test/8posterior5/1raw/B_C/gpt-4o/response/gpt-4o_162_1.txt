To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the fields of business administration and computer science, we need to consider the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the probability of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Let's denote:
- \( H_{\text{BA}} \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( H_{\text{CS}} \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science.

Given Adam's personality sketch, we can assess these probabilities:

1. **Prior probabilities \( P(H) \) (likelihood that a general graduate student is in the given field):**
    - Assume \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.2 \) (business is a relatively popular field).
    - Assume \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.25 \) (computer science is also quite popular).

2. **Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) (likelihood of someone in this field having Adam's traits):**
    - Considering Adam's appreciation for nature, empathy, and love for animals, business administration is less likely aligned with these traits compared to computer science:
        - \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1 \)
        - Adam's traits such as intelligence, puzzle-solving, and understanding of abstract concepts align more closely with computer science over business:
        - \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.5 \)

3. **Probability of the evidence given not the hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
    - This represents the likelihood of Adam having these traits across all other fields.
        - Assume a general moderate likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.3 \).
        - Assume a general moderate likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.3 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

1. **Business Administration:**
    \[
    P(E)_{\text{BA}} = P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{BA}})
    \]
    \[
    P(E)_{\text{BA}} = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8 = 0.02 + 0.24 = 0.26
    \]
    \[
    P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)_{\text{BA}}} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.26} \approx 0.077
    \]

2. **Computer Science:**
    \[
    P(E)_{\text{CS}} = P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{CS}})
    \]
    \[
    P(E)_{\text{CS}} = 0.5 \cdot 0.25 + 0.3 \cdot 0.75 = 0.125 + 0.225 = 0.35
    \]
    \[
    P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)_{\text{CS}}} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \approx 0.357
    \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities given the evidence are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.077,
  "computer science": 0.357
}
```
