To calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to consider the following terms for each hypothesis (H):

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch, given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch, given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.
  
Bayes' Rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

Let's estimate these probabilities for "business administration" and "computer science" based on the given personality sketch.

**1. Business Administration:**

- **P(H)**: Let's assume the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a business administration program. Graduate programs are various, and the business administration field is quite broad. So, let's estimate:
  \[ P(H) = 0.20 \]
  
- **P(E|H)**: Given the personality sketch, does it fit well for a business administration student? Business administration does not strongly align with Adam's curiosity about nature, his love for animals, and his quiet nature focused on puzzles. It moderately aligns with high intelligence and understanding of hard work:
  \[ P(E|H) = 0.10 \]
  
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch if Adam was not in business administration should be higher since many fields could fit his profile better:
  \[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.30 \]

**2. Computer Science:**

- **P(H)**: Let's assume the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a computer science program. This field is popular and aligns fairly well with the skills described:
  \[ P(H) = 0.25 \]

- **P(E|H)**: Given the personality sketch, does it fit well for a computer science student? Computer science aligns well with high intelligence, solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts:
  \[ P(E|H) = 0.40 \]
  
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch if Adam was not in computer science should be lower since the fields aligning with his profile might be fewer:
  \[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.20 \]

Now, let's compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Rule. Note that we need \( P(E) \) for normalization, but we'll compare the unnormalized values for simplicity since the question allows it.

**Business Administration:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = 0.10 \cdot 0.20 \]

**Computer Science:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = 0.40 \cdot 0.25 \]

\[ P(E) \] would be calculated such that both probabilities are normalized, but we are asked for values between 0 and 1.

Putting it all together:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.10
}
```

These probabilities are indicative of how likely it is, given the provided personality sketch and our estimates, that Adam is enrolled in each field.
