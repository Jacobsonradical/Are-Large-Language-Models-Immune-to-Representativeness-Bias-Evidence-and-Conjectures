To approach this, we need to use Bayes' rule, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis H.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence E given hypothesis H.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of evidence E given not-H.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of evidence E.

Given the limited information, we need to assign some reasonable values to these probabilities.

### Assumptions:
- Graduate students are evenly distributed across various fields, so we use reasonable albeit somewhat arbitrary priors.
- We hypothesize that Adamâ€™s personality traits align more closely with certain fields, influencing the likelihoods accordingly.

#### For Business Administration:
- \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): Prior probability of being in business administration, let's say 0.1.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): Probability that Adam has these traits if he is in business administration. Business administration typically does not emphasize the traits related to nature, empathy, and love for animals as strongly; let's set this low, at 0.2.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \): Difficult due to the "not business" category encompassing many fields, but since many other fields like environmental science or biology might align better, we estimate this at 0.5.

#### For Computer Science:
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): Prior probability of being in computer science, let's say 0.1.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): Probability that Adam has these traits if he is in computer science. Computer science can involve puzzle-solving and abstract thinking but might be less about nature and animals; we estimate this as 0.4.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \): Again, since the "not computer science" category encompasses many fields where the traits might align better, estimate this at 0.5.

### Calculations:

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.02}{P(E)} \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.04}{P(E)} \]

Assuming equal overall probability \( P(E) \) across hypotheses for simplicity:

So our relative probabilities are:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = 0.02 / P(E) \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = 0.04 / P(E) \]

When normalizing these to sum to 1 (for better relative comparison), we get:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.04} = \frac{0.02}{0.06} = \frac{1}{3} = 0.333 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.02 + 0.04} = \frac{0.04}{0.06} = \frac{2}{3} = 0.667 \]

Hence, the results are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.333,
  "computer science": 0.667
}
```
