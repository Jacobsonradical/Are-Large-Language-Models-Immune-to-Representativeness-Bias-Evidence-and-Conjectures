To begin, let's go through each field and assess the probabilities step-by-step. We'll use Bayes' rule, which in this context can be formulated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of E given that Adam is in a specific field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of E given that Adam is not in a specific field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence E.

Let's estimate these probabilities:

**Business Administration:**
- \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): The prior probability of any given graduate student being in business administration might be say 0.2 (this is an estimate based on general graduate program distributions).
- \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): A personality sketch featuring curiosity about nature, love of animals, and puzzle-solving does not strongly correlate with business administration, so let's estimate this as 0.1.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \): The likelihood of the given personality traits for all other fields might be higher as scientific fields often valuate these traits. Let's estimate this as 0.3.
- \( P(E) \): This can be seen as a normalizing constant but isn't directly needed to use Bayesâ€™ rule comparatively between fields.

**Computer Science:**
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): The prior probability of any given graduate student being in computer science might be say 0.25.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): A quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles with high intelligence might very well align with computer science. Additionally, appreciation for hard work aligns with the discipline required in CS. Let's estimate this as 0.5.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \): The same basis as before, let's estimate this as 0.3.

Now we use Bayes' rule to calculate \( P(H|E) \):

1. For **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}})P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.02}{P(E)} \]

2. For **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}})P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.5 \times 0.25}{P(E)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.125}{P(E)} \]

Since the final probabilities need to be compared relatively, we normalize them:

Let \( P(E) = k \):

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E)_{\text{normalized}} = \frac{0.02}{k} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E)_{\text{normalized}} = \frac{0.125}{k} \]

After normalization, the relative probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": 0.02 / (0.02 + 0.125) = 0.1379,
  "computer science": 0.125 / (0.02 + 0.125) = 0.8621
}

Rounded estimates:

{
  "business administration": 0.14,
  "computer science": 0.86
}
