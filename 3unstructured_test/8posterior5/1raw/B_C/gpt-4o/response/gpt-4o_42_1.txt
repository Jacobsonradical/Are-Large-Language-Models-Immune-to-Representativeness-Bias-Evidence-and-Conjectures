To use Bayes' theorem to compute \( P(H|E) \), the probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch, we use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields (as it represents the total probability of observing the evidence irrespective of the field), we can simplify our comparison to focus on \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \). This will give us a sense of which hypothesis is more probable given the evidence.

### Key Terms
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood of observing the personality traits given Adam is in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likelihood of observing the personality traits given Adam is not in that field.
- \( P(H|E) \): Posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field given his personality traits.

### Assessment of Probabilities
#### Computer Science
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that a random graduate student is studying computer science (let's assume it is moderately high but not the majority, say 0.3).
- \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood of Adam's personality traits given he is in computer science. Adam has traits that can go well with computer science such as intelligence, problem-solving skills, and an appreciation for hard work. Let's assign this a relatively high value, say 0.7.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likelihood of Adam's personality traits given he is not in computer science could be more evenly distributed among other fields. Let's assume this is 0.5.

#### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that a random graduate student is studying business administration (let's assume it is moderately lower than computer science, say 0.2).
- \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood of Adam's personality traits given he is in business administration. Attributes like empathy and appreciation for hard work fit well, but love for nature and animals might be less relevant. Let's assign this a moderate value, say 0.4.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likelihood of Adam's personality traits given he is not in business administration could be higher, say 0.6, as these traits may be more common in other fields.

### Calculation
Using Bayes' Theorem, \( P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \), for comparison purposes:

For Computer Science:
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) \propto 0.7 \cdot 0.3 = 0.21 \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(\text{BA}|E) \propto 0.4 \cdot 0.2 = 0.08 \]

Based on these computations, the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) are proportionally higher for Computer Science than for Business Administration.

### Result
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.21,
  "business administration": 0.08
}
```
This indicates that, based on his personality traits, Adam is more likely to be enrolled in computer science than in business administration.
