To apply Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was not enrolled in that field.

Now let's estimate these probabilities for each field:

### Computer Science:

1. \( P(H) \): 
   - Computer Science is a common graduate field, so let's assume the prior probability \( P(H) \) is around 0.15. 

2. \( P(E|H) \):
   - Given Adam's personality sketch, he seems to have traits suitable for computer science (e.g., solving puzzles, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts). Therefore, \( P(E|H) \) might be high. Let's assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.7 \).

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \):
   - Given the specific nature of Adam's personality (including strong empathy and a deep love for animals which may not be typical for non-computer science fields), we can estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Substituting values:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.15}{0.7 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.105}{0.105 + 0.17} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.105}{0.275} \approx 0.382 \]

### Business Administration:

1. \( P(H) \): 
   - Business Administration is another common graduate field, so let's assume the prior probability \( P(H) \) is around 0.15.

2. \( P(E|H) \):
   - Given Adam’s personality traits (e.g., warm heart, empathy, and appreciation for hard work), it’s less aligned with Business Administration which often emphasizes strategic, analytical, and managerial skills. So, \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \).

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \):
   - Similarly, as explained earlier, we can estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Substituting values:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.15}{0.3 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.17} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.215} \approx 0.209 \]

Summarizing the results, we have:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.382,
  "business administration": 0.209
}
