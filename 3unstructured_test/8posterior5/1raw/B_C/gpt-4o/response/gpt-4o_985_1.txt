To estimate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the fields of business administration and computer science, we will use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of H (Adam being enrolled in a specific field)
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing E (the personality sketch) given H (the field)
- \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing E
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing E given not H (the field)

First, let's qualitatively evaluate each of these terms before providing estimates.

### Business Administration
- **\( P(H) \)**: Suppose the prior probability that any random graduate student is enrolled in business administration is moderate.
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: The personality traits of Adam (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, intelligence, and understanding of hard work) seem less aligned with the typical traits we might expect for business administration.
  - Likelihood is therefore relatively low.
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of these traits given not business administration might be higher, given he could fit well in several other fields (like environmental science, psychology, etc.)

### Computer Science
- **\( P(H) \)**: Suppose the prior probability that any random graduate student is enrolled in computer science is moderate to high, given its popularity.
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's attributes of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts are fairly aligned with characteristics desirable in computer science.
  - Likelihood here is relatively high.
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: If Adam is not in computer science, his traits might still fit in fields requiring problem-solving skills but not as perfectly (e.g., mathematics or engineering).

Based on these qualitative assessments, we assign some rough probabilities:

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): 0.2 (Assume 20% prior probability)
- \( P(E|H) \): 0.05 (Traits not very aligned)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): 0.3 (Higher likelihood given other possible majors)

### Computer Science
- \( P(H) \): 0.3 (Assume 30% prior probability)
- \( P(E|H) \): 0.4 (Traits quite aligned)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): 0.15 (More likely than business administration if not computer science)

We need to compute \( P(E) \) as well:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H)) \]

Let's compute for each:

### Business Administration
\[ P(E) = 0.05 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8 = 0.01 + 0.24 = 0.25 \]
### Computer Science
\[ P(E) = 0.4 \cdot 0.3 + 0.15 \cdot 0.7 = 0.12 + 0.105 = 0.225 \]

Let's now compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.2}{0.25} = \frac{0.01}{0.25} = 0.04 \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{0.225} = \frac{0.12}{0.225} = 0.533 \]

Given these numbers, the JSON-formatted answer would be:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.04,
  "computer science": 0.533
}
```

Please note, these probabilities are based on assumed prior probabilities and likelihoods, which could vary based on more accurate contextual information.
