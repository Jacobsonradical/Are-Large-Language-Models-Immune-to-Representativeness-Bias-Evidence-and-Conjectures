To apply Bayes' theorem to compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need the following values:
1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in the given field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in the given field.

Let's assume some reasonable estimates for these probabilities, as we don't have specific data:

1. **Computer Science**:
    - \( P(H) \): Let's assume the prior probability of Adam being a computer science graduate student is 0.2.
    - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adamâ€™s skills in understanding abstract concepts, his love for solving puzzles, high intelligence, and empathy, we can assume a relatively high probability that his personality sketch fits someone in computer science. Let's estimate this as 0.6.
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of his personality sketch given he is not a computer science student. Estimating this as lower than \( P(E|H) \), let's say 0.3.

   Applying Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   Where,
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
   \]
   Since \( \neg H \) is the complement of H, \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) \).

   Calculations:
   \[
   P(E) = (0.6 \times 0.2) + (0.3 \times 0.8) = 0.12 + 0.24 = 0.36
   \]

   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.2}{0.36} = \frac{0.12}{0.36} \approx 0.333
   \]

2. **Business Administration**:
    - \( P(H) \): Let's assume the prior probability of Adam being a business administration graduate student is 0.1.
    - \( P(E|H) \): Given his empathy and appreciation for hard work and dedication, assume the probability of his personality sketch fitting someone in business administration as 0.4.
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Using the same \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \) for consistency.

   Calculations:
   \[
   P(E) = (0.4 \times 0.1) + (0.3 \times 0.9) = 0.04 + 0.27 = 0.31
   \]

   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.1}{0.31} = \frac{0.04}{0.31} \approx 0.129
   \]

Final answer format:

{
  "computer science": 0.333,
  "business administration": 0.129
}
