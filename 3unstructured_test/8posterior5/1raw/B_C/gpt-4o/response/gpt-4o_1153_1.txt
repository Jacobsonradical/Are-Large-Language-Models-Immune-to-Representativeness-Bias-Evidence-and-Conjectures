To apply Bayes' rule and determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in each field given the personality sketch \( E \), we need to assess the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the complements \( P(E|\neg H) \) for both fields: computer science and business administration. 

### Step-by-step Process:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Computer Science: Computer Science is a common graduate field. Let's assume a prior probability \( P(H_{CS}) \) of 0.2.
   - Business Administration: Business Administration is also a common field, so let's assume a prior probability \( P(H_{BA}) \) of 0.2.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Computer Science \( P(E|H_{CS}) \):
     Adam's love for puzzles and high intelligence might align with traits of computer science students. His empathy and love for nature don't directly align but don't contradict either. Let's assume \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) is 0.4.
   - Business Administration \( P(E|H_{BA}) \):
     Adam's warm heart, empathy, and appreciation for hard work can be qualities found in business administration students. His love for nature and puzzles isn't particularly relevant. So, let's assume \( P(E|H_{BA}) \) is 0.3.

3. **Complementary Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   Assessing \( P(E|\neg H) \) is trickier and would require understanding the proportions of possible students in all other fields matching the profile. However, for simplicity:
   - For Computer Science: Assume \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \) to be 0.1 (`neg H_{CS}` entails all other students not in computer science).
   - For Business Administration: Assume \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \) similarly to be 0.15.

### Applying Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Considering \( P(E) \) as a normalization factor for both hypotheses:

#### Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.2}{(0.4 \times 0.2) + (0.1 \times 0.8)} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.08} = \frac{0.08}{0.16} = 0.5 \]

#### Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{(0.3 \times 0.2) + (0.15 \times 0.8)} = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.12} = \frac{0.06}{0.18} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.33 \]

### Combined Result:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.33
}
```

Given the assumptions and the personality sketch, it appears moderately likely that Adam could be enrolled in either field, but slightly more likely in computer science. These values are approximations based on the assumed probabilities and should be refined with more specific data.
