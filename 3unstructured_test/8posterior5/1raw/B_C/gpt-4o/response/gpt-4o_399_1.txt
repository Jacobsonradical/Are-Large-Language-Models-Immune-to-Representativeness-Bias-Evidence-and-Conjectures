To use Bayes' rule for this problem, we need to understand the notations and basic concept of how probabilities transform using given evidence. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For each field (business administration and computer science), we'll define \(P(H)\), \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E|\neg H)\):

- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the probability of observing the personality sketch given he was in that field.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\) is the probability of observing the personality sketch given he was not in that field.

Finally, \(P(E)\) can be computed, but since we are comparing two fields only, it is essentially a normalizing factor.

### Evaluations:

1. **Business Administration**
   - \(P(H)\): Let's assume a moderate prior probability for this field, say 0.2.
   - \(P(E|H)\): Given the personality sketch, the characteristics described (curiosity about nature, love for animals, puzzle solving) do not align well with typical traits associated with business administration. We'll set it low, around 0.05.
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\): This represents the rest of the fields not business administration. Let's assume a moderate probability, say 0.1.

   Using Bayes' rule:

   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

2. **Computer Science**
   - \(P(H)\): Let's assume a higher prior probability for this field, given it is a common field and Adam's interest in puzzles. We set it somewhat higher, say 0.3.
   - \(P(E|H)\): The characteristics described (intelligence, puzzle solving, understanding abstract concepts) align well with computer science. This is higher, say 0.5.
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\): This includes fields other than computer science. Let's assume a moderate to higher probability, say 0.4.

   Using Bayes' rule:

   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \]

### Comparative normalization

Since \(P(E)\) is the same for both fields and we are effectively comparing the ratios, we focus on the numerator:

For business administration:

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.05 \cdot 0.2 = 0.01 \]

For computer science:

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.5 \cdot 0.3 = 0.15 \]

So, compared to each other:

Now, normalizing these (so they both sum up to 1 for these two probabilities):

\[ P(H|E)_{business \, administration} = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.15} = \frac{0.01}{0.16} \approx 0.0625 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{computer \, science} = \frac{0.15}{0.01 + 0.15} = \frac{0.15}{0.16} \approx 0.9375 \]

Putting them together:

{
  "business administration": 0.0625,
  "computer science": 0.9375
