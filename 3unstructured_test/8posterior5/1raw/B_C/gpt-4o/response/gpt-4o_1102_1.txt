Note that to solve this with precise probabilities in practice, we'd require detailed data or prior distributions regarding the likelihood of individuals with Adam's profile enrolling in each field. However, based on intuition and common understanding, we can make reasonable estimations for this exercise.

Let's denote:

- \(H_{\text{CS}}\) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in a computer science (CS) program.
- \(H_{\text{BA}}\) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in a business administration (BA) program.

To apply Bayes' rule, we need the following probabilities:
- \(P(H_{\text{CS}})\): The prior probability of Adam enrolling in computer science.
- \(P(E|H_{\text{CS}})\): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in computer science.
- \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}})\): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not enrolled in computer science.
- \(P(H_{\text{BA}})\): The prior probability of Adam enrolling in business administration.
- \(P(E|H_{\text{BA}})\): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in business administration.
- \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}})\): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not enrolled in business administration.

### Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H_{\text{CS}})\):**
   - Let's assume a baseline probability of students enrolling in computer science. For simplicity, we can assume a balanced prior of 0.1 (10% of graduate students).

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H_{\text{CS}})\):**
   - Adam's interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence aligns with computer science. Empathy and love for nature don't contradict this, but they're not common indicators. So let's estimate a moderately high probability: 0.6.

3. **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}})\):**
   - The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in any other field can vary, but empathy and love for nature could be more common in other fields. So let's assign a slightly lower probability: 0.5.

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H_{\text{BA}})\):**
   - We’ll again assume a baseline probability of students enrolling in business administration. For simplicity, let's use 0.1 (10%).

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H_{\text{BA}})\):**
   - Business administration students often emphasize organizational skills and leadership, but Adam’s traits of empathy and love for animals are less typical. We'll assign a lower probability: 0.3.

3. **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}})\):**
   - The likelihood of observing Adam’s profile in other fields might be higher. Let's estimate: 0.5.

### Bayes Rule for Posterior Probability

1. **Computer Science \(P(H_{\text{CS}}|E)\)**:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{\text{CS}}))}
   \]
   \[
   P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.1}{0.6 \cdot 0.1 + 0.5 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.45} \approx 0.1176
   \]

2. **Business Administration \(P(H_{\text{BA}}|E)\)**:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{\text{BA}}))}
   \]
   \[
   P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.3 \cdot 0.1 + 0.5 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.45} \approx 0.0625
   \]

Here are the resulting probabilities for the two fields of study:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.1176,
  "business administration": 0.0625
}
