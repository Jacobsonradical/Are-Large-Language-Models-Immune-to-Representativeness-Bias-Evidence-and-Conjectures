To calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis (field of study) using Bayes' rule, we need to assess the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): Prior probability of Adam being in that field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): Probability of observing the personality sketch of Adam given that he is in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of observing the personality sketch of Adam given that he is not in that field.

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we are not given the exact values for these probabilities and we are comparing two fields, we can ignore \( P(E) \) as it will cancel out in the relative comparison. We will estimate the probabilities based on the given information.

### Assumptions:
Given the personality sketch, let's make the following assumptions for simplicity:

- Prior probabilities \( P(H) \):
  - P(Computer Science): 0.2 (as a relatively common graduate field)
  - P(Business Administration): 0.2 (also a relatively common graduate field)
  
- Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) based on the fit of Adam's personality:

  - \( P(E|Computer Science) \):
    - High intelligence: Fits well.
    - Understanding abstract concepts: Fits well.
    - Empathy and warm heart: Less commonly emphasized but not excluded.
    - Curiosity about nature: May be present but not directly related.
    - Overall for Computer Science: Moderately likely. Let's estimate 0.4.

  - \( P(E|Business Administration) \):
    - Intelligence: Fits well.
    - Understanding abstract concepts: Fits well but can be more practical.
    - Empathy and warm heart: Fits well given the rising emphasis on soft skills and leadership.
    - Curiosity about nature: Less common but doesn't exclude him from the field.
    - Overall for Business Administration: Moderately likely. Let's estimate 0.3.

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): General probability of the personality sketch being seen in any other field, taken to be the average non-fit.

Now calculate the posterior probabilities:

### Computer Science
Assuming other fields combined encompass a broader spectrum, we can estimate roughly:
\[ P(E|\neg \text{Computer Science}) \approx 0.5 \]

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science})}{P(E)} \]
Approximate:
\[ \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.5} = 0.16 \]

### Business Administration
Assuming similar logic for other fields:
\[ P(E|\neg \text{Business Administration}) \approx 0.5 \]

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{Business Administration}) \cdot P(\text{Business Administration})}{P(E)} \]
Approximate:
\[ \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.5} = 0.12 \]

This results in:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.16,
  "business administration": 0.12
}
