Sure, let's start by computing the necessary probabilities for each field based on the given information.

### 1. Computer Science (CS)

**P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Assuming a relatively balanced distribution of graduate students among different fields, let’s assume P(H) to be moderate. We might estimate this at 0.2 (20%).

**P(E|H):** The probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Computer science students often need to be intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, so let's assume this matches well. Other traits such as curiosity about nature and empathy are not typical markers for CS but can exist. Let's set this estimate a bit lower, perhaps around 0.3 (30%).

**P(E|¬H):** The probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam was not enrolled in computer science. Since Adam’s traits are quite general and could apply to a wide variety of fields, this might be reasonably high, at around 0.7 (70%).

**Calculating P(H|E) using Bayes' Rule:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \),
we get:
\[ P(E) = 0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.7 \cdot 0.8 = 0.06 + 0.56 = 0.62 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.62} \approx 0.097 \]

### 2. Business Administration (BA)

**P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. We might estimate this similarly at 0.2 (20%).

**P(E|H):** The probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Traits such as empathy and understanding hard work could match well, but high intelligence and love for nature are less typical. Let’s set this estimate moderately at around 0.2 (20%).

**P(E|¬H):** The probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam was not enrolled in business administration, which includes all other fields. This might be similarly around 0.7 (70%).

**Calculating P(H|E) using Bayes' Rule:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \),
we get:
\[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.2 + 0.7 \cdot 0.8 = 0.04 + 0.56 = 0.6 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.6} \approx 0.067 \]

Final computed probabilities:
