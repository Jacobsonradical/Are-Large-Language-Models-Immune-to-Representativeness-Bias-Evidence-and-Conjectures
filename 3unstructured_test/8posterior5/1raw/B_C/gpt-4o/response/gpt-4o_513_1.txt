To evaluate the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in either computer science or business administration, we'll use the available information and Bayes' rule. Let's denote each hypothesis accordingly:

- \(H_{CS}\): Adam is enrolled in computer science.
- \(H_{BA}\): Adam is enrolled in business administration.

First, we'll outline the steps:

1. **Estimate Prior Probabilities \(P(H)\):** The prior probabilities of Adam being in each field without considering the personality sketch.
2. **Estimate Likelihood \(P(E|H)\):** The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in each field.
3. **Estimate Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\):** The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is **not** enrolled in each field.
4. **Apply Bayes' Rule:** Use these to find the posterior probabilities \(P(H|E)\):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's dive into the estimations:

### For Computer Science \(H_{CS}\):
1. **Prior Probability \(P(H_{CS})\):**
   - Let's assume that in general, a moderate percentage of graduate students might be enrolled in computer science. We'll set \(P(H_{CS})\) to be around 0.2.

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H_{CS})\):**
   - Given Adam’s personality traits (good at understanding abstract concepts, enjoys solving puzzles), it seems reasonably likely he could be in computer science. Let's estimate this to be 0.6.

3. **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H_{CS})\):**
   - Now, for the other fields (excluding computer science), many might not exhibit the same alignment with Adam’s traits. Still, Adam’s traits like appreciation for hard work could exist widely. Let's set it at 0.4.

### For Business Administration \(H_{BA}\):
1. **Prior Probability \(P(H_{BA})\):**
   - Let's assume a moderate percentage of graduate students might also be enrolled in business administration. We'll set \(P(H_{BA})\) to be around 0.2.

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H_{BA})\):**
   - Given Adam’s personality traits (strong empathy, warm heart, appreciation for hard work), it might align well with business administration, though perhaps not as strongly as computer science traits. Let’s estimate this to be 0.4.

3. **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H_{BA})\):**
   - For fields excluding business administration, Adam's personality traits might be less likely to match. We can set it to 0.3.

Now, compute posteriors using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]

Without the exact value of \(P(E)\), we use relative scaling. Assuming \(P(E)\) is the same for comparing both fields, we focus on numerators:

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) = 0.6 \cdot 0.2 = 0.12 \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) = 0.4 \cdot 0.2 = 0.08 \]

Normalize proportional values:

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.08} = 0.6 \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.12 + 0.08} = 0.4 \]

Now, we'll provide the answers in the requested format:
