Let's begin by evaluating the probabilities step-by-step, using the provided personality sketch (E) and Bayesian principles. 

### Prior Probability (P(H))
For simplicity, let's assume that Adam had equal odds of enrolling in any graduate program. This is a simplifying assumption, but it allows us to move forward without additional bias. 

- P(H = Computer Science) = 0.1
- P(H = Business Administration) = 0.1

### Likelihood (P(E|H))
This is the probability of observing the evidence given that Adam was in a particular field. 

#### Computer Science
- P(E|H = Computer Science) is informed by the fact that computer science students often have high intelligence, are good at solving puzzles, and understand abstract concepts. Interest in nature and plants as well as strong empathy is less common but possible.
  - Let's assume P(E|H = Computer Science) ≈ 0.6

#### Business Administration
- P(E|H = Business Administration) is informed by the fact that business administration students often appreciate hard work and dedication. However, a love for nature, plants, animals, and puzzles is less typical.
  - Let's assume P(E|H = Business Administration) ≈ 0.2

### Complementary Likelihood (P(E|¬H))
This is the likelihood of the evidence if Adam wasn't enrolled in that particular field. 

#### Not Computer Science
- P(E|¬H = Computer Science) would be lower compared to P(E|H = Computer Science) but still fairly significant due to wide variety of academic fields that might cover his traits.
  - Let's assume P(E|¬H = Computer Science) ≈ 0.25
  
#### Not Business Administration
- P(E|¬H = Business Administration) would be high considering the wider number of possible fields that can cover those characteristics.
  - Let's assume P(E|¬H = Business Administration) ≈ 0.35

### Posterior Probability (P(H|E))
Now we use Bayes' Rule: 

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E| \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Let's plug in the numbers:

#### Computer Science
\[ P(H = Computer Science|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.1}{0.6 \cdot 0.1 + 0.25 \cdot 0.9} \]
\[ P(H = Computer Science|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.225} \]
\[ P(H = Computer Science|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.285} \]
\[ P(H = Computer Science|E) \approx 0.21 \]

#### Business Administration
\[ P(H = Business Administration|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.35 \cdot 0.9} \]
\[ P(H = Business Administration|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.315} \]
\[ P(H = Business Administration|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.335} \]
\[ P(H = Business Administration|E) \approx 0.06 \]

Let's compile the results in the requested format:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.21,
  "business administration": 0.06
}
```

These probabilities reflect the likelihood of Adam's enrollment in either field, given his personality traits and other provided information.
