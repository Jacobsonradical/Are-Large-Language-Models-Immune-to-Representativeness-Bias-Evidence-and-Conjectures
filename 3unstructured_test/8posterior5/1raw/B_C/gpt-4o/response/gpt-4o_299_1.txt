For both fields, we need to consider the prior probability \( P(H) \), which may be based on the popularity and frequency of the fields of study among graduate students in the U.S. Additionally, we need to evaluate the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), which relates to how well the personality sketch fits a typical student in that field, and the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in the field, \( P(E|\neg H) \). Finally, we'll use Bayes' rule to calculate \( P(H|E) \).

### Computer Science

**1. Prior Probability (P(H)):**
- Computer science is a common graduate field, so we can assign a relatively high prior probability.
- Let's assume \( P(H_{cs}) = 0.2 \).

**2. Likelihood (P(E|H)):**
- People in computer science often enjoy solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, which aligns well with Adam's personality.
- Adam's empathy and love for animals are less typical but not incompatible.
- Let's assume \( P(E|H_{cs}) = 0.7 \).

**3. Likelihood of Evidence Given Not the Field (P(E|¬H)):**
- The personality traits are not exclusive to computer science and could fit other fields, so this probability will also be moderate.
- Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{cs}) = 0.5 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.2}{0.7 \times 0.2 + 0.5 \times 0.8} \]
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{0.14}{0.14 + 0.4} \]
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{0.14}{0.54} \]
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) \approx 0.259 \]

### Business Administration

**1. Prior Probability (P(H)):**
- Business administration is a common graduate field, so we can also assign a relatively high prior probability.
- Let's assume \( P(H_{ba}) = 0.2 \).

**2. Likelihood (P(E|H)):**
- Business administration typically involves interaction with people, leadership, and decision making, which may not align as well with Adam's quiet and warm-hearted nature.
- These traits might not strongly suggest business administration.
- Let's assume \( P(E|H_{ba}) = 0.3 \).

**3. Likelihood of Evidence Given Not the Field (P(E|¬H)):**
- The probability might be higher if Adam is not in business administration, given his traits appear somewhat unrelated.
- Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{ba}) = 0.6 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{0.3 \times 0.2 + 0.6 \times 0.8} \]
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.48} \]
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.54} \]
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) \approx 0.111 \]
