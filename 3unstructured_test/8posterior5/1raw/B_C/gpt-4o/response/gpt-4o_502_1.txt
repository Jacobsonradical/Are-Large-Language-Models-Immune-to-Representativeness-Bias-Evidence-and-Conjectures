To apply Bayes' rule to these hypotheses, let's make some assumptions to simplify the problem:

- P(H): Prior probability of Adam being in each field. We'll assume equal priors for both Computer Science (CS) and Business Administration (BA) for simplicity.
- P(E|H): Probability of the evidence given the hypothesis. This means how well the personality sketch aligns with students in that specific field.
- P(E|\neg H): Probability of the evidence given the hypothesis is not true. This means how well the personality sketch aligns with students in fields other than the specified one.

Firstly, let's make reasonable assumptions based on the given personality sketch of Adam.

### Computer Science

1. **P(H):** Since we assume equal priors for simplicity, let's denote P(H) = 0.5.
  
2. **P(E|H):** Given that Adam is quiet, enjoys solving puzzles, and understands abstract concepts well, these traits align quite well with the typical profile of a Computer Science student. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.7.

3. **P(E|\neg H):** This denotes how well the personality matches with fields other than Computer Science. Given the specificity towards attributes useful in Computer Science, we'll assume P(E|\neg H) = 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where,
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
Since we are using equal priors,
\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.5) + (0.3 \cdot 0.5) = 0.35 + 0.15 = 0.5 \]

Thus,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = 0.7 \]

### Business Administration

1. **P(H):** Prior probability is assumed equal, so P(H) = 0.5.
  
2. **P(E|H):** Traits like a deep love for nature, animals, and curiosity fit less neatly with a typical Business Administration student. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.3.

3. **P(E|\neg H):** This would be similar to Computer Science since \(\neg H\) means any field other than Business Administration. Again assuming P(E|\neg H) = 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where,
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
Since we are using equal priors,
\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.5) + (0.3 \cdot 0.5) = 0.15 + 0.15 = 0.3 \]

Thus,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.5}{0.3} = 0.5 \]

So, considering our assumptions and given calculations, the results are:

{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.5
}
