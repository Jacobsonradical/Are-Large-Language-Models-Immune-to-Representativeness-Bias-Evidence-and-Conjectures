To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \), where \( H \) denotes the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in a specific field (either computer science or business administration) given the personality sketch \( E \), we need to use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given Adam was not enrolled in that field.

Let's start by assessing \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) based on Adam's personality sketch.

### Computer Science
#### \( P(H) \): Prior belief of Adam being enrolled in computer science.
Without specific statistics, let's assume a reasonable prior. Computer science is a popular field, but there are many fields. Let's assign:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.1 \]

#### \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood of the personality sketch given Adam is in computer science.
Adam is described as being good at solving puzzles, understanding abstract concepts, and intelligentâ€”all traits conducive to computer science. Thus:
\[ P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.8 \]

#### \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likelihood of the personality sketch given Adam is not in computer science.
The traits described are not exclusive to computer science; they could fit other fields like engineering, sciences, and even some areas of humanities. Let's assign:
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.3 \]

### Business Administration
#### \( P(H) \): Prior belief of Adam being enrolled in business administration.
Business Administration is also popular, but given Adam's traits (empathy, love for animals, deep appreciation for hard work), let's lower the prior a bit compared to computer science:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.05 \]

#### \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood of the personality sketch given Adam is in business administration.
Certain traits like strong empathy and appreciation for hard work fit business administration well, but his love for animals and curiosity about nature seem less relevant strictly to business. So, let's assign:
\[ P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.6 \]

#### \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likelihood of the personality sketch given Adam is not in business administration.
These traits still fit many non-business fields well:
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.3 \]

#### Calculating \( P(H|E) \)
Now let's compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field.

1. **Computer Science**

\[ 
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} 
= \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} 
\]

2. **Business Administration**

\[ 
P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} 
= \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} 
\]

Since \( P(E) \) is common in both and can be considered as a normalizing factor, we simplify calculations:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = 0.08 / P(E) \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = 0.03 / P(E) \]

The relative probabilities (not normalized to sum to 1, as other fields exist) are:

{ 
  "computer science": 0.08,
  "business administration": 0.03
}
