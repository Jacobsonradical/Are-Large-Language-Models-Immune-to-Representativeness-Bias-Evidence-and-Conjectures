To determine the probabilities P(H|E) for each hypothesis (field of study), we need some initial estimates based on the personality sketch of Adam. Given the traits and interests described, we can make educated guesses about P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|\neg H) for each field. Here's an outline of the reasoning and calculations:

### Computer Science
1. **P(H):** This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Considering the large number of students in this field and the general interest in it, let's estimate a moderate prior probability:
   - P(computer science) = 0.2

2. **P(E|H):** This is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is in computer science. High intelligence and an interest in solving puzzles align well with computer science, but the specific interest in nature, plants, and animals does not strongly suggest it:
   - P(E | computer science) = 0.4

3. **P(E|\neg H):** This is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not in computer science. Given the broad nature of the traits that could fit other fields as well:
   - P(E | not computer science) = 0.6

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Since \( P(E) \) normalizes the value, and for simplicity, we can compare relative ratings:
\[ P(computer science | E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.6 \cdot (1 - 0.2)} \approx 0.083 \]

### Business Administration
1. **P(H):** This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration. Given the competitiveness and the varied backgrounds of students in this field:
   - P(business administration) = 0.1

2. **P(E|H):** This is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is in business administration. The empathy and appreciation for dedication are good fits, but high intelligence and interest in nature/plants are less closely related:
   - P(E | business administration) = 0.3

3. **P(E|\neg H):** This is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not in business administration:
   - P(E | not business administration) = 0.7

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(business administration | E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.3 \cdot 0.1 + 0.7 \cdot (1 - 0.1)} \approx 0.041 \]

Putting it all together, we get the following estimates:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.083,
  "business administration": 0.041
}
``` 

These probabilities reflect the evidence suggested by the personality sketch and initial prior beliefs.
