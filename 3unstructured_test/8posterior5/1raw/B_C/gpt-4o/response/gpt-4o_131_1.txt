To calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we consider the formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was in the specified field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was in any field other than the specified one.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \).

We start by estimating the values for each part. Since we lack specific data, we will make reasoned assumptions for these probabilities based on the given personality traits and their relevance to each field.

**Estimates for Business Administration:**
- \( P(H_{BA}) \): Generally, about 1 in 10-20 graduate students might be in Business Administration.
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): While some traits such as high intelligence and appreciation for hard work may be aligned, a deep love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles might be less relevant.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \): Given the diversity of fields, this combination of traits might be more common in other fields.

Let's set some reasonable estimates:
- \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.05 \)
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.3 \)

**Estimates for Computer Science:**
- \( P(H_{CS}) \): Computer Science is a popular graduate field, perhaps 1 in 5-10 students.
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Traits such as high intelligence, solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts are highly relevant, though the nature and empathy aspects might weigh against this.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \): More likely than Business Administration, since some fields still fit these traits.

Let's set some reasonable estimates:
- \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.6 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.3 \)

**Calculations:**

1. **Business Administration:**
   \[ P(E) = P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{BA})) \]
   \[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.05 + 0.3 \cdot 0.95 = 0.01 + 0.285 = 0.295 \]

   \[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]
   \[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.05}{0.295} \approx 0.0339 \]

2. **Computer Science:**
   \[ P(E) = P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{CS})) \]
   \[ P(E) = 0.6 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9 = 0.06 + 0.27 = 0.33 \]

   \[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]
   \[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.1}{0.33} \approx 0.1818 \]

Thus, the approximate values for \( P(H|E) \) are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0339,
  "computer science": 0.1818
}
