To solve this problem using Bayes' Rule, we need to estimate the probability of Adam being enrolled in either business administration or computer science, given his personality sketch.

Bayes' Rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability of H (the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in a specific field) given E (the personality sketch).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch given Adam is in the field of H.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch E.

For simplification, we'll assume:
- \( P(H) \) for both fields (business administration and computer science) to be reasonably similar as we don't have specific prior information.
- We'll use approximate likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) based on how congruent the personality sketch is with typical characteristics for each field.

### Business Administration
**P(H) estimation:**
Let's assume roughly 20% of graduates might be in business administration, giving us \( P(H) \approx 0.20 \).

**P(E|H) estimation:**
The personality sketch of Adam seems less typical for business administration, which might focus more on leadership, interpersonal skills, and business acumen rather than curiosity about nature and animals. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.10 \).

**P(E|\neg H) estimation:**
Assuming that the vast majority of graduate fields (\(\neg H\)) might share the more general traits of empathy, intelligence, puzzle-solving, and appreciation for dedication, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.70 \).

### Computer Science
**P(H) estimation:**
Let's assume roughly 20% of graduates might be in computer science as well, giving us \( P(H) \approx 0.20 \).

**P(E|H) estimation:**
Adam's personality sketch aligns well with typical traits expected in computer science, such as problem-solving, intelligence, and abstract thinking. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.60 \).

**P(E|\neg H) estimation:**
Assuming similar reasoning for graduate fields (\(\neg H\)), let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.70 \).

### Calculating P(H|E)
Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) \) can be derived from:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

#### Business Administration
\[ P(E) \approx 0.10 \ \text{x} \ 0.20 + 0.70 \ \text{x} \ 0.80 = 0.02 + 0.56 = 0.58 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.10 \ \text{x} \ 0.20}{0.58} = \frac{0.02}{0.58} \approx 0.0345 \]

#### Computer Science
\[ P(E) \approx 0.60 \ \text{x} \ 0.20 + 0.70 \ \text{x} \ 0.80 = 0.12 + 0.56 = 0.68 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.60 \ \text{x} \ 0.20}{0.68} = \frac{0.12}{0.68} \approx 0.1765 \]

Thus, the probabilities for each field given Adam's personality sketch are approximately as follows:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0345,
  "computer science": 0.1765
}
