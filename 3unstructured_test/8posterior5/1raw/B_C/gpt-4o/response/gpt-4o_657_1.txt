To estimate the probability \( P(H|E) \) (posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field, given his personality sketch), we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in any other field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch, which can be derived from the law of total probability but is common to both calculations and thus acts as a normalizer.

Let's analyze each field:

### Business Administration
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H \text{ for business administration}) \)**:
   - Given the wide range of graduate programs available, let's assume a relatively equal prior probability distribution across main fields. This is quite arbitrary without specific data, but let's assume:
     \( P(H \text{ for business administration}) = 0.1 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H \text{ for business administration}) \)**:
   - Given Adam's personality sketch, a strong curiosity about nature and deep love for animals doesn't strongly align with business administration. These characteristics are not typical for a business student, though his intelligence might help.
     \( P(E|H \text{ for business administration}) = 0.02 \)

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H \text{ for business administration}) \)**:
   - This is trickier and requires normalizing across all fields, but let's assume that the traits are more common among certain other fields:
     \( P(E|\neg H \text{ for business administration}) = 0.1 \)

### Computer Science
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H \text{ for computer science}) \)**:
   - Similar to business administration in the absence of specific data:
     \( P(H \text{ for computer science}) = 0.1 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H \text{ for computer science}) \)**:
   - Adam's intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of puzzles fit well with computer science.
     \( P(E|H \text{ for computer science}) = 0.4 \)

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H \text{ for computer science}) \)**:
   - Again assuming normalization but that personality is less likely across all other fields than it is for CS:
     \( P(E|\neg H \text{ for computer science}) = 0.1 \)

Given these values:

### Calculation
For business administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.02 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

For computer science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

Normalization transition:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

Though not simplifying to exact P(E), relative comparison using normalized terms:

For business administration:
\[ \text{representation} \approx \frac{0.02 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = 0.002 \]

For computer science:
\[ \text{representation} \approx \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = 0.04 \]

### Results
Making approximate relative terms could convert:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.95
}
```
Thus, Adam's personality matches computer science likelihood more after approximating basics of Bayes' method.
