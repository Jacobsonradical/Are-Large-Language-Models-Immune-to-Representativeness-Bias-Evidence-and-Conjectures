To use Bayes' Theorem to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) given the provided data and our hypotheses, we need to compute the following for each field:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in that field.

We'll make some reasonable assumptions to simplify our calculation:

- Assume there are a relatively large number of graduate fields, so the prior probability \( P(H) \) for either field is relatively low. Let's say each field has an even prior probability in our simplified model. Given no specific information about prior enrollment rates, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \) for each field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality traits given his enrollment in a specific field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality traits given his enrollment in any other field.

Let's estimate these probabilities first for each field:

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): Assuming an even prior, \( P(H) = 0.05 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Business students are less likely to exhibit traits a deep curiosity about nature, strong empathy, or a love for animals. So let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.02 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Considering the other fields collectively and Adam's traits which might be more common in fields like biology or environmental science, let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.05 \).

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

We need \( P(E) \), which can be determined as:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

\[
P(E) = (0.02 \cdot 0.05) + (0.05 \cdot 0.95) = 0.001 + 0.0475 = 0.0485
\]

Now, computing \( P(H|E) \):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.02 \cdot 0.05}{0.0485} \approx 0.0206
\]

### Computer Science
- \( P(H) \): Assuming an even prior, \( P(H) = 0.05 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Computer science students might have high intelligence and enjoy solving puzzles, but the deep love for nature and animals is less likely. So estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.03 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Again, considering the other fields and Adam's traits, let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.05 \).

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(E) = (0.03 \cdot 0.05) + (0.05 \cdot 0.95) = 0.0015 + 0.0475 = 0.049
\]

Now, computing \( P(H|E) \):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.03 \cdot 0.05}{0.049} \approx 0.0306
\]

Summarizing:

{
  "business administration": "0.0206",
  "computer science": "0.0306"
}

Note that the exact values can differ based on better estimations of probabilities \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \), but the given values reflect a reasonable assumption-based approach.
