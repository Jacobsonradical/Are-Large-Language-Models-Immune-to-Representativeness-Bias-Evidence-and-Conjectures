Let's begin by evaluating the likelihoods needed for Bayes' Rule for both fields.

Bayes' Rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( H \) is the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
- \( E \) is the evidence, which is the personality sketch of Adam.

We need to estimate:
1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the evidence given that Adam was not enrolled in the given field.
4. \( P(E) \): The total probability of the evidence, which can be calculated as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's start with the given fields.

### Business Administration

#### Step 1: Estimate \( P(H) \)
- The prior probability \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \) that a graduate student is enrolled in business administration. Let's assume it to be a moderate value like 0.2 (20%).

#### Step 2: Estimate \( P(E|H) \)
- Considering the personality sketch, Adam has a curiosity for nature, enjoys solving puzzles, has strong empathy, love for animals, and high intelligence. These traits do not typically align closely with business administration, which is more associated with management, economics, and finance.
- Let's assign a low probability to \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \), say 0.1 (10%).

#### Step 3: Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \)
- For students not in Business Administration, the evidence aligns better with other fields related to nature, puzzles, intelligence, and empathy.
- So \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \) could be relatively higher. Let's arbitrarily set it to 0.3 (30%).

### Computer Science

#### Step 1: Estimate \( P(H) \)
- The prior probability \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \) that a graduate student is enrolled in computer science. Given the popularity and breadth of the field, we take a reasonable estimate such as 0.3 (30%).

#### Step 2: Estimate \( P(E|H) \)
- Given Adam's intelligence, enjoyment in solving puzzles, and abstract thinking, these traits align well with computer science.
- Thus, \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \) might be higher, say 0.5 (50%).

#### Step 3: Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \)
- Similar to Business Administration, for students not in Computer Science, the evidence might still somewhat describe other non-CS students.
- We could approximate \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \) around 0.2 (20%).

### Calculation: Business Administration

Using Bayes' Rule, we calculate \( P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \):

\( P(E_{\text{BA}}) = P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \)
\( = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8 \)
\( = 0.02 + 0.24 \)
\( = 0.26 \)

Therefore,

\( P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E_{\text{BA}})} \)
\( = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.26} \)
\( = \frac{0.02}{0.26} \)
\( \approx 0.077 \)

### Calculation: Computer Science

Using Bayes' Rule, we calculate \( P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \):

\( P(E_{\text{CS}}) = P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \)
\( = 0.5 \cdot 0.3 + 0.2 \cdot 0.7 \)
\( = 0.15 + 0.14 \)
\( = 0.29 \)

Therefore,

\( P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E_{\text{CS}})} \)
\( = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.3}{0.29} \)
\( = \frac{0.15}{0.29} \)
\( \approx 0.517 \)

### Summary

Based on the above calculations:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.077,
  "computer science": 0.517
}
```

This means that, according to the given personality sketch and general assumptions, Adam is more likely to be enrolled in computer science than in business administration.
