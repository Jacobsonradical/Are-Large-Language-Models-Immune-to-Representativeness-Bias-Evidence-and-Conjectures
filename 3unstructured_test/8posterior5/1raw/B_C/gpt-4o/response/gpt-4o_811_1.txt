Sure, let's analyze and compute the probabilities:

First, we'll consider the prior probabilities, P(H), for each field which represents the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in each field before knowing his personality traits.

Let's assume:
- P(business administration) = 0.2 (since business administration programs are quite popular but not necessarily aligned with Adam's described nature).
- P(computer science) = 0.2 (since computer science is also a common field and could align with his interest in puzzles and abstract concepts).

Second, we'll consider the likelihoods, P(E|H), which represent the probability of observing the personality sketch given the hypothesis that Adam is in each specific field:

For business administration:
- P(E|business administration): This is relatively low, as business administration doesn't strongly align with Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, or solving puzzles. Assume P(E|business administration) = 0.1.

For computer science:
- P(E|computer science): This is relatively high, as computer science aligns well with Adam's puzzle-solving ability, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts. Assume P(E|computer science) = 0.4.

Third, weâ€™ll consider the complement probabilities, P(E|\neg H), which represent the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not in the specific fields:

For business administration:
- P(E|\neg business administration): Without considering business administration, Adam's traits fit better with fields like biology or environmental science. This is moderately high - let's say P(E|\neg business administration) = 0.5.

For computer science:
- P(E|\neg computer science): Considering Adam not being in computer science but in other fields closely related to his traits, this might be moderately high too - let's say P(E|\neg computer science) = 0.3.

Now, we apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we are not explicitly given P(E), but we can use the relationship:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's compute the posterior probabilities:

For business administration:
\[ P(E)_{business} = (0.1 \times 0.2) + (0.5 \times 0.8) = 0.02 + 0.4 = 0.42 \]
\[ P(business administration|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.42} \approx 0.048 \]

For computer science:
\[ P(E)_{CS} = (0.4 \times 0.2) + (0.3 \times 0.8) = 0.08 + 0.24 = 0.32 \]
\[ P(computer science|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.2}{0.32} = \frac{0.08}{0.32} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": 0.048,
  "computer science": 0.25
}

These values reflect the likelihood of Adam being in each field based on his personality sketch.
