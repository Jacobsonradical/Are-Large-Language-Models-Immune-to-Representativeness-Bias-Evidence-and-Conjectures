To apply Bayes' theorem here, we need to follow the steps outlined:

1. Determine the prior probability \( P(H) \) for each hypothesis.
2. Assess the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for each hypothesis given the evidence.
3. Assess the likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each hypothesis given the negation of the evidence.
4. Apply Bayes' theorem to find \( P(H|E) \).

Let's begin by setting some reasonable prior probabilities that Adam might be in each field:

- Assuming there are many fields Adam could be studying, let's assign a prior probability \( P(H) \) for computer science and business administration to be relatively small but equal. We might assume \( P(H_{cs}) = 0.1 \) and \( P(H_{ba}) = 0.1 \).

Next, we assess the likelihood \( P(E|H) \):

- Computer Science: Given Adam's characteristics (curious about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts), there is a reasonable likelihood that he would be in computer science. Let’s estimate \( P(E|H_{cs}) = 0.7 \).

- Business Administration: Given Adam's characteristics, it's less likely that business administration would be his field. Let’s estimate \( P(E|H_{ba}) = 0.3 \).

Then, we assess the likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):

- For computer science, given that Adam is not in this field, we assume he is in one of many other fields. The probability of having such attributes could be lower, let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H_{cs}) = 0.2 \).

- For business administration, we might assume \( P(E|\neg H_{ba}) = 0.4 \) considering that there are other fields that might better fit his personality.

Finally, we use Bayes' theorem to calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where \( P(E) \) can be calculated as:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs}) + P(E|H_{ba}) \cdot P(H_{ba}) + P(E|\neg H_{cs}) \cdot P(\neg H_{cs}) + P(E|\neg H_{ba}) \cdot P(\neg H_{ba})
\]

Given:

\[
P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) + (0.4 \cdot 0.9) 
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
P(E) = 0.07 + 0.03 + 0.18 + 0.36 = 0.64
\]

Thus, for computer science:

\[
P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.64} = \frac{0.07}{0.64} \approx 0.109
\]

For business administration:

\[
P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.64} = \frac{0.03}{0.64} \approx 0.047
\]

So, the probabilities calculated for each field are:

\[
{
  "computer science": 0.109,
  "business administration": 0.047
}
\]
