Sure, let's break this down step-by-step:

We'll use Bayes' Rule, which states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to estimate:
1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of someone in each field having Adam's personality sketch.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of someone not in each field having Adam's personality sketch.

### Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**
   - Let's assume \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.1 \) (10%), given the popularity of the field among graduate students.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**
   - Given Adam's traits (curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals), these traits are less common but not entirely unrelated to computer science. We might estimate \( P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.2 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**
   - To estimate \( P(E|\neg \text{computer science}) \), we consider that Adam's traits might be more common in fields like environmental science or psychology. So let's assume this to be \( P(E|\neg \text{computer science}) = 0.3 \).

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**
   - Let's assume \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.1 \) (10%).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**
   - Business administration is less likely to attract people with Adam's traits (high empathy, curiosity about nature). So, let's estimate \( P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.1 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**
   - Given the same reasoning as above, \( P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) \) might be around \( 0.3 \).

### Bayesâ€™ Rule Calculations

Remember that in Bayesian statistics, the scale matters more than the exact values if we are comparing multiple hypotheses. To simplify, let's assume \( P(E) \approx P(E|\neg H) \) since we are dealing across multiple fields, especially if they are minorities in graduate specializations.

Let's compute \( P(H|E) \):

#### Computer Science
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.3} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.3} \approx 0.067 \]

#### Business Administration
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.3} \approx \frac{0.01}{0.3} \approx 0.033 \]

### Final Answer

{
  "computer science": "0.067",
  "business administration": "0.033"
}

These probabilities suggest that given Adam's personality traits, it's more likely (relatively) that he would be in Computer Science than in Business Administration, although both probabilities are quite low.
