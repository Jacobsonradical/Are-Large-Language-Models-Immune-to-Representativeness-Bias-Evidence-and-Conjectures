To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we can use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the specified field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is enrolled in the specified field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is not enrolled in the specified field (sum of all other fields).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing Adam's personality traits, which can be expressed as \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \).

For simplicity, let's assume the following prior probabilities (as it's not given):

- \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.2 \) (probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science)
- \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.2 \) (probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration)
- \( P(\neg H_{CS}) = 0.8 \) (probability that Adam was not enrolled in computer science)
- \( P(\neg H_{BA}) = 0.8 \) (probability that Adam was not enrolled in business administration)

Now let's estimate the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \):

For computer science:

- Given Adam's curiosity about nature, interest in puzzles, high intelligence, and abstract concepts comprehension, we can say \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.6 \).
- Given the same traits in another field, say biology, psychology, or environmental science, we might estimate \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.4 \).

For business administration:

- Given Adam's empathy, appreciation for hard work, and love for animals, itâ€™s less directly related to business administration, so let's estimate \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.2 \).
- Given these traits in another field, the likelihood might be higher in fields like sociology, environmental studies, or psychology \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.4 \).

Using these numbers, we can calculate \( P(H|E) \).

For computer science:

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS})P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H_{CS})P(H_{CS}) + P(E|\neg H_{CS})P(\neg H_{CS}) \):

\[ P(E) = 0.6 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8 = 0.12 + 0.32 = 0.44 \]

Then:

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{0.44} \approx 0.273 \]

For business administration:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA})P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H_{BA})P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA})P(\neg H_{BA}) \):

\[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8 = 0.04 + 0.32 = 0.36 \]

Then:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.36} \approx 0.111 \]

Thus, the computed probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": 0.273,
  "business administration": 0.111
}
