To calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the following for each field:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is in a certain field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam having characteristics \( E \) given he is in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam having characteristics \( E \) given he is not in that field.

Using these, we can compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we do not have the exact value for \( P(E) \), we will assume it is the same for both fields for the sake of comparison.

### Business Administration

1. \( P(H_{BA}) \): The prior probability Adam is in business administration. Suppose this is a broad and somewhat common field, we might estimate it as 0.2.
2. \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): Given the description, Adam's traits are less likely to be perfectly aligned with business administration, which typically values different skills (e.g., networking, leadership). Assume this is 0.2.
3. \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \): The probability of Adam having these characteristics and *not* being in business administration could be relatively higher since many other fields value curiosity, intelligence, and empathy. Assume this is 0.6.

### Computer Science

1. \( P(H_{CS}) \): The prior probability Adam is in computer science. This is a popular field for high-intelligence individuals who enjoy solving puzzles. We might estimate this as 0.3.
2. \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): The likelihood of the personality matching computer science is relatively high due to his love of puzzles and intelligence. Assume this is 0.7.
3. \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \): Given his traits are generalized and not specific to only computer science, we assume a lower probability here, say 0.5.

Now we can use these estimates to compare the posterior probabilities. While calculation precision is important, we'll give approximations for intuition.

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) = 0.2 \cdot 0.2 = 0.04 \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) = 0.7 \cdot 0.3 = 0.21 \]

Since \( P(E) \) is constant and not given, we will compare these values directly.

Therefore, the normalized probabilities would roughly be:

{
  "business administration": "0.16",
  "computer science": "0.84"
}

(Note: These values are comparative and based on approximations. Actual computation requires accurate priors.)
