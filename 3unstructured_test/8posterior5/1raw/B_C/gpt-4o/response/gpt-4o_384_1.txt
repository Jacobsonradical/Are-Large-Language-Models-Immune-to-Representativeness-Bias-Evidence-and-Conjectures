To evaluate the probabilities for Adam being enrolled in business administration and computer science based on his personality sketch (E), we will use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field (business administration or computer science).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is not enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing Adam's personality traits.

### Business Administration
#### Prior Probability \( P(H) \):
Graduate students in business administration are quite common, but let's assume \( P(H) \) to be moderate.
\[ P(H_{BA}) = 0.2 \]

#### Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):
The traits described in the sketch, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, and a love for animals, are less likely to be seen in business administration students. However, being good at abstract concepts might fit to some extent:
\[ P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.2 \]

#### Alternative Hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H) \):
Considering the wide range of students from different fields and the less specific nature of these traits:
\[ P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.5 \]

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.5} = 0.08 \]

### Computer Science
#### Prior Probability \( P(H) \):
Graduate students in computer science are also relatively common, especially given the high value placed on abstract thinking and puzzle-solving:
\[ P(H_{CS}) = 0.3 \]

#### Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):
Traits like intelligence, solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts align well with computer science:
\[ P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.7 \]

#### Alternative Hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H) \):
Given the specificity of the traits in question and a moderate prevalence in other fields:
\[ P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.4 \]

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.3}{0.4} = 0.525 \]

Combining these results together, we have:

{
  "business administration": 0.08,
  "computer science": 0.525
}

Note that these values do not sum up to 1 because there are other graduate fields that Adam might be enrolled in, but these results provide a comparative likelihood based on his personality traits for these specific fields.
