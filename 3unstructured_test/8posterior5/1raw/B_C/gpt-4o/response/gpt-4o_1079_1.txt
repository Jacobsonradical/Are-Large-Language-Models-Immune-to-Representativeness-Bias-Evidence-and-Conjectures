To solve this, let's consider prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \), and calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule.

Bayes' rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assuming we don't know much about the base rates for each field, we can use reasonable estimates based on the provided personality sketch.

### Business Administration

#### P(H):  
We assume a prior equal probability, so for graduate students, let's assume:
\[ P(\text{business administration}) = 0.1 \]

#### P(E|H):
Likelihood of the personality sketch given business administration. Business administration may not strictly align with a love for nature and animals but could still have some curious and empathetic individuals.
\[ P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.3 \]

#### P(E|\neg H):
Likelihood of the personality sketch given anything other than business administration (all other fields combined).
\[ P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) = 0.7 \]

### Computer Science

#### P(H):
We assume the same prior as for business administration:
\[ P(\text{computer science}) = 0.1 \]

#### P(E|H):
Likelihood of the personality sketch given computer science. Computer science aligns well with being quiet, solving puzzles, and being intelligent.
\[ P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.8 \]

#### P(E|\neg H):
Likelihood of the personality sketch given anything other than computer science (all other fields combined).
\[ P(E|\neg \text{computer science}) = 0.6 \]

Now we calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for both fields.

First, let's define a common term used in both calculations:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

#### For Business Administration:
\[ P(E)_{\text{business administration}} = (0.3)(0.1) + (0.7)(0.9) \]
\[ P(E)_{\text{business administration}} = 0.03 + 0.63 = 0.66 \]

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{(0.3)(0.1)}{0.66} \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.66} \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) \approx 0.0455 \]

#### For Computer Science:
\[ P(E)_{\text{computer science}} = (0.8)(0.1) + (0.6)(0.9) \]
\[ P(E)_{\text{computer science}} = 0.08 + 0.54 = 0.62 \]

\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{(0.8)(0.1)}{0.62} \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.62} \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) \approx 0.129 \]

### Results:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0455,
  "computer science": 0.129
}
```

Note: These values are approximate and simplified for understanding. The exact prior probabilities might differ and could adjust the results.
