To solve this problem using Bayes' theorem, we need to assess \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study. To do this, we must first estimate three probabilities for each hypothesis \( H \):

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam’s personality sketch given that he is enrolled in the field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam’s personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in the field.

We will then use Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we are comparing two fields, we do not need the exact value of \( P(E) \) because it is a normalizing constant that will be the same for both fields. We only need the relative probabilities to determine which is more likely.

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability (\( P(H_{BA}) \))**: Business administration is a relatively common field, so let's assign it a moderate prior. 
   \[
   P(H_{BA}) \approx 0.2
   \]

2. **Likelihood (\( P(E|H_{BA}) \))**: Given Adam’s interests and personality traits, it seems less likely he would fit perfectly into business administration compared to a more scientific field.
   \[
   P(E|H_{BA}) \approx 0.1
   \]

3. **Likelihood (\( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \))**: For all other fields combined, it's more likely to encounter someone with Adam’s profile.
   \[
   P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \approx 0.5
   \]

### Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability (\( P(H_{CS}) \))**: Computer Science is also a common field, particularly for students with high intelligence and abstract thinking abilities.
   \[
   P(H_{CS}) \approx 0.3
   \]

2. **Likelihood (\( P(E|H_{CS}) \))**: The likelihood is quite high, given that computer science students often exhibit high intelligence, puzzle-solving interest, and sometimes quiet demeanor.
   \[
   P(E|H_{CS}) \approx 0.5
   \]

3. **Likelihood (\( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \))**: For all other fields, it's less likely to see the exact combination of traits in a single individual.
   \[
   P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \approx 0.2
   \]

### Using Bayes' Rule

#### Business Administration
\[
P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{P(E)}
\]

#### Computer Science
\[
P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.5 \times 0.3}{P(E)}
\]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both, we can compare the numerators directly:

\[
P(H_{BA}|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02
\]
\[
P(H_{CS}|E) \propto 0.5 \times 0.3 = 0.15
\]

We see that \( P(H_{CS}|E) \) is significantly higher than \( P(H_{BA}|E) \).

### Conclusion

{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.15
}

These numbers show that it is much more likely that Adam is studying computer science rather than business administration.
