To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch of Adam, we need to evaluate the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood of the evidence given not-H, \( P(E|\neg H) \). Then, we can compute the posterior probability using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where,

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Assume that \( P(\neg H) \) is the uniform distribution over all other possible fields, allowing us to approximate \( P(E) \). Note that for simplicity, we will not go into the exact calculations of \( P(E) \) from all other fields, but we'll discuss it in a qualitative sense.

### Hypothesis 1: Computer Science
**P(H):** Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Assuming equal probability across fields, this might be moderately likely because many graduate students are in CS.
**P(E|H):** Probability of Adam having the personality E given he's studying computer science. This is fairly moderate - CS students often have high intelligence and enjoy puzzles, but empathy and nature might not be as directly related.
**P(E|\neg H):** Assuming large fields, this is likely higher because the empathy and love for nature may align more closely with other fields.

### Hypothesis 2: Business Administration
**P(H):** Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. This could be less likely compared to CS, given a lower proportion of graduates in this field compared to other STEM fields.
**P(E|H):** Probability of Adam having personality E given he's studying business administration. This is less probable - business administration students might have strong work ethic but not necessarily a strong love for nature or empathy traits.
**P(E|\neg H):** This would again be moderately high as many fields would likely capture the empathy and nature attributes better than business admin.

Here are the approximations for the probabilities:

**Computer Science:**
- \( P(H) \approx 0.15 \) (assuming slightly higher representation of CS among graduates)
- \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \) (moderately likely given certain personality traits)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.7 \) (other fields might align better)

**Business Administration:**
- \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \) (assuming less prevalent among graduate students)
- \( P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \) (less align with personality)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.8 \) (nature, empathy more aligned with other fields)

Using Bayes' Rule and qualitative understanding:

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

### Approximated Posterior Probabilities:
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

These probabilities are qualitative approximations based on given personality sketch and typical field distributions. Adjustments could be needed for real distributions.
