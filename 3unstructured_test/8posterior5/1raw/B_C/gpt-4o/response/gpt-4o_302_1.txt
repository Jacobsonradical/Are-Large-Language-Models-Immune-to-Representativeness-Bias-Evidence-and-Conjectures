To estimate \(P(H|E)\) for each of the given fields, we need the following probabilities:
1. \(P(H)\) - Prior probability that Adam is in that field.
2. \(P(E|H)\) - Probability of Adam having the described personality sketch, given that he is in that field.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\) - Probability of Adam having the described personality sketch, given that he is not in that field.

Here are the estimates for the fields of business administration and computer science.

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is in Business Administration. Business Administration is a common field, but given the traits described, which lean more towards science and analysis rather than organizational management, the prior might be lower. Let's assume,
  \(P(H) = 0.2\).

- **P(E|H)**: The probability that someone in Business Administration has the personality sketch described. Business Administration might attract people with good people skills and empathy, but not necessarily a fascination with nature and abstract concepts at a high level. Let's assume,
  \(P(E|H) = 0.1\).

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of having the described personality sketch given that Adam is not in Business Administration. Given the traits which align more with scientific fields, the probability might be moderate. Let's assume,
  \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.3\).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.1 \times 0.2 + 0.3 \times 0.8} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.24} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.26} \approx 0.077 \]

### Computer Science
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is in Computer Science. Computer Science is a highly popular field for graduate students. Adam's traits of high intelligence, abstract thinking, and problem-solving align well with Computer Science. Let's assume,
  \(P(H) = 0.4\).

- **P(E|H)**: The probability that someone in Computer Science has the described personality sketch. Computer Science often attracts individuals who are intelligent, enjoy solving puzzles, and think abstractly. Let's assume,
  \(P(E|H) = 0.5\).

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of having the described personality sketch given that Adam is not in Computer Science. Similar to before, given the described traits favor science and analysis, let's assume,
  \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.25\).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \times 0.4}{0.5 \times 0.4 + 0.25 \times 0.6} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2}{0.2 + 0.15} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \approx 0.571 \]

Thus, the results are:

{
  "business administration": 0.077,
  "computer science": 0.571
}
