To answer this question using Bayes' theorem, we need to make some assumptions and estimates for each field:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is studying in the specified field, which we can consider as the general proportion of students enrolled in that field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in the specified field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in the specified field.

### Computer Science

1. **P(H)**: Let's assume computer science has around 15% of the graduate student population.
   - P(H) ≈ 0.15

2. **P(E|H)**: Considering Adam's personality sketch (curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, high intelligence), it's somewhat aligned with computer science, though not perfectly.
   - P(E|H) ≈ 0.4

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: This is more challenging to estimate, but considering fields other than computer science where his traits might also be valued (like Biology, Environmental Science, etc.), let's estimate:
   - P(E|\neg H) ≈ 0.2

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.15}{0.4 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.17} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.23} ≈ 0.26 \]

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: Let's assume business administration has around 10% of the graduate student population.
   - P(H) ≈ 0.10

2. **P(E|H)**: Adam's personality traits (curiosity about nature, empathy) do not strongly align with business administration.
   - P(E|H) ≈ 0.2

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Using the same logic as above, fields other than business administration could have similar estimates.
   - P(E|\neg H) ≈ 0.2

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.10}{0.2 \cdot 0.10 + 0.2 \cdot 0.90} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.18} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.20} = 0.1 \]
