To apply Bayes' rule to determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch, we need the following components:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field without any additional information.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits if he is enrolled in that specific field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits if he is not enrolled in that specific field.
4. \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch, calculated using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be computed using the law of total probability.

For simplicity, let's assume we are comparing two fields: business administration and computer science. To provide specific probabilities, we'll base our assessment on general knowledge and reasonable assumptions.

### Business Administration

1. **Prior probability (\( P(H) \))**:
   - Suppose the general proportion of graduate students in business administration programs is roughly 10% (\( P(H_\text{BA}) = 0.1 \)).

2. **Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \))**:
   - A business administration student may possess traits such as empathy and appreciation for hard work. However, the traits of curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, and a strong love for animals might be less common. Assume a moderate likelihood.
   - Let's assign \( P(E|H_\text{BA}) = 0.3 \).

3. **Likelihood of traits given not in business administration (\( P(E|\neg H) \))**:
   - Since these traits might align better with other fields, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_\text{BA}) = 0.6 \).

### Computer Science

1. **Prior probability (\( P(H) \))**:
   - Suppose the general proportion of graduate students in computer science programs is roughly 15% (\( P(H_\text{CS}) = 0.15 \)).

2. **Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \))**:
   - A computer science student often shows high intelligence and an interest in solving puzzles. However, traits related to nature and a strong love for animals might be less common, though not completely misaligned. Assume a relatively higher likelihood.
   - Let's assign \( P(E|H_\text{CS}) = 0.5 \).

3. **Likelihood of traits given not in computer science (\( P(E|\neg H) \))**:
   - Assume \( P(E|\neg H_\text{CS}) = 0.7 \) based on the eclectic personality traits fitting across different fields.

### Computing Posterior Probabilities

#### Business Administration

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_\text{BA}) \cdot P(H_\text{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_\text{BA}) \cdot P(\neg H_\text{BA}) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.3 \cdot 0.1 + 0.6 \cdot 0.9 = 0.03 + 0.54 = 0.57 \]

\[ P(H_\text{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_\text{BA}) \cdot P(H_\text{BA})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.57} \approx 0.0526 \]

#### Computer Science

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_\text{CS}) \cdot P(H_\text{CS}) + P(E|\neg H_\text{CS}) \cdot P(\neg H_\text{CS}) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.5 \cdot 0.15 + 0.7 \cdot 0.85 = 0.075 + 0.595 = 0.67 \]

\[ P(H_\text{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_\text{CS}) \cdot P(H_\text{CS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.15}{0.67} \approx 0.1119 \]
