To determine the likelihood that Adam was enrolled in either Business Administration or Computer Science, we need to apply Bayes' rule. The rule is as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We will assume some general probabilities based on typical characteristics of students in these fields and the described personality sketch. 

For **Business Administration**:
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in Business Administration might be moderately common, so let's assume P(H) = 0.15.
- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam’s personality sketch given he is in Business Administration seems less consistent, especially since his interests and traits do not strongly align with this field. I’ll assume a lower value, say P(E|H) = 0.05. 
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Because E involves traits that can apply to fields other than Business Administration, let’s assume P(E|\neg H) = 0.2.

For **Computer Science**:
- **P(H)**: Given the popularity of computer science among graduate students, we might assume P(H) = 0.3.
- **P(E|H)**: Adam’s high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of puzzles align well with Computer Science, suggesting a higher probability, say P(E|H) = 0.3.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Again, because E involves general traits applicable outside of Computer Science, we maintain P(E|\neg H) = 0.2.

Using these values, we calculate P(H|E) for each field.

For **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \]

For **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \]

To compute \( P(E) \), we recognize:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
For each specific \( H \), let's simplify:

For **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.15}{0.05 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85} \approx \frac{0.0075}{0.0075 + 0.17} \approx \frac{0.0075}{0.1775} \approx 0.042 \]

For **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.3}{0.3 \cdot 0.3 + 0.2 \cdot 0.7} \approx \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.14} \approx \frac{0.09}{0.23} \approx 0.391 \]

Thus, final values are:

{
  "business administration": 0.042,
  "computer science": 0.391
}
