To apply Bayes' rule, we'll first need to make some reasonable judgments about the probabilities based on the personality sketch provided. 

### Background Definitions
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the given personality sketch if Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the given personality sketch if Adam was not enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H|E) \): The probability that Adam was enrolled in that field given his personality sketch.

Let's consider the two fields one by one:

### Field 1: Business Administration
#### Judgments
- \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): Low. Considering the personality sketch focused on nature, animals, empathy, puzzles, and abstract concepts, these traits do not strongly align with what one typically expects for a Business Administration student.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): Low to Moderate. While some students in Business Administration might share some of Adam's traits, it is not the most typical alignment.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \): High. Other fields such as biology, environmental science, or psychology might more commonly exhibit these traits.

#### Estimates
- \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1 \) (assumed prior probability)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.4 \)

### Field 2: Computer Science
#### Judgments
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): Moderate. Adam's intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles fit well with a field like computer science.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): Moderate to High. The enjoyment of solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts strongly align with computer science.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \): Moderate. Other potential fields that fit Adam's interests can still exhibit similar traits, but with less emphasis on puzzles and abstract reasoning, such as biology or psychology.

#### Estimates
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.2 \) (assumed prior probability)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.6 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.3 \)

### Bayes' Rule
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Initially, \( P(E) \) can be complex to calculate directly but can be inferred from complementary events. Since we are comparing fields, we can simplify:

\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{(0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.4 \cdot 0.9)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \approx \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.36} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \approx \frac{0.02}{0.38} \approx 0.0526 \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{(0.6 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.24} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx \frac{0.12}{0.36} \approx 0.3333 \]

### Final Results
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0526,
  "computer science": 0.3333
}
```
These values suggest that, given Adam's personality sketch, it is more likely that he was enrolled in Computer Science than in Business Administration.
