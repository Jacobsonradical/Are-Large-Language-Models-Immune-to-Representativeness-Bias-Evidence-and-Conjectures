Sure, let's break this down step by step. 

We need to assess:
1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field \( H \).
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in \( H \).
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in \( H \).

Then, using Bayes' Rule, we can compute:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we are always dealing with the ratio of probabilities given the same evidence \( E \), we can use:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

For the sake of simplicity, we assume uniform priors and focus mainly on the likelihoods:

1. **Business Administration:**

- \( P(H) \): Let's assume the prior \( P(H) \) is 0.2, assuming there are 5 probable fields and each field would have an equal prior probability.
- \( P(E|H) \): Business administration typically does not strongly correlate with attributes like a genuine curiosity about nature, empathy, or a love for animals. Hence, we might assume the probability to be fairly lowâ€”say 0.1.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing someone with these traits in any field other than business administration may be relatively higher, say 0.3.

2. **Computer Science:**

- \( P(H) \): Let's assume the prior \( P(H) \) is again 0.2.
- \( P(E|H) \): Computer science might be more aligned with high intelligence and abstract thinking but less so with a deep love for nature and animals. So let's assume a moderate probability, like 0.3.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of encountering someone with these traits in other fields, given it's not computer science, would be higher than business but modest, say 0.25.

Now we compute the posterior probabilities.

Given \( P(\neg H) = 0.8 \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E|H)P(H) + P(E | \neg H) P(\neg H)} \]

**Business Administration:**

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.1 \times 0.2 + 0.3 \times 0.8} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.24} = \frac{0.02}{0.26} \approx 0.077 \]

**Computer Science:**

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{0.3 \times 0.2 + 0.25 \times 0.8} = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.2} = \frac{0.06}{0.26} \approx 0.231 \]

So, the posterior probabilities can be formatted as follows:

{
  "business administration": 0.077,
  "computer science": 0.231
}
