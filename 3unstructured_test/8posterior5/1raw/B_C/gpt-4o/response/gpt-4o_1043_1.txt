To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \), we will use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We will need the following components for each field:
1. \( P(H) \) - The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \) - The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in this field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in this field.

Assumptions:
1. Graduate student distributions across fields are approximately equal in the absence of evidence suggesting a particular distribution.
2. Adam's personality and interests can be evaluated against typical graduate student profiles for each field.

Let's make the following qualitative judgements before assigning numerical values:
- Computer science students often possess high intelligence and an affinity for solving puzzles, which seems to align with Adam's personality traits. However, the strong empathy and love for nature and animals might be less characteristic.
- Business administration students may appreciate hard work and dedication, but the other traits such as love for nature and strong empathy are less typical.

We can judge the probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): For simplicity, let's set the base rate for each field \( P(H) \) as 0.1 (assuming there are at least 10 fields and Adam could be enrolled in any of them equally).
2. \( P(E|H) \) for each field:
   - Computer Science: Given Adam's traits, \( P(E|H) \) might be relatively high.
   - Business Administration: \( P(E|H) \) might be lower, as Adam's traits seem less aligned with the typical profile.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): This is the probability of Adam's personality in all other fields, which we'll assume to be relatively balanced across different fields.

Using simplified qualitative judgments:
- \( P(E| \text{Computer Science}) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(E| \neg \text{Computer Science}) = 0.05 \)
- \( P(E| \text{Business Administration}) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E| \neg \text{Business Administration}) = 0.05 \)

Given \( P(H) = 0.1 \), we can compute \( P(H|E) \):

For Computer Science:
\[ P(\text{Computer Science} | E) = \frac{P(E|\text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science})}{P(E)} \]
Let’s assume \( P(E) = 0.15 \) for normalization.
\[ P(\text{Computer Science} | E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.15} = 0.2 \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(\text{Business Administration} | E) = \frac{P(E|\text{Business Administration}) \cdot P(\text{Business Administration})}{P(E)} \]
Let’s assume \( P(E) = 0.15 \) for normalization.
\[ P(\text{Business Administration} | E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.15} = 0.0667 \]

Therefore, based on the qualitative judgments and Bayesian calculations, here are the results:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.0667
}
