Sure, let's analyze the probabilities step by step using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll use the given personality sketch (E) and the hypothesis (H) that Adam was enrolled in specific fields.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### P(H): Prior probability of Adam being in each field.
- **P(H_business_administration)**: The base rate for students enrolling in Business Administration. Let's assume it's 0.2 (20%).
- **P(H_computer_science)**: The base rate for students enrolling in Computer Science. Let's assume it's 0.3 (30%).

#### P(E|H): Probability of the personality sketch given the hypothesis.
- **P(E|H_business_administration)**:
  - Curiosity about nature and solving puzzles are less typical but not impossible.
  - Empathy and a warm heart can be found in any field but might be less associated with the stereotype of Business Administration.
  - Understanding of hard work fits well.
  - Let's assume P(E|H_business_administration) = 0.1.

- **P(E|H_computer_science)**:
  - High intelligence and aptitude for abstract concepts are strong indicators.
  - Solving puzzles aligns well with problem-solving skills in the field.
  - Love for animals and empathy are less relevant but do not contradict.
  - Let's assume P(E|H_computer_science) = 0.3.

#### P(E|\neg H): Probability of the personality sketch given NOT the hypothesis.
Let's approximate P(E|\neg H) by thinking about how likely it is that someone with this personality profile would not be in the specified fields:
- Given how specific the personality sketch is, let's assume P(E|\neg H_business_administration) = 0.05 and P(E|\neg H_computer_science) = 0.1.

### Calculating Posterior Probabilities:

1. **Business Administration:**
\[ P(H|E)_\text{business_administration} = \frac{P(E|H)_\text{business_administration} \cdot P(H)_\text{business_administration}}{P(E|H)_\text{business_administration} \cdot P(H)_\text{business_administration} + P(E|\neg H)_\text{business_administration} \cdot P(\neg H)_\text{business_administration}} \]
\[ = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.05 \cdot (1-0.2)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.04} \]
\[ = \frac{0.02}{0.06} \approx 0.333 \]

2. **Computer Science:**
\[ P(H|E)_\text{computer_science} = \frac{P(E|H)_\text{computer_science} \cdot P(H)_\text{computer_science}}{P(E|H)_\text{computer_science} \cdot P(H)_\text{computer_science} + P(E|\neg H)_\text{computer_science} \cdot P(\neg H)_\text{computer_science}} \]
\[ = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.3}{0.3 \cdot 0.3 + 0.1 \cdot (1-0.3)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.07} \]
\[ = \frac{0.09}{0.16} \approx 0.5625 \]

Thus, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.333,
  "computer science": 0.5625
}
```
