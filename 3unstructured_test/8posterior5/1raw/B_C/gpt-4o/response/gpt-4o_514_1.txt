Judging the probabilities requires assessing each step of the process carefully. Here are the detailed steps for the necessary fields, including prior probability \(P(H)\), likelihood \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E|\neg H)\), as well as Bayes' rule application to compute \(P(H|E)\).

Let’s make some reasonable assumptions for these probabilities:

### Business Administration

1. **\(P(H_{BA})\):** The prior probability that Adam is studying business administration. Since business administration is a popular field, we can set this at 0.2 for the general pool of graduate students.
2. **\(P(E|H_{BA})\):** The likelihood that Adam has the described personality traits given he is studying business administration. The traits do not seem to fit the typical traits of a business administration student deeply. We'll assign this a lower value, say 0.1.
3. **\(P(E|\neg H_{BA})\):** The probability that Adam has the described personality traits given that he is not studying business administration. This might include fields that align more closely with his personality (e.g., biology, environmental sciences). Let's estimate this at 0.9.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA})P(H_{BA})}{P(E)}\]

Where:
\[P(E) = P(E|H_{BA})P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA})P(\neg H_{BA})\]

\[P(E) = 0.1 * 0.2 + 0.9 * 0.8 = 0.02 + 0.72 = 0.74\]

\[P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1 * 0.2}{0.74} \approx 0.027\]

### Computer Science

1. **\(P(H_{CS})\):** The prior probability that Adam is studying computer science. Given the popularity of the field, let’s set this at 0.25.
2. **\(P(E|H_{CS})\):** The likelihood that Adam has the described personality traits given he's studying computer science. Traits such as problem-solving skills and high intelligence align well with computer science. We'll assign this a moderate value, say 0.5.
3. **\(P(E|\neg H_{CS})\):** The probability that Adam has described personality traits given he is not studying computer science. As before, it's around 0.9.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS})P(H_{CS})}{P(E)}\]

Where:
\[P(E) = P(E|H_{CS})P(H_{CS}) + P(E|\neg H_{CS})P(\neg H_{CS})\]

\[P(E) = 0.5 * 0.25 + 0.9 * 0.75 = 0.125 + 0.675 = 0.8\]

\[P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.5 * 0.25}{0.8} = \frac{0.125}{0.8} = 0.156\]

So, in conclusion:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.027,
  "computer science": 0.156
}
```
