Firstly, let's outline our initial assumptions:

- P(H) represents our initial belief in the probability of Adam being enrolled in the specified graduate field without any further information.
- P(E|H) represents the likelihood of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is enrolled in the specified graduate field.
- P(E|\neg H) represents the likelihood of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is not enrolled in the specified graduate field.

Then, we can compute P(H|E), the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in the specified graduate field given the personality sketch E, using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll assume that P(E) is consistent across different fields for now, as we're comparing relative probabilities rather than attempting to assign an exact posterior probability without normalization.

### Business Administration

- P(H): Let's assume a reasonable initial probability of business administration is \(0.2\) (since there are many fields and we assume a non-zero chance for each given no information).
- P(E|H): The personality traits of curiosity about nature, enjoying puzzles, empathy, and love for animals seem less relevant to business administration compared to other fields. For an average business administration student, these traits are less likely. Let's put this at \(0.1\).
- P(E|\neg H): As these traits are more common in fields related to nature, puzzles, and abstract thinking, we can assume a higher baseline presence in other fields. Let's say \(0.3\).

### Computer Science

- P(H): Consider computer science with a similar baseline probability of \(0.2\).
- P(E|H): The traits, especially enjoying puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, align well with computer science. Let's estimate this at \(0.6\).
- P(E|\neg H): If Adam were not in computer science, these traits might still appear relatively frequently, so let's assume a value of \(0.3\).

Now we use these priors and likelihoods to compute the posterior probability via Bayes' rule:

### Business Administration

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.2 \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.02 \]

### Computer Science

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.6 \times 0.2 \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.12 \]

So, the unnormalized posterior probabilities are:

- Business Administration: 0.02
- Computer Science: 0.12

Now we present the values in the required format:

  "business administration": 0.02,
