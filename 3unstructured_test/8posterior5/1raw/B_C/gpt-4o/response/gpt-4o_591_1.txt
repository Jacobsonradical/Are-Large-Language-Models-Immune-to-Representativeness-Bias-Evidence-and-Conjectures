To compute the posterior probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for Adam being enrolled in either computer science or business administration, we need to apply Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we don't have absolute numerical values, we'll make educated estimations based on the personality sketch provided.

### Assumptions
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being in a particular field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's traits given he is in that field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's traits given he is not in that field.

We'll estimate these probabilities contextually:

#### Computer Science

**P(H):** The prior probability that a random graduate student is in computer science. Let's assume this is about 0.2 (20%), as computer science is popular.

**P(E|H):** Given Adam's high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts, combined with his curiosity, these traits fit well with the personality often found in computer science. Let's estimate this as 0.7 (70%).

**P(E|\neg H):** The probability that Adam has these traits but is not in computer science. We'll estimate this as 0.3 (30%).

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

#### Business Administration

**P(H):** The prior probability that a random graduate student is in business administration. Let's assume this is about 0.15 (15%).

**P(E|H):** Given Adam's empathy, warm heart, and appreciation for hard work, these traits align somewhat with business administration but aren't a strong match for typical business administration students, who might be more quantitatively or financially focused. Let's estimate this as 0.3 (30%).

**P(E|\neg H):** The probability that Adam has these traits but is not in business administration. We'll estimate this as 0.4 (40%).

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \]

### Simplification Using Same P(E)

Since \(P(E)\) is the same for both fields, we can forgo its exact value for comparison purposes:

\[ 
P(E) = \sum P(E|H_i) \cdot P(H_i)
\]

This simplification yields a relative comparison:

\[
\text{Rank} = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) 
\]

So our values are:

- For computer science: \( 0.7 \times 0.2 = 0.14 \)
- For business administration: \( 0.3 \times 0.15 = 0.045 \)

### Results

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.14,
  "business administration": 0.045
}
```

These values suggest Adam is more likely to have been enrolled in computer science given his personality traits and our assumptions.
