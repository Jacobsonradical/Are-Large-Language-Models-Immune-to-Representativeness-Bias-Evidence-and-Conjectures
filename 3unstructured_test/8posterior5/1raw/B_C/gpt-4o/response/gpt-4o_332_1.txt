To address this problem, we need to evaluate the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in either business administration or computer science, given his personality sketch. The relevant probabilities to consider are the prior probability of Adam being in each field (\(P(H)\)), the likelihood of the personality sketch given each field (\(P(E|H)\)), and the likelihood of the personality sketch not being given each field (\(P(E|\neg H)\)). Then, we can use Bayes' Rule to compute the posterior probabilities \(P(H|E)\).

### Business Administration
1. \(P(H)\): The prior probability that any graduate student is enrolled in business administration varies by the context, but let's assume a moderate prior:
   \[
   P(\text{Business Administration}) = 0.25
   \]

2. \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in business administration:
   - Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy are less typical traits for business administration.
   - Therefore, let's assume a low likelihood:
   \[
   P(E|\text{Business Administration}) = 0.05
   \]

3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): The likelihood of Adam’s personality sketch given he's not in business administration:
   - Given that he has qualities that might be found in many fields outside business (e.g., biology, environmental science), let's give this a moderate to high value:
   \[
   P(E|\neg \text{Business Administration}) = 0.2
   \]

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[
P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{Business Administration}) \cdot P(\text{Business Administration})}{P(E)}
\]
Where:
\[
P(E) = P(E|\text{Business Administration}) \cdot P(\text{Business Administration}) + P(E|\neg \text{Business Administration}) \cdot P(\neg \text{Business Administration})
\]
\[
P(E) = (0.05 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) = 0.0125 + 0.15 = 0.1625
\]
\[
P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.25}{0.1625} \approx 0.077
\]

### Computer Science
1. \(P(H)\): The prior probability for computer science might be slightly higher given the popularity of the field:
   \[
   P(\text{Computer Science}) = 0.3
   \]

2. \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in computer science:
   - Being good at solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts align well with computer science.
   - Therefore, let's assume a high likelihood:
   \[
   P(E|\text{Computer Science}) = 0.6
   \]

3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): The likelihood of Adam’s personality sketch given he's not in computer science:
   - Since many other fields also value solving puzzles and abstract thinking, let's keep this moderate:
   \[
   P(E|\neg \text{Computer Science}) = 0.25
   \]

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[
P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science})}{P(E)}
\]
Where:
\[
P(E) = P(E|\text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science}) + P(E|\neg \text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\neg \text{Computer Science})
\]
\[
P(E) = (0.6 \cdot 0.3) + (0.25 \cdot 0.7) = 0.18 + 0.175 = 0.355
\]
\[
P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.3}{0.355} \approx 0.507
\]

Final results, rounded to three decimal places:

  "business administration": 0.077,
