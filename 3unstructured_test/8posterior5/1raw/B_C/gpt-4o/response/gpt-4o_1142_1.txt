To calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) of Adam being enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch \( E \), we need to use Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here's the step-by-step reasoning for each field:

### Computer Science

**Step 1: Determine \( P(H) \)**
- \( P(\text{computer science}) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science. Let's assume, for a graduate student, the probability could be around 0.2.

**Step 2: Determine \( P(E|H) \)**
- \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \): The likelihood of Adam having his given personality if he is enrolled in computer science.
  - Curiosity about nature and plants: somewhat uncommon, but not impossible.
  - Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles: quite common.
  - Warm heart, empathy, love for animals: neutral, as it doesn't necessarily align with or contradict computer science students.
  - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: very common.
  - Appreciation for hard work: aligns well.

Given the above points, let's assign a value of 0.5 to \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \).

**Step 3: Determine \( P(E|\neg H) \)**
- \( P(E|\neg \text{computer science}) \): The likelihood of Adam having his given personality if he is not enrolled in computer science.
  - Considering there are many fields, let's assume this value to be 0.4.

**Step 4: Put it all together**
- Bayes’ rule: \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \)
  - We assume \( P(E) \) to be the same for all fields.

### Business Administration

**Step 1: Determine \( P(H) \)**
- \( P(\text{business administration}) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration. Let's assume this probability could be around 0.1.

**Step 2: Determine \( P(E|H) \)**
- \( P(E|\text{business administration}) \): The likelihood of Adam having his given personality if he is enrolled in business administration.
  - Curiosity about nature and plants: less common.
  - Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles: less common for business but not impossible.
  - Warm heart, empathy, love for animals: neutral, potential alignment.
  - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: important but not a primary characteristic.
  - Appreciation for hard work: aligns well.

Given these points, let's assign a value of 0.3 to \( P(E|\text{business administration}) \).

**Step 3: Determine \( P(E|\neg H) \)**
- \( P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) \): The likelihood of Adam having his given personality if he is not enrolled in business administration.
  - Let's assume this value to be 0.4.

**Step 4: Put it all together**
- Bayes’ rule: \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \)
  - Again, \( P(E) \) assumed to be the same.

### Final Calculations

Using the assumed values:
- For Computer Science:
  - \( P(H) = 0.2 \)
  - \( P(E|H) = 0.5 \)
  - \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \)
  - \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.5 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.1}{0.1 + 0.32} = \frac{0.1}{0.42} \approx 0.238 \)

- For Business Administration:
  - \( P(H) = 0.1 \)
  - \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \)
  - \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \)
  - \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.3 \cdot 0.1 + 0.4 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.36} = \frac{0.03}{0.39} \approx 0.077 \)

Here are the final answers:

  "computer science": 0.238,
