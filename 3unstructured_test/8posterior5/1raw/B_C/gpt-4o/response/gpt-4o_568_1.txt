To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' theorem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Assign prior probabilities for each hypothesis \( P(H) \).
2. Assign the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \).
3. Use Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \).

Bayes' theorem is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where 
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

### Estimation for "business administration":
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Let's assume that the probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration is relatively low given his interests and traits. 
   - \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.1 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Considering Adam's personality sketch, it doesn't strongly align with the usual traits needed for business administration. 
   - \( P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.2 \)

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - \( P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) = 0.8 \)

### Estimation for "computer science":
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Given Adam's traits of solving puzzles, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and curiosity about nature, the probability of him being in computer science is higher.
   - \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.4 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's traits are quite well aligned with computer science.
   - \( P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.7 \)

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - \( P(E|\neg\text{computer science}) = 0.3 \)

### Calculations:
Let's compute the combined probability first, \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(E|\neg\text{CS}) \cdot P(\neg\text{CS}) = 0.7 \cdot 0.4 + 0.3 \cdot 0.6 = 0.28 + 0.18 = 0.46 \]

\[ P(E) = P(E|\text{BA}) \cdot P(\text{BA}) + P(E|\neg\text{BA}) \cdot P(\neg\text{BA}) = 0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.8 \cdot 0.9 = 0.02 + 0.72 = 0.74 \]

#### Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.74} \approx 0.027 \]

#### Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.4}{0.46} \approx 0.609 \]

Hence the final answer is:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.027,
  "computer science": 0.609
}
```
