To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to use Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

In this problem, \( E \) is the information given in Adam's personality sketch. We'll denote \( H_{CS} \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science, and \( H_{BA} \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in business administration.

First, let's estimate the different probabilities mentioned in the problem.

### Computer Science

- **\( P(H_{CS}) \)**: The prior probability that a randomly selected graduate student is in computer science. Let’s assume this probability is around 0.1, as computer science is a popular field but there are many other fields as well.

- **\( P(E|H_{CS}) \)**: The probability that Adam has the personality sketch \( E \) given that he is a computer science student. People in computer science often have high intelligence and enjoy solving puzzles, but the fascination with nature and strong empathy might be less common. Let's estimate this as 0.3.

- **\( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \)**: The probability that Adam has the personality sketch \( E \) given that he is not a computer science student. This is harder to estimate but might be reasonably high, given the broad range of students who could match the personality traits described. Let's estimate it at 0.6.

### Business Administration

- **\( P(H_{BA}) \)**: The prior probability that a randomly selected graduate student is in business administration. Let’s assume this probability is around 0.1 as well.

- **\( P(E|H_{BA}) \)**: The probability that Adam has the personality sketch \( E \) given that he is a business administration student. This seems less likely as the connection to business administration is weaker based on the profile. Let's estimate it at 0.2.

- **\( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \)**: The probability that Adam has the personality sketch \( E \) given that he is not a business administration student. Again, let's estimate it at 0.6.

Now, let's compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

1. **Computer Science**:

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]
Assuming \( P(E) \) is constant for all hypotheses (it cancels out in relative comparisons):

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

2. **Business Administration**:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is common for both, we can compare the numerators directly:

1. Computer Science: \( 0.3 \times 0.1 = 0.03 \)
2. Business Administration: \( 0.2 \times 0.1 = 0.02 \)

When comparing these values:

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \approx \frac{0.03}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx \frac{0.02}{P(E)} \]

By normalizing:

- For computer science:

\[ \text{Normalized } P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.02} = 0.6 \]

- For business administration:

\[ \text{Normalized } P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.03 + 0.02} = 0.4 \]

Thus, we have:

\[
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.4
}
\]
