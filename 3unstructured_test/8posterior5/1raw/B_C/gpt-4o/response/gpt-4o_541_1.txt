To calculate the probability \( P(H \mid E) \), for each field, we need to apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, for simplicity, since we're comparing two fields for the same personality sketch \( E \), we can use the odds form of Bayes' rule and only need the relative values:

\[ \frac{P(H_1 \mid E)}{P(H_2 \mid E)} = \frac{P(E \mid H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E \mid H_2) \cdot P(H_2)} \]

Then normalize the probabilities for comparison purposes. I'll now estimate the necessary probabilities and then compute them.

**The Hypothesis:**
- H\_BA: Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- H\_CS: Adam was enrolled in computer science.

**Prior Probabilities:**
We generally don't know Adam's specific background, so for simplicity, we might assume:
- \( P(H\_BA) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(H\_CS) = 0.2 \)

Given Adam's interests and personality traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, high intelligence, abstract concept understanding), it seems more aligned with certain fields rather than business administration. Thus we might assert:
- \( P(E \mid H\_BA) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E \mid H\_CS) = 0.3 \)

**Complement Probabilities:**
- \( P(E \mid \neg H\_BA) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(E \mid \neg H\_CS) = 0.7 \)

Finally, normalizing using Bayes' rule, though we can't calculate \( P(E) \) directly, we can compare relative probabilities. Let's compute:

1. For Business Administration:
\[ P(H\_BA \mid E) \approx P(E \mid H\_BA) \cdot P(H\_BA) = 0.1 \cdot 0.1 = 0.01 \]

2. For Computer Science:
\[ P(H\_CS \mid E) \approx P(E \mid H\_CS) \cdot P(H\_CS) = 0.3 \cdot 0.2 = 0.06 \]

Let's normalize these:
\[ P(H\_BA \mid E) + P(H\_CS \mid E) = 0.01 + 0.06 = 0.07 \]

Then:
\[ P(H\_BA \mid E) = \frac{0.01}{0.07} \approx 0.142 \]
\[ P(H\_CS \mid E) = \frac{0.06}{0.07} \approx 0.857 \]

The final answers are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.142,
  "computer science": 0.857
}
```

These values reflect the likelihood, given the personality sketch \( E \), that Adam would be enrolled in these respective fields.
