Sure, let's break down the problem and use Bayes' rule to compute the probabilities. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of Adam being in the field.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is in the field.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\) is the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in the field.
- \(P(E)\) is the overall probability of Adam's personality sketch (normalization factor).

For simplicity, let's assume \(P(H)\), \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E|\neg H)\) based on common sense and the given information.

### 1. Business Administration
- **P(H_business)**: The prior probability that Adam was in business administration could be assumed to be reasonably lower given his interests in nature, animals, and abstract concepts. Let's estimate it to be \(0.1\).
- **P(E|H_business)**: The likelihood that someone with Adam's personality sketch would be in business administration might be low, given that business administration doesn't typically involve strong interests in nature and animals. Let's estimate \(0.2\).
- **P(E|\neg H_business)**: The likelihood that someone with Adam's personality sketch who is not in business administration matches his personality, which covers a lot of other fields he might be in. Let’s make it \(0.3\).

Now, we calculate \(P(H_business|E)\):
\[ P(H|E)_{business} = \frac{P(E|H_{business}) \cdot P(H_{business})}{P(E)} \]

### 2. Computer Science
- **P(H_compsci)**: The prior probability that Adam was in computer science might be higher, considering his high intelligence, puzzle-solving interest, and good understanding of abstract concepts. Let's estimate it to be \(0.25\).
- **P(E|H_compsci)**: The likelihood that someone with Adam's personality sketch is in computer science seems reasonably high. Let's estimate \(0.5\).
- **P(E|\neg H_compsci)**: The likelihood that someone with Adam's personality sketch who is not in computer science matches his personality. Let’s make it \(0.3\).

Now, we calculate \(P(H_compsci|E)\):
\[ P(H|E)_{compsci} = \frac{P(E|H_{compsci}) \cdot P(H_{compsci})}{P(E)} \]

To simplify \(P(E)\), we don't need the exact value (as we are comparing two fields and it will cancel out when normalized).

### Calculations:
\[ P(H|E)_{business} = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.02}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H|E)_{compsci} = \frac{0.5 \times 0.25}{P(E)} = \frac{0.125}{P(E)} \]

After normalizing (considering these two fields only):
\[
P(H|E)_{business} = \frac{0.02 / P(E)}{(0.02 / P(E)) + (0.125 / P(E))} = \frac{0.02}{0.145} \approx 0.138
\]
\[
P(H|E)_{compsci} = \frac{0.125 / P(E)}{(0.02 / P(E)) + (0.125 / P(E))} = \frac{0.125}{0.145} \approx 0.862
\]

### Answer:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.138,
  "computer science": 0.862
}
```
