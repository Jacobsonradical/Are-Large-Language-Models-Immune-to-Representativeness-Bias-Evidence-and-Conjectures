To determine the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field given Adam's personality sketch \( E \), we need to use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant and the same for both fields, we can compare \( P(H|E) \) for each field using proportional reasoning:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

To compute these values, we must make some reasonable judgments about each term in the context of graduate fields:

1. **Computer Science:** 
    - \( P(H) \): Assume a baseline probability that a random graduate student could be in computer science. Since many graduate students enroll in this field, let's estimate \( P(H) \) to be moderately high.
    - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's high intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and understanding of abstract concepts strongly align with computer science. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) to be high.
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Considering Adam’s qualities, students from other fields might also exhibit them to some extent, so this probability will be moderate to low.

2. **Business Administration:**
    - \( P(H) \): Assume a baseline probability that a random graduate student could be in business administration. This field also attracts many graduate students, so let's estimate \( P(H) \) to be moderately high.
    - \( P(E|H) \): While business administration involves understanding complex concepts, Adam's specific traits such as a strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature are less typical for a business student. Let’s estimate \( P(E|H) \) to be lower.
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Similar to computer science, other fields may partly exhibit these qualities. This probability will be moderate.

Now let’s assign values (these are estimates for conceptual understanding):

1. **Computer Science:**
    - \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.2 \)
    - \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.7 \)
    - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.3 \)

2. **Business Administration:**
    - \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.2 \)
    - \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.3 \)
    - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.4 \)

Using Bayes’ Rule proportionally:
  
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} \propto P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.7 \cdot 0.2 = 0.14 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} \propto P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.3 \cdot 0.2 = 0.06 \]

To normalize these:
  
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} = \frac{0.14}{0.14+0.06} = \frac{0.14}{0.20} = 0.70 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} = \frac{0.06}{0.14+0.06} = \frac{0.06}{0.20} = 0.30 \]

The resulting probabilities for Adam's enrollment in each field are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.70,
  "business administration": 0.30
}
```

These values suggest that, based on Adam’s personality sketch, it is more likely he was enrolled in computer science rather than business administration.
