Sure, let's approach this step by step using Bayes' Theorem. We're looking to determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in either Business Administration or Computer Science given his personality sketch \(E\).

Bayes' Theorem is:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here are the steps we need to take for each field:

1. Estimate \( P(H) \): the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field.
2. Estimate \( P(E|H) \): the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in each respective field.
3. Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \): the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in each respective field.
4. Calculate \( P(E) \): the total probability of observing the personality sketch \(E\).

Since we are comparing fields, we can focus on the relative likelihoods and priors and may not need an exact value for \( P(E) \) because it will cancel out when comparing the two fields.

### For Business Administration:
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
   Business Administration is a common graduate field, but given the details about Adam's interests and traits related to nature, puzzles, empathy, and intelligence, it seems less likely. Let's estimate:
   \[ P(H)_{\text{BA}} = 0.05 \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   The personality traits described are generally less consistent with the typical Business Administration student. Thus, let's estimate:
   \[ P(E|H)_{\text{BA}} = 0.01 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   This is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was not a Business Administration student. Let's estimate:
   \[ P(E|\neg H)_{\text{BA}} = 0.1 \]

### For Computer Science:
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
   Computer Science is a field that can encompass a variety of personality types, including those with strong intelligence, abstract thinking, and problem-solving skills. Let's estimate:
   \[ P(H)_{\text{CS}} = 0.1 \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   The traits described (intelligence, abstraction, puzzle-solving) align well with Computer Science. Thus, let's estimate:
   \[ P(E|H)_{\text{CS}} = 0.3 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   This is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was not a Computer Science student. Let's estimate:
   \[ P(E|\neg H)_{\text{CS}} = 0.05 \]

### Calculation using Bayes' Theorem

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} = \frac{P(E|H)_{\text{BA}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{BA}}}{P(E)} \]
Let's assume \( P(E) \) remains consistent for comparison:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} \propto 0.01 \times 0.05 = 0.0005 \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} = \frac{P(E|H)_{\text{CS}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{CS}}}{P(E)} \]
Assuming \( P(E) \) is consistent:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} \propto 0.3 \times 0.1 = 0.03 \]

We have the proportional likelihoods:
- Business Administration: 0.0005
- Computer Science: 0.03

After normalization (dividing each by the sum of both), it is clear that Computer Science is much more likely than Business Administration.

Here are the estimates:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.0164",
  "computer science": "0.9836"
}
```

This means that given Adam's personality sketch, it is much more likely that he was enrolled in Computer Science over Business Administration.
