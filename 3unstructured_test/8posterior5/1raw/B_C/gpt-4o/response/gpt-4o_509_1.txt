To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \), we can use Bayes' theorem, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we need to judge the probabilities subjectively, let's outline the components for each hypothesis:

1. **Business Administration (BA):**
   - **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration. Let's assume this to be relatively lower given his traits and interests mentioned.
     \[ P(\text{BA}) = 0.1 \]

   - **P(E|H):** The probability that Adam's personality sketch \( E \) aligns with someone studying Business Administration. This may not align strongly with BA, especially given his interest in nature, puzzles, and deep empathy.
     \[ P(E|\text{BA}) = 0.05 \]

   - **P(E| \neg H):** The probability that Adam's personality sketch \( E \) aligns with someone not enrolled in Business Administration. This value will be assessed considering other fields might be more fitting.
     \[ P(E|\neg \text{BA}) = 0.2 \]

2. **Computer Science (CS):**
   - **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science. Let's assume this to be relatively higher given his intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and good understanding of abstract concepts.
     \[ P(\text{CS}) = 0.3 \]

   - **P(E|H):** The probability that Adam's personality sketch \( E \) aligns with someone studying Computer Science. This is relatively high considering his interests in puzzles and abstract concepts.
     \[ P(E|\text{CS}) = 0.6 \]

   - **P(E| \neg H):** The probability that Adam's personality sketch \( E \) aligns with someone not enrolled in Computer Science. This value assumes that many other fields are less fitting.
     \[ P(E|\neg \text{CS}) = 0.2 \]

Now, letâ€™s compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \):

### For Business Administration:
\[ P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{BA}) P(\text{BA})}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( P(E) \) is summed over all possible hypotheses, but for simplicity, we can exclude it in comparison:

\[ P(\text{BA}|E) \propto P(E|\text{BA}) P(\text{BA}) \]
\[ P(\text{BA}|E) \propto 0.05 \times 0.1 \]
\[ P(\text{BA}|E) = 0.005 \]

### For Computer Science:
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{CS}) P(\text{CS})}{P(E)} \]

Again, simplifying without \( P(E) \):

\[ P(\text{CS}|E) \propto P(E|\text{CS}) P(\text{CS}) \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) \propto 0.6 \times 0.3 \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = 0.18 \]

Now we normalize these to actual probabilities by considering the sum:

\[ P(\text{BA}|E) + P(\text{CS}|E) = 0.005 + 0.18 = 0.185 \]

\[ P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.185} \approx 0.027 \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.18}{0.185} \approx 0.973 \]

Therefore, the approximate probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.027,
  "computer science": 0.973
}
```
