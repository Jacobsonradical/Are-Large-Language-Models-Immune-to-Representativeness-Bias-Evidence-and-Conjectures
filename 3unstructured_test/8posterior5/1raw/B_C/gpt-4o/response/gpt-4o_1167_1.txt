To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Rule, we need to evaluate the following terms:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being in the specified field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the evidence (personality sketch) given that Adam is in the specified field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the evidence given that Adam is not in the specified field.

Bayes' Rule is stated as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is constant for both fields and our goal is to compare them, it is sufficient to calculate the numerator of Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

### For Computer Science

#### P(H) - Prior probability of Adam being in Computer Science:
Let's assume that graduate students are evenly distributed among various fields. So, the prior probability might be around 0.1 (10%).

\[ P(H_{CS}) = 0.1 \]

#### P(E|H_{CS}) - Probability of the evidence given Computer Science:
Adam's traits such as high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment in solving puzzles align well with Computer Science. However, his deep love for nature, animals, and empathy may not align as strongly with typical profiles in this field.

Let's estimate this to be moderately likely:
\[ P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.5 \]

#### P(E|\neg H_{CS}) - Probability of the evidence given NOT Computer Science:
Given Adam's traits, it seems moderately likely that he could be in another field that also values his characteristics, such as biology or psychology.

Let's estimate this at:
\[ P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.6 \]

### For Business Administration

#### P(H) - Prior probability of Adam being in Business Administration:
Similar to the above estimation:
\[ P(H_{BA}) = 0.1 \]

#### P(E|H_{BA}) - Probability of the evidence given Business Administration:
Adam's empathy, strong appreciation for hard work, and dedication might fit Business Administration to some extent. However, his deep curiosity for nature and love for animals do not fit as well with typical business traits.

Let's estimate this to be somewhat less likely:
\[ P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.2 \]

#### P(E|\neg H_{BA}) - Probability of the evidence given NOT Business Administration:
Adam's traits are less typical for Business Administration but more typical for other fields, making it more likely he would be in another field.

Let's estimate this at:
\[ P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.7 \]

### Calculate Posterior Probabilities using Bayes' Rule:

#### Computer Science
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) = 0.5 \cdot 0.1 = 0.05 \]

#### Business Administration
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) = 0.2 \cdot 0.1 = 0.02 \]

### Normalize to get probabilities (assuming we only have these two fields for simplicity, but in actuality, other fields would be included in normalization):

Total = \( 0.05 + 0.02 = 0.07 \)

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.05}{0.07} \approx 0.714 \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.07} \approx 0.286 \]

### Result

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.714,
  "business administration": 0.286
}
```
These values give us an idea of the likelihood of Adam being in each of these fields based on the provided personality sketch.
