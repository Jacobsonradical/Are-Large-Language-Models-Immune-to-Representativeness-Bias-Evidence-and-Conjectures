Let's break this down step-by-step to understand how to use Bayes' rule to compute the probabilities.

Bayes' rule is:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of H.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of E given H.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of E.
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of H given E.

Firstly, we need to estimate the various probabilities based on the given personality sketch E.

### For Computer Science
- **Prior Probability \( P(H_{cs}) \)**: Let's assume that the overall likelihood of a graduate student being in computer science is moderate. We'll set this to 0.3.
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{cs}) \)**: Given Adam's attributes of high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles, these traits align well with computer science. We'll set this to 0.7.
- **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{cs}) \)**: This represents the probability of Adam having these characteristics if he is not in computer science. Given these characteristics can also be found in other fields (e.g., sciences, research-oriented fields), let's set this to 0.4.

### For Business Administration
- **Prior Probability \( P(H_{ba}) \)**: Let's assume that the overall likelihood of a graduate student being in business administration is moderate. We'll set this to 0.3.
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{ba}) \)**: Given Adam's traits, there are some mismatches (e.g., strong empathy and nature curiosity are less directly applicable). We'll set this to 0.2.
- **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{ba}) \)**: This represents the probability of Adam having these characteristics if he is not in business administration. We'll set this to 0.5.

### Calculating \( P(E) \)
\( P(E) \) can be complex to compute exactly but for simplicity, we'll approximate it by a normalization constant. In practice, it is a combination of all possible hypotheses.

### Using Bayes' Rule

1. **For Computer Science**:

\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs})}{P(E)} \]

2. **For Business Administration**:

\[ P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{ba}) \cdot P(H_{ba})}{P(E)} \]

Since it's binary, for normalization,

\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs}) + P(E|H_{ba}) \cdot P(H_{ba}) + \text{other fields} \]

But we'll compute the relative likelihoods:

\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs}) + P(E|H_{ba}) \cdot P(H_{ba}) = (0.7 \cdot 0.3) + (0.2 \cdot 0.3) = 0.21 + 0.06 = 0.27 \]

Now, compute the posterior probabilities:

1. **For Computer Science**:

\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.3}{0.27} \approx 0.778 \]

2. **For Business Administration**:

\[ P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{0.27} \approx 0.222 \]

Hence the results in the required format:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.778,
  "business administration": 0.222
}
```
