To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis (business administration and computer science) given the personality sketch of Adam (E), we will use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is common for both hypotheses, we can focus on the numerator \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for comparison. Let’s break down each part:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the respective field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of E given H, i.e., how likely Adam’s personality sketch would match if he were in that field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of E given that H is not true, i.e., how likely Adam’s personality sketch would match if he were not in that field. However, since we don't focus on this directly in the Bayes calculation but instead on the specific fields, we'll note it as the complement.

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: Business administration is a popular field, but considering Adam's personality sketch, the prior might be moderate.
   - Let's assume \(P(H) = 0.2\).
   
2. **P(E|H)**: Adam's curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and abstract thinking do not strongly align with the typical traits emphasized in business administration.
   - Let's assume \(P(E|H) = 0.1\).
   
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of someone with Adam's personality traits not being in business administration seems high.
   - Let's assume \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.6\).

### Computer Science

1. **P(H)**: Computer science is also a popular field for graduate students, particularly those high in intelligence and enjoying solving puzzles. So, this might be higher than business administration.
   - Let's assume \(P(H) = 0.3\).
   
2. **P(E|H)**: Adam's traits of problem-solving, intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts align well with computer science.
   - Let's assume \(P(E|H) = 0.35\).
   
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of someone with Adam's personality traits not being in computer science is lower but still reasonable.
   - Let's assume \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.7\).

Using Bayes’ rule for comparison:

\[ P(H|E \text{ for Business Administration}) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02 \]

\[ P(H|E \text{ for Computer Science}) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.35 \times 0.3 = 0.105 \]

Now, to normalize these probabilities for comparison:

Sum of all \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) values:
\[ 0.02 + 0.105 = 0.125 \]

Therefore,

\[ P(H|E \text{ for Business Administration}) = \frac{0.02}{0.125} = 0.16 \]
\[ P(H|E \text{ for Computer Science}) = \frac{0.105}{0.125} = 0.84 \]

Based on this brief analysis, the computed posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.16,
  "computer science": 0.84
}
