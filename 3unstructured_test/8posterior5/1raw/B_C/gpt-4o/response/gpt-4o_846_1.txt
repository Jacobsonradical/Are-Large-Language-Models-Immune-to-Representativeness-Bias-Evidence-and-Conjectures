To calculate the probabilities, we'll first estimate the values of \( P(H) \) (the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field), \( P(E|H) \) (the probability of observing Adam's personality traits given he is enrolled in each field), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) (the probability of observing Adam's personality traits given he is not enrolled in each field).

For simplicity, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \) as a general prior for each field (since there are many fields of graduate studies and we don't have specific prior information about Adam's likelihood of any specific field).

We'll use the personality traits provided to estimate \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \):

### Computer Science
- **P(H):** We assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).
- **P(E|H):** Computer science may align with Adamâ€™s high intelligence and puzzle-solving skills, but may not directly align with his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy.
  Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{CS}) \approx 0.2 \).
- **P(E|\neg H):** If Adam is in any other field, it's still possible but less specific in alignment.
  Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \approx 0.05 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)(1 - P(H)) \), we can calculate:
\[ P(E) \approx 0.2 \times 0.05 + 0.05 \times 0.95 = 0.01 + 0.0475 = 0.0575 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.05}{0.0575} \approx 0.1739 \]

### Business Administration
- **P(H):** We assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).
- **P(E|H):** Business administration typically involves people skills, decision making, and understanding complex concepts, but it less likely aligns with Adam's interest in nature and animals.
  Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{BA}) \approx 0.1 \).
- **P(E|\neg H):** Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \approx 0.05 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)(1 - P(H)) \), we can calculate:
\[ P(E) \approx 0.1 \times 0.05 + 0.05 \times 0.95 = 0.005 + 0.0475 = 0.0525 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.05}{0.0525} \approx 0.0952 \]

Therefore, the answers are:

{
  "computer science": "0.1739",
  "business administration": "0.0952"
}
