To compute the probabilities using Bayes' Rule, we need to consider the following for each field (computer science and business administration):

1. \( P(H) \) - The prior probability of Adam being in the specific field.
2. \( P(E|H) \) - The probability of the personality sketch given the hypothesis that Adam was in the specific field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was not in the specific field.

Then, we use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the personality sketch occurring, which can be expressed using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For simplicity, let's assume the priors \( P(H) \) are equal across all fields since we have no additional information. We will assume \( P(H) = 0.25 \) for each field, noting that they represent just two of many possible fields. Thus, \( P(\neg H) = 0.75 \).

**Computer Science:**

- \( P(H) \): Assume 0.25.
- \( P(E|H) \): Adam's traits like high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts align well with computer science, but empathy and love for animals are less aligned.
  - Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam having these traits if not in computer science could still be moderately high.
  - Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

**Business Administration:**

- \( P(H) \): Assume 0.25.
- \( P(E|H) \): High empathy and appreciation for hard work could fit, but curiosity about nature and deep love for animals might be less relevant.
  - Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam having these traits if not in business administration might be roughly similar.
  - Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

Now let's compute \( P(H|E) \).

**Computer Science:**

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.25}{(0.3 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.075}{0.075 + 0.15} = \frac{0.075}{0.225} \approx 0.333 \]

**Business Administration:**

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{(0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05}{0.05 + 0.15} = \frac{0.05}{0.20} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities for the fields are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.333,
  "business administration": 0.25
}
```

These values suggest that, based on the given personality sketch, it is slightly more likely that Adam was enrolled in computer science compared to business administration. However, considering the provided traits, there could be other disciplines better suited to Adam's profile that are not evaluated here.
