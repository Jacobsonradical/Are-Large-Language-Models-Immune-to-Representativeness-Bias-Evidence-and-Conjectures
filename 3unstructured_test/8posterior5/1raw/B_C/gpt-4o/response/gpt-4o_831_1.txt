To assess the likelihood that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or computer science based on his personality sketch, we will use Bayes' rule as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, given we don't have the exact figures for \(P(E)\), we will be comparing the relative values of \(P(H|E)\). Here's our assessment based on the personality sketch and our prior beliefs:

### 1. Business Administration

**P(H)**:
- Let's assume the prior probability \(P(H)\) for business administration is low, considering Adam's interests in nature, puzzles, empathy, and intelligence related to abstract concepts. People with these traits are less likely to choose business administration.
- **Estimate**: 0.05

**P(E|H)**:
- The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in business administration:
  - Genuine curiosity about nature and plants: Low
  - Enjoys solving puzzles: Medium
  - Warm heart, strong empathy: Medium
  - Deep love for animals: Low
  - High intelligence, good at abstract concepts: Medium
  - Appreciation for hard work and dedication: High
- Based on these, \(P(E|H)\) is relatively low because his personality doesn't strongly match typical business administration traits.
- **Estimate**: 0.1

**P(E|\neg H)**:
- The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is **not** in business administration. This would be higher given that traits like genuine curiosity about nature and a love for animals are less common in business fields.
- **Estimate**: 0.8

### 2. Computer Science

**P(H)**:
- Let's assume the prior probability \(P(H)\) for computer science is higher, considering Adamâ€™s high intelligence, strong understanding of abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving inclination. These traits are more aligned with computer science.
- **Estimate**: 0.15

**P(E|H)**:
- The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in computer science:
  - Genuine curiosity about nature and plants: Medium
  - Enjoys solving puzzles: High
  - Warm heart, strong empathy: Medium
  - Deep love for animals: Low
  - High intelligence, good at abstract concepts: High
  - Appreciation for hard work and dedication: High
- Based on these, \(P(E|H)\) is moderately high.
- **Estimate**: 0.7

**P(E|\neg H)**:
- The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is **not** in computer science.
- **Estimate**: 0.5

Now we compute the relative values of \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' Rule (without normalizing as we don't have P(E)):

### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E)_{business} \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.05 = 0.005 \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} \propto 0.7 \cdot 0.15 = 0.105 \]

The results in a comparative sense (normalized within this context) are:

\[ \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.105} \] for business administration

\[ \frac{0.105}{0.005 + 0.105} \] for computer science

Normalized comparative values:
- Business Administration: \( \frac{0.005}{0.11} \approx 0.045 \)
- Computer Science: \( \frac{0.105}{0.11} \approx 0.955 \)

Thus, the resulting probabilities (comparative likelihoods) are:

{
  "business administration": 0.045,
  "computer science": 0.955
}

So, Adam is much more likely to be in computer science given his personality sketch.
