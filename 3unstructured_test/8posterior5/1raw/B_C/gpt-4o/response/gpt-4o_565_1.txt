To calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) of Adam being enrolled in either computer science or business administration, we need to initially estimate the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), as well as the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Then, we can use Bayes' rule, which is:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

where

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

Given the personality sketch:

1. Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its plants.
2. He enjoys solving puzzles.
3. He has warmth, empathy, and a deep love for animals.
4. He understands and appreciates hard work and dedication.
5. He has high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts.

Let's break down our estimations:

**Computer Science**:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science. Given the field's popularity among male graduate students and the general qualities of solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts (which align), let's estimate this at approximately 0.2.

- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's personality traits, being good at understanding abstract concepts and enjoying solving puzzles aligns well with computer science. Let's estimate this at 0.4.

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likelihood that someone not in computer science shares these traits. Since these traits could align with various fields, let's consider this at 0.1.

**Business Administration**:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration. Given the broad applicability of business administration but considering specific personal traits that might not align perfectly with business administration, let's estimate this at approximately 0.15.

- \( P(E|H) \): Given the personality traits, a few do align with business administration (e.g., appreciation for hard work and dedication), but not all. Let's estimate this at 0.25.

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likelihood that someone not in business administration shares these traits. Similar to computer science, let's consider this at 0.1.

Now, we calculate the posterior probabilities:

**Computer Science**:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

For computer science:
\[
P(E)_{CS} = 0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.1 \cdot 0.8 = 0.08 + 0.08 = 0.16
\]

\[
P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.16} = \frac{0.08}{0.16} = 0.5
\]

**Business Administration**:

For business administration:
\[
P(E)_{BA} = 0.25 \cdot 0.15 + 0.1 \cdot 0.85 = 0.0375 + 0.085 = 0.1225
\]

\[
P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.25 \cdot 0.15}{0.1225} = \frac{0.0375}{0.1225} \approx 0.306
\]

Putting it all together in the requested format:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.306
}
```

These values represent the estimated probabilities that Adam was enrolled in the respective fields given his personality traits.
