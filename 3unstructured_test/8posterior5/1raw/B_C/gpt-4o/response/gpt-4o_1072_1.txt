To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration or computer science given the personality sketch, we will employ Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To simplify the problem, let's make reasonable assumptions for each prior probability and conditional probability.

### Hypotheses:
- \( H_{BA} \): Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( H_{CS} \): Adam was enrolled in computer science.

### Assumptions:
1. \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was enrolled in business administration.
   - Business administration students might have diverse backgrounds, but his love for puzzles, nature, and animals might not be strongly related.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.1 \).

2. \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was enrolled in computer science.
   - Computer science students are often good at solving puzzles and intelligent, as stated in E.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.4 \).

3. \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \) and \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was in other fields.
   - There are many other fields in graduate studies. Since we don't have an exact number, let's assume that someone with Adam's personality sketch fits moderately well in other fields.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.3 \) and \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.3 \).

4. \( P(H_{BA}) \): The prior probability of a graduate student being in business administration.
   - Given the diversity of graduate fields, let's assume a low probability.
   - Let's assume \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.1 \).

5. \( P(H_{CS}) \): The prior probability of a graduate student being in computer science.
   - Computer science has become a popular field, so let's assume a moderate probability.
   - Let's assume \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.3 \).

6. \( P(E) \): The total probability of observing the evidence.
   - \( P(E) = P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \cdot P(\neg H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \cdot P(\neg H_{CS}) \)
   - Simplifying, \( P(E) \approx \).

### Calculations:
1. For business administration:
   \[ P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) = 0.1 \cdot 0.1 = 0.01 \]
   \[ P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.3 \]
   \[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.27} = \frac{0.01}{0.28} \approx 0.0357 \]

2. For computer science:
   \[ P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) = 0.4 \cdot 0.3 = 0.12 \]
   \[ P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.3 \]
   \[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.3 \cdot 0.7} = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.21} = \frac{0.12}{0.33} \approx 0.3636 \]

Given the calculations, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0357,
  "computer science": 0.3636
}
```

Note: These values are subject to the assumptions made and any actual distributions might vary in a real-world context.
