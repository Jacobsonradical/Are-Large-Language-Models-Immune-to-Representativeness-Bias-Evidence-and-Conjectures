Let's assign probabilities based on the information provided in Adam's personality sketch.

### Business Administration

- **P(H) - Prior Probability for Business Administration:** 
  This is the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in Business Administration without considering the personality sketch. For simplicity, let's assume equal prior probability for any field. If there are many graduate fields, each might have a low prior probability. Let's assume \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \) = 0.1.

- **P(E|H) - Probability of Personality Sketch Given Business Administration:**
  While Business Administration might attract diverse personalities, it might be less common for the field to have someone with such a strong focus on nature, animals, and abstract concepts. Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \) = 0.05.

- **P(E|\neg H) - Probability of Personality Sketch Given Not Business Administration:**
  For all other fields, this probability might be slightly higher because Adam's personality aligns more with fields outside Business Administration. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \) \approx 0.2.

Applying Bayes' rule:

\[ 
P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{BA}})}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[ 
P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{0.05 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.18} \approx 0.027
\]

### Computer Science

- **P(H) - Prior Probability for Computer Science:**
  Using the same assumption for equal prior probability across many fields, let’s assume \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \) = 0.1.

- **P(E|H) - Probability of Personality Sketch Given Computer Science:**
  Given Adam's interest in puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, this field aligns well with his personality. Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \) = 0.4.

- **P(E|\neg H) - Probability of Personality Sketch Given Not Computer Science:**
  This would be slightly lower as the personality traits described fit well with Computer Science. Let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \) = 0.15.

Applying Bayes' rule:

\[ 
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{CS}})}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[ 
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.1}{0.4 \cdot 0.1 + 0.15 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.135} \approx 0.228
\]

### Summary
Based on these calculations:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.027,
  "computer science": 0.228
}
```

These values represent the estimated probabilities that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration or Computer Science given his personality sketch.
