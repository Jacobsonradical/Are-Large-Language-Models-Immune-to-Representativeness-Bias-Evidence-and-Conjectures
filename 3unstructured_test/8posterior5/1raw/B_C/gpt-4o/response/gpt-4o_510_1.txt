To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' Rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the problem, we need to assess the likelihoods and priors for each hypothesis (field of study) to compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \).

Let's break this down for each field:

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)** (prior): The probability that any given graduate student in the U.S. is studying Business Administration.
   - This can be relatively common as a graduate field, so let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \) (20%).

2. **P(E|H)** (likelihood): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in Business Administration.
   - Business Administration might attract people who are empathetic, hardworking, and intelligent but might not strongly correlate with a deep curiosity in nature and solving puzzles. Therefore, let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \) (10%).

3. **P(E|\(\neg\)H)** (likelihood): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in Business Administration.
   - For all other fields combined, let's guess \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.05 \) (5%).

### Computer Science
1. **P(H)** (prior): The probability that any given graduate student in the U.S. is studying Computer Science.
   - Computer Science is also a common graduate field, so let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \) (20%).

2. **P(E|H)** (likelihood): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in Computer Science.
   - Computer Science might attract people who are intelligent, love solving puzzles, and have a deep curiosity, but might be less likely for those into nature. So let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \) (30%).

3. **P(E|\(\neg\)H)** (likelihood): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in Computer Science.
   - For all other fields combined, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.05 \) (5%).

### Computing Posterior Probabilities
Using Bayes' rule for each hypothesis:

1. **Business Administration**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

\( P(E) \) (total probability of evidence):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
Assuming priors sum to 1:
\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H_{BA}) - P(H_{CS}) = 0.6 \]
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.2) + (0.05 \cdot 0.6) = 0.02 + 0.06 + 0.03 = 0.11 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.11} = \frac{0.02}{0.11} \approx 0.18 \]

2. **Computer Science**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

Using same \( P(E) \):
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.11} = \frac{0.06}{0.11} \approx 0.55 \]

So, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.18,
  "computer science": 0.55
}
```

These are the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration or Computer Science, given his personality sketch.
