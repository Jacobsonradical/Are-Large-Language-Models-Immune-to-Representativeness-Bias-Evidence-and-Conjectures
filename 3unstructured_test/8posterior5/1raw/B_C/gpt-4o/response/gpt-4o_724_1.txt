To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to consider the following probabilities:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was not in that field.

Given Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) (the overall probability of the personality sketch) will be constant for all fields and we are comparing just the relative likelihoods, we will focus on the numerators.

### For Computer Science:
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): The prior probability that a student is in computer science.
  - Assuming this is moderately common, we might assign a value like 0.15 (this value is illustrative).
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): The probability of the personality sketch given Computer Science.
  - Adam's high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts match well with Computer Science. Curiosity, puzzle-solving, and quiet nature also match, so we assign a higher likelihood, say 0.6.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \): The probability of the personality sketch given not Computer Science.
  - This is the complement: personalities may vary in other fields, but aren't typically as strongly matched as CS, so we assign a value like 0.3.

### For Business Administration:
- \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): The prior probability that a student is in Business Administration.
  - Assuming this is moderately common, we might assign a similar prior of 0.15 (this value is illustrative).
- \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): The probability of the personality sketch given Business Administration.
  - Adam's warm heart, empathy, and appreciation for hard work match somewhat but less closely to Business Administration, which often values extroversion and interpersonal skills. We might assign a lower likelihood, like 0.3.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \): The probability of the personality sketch given not Business Administration.
  - Higher in complement, a value like 0.4.

Now, applying Bayesâ€™ Rule relative:
\[
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.6 \cdot 0.15 = 0.09
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.3 \cdot 0.15 = 0.045
\]

To normalize and get the actual probabilities:
\[
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.045} \approx 0.67
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.09 + 0.045} \approx 0.33
\]

Thus, the final answers are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.67,
  "business administration": 0.33
}
```
These answers reflect the comparative likelihoods that Adam, given his personality sketch, was enrolled in either computer science or business administration.
