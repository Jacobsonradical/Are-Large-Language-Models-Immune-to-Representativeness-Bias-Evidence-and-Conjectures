To apply Bayes' Rule, we need to compute the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\), which represents the probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch \(E\). Bayes' Rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We also need to make educated guesses for the following probabilities:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch if Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch if Adam is not enrolled in that field.
  
\( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch, which can be computed as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

However, for simplicity, given that \( P(\neg H) \) covers all other fields not specified as computer science or business administration, we will focus on comparing the relative probabilities.

### Hypotheses:
1. Adam is enrolled in *computer science*.
2. Adam is enrolled in *business administration*.

### Assumptions:
Let us assume:
- \(P(H)\) is relatively low for both fields as they are specific options.
- Given his characteristics, let us assume that the traits fit computer science more closely than business administration based on traits like high intelligence, problem-solving interest, appreciation of hard work, and understanding abstract concepts.

#### Computer Science:
- \( P(H_\text{cs}) \approx 0.1 \): Low prior probability.
- \( P(E|H_\text{cs}) \approx 0.7 \): Likelihood is relatively high given his interest in solving puzzles, high intelligence, and appreciation for abstract concepts.
- \( P(E|\neg H_\text{cs}) \approx 0.3 \): Lower than \(P(E|H_\text{cs})\) but not negligible.

\[ P(H_\text{cs}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_\text{cs}) \cdot P(H_\text{cs})}{P(E)} \]

#### Business Administration:
- \( P(H_\text{ba}) \approx 0.1 \): Low prior probability.
- \( P(E|H_\text{ba}) \approx 0.2 \): Likelihood is relatively low because business administration typically does not align as closely with Adam's profile.
- \( P(E|\neg H_\text{ba}) \approx 0.5 \): Fairly high because the profile can fit many other fields more than BA.

\[ P(H_\text{ba}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_\text{ba}) \cdot P(H_\text{ba})}{P(E)} \]

### Estimations:
Given our assumptions, computing the exact \(P(E)\) is complex without a denominator, but we can still compare relative probabilities based on the numerators:

#### Results:
- For computer science:
\[ P(H_\text{cs}|E) \propto 0.7 \times 0.1 = 0.07 \]

- For business administration:
\[ P(H_\text{ba}|E) \propto 0.2 \times 0.1 = 0.02 \]

Since these values aren't intended to perfectly add up but rather to give a comparative sense:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
