To calculate the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Theorem, we need to evaluate the relevant components for each field:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \), which can be calculated as:
  \[
  P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
  \]

Let's make qualified assumptions for each component:

**1. Business Administration:**

- \( P(H) \): Let’s assume a prior based on general interest. Since business administration is one of many possible fields, a modest prior like 0.1 seems reasonable.
- \( P(E|H) \): The given personality traits (interest in nature, puzzles, empathy, love for animals) don't particularly align with typical business administration traits, though it’s not impossible. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) as 0.2.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Since there are many other fields and many could align more closely with Adam's traits, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.8 \).

\[ P(H|E_{\text{business administration}}) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.8 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.72} = \frac{0.02}{0.74} \approx 0.027 \]

**2. Computer Science:**

- \( P(H) \): If we assume an equal initial prior probability for various fields, let's again assume a prior of 0.1.
- \( P(E|H) \): Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which fits well with computer science. Hence, let’s estimate \( P(E|H) \) as 0.7.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.8 \) (same as above).

\[ P(H|E_{\text{computer science}}) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.7 \cdot 0.1 + 0.8 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.07}{0.07 + 0.72} = \frac{0.07}{0.79} \approx 0.089 \]

The computed probabilities (approximate values):

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.027,
  "computer science": 0.089
}
```

These values suggest that, based on the given personality sketch, Adam is somewhat more likely to be enrolled in computer science than business administration, although neither probability is particularly high given the assumptions.
