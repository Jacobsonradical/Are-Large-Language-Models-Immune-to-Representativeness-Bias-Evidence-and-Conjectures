To apply Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the following probabilities:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the evidence (Adam's personality sketch) given that Adam was enrolled in the specific field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of the evidence (Adam's personality sketch) given that Adam was not enrolled in the specific field.

Let's analyze the given fields:

### Computer Science

#### P(H)
The prior probability that a random graduate student is studying computer science. Let's assume, for simplicity, that this is around 0.2 (20%).

#### P(E|H)
Considering Adam's high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, and interest in solving puzzles, it's reasonable to assume that P(E|H) for computer science is relatively high. Let's assign it a high value, say 0.7.

#### P(E|\neg H)
The probability of the evidence given that Adam is not studying computer science. Given that there are many other fields where high intelligence and solving puzzles could fit, let's assume this to be moderate, around 0.3.

### Business Administration

#### P(H)
The prior probability that a random graduate student is studying business administration. Let's assume this is also around 0.2 (20%).

#### P(E|H)
Given Adam's warm heart, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, business administration is a plausible field, although less so than computer science based on his interests. Let's assign it a value of 0.4.

#### P(E|\neg H)
Again, given that there are many fields where empathy and appreciation for hard work could be relevant, we set this to a moderate value, say 0.4.

### Bayes Rule Calculation

Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where,
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Since we are only focused on the relative probabilities for the purpose of ranking likelihoods between computer science and business administration, we don't need to calculate \( P(E) \) explicitly. Instead, we can compare the numerators of Bayes' rule directly for each hypothesis.

### Comparison of Probabilities

For **computer science**:
\[ P(computer\ science|E) \propto P(E|computer\ science) \cdot P(computer\ science) = 0.7 \cdot 0.2 = 0.14 \]

For **business administration**:
\[ P(business\ administration|E) \propto P(E|business\ administration) \cdot P(business\ administration) = 0.4 \cdot 0.2 = 0.08 \]

### Conclusion

Comparing the computed values, computer science has a higher posterior probability than business administration.

Therefore, in the requested format:

```
{
  "computer science": 0.14,
  "business administration": 0.08
}
```
