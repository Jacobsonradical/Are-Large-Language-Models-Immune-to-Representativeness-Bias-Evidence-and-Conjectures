To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in the specified fields (business administration and computer science), we need to apply Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's break down the terms to estimate their values for each hypothesis (business administration and computer science).

1. **P(H)**: Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the given field.
2. **P(E|H)**: Likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in the given field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in the given field.
4. **P(E)**: Normalizing constant which ensures the total probability sums to 1, calculated as:
   \[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Since we're focusing on two fields, we can denote \(\neg H\) as the complement of H in the selected context.

### Evaluations

#### Business Administration
1. **P(H)**: Let’s assume a reasonable estimate that the probability of a graduate student in the U.S. enrolling in business administration is moderately high, about \(0.15\).

2. **P(E|H)**: Given Adam’s interest in nature, animals, and puzzles, it's less likely but not impossible he is in business administration. Say \(0.1\).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: This is the likelihood of his personality, given he is in any other field. Let's estimate it higher, since there are many other fields (e.g., biology, environmental science), say \(0.3\).

#### Computer Science
1. **P(H)**: Assume a relatively high probability for computer science among graduate students, about \(0.20\).

2. **P(E|H)**: Adam’s intelligence, interest in puzzles, and abstract thinking align well with computer science. Say \(0.4\).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Likelihood he exhibits these traits if he’s in any other field, let’s say \(0.2\).

### Calculations

Let's calculate the required terms for each field using these estimates.

#### Business Administration
\[ P(\text{business administration} | E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} \]

#### Computer Science
\[ P(\text{computer science} | E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} \]

Here \( P(E) \) can be approximated using normalization:
\[ P(E) = P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) + P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) + \text{other fields} \]

For simplicity, we ignore "other fields" in this context since our total does not need to add up to 1.

\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.15) + (0.4 \cdot 0.20) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.015 + 0.08 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.095 \]

Now, using Bayes' Rule for each:

\[ P(\text{business administration} | E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{0.095} \approx 0.1579 \]
\[ P(\text{computer science} | E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.20}{0.095} \approx 0.8421 \]

### Final Results
Based on this estimation:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1579,
  "computer science": 0.8421
}
