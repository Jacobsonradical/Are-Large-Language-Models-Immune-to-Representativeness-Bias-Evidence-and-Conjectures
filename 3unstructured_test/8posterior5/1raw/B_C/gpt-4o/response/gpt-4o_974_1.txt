To answer this question using Bayes' theorem, we need to estimate certain probabilities for each field:

1. **P(H):** The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field.
2. **P(E|H):** The likelihood of observing traits described in E if Adam is enrolled in the given field.
3. **P(E|\(\neg\)H):** The likelihood of observing traits described in E if Adam is not enrolled in the given field.
4. **P(H|E):** The posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in the given field given the traits described.

Let's estimate these probabilities for each field as follows:

### Computer Science
- **P(H):** Let's assume the prior probability that Adam could be in any graduate field is uniform for simplification. Given the large number of fields, let's use an approximate value of 0.2 (assuming the likelihood of being in a tech-related field in the U.S.).
- **P(E|H):** Given Adam's characteristics (high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts), this is moderately high, say 0.7.
- **P(E|\(\neg\)H):** The probability of having these characteristics but being in a different field. Considering many fields value intelligence and abstract thinking, let's use a lower value, say 0.3.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Given that \(P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)\),

\[P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) = 0.14 + 0.24 = 0.38\]

Then,
\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.38} ≈ 0.368\]

### Business Administration
- **P(H):** Let's use a similar prior for diversity, say 0.1 (considering it's relatively less common compared to tech fields).
- **P(E|H):** Adam’s characteristics like empathy, understanding hard work might be moderately high in this field, say 0.6.
- **P(E|\(\neg\)H):** Again considering other fields' traits, let’s use 0.4.

Again using Bayes' theorem:

\[P(E) = (0.6 \cdot 0.1) + (0.4 \cdot 0.9) = 0.06 + 0.36 = 0.42\]

Then,
\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.1}{0.42} ≈ 0.143\]

So, the results would be:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.368,
  "business administration": 0.143
}
```

These values are rough estimates to illustrate the use of Bayes' rule. With more precise data, the estimates could be improved.
