Sure, let's follow the Bayesian inference method to calculate the probability \( P(H|E) \) (the probability Adam was enrolled in a given field given his personality sketch). We first need to estimate the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

1. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Let's say the prior probability that a random graduate student is in Computer Science is relatively high in the U.S. due to the popularity of the field. We can estimate this as 0.2 (20%).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of having Adam's personality sketch if he were in Computer Science might be moderate. Computer Scientists often enjoy solving puzzles and can have high intelligence, but other traits like strong empathy may be less common, so we can estimate this as 0.3.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of having Adam's personality sketch if he were NOT in Computer Science. Given the diversity of other fields, it's quite possible to have Adam's traits. Let's estimate this as 0.5.

   Using Bayes' Rule:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   where
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
   \]

   Substituting the values:
   \[
   P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.2) + (0.5 \cdot 0.8) = 0.06 + 0.4 = 0.46
   \]

   So,
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.46} \approx \frac{0.06}{0.46} \approx 0.130
   \]

2. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): Let's say the prior probability that a random graduate student is in Business Administration is moderate. We can estimate this as 0.1 (10%).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of having Adam's personality sketch if he were in Business Administration might be lower comparative to Computer Science, as Business Administration might not typically attract those with a strong love for nature and animals. Letâ€™s estimate this as 0.1.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): As before, the likelihood of having Adam's personality without being in Business Administration is quite possible. We estimated this as 0.5.

   Substituting the values:
   \[
   P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.1) + (0.5 \cdot 0.9) = 0.01 + 0.45 = 0.46
   \]

   So,
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.46} \approx \frac{0.01}{0.46} \approx 0.022
   \]

Therefore, the final probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": 0.130,
  "business administration": 0.022
}
