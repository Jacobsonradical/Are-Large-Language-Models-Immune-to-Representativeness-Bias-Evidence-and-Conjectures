To determine \( P(H|E) \) through Bayes' rule, we use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch.

However, \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field need to be estimated or assumed based on given information, general knowledge, and intuition. Since we are estimating, the values may not be precise but should reflect logical reasoning.

Let's make the following reasonable assumptions:

**For Computer Science:**
- \( P(H) \): Let's assume a moderate base rate of students in computer science.
- \( P(E|H) \): Adam's interest in puzzles and abstract concepts aligns well with computer science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Reflects the likelihood of Adam having such a personality sketch but being in another field.

**For Business Administration:**
- \( P(H) \): Let's assume a moderate base rate of students in business administration.
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's empathy, love for animals, and quiet nature, this field might be less aligned but not impossible.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Reflects the likelihood of Adam having such a personality sketch but being in another field.

### Estimation Values:

**Computer Science:**
- \( P(H) = 0.2 \): Prior probability for computer science.
- \( P(E|H) = 0.5 \): Adam's traits fit well with computer science (ability to understand abstract concepts and love for solving puzzles).
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \): There could be other fields fitting this sketch too.

**Business Administration:**
- \( P(H) = 0.2 \): Prior probability for business administration.
- \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \): Less alignment with his personality traits.
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.35 \): Other fields likely fit better with the given sketch.

Now to compute \( P(H|E) \):

1. **Computer Science:**

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

2. **Business Administration:**

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

We can compute \( P(E) \) as the sum of the probabilities considering both hypotheses and their complements:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{CS}})P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}})(1 - P(H_{\text{CS}})) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.5 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.1 + 0.24 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.34 \]

Similarly, using just Business Administration for the computation does not alter \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{BA}})P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}})(1 - P(H_{\text{BA}})) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.2) + (0.35 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.28 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.32 \]

Given that the overlapping in total \( P(E) \) can be an average or best case it shares within estimated total sum,

3. **Combined \( P(E) \):**
\[ P(E)_{\text{Combined}} = \frac{0.34 + 0.32}{2} = 0.33 \]

Finally:

1. **Computer Science:**
\[  P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.33} \approx 0.303 \]

2. **Business Administration:**
\[  P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.33} \approx 0.121 \]
