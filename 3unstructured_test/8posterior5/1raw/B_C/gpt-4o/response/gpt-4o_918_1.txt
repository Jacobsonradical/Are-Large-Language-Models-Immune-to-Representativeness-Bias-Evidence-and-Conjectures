To apply Bayes' rule, we first need to judge the values for P(H) (the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field), P(E|H) (the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in the given field), and P(E|\neg H) (the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in the given field).

### Computer Science

- **P(H) for Computer Science (CS)**: The probability that someone is enrolled in CS could be around 0.1 to 0.2, considering it’s a popular field. Let's assume P(H) = 0.15.
- **P(E|H) for CS**: Given the fact that Adam has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work, intelligence, and puzzle-solving abilities, we can assume P(E|H) is relatively high. Let's say P(E|H) = 0.4.
- **P(E|¬H) for CS**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch if he is not in CS. Given that attributes like high intelligence, solving puzzles, and appreciation for hard work can be found in many fields, let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.1.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where,
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot (1 - P(H)) \]

Let's calculate it step-by-step:

\[ P(E) = (0.4 \times 0.15) + (0.1 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.06 + 0.085 = 0.145 \]

Then:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.15}{0.145} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.145} \approx 0.414 \]

### Business Administration

- **P(H) for Business Administration (BA)**: The probability that someone is enrolled in BA might be around 0.1, as it is also a fairly common field. Let's assume P(H) = 0.1.
- **P(E|H) for BA**: Given the personality sketch and attributes like warm-heartedness, empathy, and strong dedication, these can fit the profile of a business student, but less emphasis on abstract concepts and puzzle-solving. Let's say P(E|H) = 0.2.
- **P(E|¬H) for BA**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is not in BA, considering that the attributes might be common in other fields as well. Let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.1.

Let’s calculate it:

\[ P(E) for BA = (0.2 \times 0.1) + (0.1 \times 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.09 = 0.11 \]

Then:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{0.11} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.11} \approx 0.182 \]

Thus, the updated probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.414,
  "business administration": 0.182
}
