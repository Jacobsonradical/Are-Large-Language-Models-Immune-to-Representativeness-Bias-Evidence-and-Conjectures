We'll start by applying Bayesian reasoning to evaluate the probabilities in question. Bayes' Theorem is represented as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specified field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch.

For simplicity, we assume that \( P(E) \) is constant for both fields.

1. **Computer Science**:
   - **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Computer science is a popular graduate field, but it might be less likely for someone with Adam's profile compared to other more specific fields like biology or environmental science. Let's assume a modest prior probability, e.g., \( P(H = \text{computer science}) = 0.1 \).
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Given the personality sketch, someone with a strong curiosity about nature and plants, along with a love for animals, might not typically be associated with computer science. However, the high intelligence and skill in understanding abstract concepts are supportive. Let's give this a moderate likelihood, e.g., \( P(E|H = \text{computer science}) = 0.3 \).
   - **Complement Likelihood \( P(E| \neg H) \)**: Considering other fields (e.g., biological sciences, environmental studies), the profile seems to fit better elsewhere. So, \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

2. **Business Administration**:
   - **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Business administration is also a popular field, but given the interest in nature and animals, it seems less probable for Adam. To reflect this, let's assign \( P(H = \text{business administration}) = 0.05 \).
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The personality sketch is less aligned with business administration compared to other fields. Therefore, let's give this a lower likelihood, e.g., \( P(E|H = \text{business administration}) = 0.1 \).
   - **Complement Likelihood \( P(E| \neg H) \)**: Same as above, so \( P(E| \neg H) = 0.5 \).

Now, we calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

### Computer Science:

\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} \]
Since \( P(E) \) is constant and equal for both fields, it's the normalization factor. Let's calculate the numerator first:

\[ P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) = 0.3 \times 0.1 = 0.03 \]

### Business Administration:

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} \]
Similarly, the numerator is:

\[ P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) = 0.1 \times 0.05 = 0.005 \]

To simplify, we ignore the constant \( P(E) \) since we need relative scores:

{
  "computer science": "0.03 (normalized value)",
  "business administration": "0.005 (normalized value)"
}

To make it clear for comparison, if you want the probabilities to sum up to 1, normalize:

Total = 0.03 + 0.005 = 0.035

{
  "computer science": "0.03 / 0.035 = 0.857",
  "business administration": "0.005 / 0.035 = 0.143"
}

This yields the final probabilities, normalized:

{
  "computer science": "0.857",
  "business administration": "0.143"
}
