Sure, let's evaluate the probabilities given the personality sketch of Adam.

### Probabilities for Computer Science

1. **P(H) (Prior Probability):**
   - Let's assume the prior probability of a random graduate student being in Computer Science is moderately high, given the prevalence of this field.
   - P(H) ≈ 0.2
   
2. **P(E|H) (Likelihood of Evidence given Hypothesis):**
   - Computer Science students are often characterized by high intelligence and an aptitude for solving puzzles. They might also have curiosity about nature if they are involved in fields like artificial intelligence with a focus on natural phenomena, although this is less common.
   - P(E|H) ≈ 0.3
   
3. **P(E|¬H) (Likelihood of Evidence given Not-Hypothesis):**
   - Given the variety of other fields, many attributes in Adam's profile (high intelligence, empathy, love for animals, understanding of hard work) may be less common in Computer Science.
   - P(E|¬H) ≈ 0.1

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assuming P(E) reflects the general characteristics of graduate students across various fields,

\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]
\[ P(E) ≈ (0.3 \cdot 0.2) + (0.1 \cdot 0.8) = 0.06 + 0.08 = 0.14 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.14} = \frac{0.06}{0.14} ≈ 0.43 \]

### Probabilities for Business Administration

1. **P(H) (Prior Probability):**
   - The field of Business Administration might be less common among graduate students compared to others.
   - P(H) ≈ 0.1
   
2. **P(E|H) (Likelihood of Evidence given Hypothesis):**
   - Business Administration students may value hard work and dedication, have a strong empathy for handling people, and intelligent analytical skills.
   - P(E|H) ≈ 0.25
   
3. **P(E|¬H) (Likelihood of Evidence given Not-Hypothesis):**
   - Considering the diversity of other fields, many attributes in Adam's profile may not align perfectly with Business Administration.
   - P(E|¬H) ≈ 0.2

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assuming P(E) reflects the general characteristics of graduate students across various fields (we maintain the same P(E)):

\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]
\[ P(E) ≈ (0.25 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) = 0.025 + 0.18 = 0.205 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.25 \cdot 0.1}{0.205} = \frac{0.025}{0.205} ≈ 0.12 \]

Hence, the results in the requested format are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.43,
  "business administration": 0.12
}
```
