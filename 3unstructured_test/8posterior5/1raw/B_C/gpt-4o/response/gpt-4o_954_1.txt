To apply Bayes' Rule, we begin with the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) that Adam was enrolled in these fields, the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) that the evidence matches a student in these fields, and the likelihoods \( P(E|\neg H) \) that the evidence matches a student in other fields.

Let's assign some reasonable estimates to the prior probabilities and likelihoods:

### Business Administration
- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Business administration is a common graduate field, but considering Adam's particular interests and characteristics, it seems somewhat less likely. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.10 \).
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood that someone in business administration has Adam's characteristics, such as a curiosity about nature, empathy, and a love for animals, seems low. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.10 \).
- **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The likelihood that someone outside of business administration matches these characteristics seems higher. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.30 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H)} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.10 \times 0.10}{0.10 \times 0.10 + 0.30 \times 0.90} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.27} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.01}{0.28} \approx 0.036 \]

### Computer Science
- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Computer science is a very common and diverse field, and Adam's interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.20 \).
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood that someone in computer science exhibits Adam's characteristics seems higher. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.50 \).
- **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The likelihood that someone outside of computer science matches these characteristics also exists, but it's less than within the field. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.30 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H)} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.50 \times 0.20}{0.50 \times 0.20 + 0.30 \times 0.80} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.10}{0.10 + 0.24} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.10}{0.34} \approx 0.294 \]

Thus, the results are:

{
  "business administration": 0.036,
  "computer science": 0.294
