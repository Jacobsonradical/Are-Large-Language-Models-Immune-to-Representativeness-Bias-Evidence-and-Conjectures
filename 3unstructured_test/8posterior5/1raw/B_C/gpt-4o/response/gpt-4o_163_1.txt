Okay, let's go through the process of assessing the probabilities.

### For Computer Science

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is in computer science. Given he is a graduate student in the U.S., let's assume it's quite a common field, so say 0.2.

- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the evidence if Adam is in computer science. Given his interests in nature, puzzles, abstract concepts, and high intelligence, it's somewhat likely but not strongly correlated, so let's estimate 0.3.

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing this evidence if Adam is not in computer science. Given the broad applicability of his personality traits across various fields, we assume this is also plausible across other fields, so let's say 0.2.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Assuming P(\neg H) = 0.8 (other fields),

\[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.2) + (0.2 \cdot 0.8) = 0.06 + 0.16 = 0.22 \]

Thus,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.22} \approx 0.2727 \]

### For Business Administration

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is in business administration. It's a reasonably common field but perhaps less so than computer science, so let's say 0.15.

- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the evidence if Adam is in business administration. This seems less correlated with his interests, so perhaps 0.1.

- **P(E|\neg H)**: As above, the probability of observing the evidence if Adam is not in business administration might be the same as for other fields, so 0.2.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Assuming P(\neg H) = 0.85 (other fields),

\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) = 0.015 + 0.17 = 0.185 \]

Thus,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{0.185} \approx 0.0811 \]

Here is the result:

{
  "computer science": 0.2727,
  "business administration": 0.0811
}
