To determine the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the fields of computer science and business administration using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the prior probability \( P(H) \) for each field, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the marginal likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \). Here, \( H \) is the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in a specific field, \( E \) is the evidence of Adam's personality sketch, and \( \neg H \) represents all other fields apart from the specified one. Finally, we apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) in the denominator is a normalization factor that is the same for both hypotheses, we can simplify the problem by comparing the numerator terms directly:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

However, because precise data is unavailable, the values we can provide are informed estimates based on the description of Adam and typical characteristics of these fields. 

### Hypotheses:

- **Computer Science (\(CS\))**: \(H_{CS}\)
- **Business Administration (\(BA\))**: \(H_{BA}\)

### Estimations:

1. **Prior Probability (\(P(H)\))**:
   - While exact statistics aren't available, we can assume that, on average, computer science and business administration each have a moderate but not the highest proportion of graduate students.

2. **Likelihood (\(P(E|H)\))**:
   - For **Computer Science**: The characteristics such as high intelligence and affinity for solving puzzles suggest a good fit, so we estimate \( P(E|CS) \) to be high.
   - For **Business Administration**: Traits like a warm heart and strong empathy are beneficial for business roles involving management and human resources, but the emphasis on problem-solving and nature may not directly align; thus, we estimate \( P(E|BA) \) to be lower.

3. **Marginal Likelihood (\(P(E|\neg H)\))** (Account for all other fields):
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\) would generally be a normalization across all attributes matching various fields, but since we focus on relative values, we do not need to calculate this directly.

### Calculations:

Given the qualitative nature of our assessment, letâ€™s provide a comparative probability:

- For **Computer Science**: \(P(H_{CS}) \approx 0.4\)
  - \(P(E|H_{CS})\) is high because of intelligence, problem-solving, and abstract thinking skills.
  - Assume \(P(E|CS) = 0.7\).

- For **Business Administration**: \(P(H_{BA}) \approx 0.3\)
  - \(P(E|H_{BA})\) is lower due to the emphasis on other qualities.
  - Assume \(P(E|BA) = 0.4\).

Combining these assumptions using Bayes' rule proportionally:

### Comparative Bayesian Update:
\[
P(H_{CS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) = 0.7 \times 0.4 = 0.28
\]
\[
P(H_{BA}|E) \propto P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) = 0.4 \times 0.3 = 0.12
\]

Normalizing (optional step for clearer comparison):

Sum = 0.28 + 0.12 = 0.40

Normalized probabilities:
\[
P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.28}{0.40} = 0.70
\]
\[
P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.40} = 0.30
\]

### Final Answer:
Thus, based on the given estimates:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```
