Let's start by analyzing the information given:

1. Adam has a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals.
2. He enjoys solving puzzles and has a high intelligence level relevant to abstract concepts.
3. He has a warm heart, strong empathy, and appreciates hard work and dedication.
4. In 2021, he was a graduate student in the U.S.

Let's consider these features in the context of two graduate fields:
- Business Administration
- Computer Science

### Business Administration
- P(H): Generally, there are many business administration students, but the personality traits given seem less aligned with business administration. Let's assume P(H) = 0.2 (20% chance Adam could be in this field).
- P(E|H): The personality sketch fits this field only moderately. Business administration typically values strategic thinking, leadership abilities, and a keen interest in business dynamics. Some empathy and appreciation for hard work are relevant but not necessarily the primary traits for the field. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.4.
- P(E|¬H): Given the specific interests in nature, empathy, and abstract thinking, there are likely several other fields beyond business administration that could be a better match. Let’s assume P(E|¬H) = 0.6.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{(P(E|H) \cdot P(H)) + (P(E| \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H))} \]

Substituting in the values:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{(0.4 \cdot 0.2) + (0.6 \cdot 0.8)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.48} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.56} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.143 \]

### Computer Science
- P(H): Computer science is also a popular field, but Adam’s interest in puzzles and abstract thinking fits well. Let's assume P(H) = 0.3 (30% chance Adam could be in this field).
- P(E|H): The personality sketch fits well with computer science due to the traits of solving puzzles, understanding abstract concepts, and intelligence. Empathy and nature love might be less directly related but not counter-indicative. Let’s assume P(E|H) = 0.7.
- P(E|¬H): Again, there are other fields beyond computer science that could fit Adam's personality traits. Let’s assume P(E|¬H) = 0.6.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{(P(E|H) \cdot P(H)) + (P(E| \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H))} \]

Substituting in the values:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.3}{(0.7 \cdot 0.3) + (0.6 \cdot 0.7)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.21}{0.21 + 0.42} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.21}{0.63} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.333 \]

So, the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field based on the given personality sketch are approximately:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.143,
  "computer science": 0.333
}
```
