To calculate the probabilities, let's break down the components:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being in a certain field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is in this field.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is not in this field.

We will use Bayes' Rule to compute \(P(H|E)\), which is the posterior probability of Adam being in a certain field given his personality sketch (E):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \(P(E)\) is the same for both fields and doesn't change the rank or ratio, we can omit it for comparison purposes. Instead, we will compare the numerators \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

### Computer Science

- **P(H)**: The general prior probability of a graduate student being in computer science. Let's assign it a reasonable value for comparison, e.g., 0.2.
- **P(E|H)**: Given that Adam has a strong understanding of abstract concepts, high intelligence, and a liking for puzzles, it seems likely that he might be in computer science. Let's estimate this as 0.7.
- **P(E|¬H)**: For not being in computer science but still having such traits, we might estimate it lower, say 0.4.

### Business Administration

- **P(H)**: The general prior probability of a graduate student being in business administration. Let's assign it another value, say 0.15.
- **P(E|H)**: The traits described (curiosity about nature, strong empathy, deep love for animals) seem less directly aligned with business administration. This might be estimated lower, say 0.2.
- **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of having these traits if not in business administration might be similar to the overall, let's estimate it as 0.5.

Now, applying Bayes' rule and comparing numerators:

1. **Computer Science**: 
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.7 \cdot 0.2 = 0.14 \]

2. **Business Administration**: 
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \cdot 0.15 = 0.03 \]

Putting these into the requested format:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.14,
  "business administration": 0.03
}
```

These values are normalized to show the relative likelihoods but are consistent with the estimates given above.
