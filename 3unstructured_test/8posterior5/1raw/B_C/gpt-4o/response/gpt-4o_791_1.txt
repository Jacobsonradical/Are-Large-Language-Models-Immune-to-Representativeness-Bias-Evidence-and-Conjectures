To calculate the probabilities, let's first make some reasonable assumptions about \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) \) (Prior probability of Adam being in Computer Science): Let's assume this to be relatively high, as computer science is a very common field. Let's set this at 0.2.
   - \( P(E|H) \) (Probability of Adam having this personality sketch given he is in Computer Science): Given Adam's traits, some of them like high intelligence and puzzle-solving skills align well with this field, but curiosity about nature and love for animals are less typical for Computer Science students. Let's estimate this at 0.4.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \) (Probability of Adam having this personality sketch given he is not in Computer Science): Since Adam's traits do not strongly point to Computer Science specifically, let's estimate this at 0.1.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \) (Prior probability of Adam being in Business Administration): This is another common graduate field, so letâ€™s also set this at 0.2.
   - \( P(E|H) \) (Probability of Adam having this personality sketch given he is in Business Administration): His traits like empathy and understanding of hard work might fit well here, but the love for nature and animals is less typical. Let's estimate this at 0.3.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \) (Probability of Adam having this personality sketch given he is not in Business Administration): These traits might not specifically indicate Business Administration, so let's estimate this at 0.1.

Using Bayes' rule, \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \), where \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \).

Calculations:

### Computer Science:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.1 \cdot 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.08 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.16 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.16} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.16} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.5 \]

### Business Administration:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.1 \cdot 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.06 + 0.08 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.14 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.14} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.14} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.4286 \]

So, the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field are:

{
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.4286
}
