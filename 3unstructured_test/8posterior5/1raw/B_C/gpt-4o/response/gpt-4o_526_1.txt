Sure, let's analyze the given fields with respect to Adam's personality sketch.

### Bayes' Rule
Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to determine \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field in question, and finally compute \( P(H|E) \).

### Assumptions and Analysis
- **P(H)**: The general probability of someone being in a particular field.
- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality in this field.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality not being in this field.

#### Business Administration
1. **P(H)** for business administration: Since graduate programs can be quite varied, let's consider the base rate probability generally lower, e.g., around 0.1 (10%).
2. **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's traits (love for nature, animals, empathy, high intelligence), these traits are not typically associated with business administration, making this value lower, e.g., around 0.2.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality in fields not related to business administration would be higher, say around 0.8.

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \cdot 0.1 = 0.02 \]

#### Computer Science
1. **P(H)** for computer science: Computer Science is quite a popular field among graduate students, so let's assume a higher base rate, e.g., around 0.2 (20%).
2. **P(E|H)**: Adam's high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts fit well with computer science. Let's assign a higher value, e.g., around 0.6.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits in fields not related to computer science would be lower relative to business administration, say around 0.4.

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.6 \cdot 0.2 = 0.12 \]

### Applying Normalization
Since we're only considering two fields here, we normalize the probabilities as follows:

\[ 
P(H_1|E) \] for business administration \( = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.12} = \frac{0.02}{0.14} \approx 0.143
\]

\[ 
P(H_2|E) \] for computer science \( = \frac{0.12}{0.02 + 0.12} = \frac{0.12}{0.14} \approx 0.857
\]

### Conclusion
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.143,
  "computer science": 0.857
}
