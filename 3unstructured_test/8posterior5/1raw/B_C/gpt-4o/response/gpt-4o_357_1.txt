Sure, let's start by assessing the probabilities and then use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \). 

### Definitions and Initial Probabilities

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in a particular field.
- \( P(E | H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is in that field.
- \( P(E | \neg H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is not in that field.

### Field: Computer Science
1. **Prior Probability P(H):**
   Let's assume that the prior probability \( P(H) \) of Adam being in computer science is moderate given its popularity among graduate students. We can take \( P(H) \) = 0.2 as an initial guess.
   
2. **Probability of Personality Sketch Given the Hypothesis \( P(E | H):**
   Adam's qualities like high intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles align well with the typical profile of a computer science student. Therefore, let's take \( P(E | H) \) = 0.6.

3. **Probability of Personality Sketch Given the Negation \( P(E | \neg H):**
   Considering other fields, Adam's qualities might still fit but perhaps not as strongly. Let's say \( P(E | \neg H) \) = 0.4.

### Field: Business Administration
1. **Prior Probability P(H):**
   Let's assume that the prior probability \( P(H) \) of Adam being in business administration is relatively lower compared to computer science due to his interests and qualities. We can take \( P(H) \) = 0.1.
   
2. **Probability of Personality Sketch Given the Hypothesis \( P(E | H):**
   Some aspects like strong empathy and appreciation for hard work might align, but others like solving puzzles and deep love for nature might not fit as well. Let's take \( P(E | H) \) = 0.3.

3. **Probability of Personality Sketch Given the Negation \( P(E | \neg H):**
   Considering other fields, Adam's qualities might fit better elsewhere. Let's say \( P(E | \neg H) \) = 0.5.

### Applying Bayes' Rule

We use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For Computer Science:

\[ P(E)_{\text{CS}} = (0.6 \cdot 0.2) + (0.4 \cdot 0.8) = 0.12 + 0.32 = 0.44 \]

\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{0.44} \approx 0.273 \]

For Business Administration:

\[ P(E)_{\text{BA}} = (0.3 \cdot 0.1) + (0.5 \cdot 0.9) = 0.03 + 0.45 = 0.48 \]

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.48} \approx 0.0625 \]

### Final Answer

{
  "computer science": "0.273",
  "business administration": "0.0625"
}
