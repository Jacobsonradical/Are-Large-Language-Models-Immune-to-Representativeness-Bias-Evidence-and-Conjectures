Let's break down each step for both fields using Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given we need to evaluate for two fields: computer science and business administration.

### Computer Science
1. **P(H) - Prior Probability:**
   - Assuming all fields of graduate study are equally likely, let’s denote the probability as \(P(H_{CS}) = 0.1\) for simplicity.
   
2. **P(E|H) - Likelihood:**
   - Computer science students can also be curious, intelligent, and good at abstract concepts, but strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work might be less directly correlated. Let's assume \(P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.4\).
   
3. **P(E|¬H) - Normalizing Constant:**
   - Represent the likelihood that someone not in computer science matches the profile. Given that Adam’s profile matches more with softer fields involving empathy and animals, we can assign \(P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.2\).

Now applying Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]

Assuming \(P(E)\) normalizes the total probability to 1 for simplification:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \cdot P(\neg H_{CS}) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.4 \times 0.1) + (0.2 \times 0.9) = 0.04 + 0.18 = 0.22 \]

Thus,

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.1}{0.22} \approx 0.1818 \]

### Business Administration
1. **P(H) - Prior Probability:**
   - As before, we assume an equal likelihood \(P(H_{BA}) = 0.1\).
   
2. **P(E|H) - Likelihood:**
   - Business administration students may have an appreciation for hard work and dedication, but empathy, love for animals, and curiosity might be less common traits. Let’s assume \(P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.2\).
   
3. **P(E|¬H) - Normalizing Constant:**
   - We can keep \(P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.25\).

Now applying Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]

Assuming \(P(E)\) normalizes the total probability to 1 for simplification:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \cdot P(\neg H_{BA}) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.2 \times 0.1) + (0.25 \times 0.9) = 0.02 + 0.225 = 0.245 \]

Thus,

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{0.245} \approx 0.0816 \]

### Results
Combining these results, we get the following:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.1818,
  "business administration": 0.0816
}
```

These probabilities reflect the relative likelihood of Adam being enrolled in each field based on his personality sketch, though it's important to remember other graduate fields may also be more well-suited to his attributes.
