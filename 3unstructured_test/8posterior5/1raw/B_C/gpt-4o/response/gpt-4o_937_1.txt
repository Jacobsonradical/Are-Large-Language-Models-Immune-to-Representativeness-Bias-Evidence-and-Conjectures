To solve this problem using Bayes' Rule, we need to compute the probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field of study given the personality sketch \(E\).

The formula for Bayes' Rule is:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll calculate for two fields: computer science \(H_{CS}\) and business administration \(H_{BA}\).

Let's start with the following assumptions:
- \( P(H_{CS}) \): Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Computer Science. This can be roughly assumed to be a common field for a high-intelligent person interested in abstract concepts. Let's say 25% or 0.25.
- \( P(H_{BA}) \): Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration. This is less likely given his interests but still possible. Let's say 10% or 0.10.

### Probabilities for Computer Science (\(H_{CS}\)):
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Probability of E given H_{CS}. Given the problem-solving nature and high intelligence, this is likely. Letâ€™s assume 0.6.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \): Probability of E given not Computer Science. Considering other similar fields (like biology, physics, etc.), let's assume this is 0.2.

### Probabilities for Business Administration (\(H_{BA}\)):
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): Probability of E given H_{BA}. Less likely as traits like love for animals might not align perfectly. Assume 0.3.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \): This should be higher considering other fields more aligned with his traits. Assume 0.4.

We'll compute \( P(E) \) as a normalization constant:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{CS})*P(H_{CS}) + P(E|H_{BA})*P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{CS \cup H_{BA}})*P(\neg H_{CS \cup H_{BA}}) \]
For simplicity, we will assume P(\neg H) is 1 normalized.

### Normalization:
Let's simplify the computation by assuming P(E) is dominated by \(P(E|H)\):

### For Computer Science (\(H_{CS}\)):
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) * P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.6 * 0.25}{?} \]

### For Business Administration (\(H_{BA}\)):
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) * P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.3 * 0.10}{?} \]

However, P(E) can be ignored as we normalize the result later.

### Calculated values:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = 0.6 * 0.25 \] 
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = 0.3 * 0.10 \]

### Normalize:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = 0.6 * 0.25 = 0.15 \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = 0.3 * 0.10 = 0.03 \]

So the results are:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.83, // As 0.15/(0.18)
  "business administration": 0.17, // As 0.03/0.18
}
```
