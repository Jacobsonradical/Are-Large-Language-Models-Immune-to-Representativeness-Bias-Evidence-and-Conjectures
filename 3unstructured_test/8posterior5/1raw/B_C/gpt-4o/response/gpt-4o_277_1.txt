To solve this problem using Bayes' theorem, we first need to define our terms clearly:

- \( H_{CS} \): Hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( H_{BA} \): Hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( E \): Personality sketch of Adam.

We need to estimate the following:
- \( P(H_{CS}) \): Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(H_{BA}) \): Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E | H_{CS}) \): Probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E | H_{BA}) \): Probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E | \neg H_{CS}) \): Probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E | \neg H_{BA}) \): Probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in business administration.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H_{CS} | E) = \frac{P(E | H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{BA} | E) = \frac{P(E | H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]

To simplify the calculation, we will assume reasonable values for these probabilities based on the information given in the personality sketch and the typical attributes of students in these fields.

Let's assume the following prior probabilities:

- \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.2 \): Since computer science is a common graduate field.
- \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.15 \): Since business administration is also a common graduate field.

Considering the personality sketch, Adam's curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and strong appreciation for hard work are traits that might be less common in typical computer science or business administration students but could still be present.

Probabilities given the fields:
- \( P(E | H_{CS}) = 0.1 \): Traits like empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature are somewhat less typical in computer science.
- \( P(E | H_{BA}) = 0.05 \): Traits like empathy and a love for animals may be less common in business administration.

We'll assume the complementary probabilities are generic across fields:
- \( P(E | \neg H_{CS}) \approx 0.05 \): Typical across other fields.
- \( P(E | \neg H_{BA}) \approx 0.07 \): Typical across other fields.

Finally, calculating the normalizing constant \( P(E) \) is challenging without detailed information, we assume a generic value for simplicity but should be coherent comparatively.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

\[
P(H_{CS} | E) = \frac{P(E | H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)}
\]
\[
P(H_{BA} | E) = \frac{P(E | H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)}
\]

For simplicity, assume \( P(E) \) as proportions relatively insignificant across.
We compute simplifying:

\[
P(H_{CS} | E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{C}
\]
\[
P(H_{BA} | E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.15}{C}
\]

Here C cancels out.

Calculations address proportionally:
