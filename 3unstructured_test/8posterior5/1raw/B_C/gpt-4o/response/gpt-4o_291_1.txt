In order to compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to apply the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we do not know \( P(E) \) directly, we can compare the posterior probabilities of the two hypotheses relative to each other. The absolute values may not be possible, but the relative values can provide meaningful insights.

Let's make some educated guesses about the probabilities based on the information given about Adam.

1. **Probability of being in computer science or business administration (P(H))**:
   - These are two common graduate fields, but considering Adam's traits, we need to think about how likely he would choose each.

2. **Probability of E given H (P(E|H))**:
   - Computer Science: Adam’s intelligence and abstract thinking ability fit well, but his empathy, love for animals, and appreciation of hard work are less relevant.
   - Business Administration: While intelligence and appreciation for hard work fit well, empathy and love for animals are less relevant in this field.

3. **Probability of E given not H (P(E|¬H))**:
   - We'll assume this covers other possibly relevant fields more aligned with his interests, such as fields involving nature, animals, or social sciences where empathy would be valued (e.g., Environmental Science, Biology, Psychology).

4. **Overall likelihood of E (P(E))**:
   - This includes all possible fields and is not directly required for the relative comparison between the two hypotheses.

Let's make some educated numerical estimates:

### Computer Science:
- \( P(H) \): 0.25 (Moderate probability he's in this common field but less likely given his love of nature and empathy)
- \( P(E|H) \): 0.20 (Abstract thinking fits, but his empathy and love for animals don't match well)
- \( P(E|¬H) \): 0.30 (Higher in other fields more aligned with his traits)

Using these:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.20 \cdot 0.25 = 0.05 \]

### Business Administration:
- \( P(H) \): 0.10 (Less probable given his personality sketch)
- \( P(E|H) \): 0.10 (Intelligence and appreciation for hard work fit, but empathy and love for animals don't)
- \( P(E|¬H) \): 0.40 (Much higher probability aligned with other fields)

Using these:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.10 \cdot 0.10 = 0.01 \]

### Relative Probabilities:
Let's normalize these to have them add up to 1:
- Sum: \( 0.05 + 0.01 = 0.06 \)

\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.05}{0.06} \approx 0.83 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.01}{0.06} \approx 0.17 \]

Even though our absolute scale wasn't perfect, we have a relative comparison:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.83,
  "business administration": 0.17
}
