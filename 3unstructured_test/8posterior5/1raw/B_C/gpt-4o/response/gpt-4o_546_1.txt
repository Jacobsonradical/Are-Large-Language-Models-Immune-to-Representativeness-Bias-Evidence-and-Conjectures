To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to apply the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For both fields mentioned, "computer science" and "business administration," we'll need to estimate the following:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in the field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in the field.
4. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing the personality sketch (this can be derived from \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \)).

For simplicity, we will assume a uniform prior \( P(H) \) for all fields since no specific information is provided about Adam's likelihood of choosing a particular field.

### Computer Science:

1. **P(H_computer_science)**: Assume a reasonable prior probability that Adam might be enrolled in computer science, which is fairly high given the popularity of the field.
   \[ P(H_{\text{computer_science}}) = 0.2 \]

2. **P(E|H_computer_science)**: Considering his traits (curiosity about nature, love for solving puzzles, high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts):
   \[ P(E|H_{\text{computer_science}}) = 0.6 \]

3. **P(E|\neg H_computer_science)**: The probability of the personality characteristics given that he is not studying computer science. Given that these traits are somewhat common across many fields:
   \[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{computer_science}}) = 0.4 \]

### Business Administration:

1. **P(H_business_administration)**: Assume a lower prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration, considering his interest and empathy towards nature and animals.
   \[ P(H_{\text{business_administration}}) = 0.05 \]

2. **P(E|H_business_administration)**: Likelihood considering his specific traits are somewhat less aligned with typical business administration students:
   \[ P(E|H_{\text{business_administration}}) = 0.2 \]

3. **P(E|\neg H_business_administration)**: Similar to the above, would be the likelihood of the personality sketch given he is not in business administration:
   \[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{business_administration}}) = 0.5 \]

To calculate \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{computer_science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer_science}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{computer_science}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{computer_science}}) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.6 \cdot 0.2) + (0.4 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.32 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.44 \]

Similarly for business administration:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{business_administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business_administration}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{business_administration}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{business_administration}}) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.05) + (0.5 \cdot 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.01 + 0.475 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.485 \]

Now, we apply Bayes' rule to find \( P(H|E) \):

### Computer Science:

\[ P(H_{\text{computer_science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{computer_science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer_science}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{computer_science}}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{0.44} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{computer_science}}|E) \approx 0.273 \]

### Business Administration:

\[ P(H_{\text{business_administration}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business_administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business_administration}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business_administration}}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.05}{0.485} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business_administration}}|E) \approx 0.021 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities would be:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.273,
  "business administration": 0.021
}
```
