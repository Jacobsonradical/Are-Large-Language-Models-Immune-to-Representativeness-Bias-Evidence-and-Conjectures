To apply Bayes' rule to determine \( P(H|E) \) for the fields of business administration and computer science, we need to estimate the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood of the evidence given not-H, \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field.

### Field 1: Business Administration

#### Estimations:
- **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Without knowing more, we might estimate this is low given his characteristics that align more with research-driven fields.
    - Let's assume \( P(\text{H}_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1 \)
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he's in business administration. Adam's characteristics don't particularly align with typical business administration traits.
    - Let's assume \( P(E|H)_{\text{BA}} = 0.2 \)
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in business administration. This could be more reflective of his actual interests and traits.
    - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H)_{\text{BA}} = 0.7 \)

#### Calculation:
Using Bayes' rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
\]
\[
P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{(0.2 \times 0.1) + (0.7 \times 0.9)} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.63} = \frac{0.02}{0.65} \approx 0.031
\]

### Field 2: Computer Science

#### Estimations:
- **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Given his interests and traits, this seems more plausible.
    - Let's assume \( P(\text{H}_{\text{CS}}) = 0.4 \)
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he's in computer science. Adam's traits align well with those of someone in this field.
    - Let's assume \( P(E|H)_{\text{CS}} = 0.8 \)
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he's not in computer science. This would cover a broad range of other fields.
    - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H)_{\text{CS}} = 0.6 \)

#### Calculation:
Using Bayes' rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
\]
\[
P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.4}{(0.8 \times 0.4) + (0.6 \times 0.6)} = \frac{0.32}{0.32 + 0.36} = \frac{0.32}{0.68} \approx 0.471
\]

### Summary of calculations

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.031,
  "computer science": 0.471
}
```
These values suggest that, given Adam's personality sketch, he is significantly more likely to be enrolled in computer science than in business administration.
