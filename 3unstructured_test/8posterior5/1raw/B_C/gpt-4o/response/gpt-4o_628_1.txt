To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study given the personality sketch of Adam, we need to use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in the field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is in the field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in the field.

Since we do not have precise numerical values, we will estimate these probabilities based on reasonable assumptions and reasoning.

### For Computer Science:

1. **Prior \( P(H) \):**
   - Computer Science is a popular field of study, but not all graduate students are enrolled in it.
   - Let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \) (20% of graduate students are in Computer Science).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   - Computer Science students might have an interest in puzzles and abstract thinking, and some may appreciate hard work and dedication. However, the love for nature, plants, and animals might be less common.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   - Considering all other fields, some may align well with Adam's characteristics (e.g., biology, environmental science), while others may not.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.15 \).

### For Business Administration:

1. **Prior \( P(H) \):**
   - Business Administration is also a common field, but let's assume it's slightly less common than Computer Science among the set of graduate students we are considering.
   - Let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.15 \) (15% of graduate students are in Business Administration).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   - Business Administration students might appreciate hard work and dedication, but the love for nature, plants, and solving puzzles might be less common.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   - Considering all other fields, some may align well with Adam's characteristics (e.g., biology, environmental science), while others may not.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.15 \).

### Applying Bayes' Rule:

We need to calculate \( P(H|E) \). Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \), and given \(\neg H\) encompasses all other fields, we calculate it for one example:

#### Computer Science:
\[ 
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) 
\]
\[ 
P(E) \approx (0.3 \cdot 0.2) + (0.15 \cdot 0.8) \approx 0.06 + 0.12 = 0.18
\]

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.18} \approx 0.33 
\]

#### Business Administration:
\[ 
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) 
\]
\[ 
P(E) \approx (0.2 \cdot 0.15) + (0.15 \cdot 0.85) \approx 0.03 + 0.1275 = 0.1575 
\]

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{0.1575} \approx 0.19 
\]

Therefore, the final probabilities for Adam's likelihood of being enrolled in each field are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.33,
  "business administration": 0.19
}
```
