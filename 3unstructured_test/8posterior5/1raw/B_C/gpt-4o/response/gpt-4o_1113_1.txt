To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in either computer science or business administration given his personality sketch \( E \), we need to consider the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \) — the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the program.
2. \( P(E|H) \) — the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in the program.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) — the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in the program.

We can use Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior probability:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Note: Since \( P(E) \) is a normalization constant and our interest lies in the ratio of \( P(H|E) \) for the two fields in comparison, we can simplify the calculations and focus on the numerators for relative probabilities.

### Judgment on Probabilities

#### Computer Science
- **Prior Probability \( P(\text{CS}) \)**
  - There is a non-specific prior that Adam could be a computer science graduate student: Let’s estimate \( P(\text{CS}) = 0.2 \).

- **Likelihood \( P(E|\text{CS}) \)**
  - Curiosity, high intelligence, puzzle solving, understanding abstract concepts, and empathy could align with characteristics of some computer science students, especially those in fields like AI or computational biology: \( P(E|\text{CS}) = 0.7 \).

- **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg \text{CS}) \)**
  - Considering all other fields, the probability of Adam having his personality traits can be similar or lower across the board. Let's estimate: \( P(E|\neg \text{CS}) = 0.3 \).

#### Business Administration
- **Prior Probability \( P(\text{BA}) \)**
  - There is also a reasonable chance Adam could have pursued business administration: Let’s estimate \( P(\text{BA}) = 0.15 \).

- **Likelihood \( P(E|\text{BA}) \)**
  - Some qualities align such as empathy and appreciation for hard work, but the focus on nature, puzzles, and abstract concepts might be less common in business administration: \( P(E|\text{BA}) = 0.4 \).

- **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg \text{BA}) \)**
  - Considering all other fields, the likelihood should be higher since his personality traits (like love of nature and puzzles) fit better outside business administration. Let's estimate: \( P(E|\neg \text{BA}) = 0.6 \).

### Calculations using Bayes' Rule

1. **Computer Science**
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) \propto P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) \propto 0.7 \cdot 0.2 = 0.14 \]

2. **Business Administration**
\[ P(\text{BA}|E) \propto P(E|\text{BA}) \cdot P(\text{BA}) \]
\[ P(\text{BA}|E) \propto 0.4 \cdot 0.15 = 0.06 \]

### Normalized values (optional, for better scale understanding but not part of initial request)
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.14}{0.14 + 0.06} = \frac{0.14}{0.20} = 0.7 \]
\[ P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.14 + 0.06} = \frac{0.06}{0.20} = 0.3 \]

So, we focus on comparative values:

{
  "computer science": 0.14,
  "business administration": 0.06
}
