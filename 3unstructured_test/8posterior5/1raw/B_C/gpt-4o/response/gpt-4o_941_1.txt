To compute the probabilities \( P(H | E) \) through Bayes' rule, we need to determine \( P(H) \), \( P(E | H) \), and \( P(E | \neg H) \). The general formula for Bayes' rule is:

\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E | H) \) is the probability that the evidence is observed given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E | \neg H) \) is the probability that the evidence is observed given the negation of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence, which can be computed as:
  \[ P(E) = P(E | H) \cdot P(H) + P(E | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's evaluate each field separately:

1. **Business Administration**

### **Business Administration**

- \( P(H_{BA}) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration. Let’s assume a value of 0.15, as business administration is a fairly common field but not the most common among graduate students.
- \( P(E | H_{BA}) \): The likelihood of observing the given personality traits if Adam is enrolled in business administration. These traits do not typically align strongly with business administration, so this probability might be relatively low. Let's assume a value of 0.05.
- \( P(E | \neg H_{BA}) \): The likelihood of observing the given personality traits if Adam is not enrolled in business administration. Since these characteristics seem more aligned with other fields (like biology, environmental science), this might be higher. Let's assume a value of 0.20.

Now, apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H_{BA} | E) = \frac{P(E | H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]

First, compute \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E | H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E | \neg H_{BA}) \cdot P(\neg H_{BA}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.05 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.0075 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.1775 \]

Now, compute \( P(H_{BA} | E) \):

\[ P(H_{BA} | E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.15}{0.1775} \]
\[ P(H_{BA} | E) \approx 0.0423 \]

2. **Computer Science**

### **Computer Science**

- \( P(H_{CS}) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science. Let's assume a value of 0.25, as computer science is a highly common field among graduate students.
- \( P(E | H_{CS}) \): The likelihood of observing the given personality traits if Adam is enrolled in computer science. Some traits such as high intelligence and puzzle-solving align with computer science, so let’s assume a value of 0.30.
- \( P(E | \neg H_{CS}) \): The likelihood of observing the given personality traits if Adam is not enrolled in computer science. This might be slightly lower, let's assume a value of 0.20.

Now, apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H_{CS} | E) = \frac{P(E | H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]

First, compute \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E | H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E | \neg H_{CS}) \cdot P(\neg H_{CS}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.30 \cdot 0.25 + 0.20 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.075 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.225 \]

Now, compute \( P(H_{CS} | E) \):

\[ P(H_{CS} | E) = \frac{0.30 \cdot 0.25}{0.225} \]
\[ P(H_{CS} | E) \approx 0.333 \]

So the results are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0423,
  "computer science": 0.333
}
```

These probabilities suggest that Adam is more likely to be enrolled in computer science than business administration based on the given personality traits.
