To infer the probability of Adam's field of study given his personality sketch, we'll use Bayes' Theorem, which is formulated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here's how we can approach it:

### Business Administration

- **P(H) - Prior Probability**

The prior probability term \(P(H)\) represents the probability that Adam would be in the business administration program without any additional information. We can denote this probability based on general enrollment numbers in various graduate programs, but let’s assume it's reasonably distributed.

- **P(E|H) - Likelihood**

This represents the probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he is indeed a student of business administration. Given Adam's personality sketch about nature, puzzles, empathy, and animals, it seems less likely for him to be in a program like business administration which is often associated more with quantitative skills and perhaps less so with nature and empathy.

- **P(E|¬H) - Complementary Likelihood**

This represents the probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he is not enrolled in business administration.

Assume:

\[ P(H) = 0.20 \] (base rate that someone might be in business administration)
\[ P(E|H) = 0.10 \] (less likely given his interest in nature and empathy)
\[ P(E|¬H) = 0.30 \] (reflecting that it's more likely to find someone with his traits in other disciplines)

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.10 \cdot 0.20) + (0.30 \cdot 0.80) = 0.02 + 0.24 = 0.26 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.10 \cdot 0.20}{0.26} \approx 0.08 \]

### Computer Science

- **P(H) - Prior Probability**

The probability that someone would be enrolled in computer science. Typically, computer science is a popular graduate program.

- **P(E|H) - Likelihood**

Adam’s traits of enjoying puzzles, understanding abstract concepts, and intelligence are conducive to computer science.

- **P(E|¬H) - Complementary Likelihood**

This represents the probability of Adam having these traits if he is not enrolled in computer science.

Assume:

\[ P(H) = 0.25 \] (base rate that someone might be in computer science)
\[ P(E|H) = 0.60 \] (likelier given his enjoyment of puzzles and abstract thinking)
\[ P(E|¬H) = 0.20 \] (less representative in other programs)

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = (0.60 \cdot 0.25) + (0.20 \cdot 0.75) = 0.15 + 0.15 = 0.30 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.60 \cdot 0.25}{0.30} = 0.50 \]

### Summary

Using the computed probabilities:

\[
{
  "business administration": 0.08,
  "computer science": 0.50
}
\]

This suggests that given Adam's personality sketch, it is much more likely that he is enrolled in computer science than in business administration.
