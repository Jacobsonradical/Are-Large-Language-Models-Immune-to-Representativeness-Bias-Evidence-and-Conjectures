To determine the probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in "business administration" or "computer science," we need to consider:

1. \(P(H)\): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
2. \(P(E|H)\): The probability of E given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of E given that Adam is not enrolled in that field.

We will use Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, let's use reasonable estimates for these probabilities. Since these are subjective probabilities, the exact values can vary; we'll use informed guesses based on typical characteristics and distributions of students in various fields.

### Business Administration
- **\(P(H)\)**: Business Administration is a common field, but not particularly known for strong focus on nature, puzzles, or high empathy.
  - **Estimate**: 0.15
- **\(P(E|H)\)**: The traits described (curiosity about nature, love for animals, high intelligence in abstract concepts) are not strongly associated with Business Administration.
  - **Estimate**: 0.05
- **\(P(E|\neg H)\)**: The probability of these traits given NOT Business Administration could be moderately higher, given there are many other fields (especially in science) where these traits are more typical.
  - **Estimate**: 0.10

### Computer Science
- **\(P(H)\)**: Computer Science is a highly popular field and is known for attracting individuals who enjoy solving puzzles and have high intelligence in abstract concepts.
  - **Estimate**: 0.25
- **\(P(E|H)\)**: The traits described, especially enjoyment of puzzles and high intelligence in abstract concepts, align well with Computer Science.
  - **Estimate**: 0.30
- **\(P(E|\neg H)\)**: For not Computer Science, the probability of these traits could vary but might be lower than within Computer Science.
  - **Estimate**: 0.05

Now, we use Bayes' rule to compute \(P(H|E)\):

### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]

Assuming \( P(E) \) can be approximated by the weighted sum where none of the fields dominate overwhelmingly:

\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA} \wedge \neg H_{CS}) \cdot P(\neg H_{BA} \wedge \neg H_{CS}) \]

To simplify, consider:
\[ P(E) \approx 0.05 \cdot 0.15 + 0.30 \cdot 0.25 + (other terms) \]

For rough calculation:
\[ P(E) \approx 0.0075 + 0.075 = 0.0825 ~ (disregard other terms for simplicity) \]

\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.15}{0.0825} = \frac{0.0075}{0.0825} \approx 0.091 \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.30 \cdot 0.25}{0.0825} = \frac{0.075}{0.0825} \approx 0.909 \]

### Final Judgement
Given the high calculated value for computer science based on the traits and the rough estimates:

{
  "business administration": "0.091",
  "computer science": "0.909"
}
