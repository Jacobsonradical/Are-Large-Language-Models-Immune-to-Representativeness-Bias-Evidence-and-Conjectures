To arrive at the probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study, we need to estimate the individual components in Bayes' theorem: \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

### For Computer Science
#### Estimating \( P(H) \)
Graduate students in computer science are relatively common, so let's assign a general prior \( P(H) \) for being in this field, say \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

#### Estimating \( P(E|H) \)
Given Adam's traits: curiosity about nature and plants, enjoys puzzles, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and empathy, the probability that he has these traits if he's in computer science—while certainly possible—might not be overwhelming. Many computer scientists are logical and enjoy solving puzzles, but the deep love for animals and nature isn't a typical presumed fit, say \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).

#### Estimating \( P(E|\neg H) \)
For fields other than computer science, the traits described could fit quite well, particularly in fields related to biology, environmental science, psychology, etc. Therefore, \( P(E|\neg H) \) might be more spread but still reasonably balanced, say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
We'll approximate the normalization factor \( P(E) \) by using a rough weighted estimate of \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Using our assumptions:
\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.6 \cdot 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.06 + 0.48 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.54 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.54} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.06}{0.54} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.111 \]

### For Business Administration
#### Estimating \( P(H) \)
Graduate students in business administration are also quite common, so let's similarly assign a general prior \( P(H) \) possibly also as \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

#### Estimating \( P(E|H) \)
The traits, while including empathy and understanding, don't exceptionally scream a strong fit with business administration where we would expect leadership, decision-making, etc. Say \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

#### Estimating \( P(E|\neg H) \)
We'll use the same reasoning as before with a balanced spread, say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Reusing our \( P(E) \approx 0.54 \):

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.54} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.02}{0.54} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.037 \]
