To determine the probabilities \(P(H|E)\) that Adam was enrolled in a particular field based on his personality sketch, we will follow Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here,

- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of Adam's personality given that he was enrolled in a given field.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\) is the likelihood of Adam's personality given that he was not enrolled in a given field.
- \(P(E)\) is the overall probability of Adam's personality across all fields of study.

For simplicity and due to lack of specific data, we'll assume uniform priors \(P(H)\) and estimate likelihoods qualitatively based on the personality sketch.

### Business Administration

- \(P(H)\) for business administration: Let's assume a prior probability of enrollment as 0.1, as it's not the most likely field for someone with Adam’s characteristics but still plausible.
- \(P(E|H)\): Adam’s personality traits (quiet, loving nature, solving puzzles) are not typically characteristic of business administration students. Hence we will assign:
  \[ P(E|H) = 0.01 \]
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): Given his likelihood in other fields, assume:
  \[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.99 \]
- Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

### Computer Science

- \(P(H)\) for computer science: Higher than business administration, especially given his high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles, so let’s assign a prior probability of 0.3.
- \(P(E|H)\): His traits are a good fit here, so we assign:
  \[ P(E|H) = 0.6 \]
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): Given his unsuitability for fields like business administration, let’s adjust:
  \[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \]
- Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \]

Next, to compute \(P(E)\), we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}}) + P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}}) + ... \]
(Note that dot dot dots (…) here denote the aggregate for all other fields)

Assuming P(E|null) around midpoint:

\[ P(E) = (0.01 \cdot 0.1) + (0.6 \cdot 0.3) + intermediate assumptions \]

\[
P(E) = 0.001 + 0.18 + rest
\]
\begin{aligned}
\left. \begin{array}{l}
\notag P(\text{business admin.} \mid E) = \frac{0.001}{0.181 + ...} \\
\notag P(\text{cs} \mid E) = \frac{0.18}{0.181 + ...}
\end{array} \right. \]
Relative to a normalized 0-1 (small absolute) approximation post-joining \(rest\):
