To solve this using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the various probability components. Here's the detailed breakdown:

**Bayes' Rule:**

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

Given the constraints of the problem, let's use some reasonable assumptions for estimating the probabilities. Let’s start with the two fields: business administration and computer science.

### Business Administration:

- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Let's assume the prior probability of a graduate student being in business administration is \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.2 \).
  
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The given personality traits and interests (nature, puzzles, animals, abstract concepts, empathy) seem less directly aligned with typical business administration characteristics. So we'll estimate \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.1 \).

- **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: To estimate \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \), consider that the traits might be more common among all other fields, but not particularly rare. Let's assume this to be \( 0.3 \).

### Computer Science:

- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Assume the prior probability of being in computer science is \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.3 \).
  
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's high intelligence, appreciation for abstract concepts, and love of puzzles align well with computer science students. So we'll estimate \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.4 \).

- **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Again, considering the traits among all other fields, we assume it is \( 0.3 \).

Using these values, we can compute the posterior probabilities using Bayes' rule:

### Business Administration:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]
Where:
- \( P(E) \) is a normalization factor which we can ignore to compare relative probabilities.

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.3} = \frac{0.02}{0.3} \approx 0.0667 \]

### Computer Science:

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \approx \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{0.3} = 0.4 \]

Thus, converting these into comparable probabilities, our final estimates are:

{
  "business administration": 0.0667,
  "computer science": 0.4
}

These values suggest that based on Adam’s personality sketch, it is more likely that he was enrolled in computer science rather than business administration.
