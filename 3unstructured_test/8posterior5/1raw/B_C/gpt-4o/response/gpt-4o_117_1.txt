To evaluate the probabilities, we need to make some reasonable assumptions based on the given personality sketch and the typical profiles of students in the fields of business administration and computer science.

First, let’s assign initial probabilities and assess the conditional probabilities:

1. **For Business Administration:**
   - **P(H):** The probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration initially.
     - Let's assume P(H) = 0.2, as business administration is a common field but not typically associated with interests in nature, puzzles, and animals.
   - **P(E|H):** The probability of observing the characteristics in E given that Adam is in business administration.
     - Given the personality sketch, the characteristics like empathy and appreciation for hard work might be somewhat common, but the deep love for nature and abstract thinking may be less common. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.1.
   - **P(E|¬H):** The probability of observing the characteristics in E given that Adam is not in business administration.
     - For fields other than business administration, such characteristics might be slightly more probable. Let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.3.

2. **For Computer Science:**
   - **P(H):** The probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science initially.
     - Let's assume P(H) = 0.3, considering it is a common and popular field for graduate studies in the U.S.
   - **P(E|H):** The probability of observing the characteristics in E given that Adam is in computer science.
     - Characteristics like high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and solving puzzles align well with a typical computer science graduate student. Let’s assume P(E|H) = 0.5.
   - **P(E|¬H):** The probability of observing the characteristics in E given that Adam is not in computer science.
     - For fields other than computer science, these characteristics might be less probable. Let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.2.

Now, we use Bayes’ rule to calculate P(H|E) for each field:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We assume \( P(E) \) is the same across both fields and is determined by:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

For simplicity, we'll focus on the ratio form and normalize rates.

### Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H)} \]
\[ P(E|H) = 0.1 \]
\[ P(H) = 0.2 \]
\[ P(E|¬H) = 0.3 \]
\[ P(¬H) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 \]
\[ P(H|E_{BA}) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.24} = \frac{0.02}{0.26} \approx 0.077 \]

### Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H)} \]
\[ P(E|H) = 0.5 \]
\[ P(H) = 0.3 \]
\[ P(E|¬H) = 0.2 \]
\[ P(¬H) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7 \]
\[ P(H|E_{CS}) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.3}{0.5 \cdot 0.3 + 0.2 \cdot 0.7} = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.14} = \frac{0.15}{0.29} \approx 0.517 \]

Thus, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.077,
  "computer science": 0.517
}
```
