To solve for \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' theorem, we follow these steps:

1. Estimate \( P(H) \), the prior probability that Adam is in each field.
2. Estimate \( P(E|H) \), the likelihood of the personality sketch given the hypothesis that Adam is in that field.
3. Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \), the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in that field.
4. Apply Bayes' theorem: \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \).

Since exact statistics are not given, we'll use reasonable estimates based on general knowledge. We'll assume the priors \( P(H) \) are relatively uniform since we lack specific data on the distribution of graduate students across fields.

### Business Administration

1. **P(H\textsubscript{BA})**: The prior probability that Adam is in Business Administration. Let's assume a prior of 0.2 (20%) for Business Administration due to the broad appeal of the field and a higher number of students typically enrolled.

2. **P(E|H\textsubscript{BA})**: The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is in Business Administration. Since the personality traits described in E (curiosity about nature, love for animals) are not closely related to typical traits of Business Administration students, we estimate this low, say 0.1 (10%).

3. **P(E|\neg H\textsubscript{BA})**: The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in Business Administration. This would be higher since the traits described fit more naturally into other fields, let’s say 0.4 (40%).

### Computer Science

1. **P(H\textsubscript{CS})**: The prior probability that Adam is in Computer Science. We can assume a prior of 0.2 (20%), similar to Business Administration for simplicity.

2. **P(E|H\textsubscript{CS})**: The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is in Computer Science. The traits given (solving puzzles, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts) fit relatively well with characteristics of Computer Science students. We may estimate this at 0.5 (50%).

3. **P(E|\neg H\textsubscript{CS})**: The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in Computer Science. This would be lower, as fields not aligning closely with those traits are less likely, say 0.3 (30%).

Now, let’s compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

In practice, \( P(E) \) would normalize the distribution among all possible fields, but since we only compare two fields (and resultant \( P(E) \) cancels out when considering ratios), we can informally compare:

### For Business Administration:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.02}{P(E)} \]

### For Computer Science:

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.1}{P(E)} \]

Comparing these ratios, Computer Science has a higher value.

Putting our estimates into the requested format:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02, 
  "computer science": 0.1
}
```

These values reflect that, based on the given personality sketch, Adam is more likely to be enrolled in Computer Science than Business Administration.
