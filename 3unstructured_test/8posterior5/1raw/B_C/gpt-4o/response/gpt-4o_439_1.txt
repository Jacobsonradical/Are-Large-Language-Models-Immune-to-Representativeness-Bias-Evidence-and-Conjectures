Let's start by utilizing Bayes' theorem which states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For each field, we will estimate:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the evidence given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the evidence given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.

We won't directly calculate \( P(E) \), since we only need the relative probabilities \( P(H|E) \).

### Computer Science

We will make the following assumptions:
- \( P(H) \): Computer Science is a popular field but not the majority, so let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): The traits mentioned (problem-solving, intelligence, appreciation for abstract concepts) strongly match with those needed for Computer Science, so let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of these traits appearing in a person not in Computer Science might be less, say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \) given the field's demands.

### Business Administration

We will make the following assumptions:
- \( P(H) \): Business Administration is also a popular field but likely less fitting given the personality traits, so letâ€™s assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): The traits like high intelligence and empathy might fit moderately for Business Administration, but not as strongly as for Computer Science, so let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of these traits appearing in someone not in Business Administration might be higher, say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

Now we apply Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

### For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.7 \cdot 0.2 + 0.1 \cdot 0.8} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.14}{0.14 + 0.08} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.14}{0.22} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} \approx 0.636 \]

### For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.1}{0.4 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.18} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.04}{0.22} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} \approx 0.182 \]

Hence, our results given the evidence are:

{
  "computer science": 0.636,
  "business administration": 0.182
}
