Let's start by assigning reasonable values for the probabilities based on the given personality sketch of Adam. 

### For Business Administration (H1):

1. **P(H1)** (Probability that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration):
    - Graduate students in the U.S. enroll in a wide variety of fields, but to quantify the typical distribution:
    - Let’s assume approximately 10% of graduate students are in Business Administration.
    - Thus, P(H1) = 0.10

2. **P(E|H1)** (Probability of Adam having the characteristics E given that he is in Business Administration):
    - Characteristics such as "curiosity about nature," "solving puzzles," and "deep love for animals" are less likely to align precisely with Business Administration, which tends to focus more on economic, managerial, and organizational concepts.
    - Let’s assign a lower probability, say P(E|H1) = 0.02

3. **P(E|¬H1)** (Probability of Adam having the characteristics E given that he is not in Business Administration):
    - Given the described traits, it seems more probable he is in a field more closely related to nature or science. Just intuitively, let's give this a higher probability.
    - Let’s assign this P(E|¬H1) = 0.10

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1) + P(E|¬H1) \cdot P(¬H1) \]
\[ P(E) =  (0.02 \cdot 0.10) + (0.10 \cdot 0.90) \]
\[ P(E) =  0.002 + 0.09 = 0.092 \]

\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.02 \cdot 0.10}{0.092} = \frac{0.002}{0.092} \approx 0.0217 \]


### For Computer Science (H2):

1. **P(H2)** (Probability that Adam is enrolled in Computer Science):
    - Given Adam's interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence, computer science could be a reasonable fit.
    - Let's assume a fairly typical distribution for areas of study, particularly with the rise in interest in this field, estimating around 15%.
    - Thus, P(H2) = 0.15
    
2. **P(E|H2)** (Probability of Adam having the characteristics E given that he is in Computer Science):
    - Given that he enjoys puzzles and has high intelligence, this leans positively towards Computer Science.
    - However, since he likes nature, plants, and animals, it might be less likely as computer science is heavily technology-focused.
    - Assigning P(E|H2) = 0.05
    
3. **P(E|¬H2)** (Probability of Adam having the characteristics E given that he is not in Computer Science):
    - This is similar to the complementary probability; Adam's characteristics could fit better in other fields like biology, ecology, etc.
    - Let’s set P(E|¬H2) = 0.10

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2)}{P(E)} \]

Again,
\[ P(E) = (0.05 \cdot 0.15) + (0.10 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) =  0.0075 + 0.085 = 0.0925 \]

\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.15}{0.0925} = \frac{0.0075}{0.0925} \approx 0.0811 \]

### Conclusion:

Here are the results for P(H|E) for both fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0217,
  "computer science": 0.0811
}
```

These values indicate that it is slightly more likely, given the characteristics, that Adam would be in a Computer Science field than Business Administration, though neither of these fields seems highly probable based on the given sketch.
