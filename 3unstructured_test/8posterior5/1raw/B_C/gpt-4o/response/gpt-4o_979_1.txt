Sure, let's break down the problem using Bayes' Rule. Here's a structured approach to solving it:

### Bayes' Rule
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\) is the probability of the evidence given that the hypothesis is false.
- \(P(E)\) is the total probability of the evidence and can be computed as: \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \)

### Assumptions
Given that Adam is a graduate student in 2021 in the U.S., we need some additional assumptions. I'll assume the following for this calculation:

- The prior, \(P(H)\), for any specific graduate program being Adam's field is relatively low, as there are many such programs available.
- Adam's personality suggests a stronger inclination towards fields involving abstract thinking and nature. This can have different impacts depending on the field.

### Hypotheses
1. H = Adam was enrolled in Business Administration.
2. H = Adam was enrolled in Computer Science.

### Calculations

#### Business Administration
- **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**:
  Given it’s one of many fields, a rough estimate might be \(0.05\) (5% of graduate students).
  
- **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**:
  Interested in nature and strong empathy are traits not strongly aligned with typical Business Administration students, who might be more focused on leadership and management. Let's estimate \(0.1\).

- **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)**:
  Involves the fields other than Business Administration, assuming a broad spread. Given there are many other fields, a rough estimation might be \(0.9\).

#### Computer Science
- **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**:
  Again, roughly estimating \(0.05\).

- **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**:
  High intelligence and problem-solving skills fit well with Computer Science. However, the nature-loving aspect might be less common, but still possible. Let's estimate \(0.5\).

- **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)**:
  Involving other fields’ alignment with Adam's traits, estimating \(0.5\), since other fields might also value intelligence and problem-solving.

### Final Calculations
To find \(P(H|E)\):

1. Compute for Business Administration:
\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

For Business Administration:
\[
P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.05 + 0.9 \cdot 0.95 \approx 0.1 \cdot 0.05 + 0.855 = 0.86
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.05}{0.86} \approx \frac{0.005}{0.86} \approx 0.0058
\]

2. Compute for Computer Science:
\[
P(E) = 0.5 \cdot 0.05 + 0.5 \cdot 0.95 \approx 0.5 \cdot 0.05 + 0.475 = 0.5
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.05}{0.5} \approx \frac{0.025}{0.5} = 0.05
\]

So, the results are:

\[
{
  "business administration": 0.0058,
  "computer science": 0.05
}
\]
