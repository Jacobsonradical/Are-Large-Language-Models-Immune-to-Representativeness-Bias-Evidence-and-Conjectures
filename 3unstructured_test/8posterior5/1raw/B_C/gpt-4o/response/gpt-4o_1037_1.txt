To calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to use Bayes' Rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We are given E (the personality sketch of Adam) and need to evaluate two hypotheses (computer science and business administration). This process involves:

1. Estimating \( P(H) \), the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field.
2. Estimating \( P(E|H) \), the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is in each field.
3. Estimating \( P(E|\neg H) \), the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not in each field. We often approximate this with \( P(E) \) in practical usage since calculating \( P(E|\neg H) \) would require considering all other possible fields.

Assumptions based on the personality sketch (E) include Adam's natural curiosity, intelligence, empathy, and love for animals, which we can use to observe different graduate fields.

Let's begin by defining reasonable estimates:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Let's assume computer science is a popular field among graduates, but not overwhelmingly so. We can roughly estimate it at 0.2.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Considering Adam's traits (curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving), these qualities may fit well with a student in computer science. Let’s estimate this as 0.4.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): This is hard to quantify precisely but let's assume the general likelihood of these traits exists among graduate students across fields. Estimating it roughly to 0.2.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): Business administration is also a common graduate field. We can estimate this as 0.15.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The traits (curiosity, empathy, appreciation for hard work) could apply but may be less aligned compared to fields like psychology or environmental sciences. Let’s assume 0.2.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): As above, let's estimate it as 0.2.

With these values, we use Bayes' Rule to calculate \( P(H|E) \):

### Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.2} = 0.4 \]

### Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{0.2} = 0.15 \]

Therefore, the probabilities can be summarized as:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.15
}
