First, let's break down the values needed for Bayes' theorem. The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to estimate each of these probabilities for the fields of computer science and business administration:

1. **P(H)**: The probability that Adam was enrolled in the field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in the field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in the field.
4. **P(E)**: The overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch, which is the normalizing constant.

We might not have specific values for all of these probabilities, but we can make educated estimates based on the information provided in Adam's personality sketch.

### Computer Science
- **P(H)**: Assuming there are many fields Adam could have chosen, the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science might be around 0.1 (10%).
- **P(E|H)**: Given his attributes like high intelligence, abstract thinking, and puzzle-solving, the likelihood of his personality sketch given that he is in computer science seems reasonably high. Let's estimate this at 0.7 (70%).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Likelihood of his personality sketch given that he is not in computer science could be lower but still significant, as puzzles and abstract thinking are valued in other fields as well. Let's estimate this at 0.3 (30%).

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: Prior probability that Adam was in business administration might be slightly less, let's estimate around 0.05 (5%).
- **P(E|H)**: The attributes like empathy and appreciation for hard work could apply well to business administration, but high intelligence and puzzle-solving might be less emphasized. Let's estimate this at 0.4 (40%).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Likelihood of his personality sketch given that he is not in business administration is probably higher because these traits are common in many fields. Let's estimate this at 0.5 (50%).

Now we can calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We can simplify the comparison by normalizing the results.

### Computer Science
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) \propto P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) \propto 0.7 \times 0.1 = 0.07 \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) \propto P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) \propto 0.4 \times 0.05 = 0.02 \]

Considering we need normalized values that do not need to add up to 1, we can keep these direct proportional values.
