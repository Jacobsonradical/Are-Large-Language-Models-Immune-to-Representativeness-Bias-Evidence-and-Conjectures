To use Bayesian probability to compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch \( E \), we need to first estimate the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihoods of the evidence given not \( H \) (i.e., \( P(E|\neg H) \)).

Let's start with the prior probabilities \( P(H) \):

1. **Business Administration**: This field typically attracts individuals who are interested in leadership, management, finance, and economics. Given that Adam has a strong curiosity about nature, plants, animals, and has a quiet personality, we might estimate the prior probability \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \) to be relatively low.

2. **Computer Science**: This field often attracts individuals who enjoy solving puzzles, are good with abstract concepts, and have high intelligence. Given that Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, we might estimate the prior probability \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) \) to be higher than for business administration.

For simplicity, let's assume the following rough prior probabilities based on the given information \( E \). These are estimates:

- \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.4 \)

Next, we estimate the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \):

1. **Business Administration**: The personality traits of curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, empathy, and love for animals are not strongly aligned with what is typically associated with business administration. Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \) is moderately low.
2. **Computer Science**: The traits of enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts are strongly aligned with computer science. Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \) is relatively high.

For simplicity:

- \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.6 \)

Lastly, we estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \): To consider how likely the personality sketch \( E \) is given enrollment in any field other than the specified field.

Assuming there is even distribution across various fields:

- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.4 \)

Now, calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For **business administration**:
\[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.2) + (0.5 \cdot 0.8) = 0.06 + 0.4 = 0.46 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.46} \approx 0.1304 \]

For **computer science**:
\[ P(E) = (0.6 \cdot 0.4) + (0.4 \cdot 0.6) = 0.24 + 0.24 = 0.48 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.4}{0.48} \approx 0.5 \]

So, the answers are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1304,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```
