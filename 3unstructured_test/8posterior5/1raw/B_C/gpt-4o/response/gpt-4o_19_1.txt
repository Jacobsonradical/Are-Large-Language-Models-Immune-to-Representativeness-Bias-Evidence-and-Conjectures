To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following probabilities for each field:

1. Prior probability, \( P(H) \): The probability that Adam was enrolled in the field before considering any information about his personality sketch.
2. Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in the field.
3. Marginal likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in the field.

Bayes' rule formula to compute \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) \) is the normalizing constant obtained from the sum of \( P(E|H_i) \cdot P(H_i) \) for all possible fields \( H_i \).

Let's start by estimating the values based on the given personality sketch and then calculate \( P(H|E) \).

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   Let's assume the prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in business admin is around 0.15 (15%).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Curiosity about nature and plants: Low alignment with business administration.
   - Solving puzzles, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts: Moderate alignment.
   - Warm heart, empathy, love for animals: Low alignment.

   Based on these factors, let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) to be 0.1.

3. **Marginal Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   Given that Adam is not in business admin, let's estimate the probability of exhibiting the personality sketch \( E \) as 0.2.

### Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   Let's assume the prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in computer science is around 0.2 (20%).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Curiosity about nature and plants: Moderate alignment.
   - Solving puzzles, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts: High alignment.
   - Warm heart, empathy, love for animals: Moderate alignment.

   Based on these factors, let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) to be 0.3.

3. **Marginal Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   Given that Adam is not in computer science, let's estimate the probability of exhibiting the personality sketch \( E \) as 0.15.

Now we can use Bayes' rule to calculate \( P(H|E) \):

For Business Administration:
\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} 
\]
Since \( P(E) \) is constant and used for normalization, we can focus on the numerator:
\[ 
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.15 = 0.015 
\]

For Computer Science:
\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} 
\]
Similarly, focusing on the numerator:
\[ 
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.3 \cdot 0.2 = 0.06 
\]

To normalize these values, we need to compute the sum of the products for all relevant fields:
\[ 
P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.15) + (0.3 \cdot 0.2) + \text{(other fields)}
\]
Since we are provided with only two fields to consider, the normalization constant \( P(E) \) becomes:
\[ 
P(E) \approx 0.015 + 0.06 = 0.075 
\]

Therefore, the posterior probabilities are:
\[ 
P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} = \frac{0.015}{0.075} = 0.2 
\]
\[ 
P(H|E)_{\text{computer science}} = \frac{0.06}{0.075} = 0.8 
\]

Thus, the final results are:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.8
}
```
