To use Bayes' theorem in this context, we will follow these steps for each field:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is in that field.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not in that field.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant. Since we don't have the exact value of \( P(E) \), we'll focus on the ratio of probabilities. Let's assume reasonable values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|¬H) \).

### 1. Business Administration

**P(H)**: Business administration is a popular field, but not as tightly aligned with Adam’s personality traits. Let’s assign a prior probability of 0.15.

**P(E|H)**: Adam’s traits like genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy might be somewhat less common in business administration students. Let’s assign a probability of 0.05.

**P(E|¬H)**: This would be the probability of observing these traits given that Adam is NOT in business administration. Given that these traits might be more common in other fields (like biology, environmental science, etc.), let’s assign a slightly higher probability, say 0.8.

### 2. Computer Science

**P(H)**: Computer science is another popular field among graduate students. Given his high intelligence and affinity for solving puzzles, this field is quite aligned. Let’s assign a prior probability of 0.25.

**P(E|H)**: Given Adam’s traits, his interests are somewhat in line with computer science, especially his problem-solving skills. Given his love for nature and animals, these traits might be less common but not out of place. Let’s assign a probability of 0.3.

**P(E|¬H)**: The probability of these traits if Adam is not in computer science. Since these are unique traits and might fit better in more specific fields, let’s assign a probability of 0.7.

Now, applying Bayes’ theorem:

### Business Administration

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.05 \cdot 0.15 = 0.0075 \]

### Computer Science

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.3 \cdot 0.25 = 0.075 \]

To provide values for these fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0075,
  "computer science": 0.075
}
```

Again, these values are relative to each other and are proportional representations. The absolute values would require normalization by \( P(E) \).
