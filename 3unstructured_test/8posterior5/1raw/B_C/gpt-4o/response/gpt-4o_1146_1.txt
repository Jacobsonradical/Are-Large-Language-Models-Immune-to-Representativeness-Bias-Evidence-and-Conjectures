To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch \( E \) (Adam's characteristics) using Bayes' Rule, we need:

1. \( P(H) \) - the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \) - the likelihood that Adam possesses these characteristics given he is in a particular field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - the likelihood that Adam possesses these characteristics given he is not in a particular field.
4. \( P(E) \) - the overall probability that Adam possesses these characteristics. This is the normalization factor.

Bayes' Rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is constant across all fields and we are looking for relative probabilities, we can ignore it in the ratio and focus on the numerator's components: \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(H) \).

Let’s evaluate each field:

### 1. Computer Science
- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Assuming equal likelihood for simplicity and a range of graduate fields, let's approximate \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam has high intelligence and enjoys solving puzzles, traits that are favorable in computer science. However, his love for nature and animals might not be directly relevant in this field. Let's assume \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.4 \).
- **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is likely higher because the traits match more fields, not just computer science. Assume \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.7 \).

### 2. Business Administration
- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Similarly, let’s approximate \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Business administration often values strong interpersonal skills and empathy, which Adam has. However, his strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, and abstract concept thinking may not be as central. Let's assume \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.2 \).
- **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is still likely higher, given that these traits fit multiple fields. Assume \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.7 \).

### Calculations:

For **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.1}{0.7} \approx 0.057 \]

For **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.7} \approx 0.029 \]

Summarizing the results in the required format:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.057,
  "business administration": 0.029
}
```

This indicates that, based on the given personality sketch and the assumptions made, it is somewhat more likely that Adam was enrolled in computer science compared to business administration. However, both probabilities are relatively low because these fields do not strongly match all aspects of his personality sketch.
