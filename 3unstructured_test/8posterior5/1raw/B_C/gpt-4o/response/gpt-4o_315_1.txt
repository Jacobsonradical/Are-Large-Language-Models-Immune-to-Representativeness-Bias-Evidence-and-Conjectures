To estimate the probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch (E), we'll use the Bayesian formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, P(H) is the prior probability of Adam being in a particular field, P(E|H) is the probability of observing the personality traits given that Adam is in that field, and P(E) is the overall probability of observing the personality traits.

Since we don't have precise values, we'll make some qualitative assessments for these probabilities. Let’s break this down for both fields.

**Business Administration:**
- **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being in Business Administration. Assuming equal likelihood across many fields, we might say this is relatively low, as Business Administration is generally not highly associated with Adam's traits.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's traits given he is in Business Administration. Given his quiet nature, love for animals, and interest in abstract concepts, this field does not strongly align. This would be low.
- **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing Adam’s traits if he is not in Business Administration.

**Computer Science:**
- **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being in Computer Science. We might assume a moderate value given that Computer Science can appeal to people who enjoy puzzles and abstract thinking.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's traits given he is in Computer Science. His intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts align well with Computer Science, so this would be relatively high.
- **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing Adam’s traits if he is not in Computer Science.

Consider the following qualitative judgments for P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|¬H):

1. **Business Administration**:
   - P(H) = 0.05
   - P(E|H) = 0.01
   - P(E|¬H) = 0.10

2. **Computer Science**:
   - P(H) = 0.15
   - P(E|H) = 0.50
   - P(E|¬H) = 0.20

Now we calculate P(H|E) using Bayes' rule. We’ll simplify by normalizing our probabilities later.

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.01 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.50 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \]

P(E) is constant across both fields for normalization. Thus, we can compare the non-normalized values directly:

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.01 \cdot 0.05 = 0.0005 \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.50 \cdot 0.15 = 0.075 \]

Now we normalize to get a relative sense of these probabilities:
\[ P(E) = 0.0005 + 0.075 = 0.0755 \]

For Business Administration (normalized):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.0005}{0.0755} \approx 0.0066 \]

For Computer Science (normalized):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.075}{0.0755} \approx 0.9934 \]

Interpretation:
{
  "business administration": 0.0066,
  "computer science": 0.9934
}
