Let's start with the necessary components for each hypothesis using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since the problem asks for the comparison between specific fields and not the exact probability values, we can focus on the relevant ratios. We don't need the exact value of \( P(E) \) since it cancels out when comparing the two hypotheses.

### For Computer Science:

1. **P(H)**: Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Computer Science.
   - Since Computer Science is a popular field, let's assume a higher prior than less common fields: 0.3.

2. **P(E|H)**: Probability of Adam's personality traits given that he is in Computer Science.
   - Intelligence and abstract thinking are beneficial traits in Computer Science, but empathy and love for nature and animals are less related. Let's assume this value to be moderate: 0.4.

3. **P(E|¬H)**: Probability of Adam's personality traits given that he is not in Computer Science.
   - This encompasses all other fields. Given his empathy, love for nature, and animals, his traits could fit well in many other fields, so let's assume the probability is moderate: 0.4.

\[ P(H|E) \text{ for Computer Science} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{0.4} = 0.3 \]

### For Business Administration:

1. **P(H)**: Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration.
   - Business Administration is also a common field, but less technical compared to Computer Science. Let's assume: 0.2.

2. **P(E|H)**: Probability of Adam's personality traits given that he is in Business Administration.
   - While empathy is beneficial in Business Administration, Adam’s traits are generally more aligned with sciences or humanities. Let's set a lower value: 0.2.

3. **P(E|¬H)**: Probability of Adam's personality traits given that he is not in Business Administration.
   - This is the same as before since it includes all other fields, some of which align well with his traits. Let's assume the same moderate probability: 0.4.

\[ P(H|E) \text{ for Business Administration} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.4} = 0.1 \]

Summarizing, we get:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
