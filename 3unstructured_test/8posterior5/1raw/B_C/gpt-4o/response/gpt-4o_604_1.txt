To apply Bayes' Rule, we need to calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) which involves the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in that field.

Bayes' Rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

**Assumptions:**
- Let's assume the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for both fields based on general distribution of graduate fields of study.
- We’ll assess \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \) based on how likely Adam’s personality traits match typical students in these fields.

### Business Administration:
- **P(H) for Business Administration (P(H_{BA})):** Assume a moderate prior probability, as it’s a common field.
- **P(E|H) for Business Administration (P(E|H_{BA})):** His traits do not strongly align with typical business administration traits.
- **P(E|\neg H) for Business Administration (P(E|\neg H_{BA})):** Assume other fields have a higher likelihood for his traits.

### Computer Science:
- **P(H) for Computer Science (P(H_{CS})):** Assume a reasonable prior since it is a popular field.
- **P(E|H) for Computer Science (P(E|H_{CS})):** His intelligence, love for puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts fit well.
- **P(E|\neg H) for Computer Science (P(E|\neg H_{CS})):** Many other fields may also fit his traits, but not as closely.

### Assigning Values:
Without exact statistical data, I will make an educated estimation for each probability between 0 and 1.

#### Business Administration:
- \( P(H_{BA}) \approx 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \approx 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \approx 0.8 \)

#### Computer Science:
- \( P(H_{CS}) \approx 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \approx 0.7 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \approx 0.4 \)

### Calculating Posterior Probabilities:
#### Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \cdot P(\neg H_{BA}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.2 + 0.8 \cdot 0.8 = 0.04 + 0.64 = 0.68 \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.68} \approx 0.059 \]

#### Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \cdot P(\neg H_{CS}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.7 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8 = 0.14 + 0.32 = 0.46 \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.14}{0.46} \approx 0.304 \]

### Final Results:
