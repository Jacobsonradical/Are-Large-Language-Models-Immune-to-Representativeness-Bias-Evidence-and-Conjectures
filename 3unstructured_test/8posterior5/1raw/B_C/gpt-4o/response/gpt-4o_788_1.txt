To apply Bayes' Theorem to calculate \( P(H|E) \), we need to evaluate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field. Let's break this down.

First, let's make some reasonable assumptions:

1. **Prior probability \( P(H) \)**: Given no specific information, we can assume that each field is equally likely. However, because business administration and computer science are popular fields, we might give them a bit higher prior probability. Let's assume the prior probability for both fields are:

   - \( P(H = \text{business administration}) = 0.2 \)
   - \( P(H = \text{computer science}) = 0.2 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This represents the probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in a particular field.

    - For business administration: The traits described in the sketch (curiosity about nature, love for animals, etc.) don't strongly correlate with a typical business administration student. Thus, \( P(E | H = \text{business administration}) \) is relatively low, let's say 0.05.
    - For computer science: A high intelligence, love for solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts align more closely with traits often found in computer science students. Thus, \( P(E | H = \text{computer science}) \) is higher, let's say 0.6.

3. **Probability of evidence given the negation \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This represents the probability of Adam's personality if he's not in the field.

    - Given that business administration and computer science are only two of the many graduate fields, the probability of the sketch fitting other fields might be moderate. Let's assume:
      - \( P(E | \neg(\text{business administration})) = 0.3 \)
      - \( P(E | \neg(\text{computer science})) = 0.2 \)

Now, use Bayes' Theorem for each field:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the normalization factor calculated from both hypotheses:

\[ P(E) = P(E | \text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) + P(E | \text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) + P(E | \neg(\text{business administration})) \cdot (1 - P(\text{business administration})) + P(E | \neg(\text{computer science})) \cdot (1 - P(\text{computer science})) \]

Plugging in values:

\[ P(E) = (0.05 \times 0.2) + (0.6 \times 0.2) + (0.3 \times 0.8) + (0.2 \times 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.01 + 0.12 + 0.24 + 0.16 = 0.53 \]

Now calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

- For business administration:

\[ P(\text{business administration} | E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.2}{0.53} \approx \frac{0.01}{0.53} \approx 0.0189 \]

- For computer science:

\[ P(\text{computer science} | E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.2}{0.53} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.53} \approx 0.2264 \]

Finally, we have:

  "business administration": 0.0189,
  "computer science": 0.2264
