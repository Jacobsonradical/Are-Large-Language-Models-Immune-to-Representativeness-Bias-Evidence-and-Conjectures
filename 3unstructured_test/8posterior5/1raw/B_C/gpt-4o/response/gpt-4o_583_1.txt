To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the fields of business administration and computer science given Adam's personality sketch \( E \), we can use Bayes' rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( E \) is the personality sketch (genuine curiosity about nature and plants, enjoys solving puzzles, warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals, high intelligence, good at abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication). \( H \) is the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in a certain field, and \( \neg H \) is the hypothesis that Adam was not enrolled in that field.

### 1. Business Administration:
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration. Since this is a common field, we may assign a prior probability estimation.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability that someone in business administration has Adam's personality traits.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that someone not in business administration has Adam's personality traits.

Given his traits, business administration doesn't seem directly aligned but could be plausible due to the appreciation of hard work and intelligence:

- **P(H)**: Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
- **P(E|H)**: Given the traits, maybe \( P(E|H) = 0.20 \) (less congruent but possible).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Given Adamâ€™s specific personality traits, the probability someone not in business administration has those traits could be lower, say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.05 \).

### Bayes' Calculation for Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, we approximate \( P(E) \) as \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

\[ P(E) \approx (0.20 \cdot 0.15) + (0.05 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.03 + 0.0425 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.0725 \]

Now:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.20 \cdot 0.15}{0.0725} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.03}{0.0725} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.414 \]

### 2. Computer Science:
- **P(H)**: The prior probability Adam is in computer science. This is a common field for high intelligence and puzzle solving, so we'd assign a higher prior probability.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability that someone in computer science has Adam's personality traits.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability of traits in someone not in computer science.

Given Adam's traits, it aligns well with computer science due to abstract thinking and puzzle solving:

- **P(H)**: Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.25 \).
- **P(E|H)**: Given the traits, \( P(E|H) = 0.50 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability that someone not in computer science shares these traits might be lower, say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.10 \).

### Bayes' Calculation for Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Again, approximate \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) \approx (0.50 \cdot 0.25) + (0.10 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.125 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.20 \]

Now:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.50 \cdot 0.25}{0.20} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.125}{0.20} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.625 \]
