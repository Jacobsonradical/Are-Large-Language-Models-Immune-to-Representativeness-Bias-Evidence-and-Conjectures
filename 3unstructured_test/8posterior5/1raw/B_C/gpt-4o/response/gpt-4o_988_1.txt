Let's break down the problem using Bayesian statistics for each field of study. 

The calculations are based on the following Bayesian rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given:
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability of Adam being in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Probability of observing the evidence (E) given the hypothesis (H).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of observing the evidence (E) given the hypothesis is not true (\neg H).

Now, without the actual numbers for the prior probabilities or the base rates of graduate students studying each field, I'll make reasonable assumptions.

### Assumptions for Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \):
- Since graduate programs in computer science and business administration are common, letâ€™s assign reasonable priors.
- Let's assume a slightly higher prior for computer science given the growing popularity of the field and related interests in puzzles and abstract thinking.

- \( P(\text{CS}) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(\text{BA}) = 0.2 \)

### Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \):
- The provided personality sketch should be more likely if Adam were in a field like computer science given his interest in puzzles and abstract concepts.
- For business administration, the likelihood is assumed to be lower but still significant given the appreciation for hard work and dedication.

- \( P(E|\text{CS}) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(E|\text{BA}) = 0.4 \)

### Likelihoods \( P(E|\neg H) \):
- We also need complementary likelihoods, but since we're comparing just two hypotheses, consider \( P(E|\neg H) \ to account for all other fields. Assuming uniform likelihood for general students not into either field:

- \( P(E|\neg \text{CS}) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|\neg \text{BA}) = 0.1 \)

### Computing Posterior Probabilities \( P(H|E) \):
- Use Bayes rule:

For Computer Science:
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is consistent across fields, it can be omitted from relative comparisons. Thus:
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) \propto P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{BA}) \cdot P(\text{BA})}{P(E)} \]

Similarly:
\[ P(\text{BA}|E) \propto P(E|\text{BA}) \cdot P(\text{BA}) = 0.4 \cdot 0.2 = 0.08 \]

Normalize the results to add context:

Total sum = 0.24 (CS) + 0.08 (BA) = 0.32.

Normalized probabilities:

- \( P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.24}{0.32} \approx 0.75 \)
- \( P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.32} \approx 0.25 \)

### Final Results:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.25
}
```

Here, Adam is more likely to be enrolled in computer science based on the provided personality sketch and the assumed probabilities.
