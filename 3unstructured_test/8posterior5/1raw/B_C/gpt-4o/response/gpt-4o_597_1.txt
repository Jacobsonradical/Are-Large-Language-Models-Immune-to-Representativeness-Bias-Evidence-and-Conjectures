Let’s evaluate the probabilities using Bayes' Rule, which states that:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the observed evidence given that Adam is in that specific field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of the observed evidence given that Adam is not in that specific field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence, which can be considered as the normalizing term here.

We will examine the specific fields of business administration (denoted as H1) and computer science (denoted as H2).

### Business Administration (H1)

**P(H1):** The prior probability of Adam being in business administration can be considered to be relatively low given the personality sketch's lack of alignment with typical business administration traits (e.g., more interest in people management, finance, etc.). Let's assume a low prior, say 0.1.

**P(E|H1):** The personality traits described (e.g., curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, love for animals) are not typically associated with a business administration specialization. Let's assume this is fairly low, say 0.2.

**P(E|\neg H1):** The probability of the evidence for someone who is not in business administration might be higher because the traits match well with other fields such as environmental science or biology. Let’s assume this is 0.6.

\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1)}{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1) + P(E|\neg H1) \cdot (1 - P(H1))} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.6 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.54} = \frac{0.02}{0.56} \approx 0.036 \)

So, \( P(H1|E) \approx 0.036 \).

### Computer Science (H2)

**P(H2):** Given Adam's high intelligence and aptitude for solving puzzles, computer science seems more plausible than business administration. Let’s assume a moderate prior, say 0.3.

**P(E|H2):** The traits match fairly well with a person in computer science who might have an inquisitive and analytical mind. Let’s assume this is moderately high, say 0.5.

**P(E|\neg H2):** This doesn't exclude other fields where these personality traits are also prevalent. Even higher here given Adam's interests and empathy for nature and animals fit well with several other fields. Let’s assume this is 0.4.

\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2)}{P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2) + P(E|\neg H2) \cdot (1 - P(H2))} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.3}{0.5 \cdot 0.3 + 0.4 \cdot 0.7} = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.28} = \frac{0.15}{0.43} \approx 0.349 \)

So, \( P(H2|E) \approx 0.349 \).

Therefore, the computed probabilities for Adam being in each field are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.036,
  "computer science": 0.349
}
