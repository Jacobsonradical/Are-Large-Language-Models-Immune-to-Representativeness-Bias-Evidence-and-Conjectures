To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in either Business Administration or Computer Science given his personality sketch \( E \) (curiosity about nature, empathy, intelligence, etc.), we'll use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's estimate each part for the fields of Business Administration and Computer Science.

1. **Business Administration**:

    - \( P(H_{BA}) \): Let's assume a base rate that 10% of graduate students might be in Business Administration. So, \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.10 \).
    
    - \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): Empirical traits given do not directly align with typical Business Administration attributes. Maybe we'd set this to a lower value, let's say 0.01.
    
    - \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \): This considers Adam not being in Business Administration. Since his traits are quite unique and thoughtful rather than business-oriented, this could be moderately high. Let's say 0.04.

    Using Bayes' rule:

    \[
    P(H_{BA}|E) =  \frac{0.01 \cdot 0.10}{P(E)}
    \]

    Since we don't know \( P(E) \) exactly and we're looking to compare the relative likelihoods, we can use:

    \[
    P(H_{BA}|E) \propto  0.001
    \]


2. **Computer Science**:

    - \( P(H_{CS}) \): Assume base rate for graduate students in Computer Science to be higher, say 20%. So, \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.20 \).
    
    - \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Adam's traits of intelligence, curiosity, and puzzle solving align more closely with traits beneficial in Computer Science. Let's set this to a higher value, say 0.15.
    
    - \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \): As his traits are kind of universal, let's again set this to 0.04.

    Using Bayes' rule:

    \[
    P(H_{CS}|E) =  \frac{0.15 \cdot 0.20}{P(E)}
    \]

    Similarly,

    \[
    P(H_{CS}|E) \propto 0.03
    \]

Combining and considering the results:

\[
\frac{P(H_{CS}|E)}{P(H_{BA}|E)} = \frac{0.03}{0.001} = 30
\]

So, itâ€™s far more likely Adam was in Computer Science.

Here are the final relative values:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.001,
  "computer science": 0.03
}
```

These values are relative and should ideally sum to 1 when compared with probabilities in the full context of all other potential fields. For purely relative comparison, the given format would suffice.
