To solve the problem, we'll need to follow the Bayesian approach as outlined.

1. **Define Hypothesis H:**
   - H1: Adam was enrolled in business administration.
   - H2: Adam was enrolled in computer science.

2. **Define Prior Probabilities P(H):**
   - P(H1): The probability that a graduate student is enrolled in business administration.
   - P(H2): The probability that a graduate student is enrolled in computer science.

3. **Calculate Likelihood P(E|H):**
   - P(E|H1): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in business administration.
   - P(E|H2): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in computer science.

4. **Calculate the Probability of Evidence P(E|¬H):**
   - P(E|¬H1): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is NOT enrolled in business administration.
   - P(E|¬H2): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is NOT enrolled in computer science.

5. **Compute Posterior Probabilities using Bayes' Rule:**
   - \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) * P(H)}{P(E)} \)

We'll begin by making reasonable assumptions for these probability values:

### Business Administration
1. **Prior Probability P(H1):**
   - Let's assume about 10% of graduate students are in business administration.
   - \( P(H1) = 0.1 \)

2. **Likelihood P(E|H1):**
   - Business students might value hard work and dedication, but a warm heart, deep love for animals, and curiosity about nature seem less relevant.
   - Let's assume this has a low likelihood, say 0.05.
   - \( P(E|H1) = 0.05 \)

3. **Probability of Evidence P(E|¬H1):**
   - Across all other fields, the probability of observing such a personality might be more common.
   - Let’s assume \( P(E|¬H1) = 0.3 \)

### Computer Science
1. **Prior Probability P(H2):**
   - Let's assume about 15% of graduate students are in computer science.
   - \( P(H2) = 0.15 \)

2. **Likelihood P(E|H2):**
   - Computer science students might also fit the attributes of high intelligence and puzzle-solving.
   - Let’s assume this has a higher likelihood, say 0.2.
   - \( P(E|H2) = 0.2 \)

3. **Probability of Evidence P(E|¬H2):**
   - Across all other fields, the probability of observing such a personality.
   - Let’s assume \( P(E|¬H2) = 0.3 \)

### Using Bayes' Rule:
1. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1) * P(H1)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.05 * 0.1}{0.3} \approx \frac{0.005}{0.3} \approx 0.0167 \)

2. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(H2|E) = \frac{P(E|H2) * P(H2)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 * 0.15}{0.3} \approx \frac{0.03}{0.3} \approx 0.1 \)

So the results are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0167,
  "computer science": 0.1
}
```
