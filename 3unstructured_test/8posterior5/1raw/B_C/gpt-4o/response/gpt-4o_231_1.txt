Let's begin by determining some reasonable values for the probabilities involved.

### Business Administration

#### Assessing Probabilities
- **P(H):** The probability that any given graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in business administration is relatively common, though not the most common. Let's assume **P(H) ≈ 0.15**.
- **P(E|H):** Given that Adam is in business administration, the sketch of his personality with a strong interest in nature and animals, empathy, and a quiet demeanor does not strongly fit the typical profile of business administration students. They are often more extroverted, less likely to have a primary focus on nature, and more focused on interpersonal communication and leadership. Therefore, let's assume **P(E|H) ≈ 0.05**.
- **P(E|¬H):** The personality sketch is likely more fitting for other fields that involve nature, science, or research. Let's assume **P(E|¬H) ≈ 0.20**.

#### Bayes Calculation
Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

Let's assume for simplicity that there are many other fields, and P(¬H) = 0.85.

\[ P(E) = (0.05 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) ≈ 0.0075 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) ≈ 0.1775 \]

Now,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.15}{0.1775} \]
\[ P(H|E) ≈ \frac{0.0075}{0.1775} \]
\[ P(H|E) ≈ 0.042 \]

### Computer Science

#### Assessing Probabilities
- **P(H):** Computer science is a very common field for graduate students in the U.S., especially in recent years. Let's assume **P(H) ≈ 0.20**.
- **P(E|H):** The description fits fairly well for someone in computer science, especially given his intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and possibly abstract thinking. Let’s assume **P(E|H) ≈ 0.25**.
- **P(E|¬H):** The probability of this personality sketch fitting other non-computer science fields may be spread out over a range of fields, some of which may match well and some poorly. Let’s assume **P(E|¬H) ≈ 0.15**.

#### Bayes Calculation
Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.25 \cdot 0.20) + (0.15 \cdot 0.80) \]
\[ P(E) ≈ 0.05 + 0.12 \]
\[ P(E) ≈ 0.17 \]

Now,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.25 \cdot 0.20}{0.17} \]
\[ P(H|E) ≈ \frac{0.05}{0.17} \]
\[ P(H|E) ≈ 0.294 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.042,
  "computer science": 0.294
}
```
