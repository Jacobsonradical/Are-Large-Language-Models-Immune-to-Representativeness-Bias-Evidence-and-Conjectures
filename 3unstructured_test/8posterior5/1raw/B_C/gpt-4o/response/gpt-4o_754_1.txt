To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Theorem, we need to estimate:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that specific field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam fits the personality sketch given he is in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that Adam fits the personality sketch given he is not in that field.

Let's start with some reasonable assumptions based on the given personality sketch and known distributions of graduate students across fields.

### Computer Science

1. **\( P(H_{CS}) \), prior probability for computer science**:
    - Assume a moderate number of students are enrolled in computer science programs.
    - Let’s estimate \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.2 \).

2. **\( P(E|H_{CS}) \), likelihood of Adam fitting the sketch in computer science**:
    - Computer Science students often require high intelligence and abstract thinking skills.
    - However, traits such as a deep love for nature and animals, while not contradictory, are less central.
    - Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.3 \).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \), likelihood of Adam fitting the sketch in other fields**:
    - Consider that Adam’s traits might align well with fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology.
    - Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.2 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.2) + (0.2 \cdot 0.8) = 0.06 + 0.16 = 0.22 \]

Therefore:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.22} \approx 0.2727 \]

### Business Administration

1. **\( P(H_{BA}) \), prior probability for business administration**:
    - Assume a moderate number of students are enrolled in business administration programs.
    - Let’s estimate \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.15 \).

2. **\( P(E|H_{BA}) \), likelihood of Adam fitting the sketch in business administration**:
    - Business Administration students typically require different traits (leadership, business acumen) that are not central to Adam's description.
    - Let’s estimate \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.15 \).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \), likelihood of Adam fitting the sketch in other fields**:
    - Similar to before, we consider Adam's traits aligning well with sciences rather than business.
    - Let’s estimate \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.22 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.15 \cdot 0.15) + (0.22 \cdot 0.85) = 0.0225 + 0.187 = 0.2095 \]

Therefore:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.15 \cdot 0.15}{0.2095} \approx 0.107 \]
