To apply Bayes' theorem, we need to consider the prior probabilities \(P(H)\), the likelihoods \(P(E|H)\), and the complements \(P(E|\neg H)\). We'll also consider the evidence \(E\), which is the personality sketch of Adam.

Given the provided description, let's provide some rough estimates to compute \(P(H|E)\) for each hypothesis.

### For Business Administration:

1. **Prior Probability (\(P(H)\))**: Let's assume the general likelihood of a graduate student being enrolled in Business Administration is moderately common. Let's arbitrarily set it at \(P(H_{\text{business}}) = 0.2\).

2. **Likelihood (\(P(E|H)\))**: Given Adam’s personality sketch, his "quiet" nature, curiosity about nature, love for animals, and his intelligence might not align strongly with the typical traits of a Business Administration student. Let's assume \(P(E|H_{\text{business}})\) is relatively low, approximately \(0.05\).

3. **Complement (\(P(E|\neg H)\))**: The probabilities of having such personality traits given he is not in Business Administration might be higher due to a higher variety of fields, including those more aligned with natural sciences. Let's assume \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}}) = 0.15\).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.2}{0.05 \times 0.2 + 0.15 \times 0.8} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.12} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.13} \approx 0.077 \]

### For Computer Science:

1. **Prior Probability (\(P(H)\))**: Assume the likelihood of a graduate student being enrolled in Computer Science is moderately common in the U.S. Let's set \(P(H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.3\).

2. **Likelihood (\(P(E|H)\))**: Adam’s high intelligence, quiet nature, love for solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts are quite aligned with typical traits of a Computer Science student. Let's estimate \(P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.4\).

3. **Complement (\(P(E|\neg H)\))**: The probabilities of having these traits given he is not in Computer Science might still be significant, but potentially less so. Let's assume \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.2\).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.3}{0.4 \times 0.3 + 0.2 \times 0.7} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.14} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.26} \approx 0.462 \]

Thus, the computed probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.077,
  "computer science": 0.462
}
