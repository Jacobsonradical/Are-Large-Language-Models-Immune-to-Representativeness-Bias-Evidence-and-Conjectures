To compute the probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for the given fields of study (business administration and computer science) using Bayes' rule, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine \(P(H)\)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field.
2. **Determine \(P(E|H)\)**: The likelihood of Adam having his personality characteristics given each field.
3. **Determine \(P(E|\neg H)\)**: The likelihood of Adam having his personality characteristics given that he is not in each field.
4. **Apply Bayes' rule**: \[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of Adam having his personality characteristics. Since \( P(E) \) is common for all hypothesis comparisons, we can ignore it for relative comparisons.

### Hypothesis: Business Administration
1. **\(P(H)\)**: Let's assume \(P(H_{BA}) = 0.2\) (a priori likelihood).
2. **\(P(E|H_{BA})\)**: Business administration students might not typically be associated with strong empathy, deep love for animals, or curiosity about nature, so let's say it is 0.1.
3. **\(P(E|\neg H_{BA})\)**: For not being in business administration, it might be more likely for Adam to have such characteristics, perhaps 0.5.

### Hypothesis: Computer Science
1. **\(P(H)\)**: Let's assume \(P(H_{CS}) = 0.25\) (a priori likelihood).
2. **\(P(E|H_{CS})\)**: Computer science students might likely be associated with high intelligence and solving puzzles. They might also value abstract concepts, so let's say it is 0.6.
3. **\(P(E|\neg H_{CS})\)**: This would be lower than for computer science, let's estimate it as 0.3.

### Bayes' Rule Application
We need to compare the probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for each field:

\[
P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} 
\]
\[
= \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} 
\approx 0.02
\]

\[
P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} 
\]
\[
= \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.25}{P(E)} 
\approx 0.15
\]

Comparisons of these values:

\[
\frac{0.02}{P(E)}, \frac{0.15}{P(E)}
\]

Since \(P(E)\) is a common factor, our comparative results are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.15
}
```

This implies that based on Adam's personality sketch, he is more likely to be enrolled in computer science than business administration.
