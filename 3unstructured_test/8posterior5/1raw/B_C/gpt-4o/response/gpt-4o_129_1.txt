To calculate the probabilities, we can follow these steps:

1. **Define Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The prior probability is our initial estimate without considering the evidence. For simplicity, let's assume that initially, the probability of Adam being in any particular graduate field is the same.

2. **Define Evidence Probabilities \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: These are conditional probabilities. \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is enrolled in the specific field. \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is not enrolled in that specific field.

3. **Calculate Posterior Probability \( P(H|E) \)**: Using Bayes' Rule:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

For simplifying the process, we assume:
- \( P(H) \) is equal for both fields,
- \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant (same across different fields).

### Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(\text{CS}) \)**: Let's assume it's 1/2 for simplicity.

2. **Conditional Probabilities**:
   - \( P(E|\text{CS}) \): The personality traits suggest high intelligence and enjoyment in solving puzzlesâ€”traits common in computer science students. However, curiosity about nature and love for animals are not typically highlighted in computer science.
   - \( P(E|\neg \text{CS}) \): The traits align less clearly with other fields, hence can be considered low.

Let's assume:
- \( P(E|\text{CS}) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|\neg \text{CS}) = 0.1 \)

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \( P(\text{BA}) \)**: Let's assume it's 1/2 for simplicity.

2. **Conditional Probabilities**:
   - \( P(E|\text{BA}) \): The personality traits like empathy, love for animals, and nature curiosity are uncommon in business administration students.
   - \( P(E|\neg \text{BA}) \): Higher probability compared to business administration, as these traits align less clearly with this field.

Let's assume:
- \( P(E|\text{BA}) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|\neg \text{BA}) = 0.3 \)

Using Bayes' Rule, we compute:

\[
P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(E)}
\]
\[
P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.5}{(0.3 \cdot 0.5) + (0.1 \cdot 0.5)} = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.05} = \frac{0.15}{0.2} = 0.75
\]

\[
P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{BA}) \cdot P(\text{BA})}{P(E)}
\]
\[
P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.5}{(0.1 \cdot 0.5) + (0.3 \cdot 0.5)} = \frac{0.05}{0.05 + 0.15} = \frac{0.05}{0.2} = 0.25
\]

Finally, the results are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.25
}
```
