To calculate the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field based on the given profile of Adam, we need to estimate the following probabilities:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is *not* in that field.

Let's denote:
- \( H_1 \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( H_2 \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science.

### Business Administration
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H_1) \)**:
   - Graduate programs in business administration are popular but not as prevalent as some other fields.
   - Let's assume a prior \( P(H_1) = 0.1 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_1) \)**:
   - The personality traits of Adam (curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, love for animals) seem less aligned with typical traits for business administration students.
   - Let's assume this likelihood \( P(E|H_1) = 0.05 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_1) \)**:
   - The probability of having Adam's personality sketch among the fields excluding business administration.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_1) = 0.2 \).

4. **Bayesian Update \( P(H_1|E) \)**:
   \( P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E|\neg H_1) \cdot P(\neg H_1)} \)
   \( = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{0.05 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9} \)
   \( = \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.18} \)
   \( = \frac{0.005}{0.185} \)
   \( \approx 0.027 \).

### Computer Science
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H_2) \)**:
   - Computer science is a popular and growing field.
   - Let's assume a prior \( P(H_2) = 0.2 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_2) \)**:
   - Adam's traits (solving puzzles, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts) are quite suitable for a computer science student.
   - Let's assume this likelihood \( P(E|H_2) = 0.5 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_2) \)**:
   - The probability of having Adam's personality sketch among the fields excluding computer science.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_2) = 0.15 \).

4. **Bayesian Update \( P(H_2|E) \)**:
   \( P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) + P(E|\neg H_2) \cdot P(\neg H_2)} \)
   \( = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.5 \cdot 0.2 + 0.15 \cdot 0.8} \)
   \( = \frac{0.1}{0.1 + 0.12} \)
   \( = \frac{0.1}{0.22} \)
   \( \approx 0.455 \).

The probability values can now be presented for each field:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.027,
  "computer science": 0.455
}
```

These values suggest that, based on Adam's personality sketch, it is much more likely that he was enrolled in computer science than in business administration.
