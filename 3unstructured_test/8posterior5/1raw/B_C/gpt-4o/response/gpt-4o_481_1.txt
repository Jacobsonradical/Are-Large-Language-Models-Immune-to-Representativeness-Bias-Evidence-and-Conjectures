To solve this problem using Bayes rule, we'll first need to make reasonable assumptions about the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), and the conditional probabilities \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \). 

For each field, we denote:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in that field given the personality sketch \( E \), which we calculate using Bayes rule.

Bayes rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll apply this formula to each field. Note that \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields and can be considered as a normalization factor.

### Business Administration
Assume:
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability of a random U.S. graduate student being in business administration. Let's assume this is relatively common, say 0.1.
- \( P(E|H) \): Probability of Adam's characteristics given he is in business administration. Business students are less likely to have these exact personality traits and interests, so let's estimate this as 0.01.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of Adam's characteristics given he is not in business administration. Since these traits might be more common in other fields, let's estimate this as 0.05.

Now we can compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.01 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.001}{P(E)} \]

### Computer Science
Assume:
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability of a random U.S. graduate student being in computer science. This might also be relatively common, say 0.1.
- \( P(E|H) \): Probability of Adam's characteristics given he is in computer science. Computer science students are often good at solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts, so let's estimate this as 0.2.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of Adam's characteristics given he is not in computer science. As before, we'll use 0.05.

Now we can compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.02}{P(E)} \]

### Posterior Probabilities
Since we don't know \( P(E) \), we cannot provide exact values for \( P(H|E) \), but we can see the relative magnitudes.

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.001 \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.02 \]

Given that the posterior probability is directly proportional to the numerator when comparing different hypotheses, we can see that Computer Science is considerably more likely than Business Administration.

### Result
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.95
}
```

These values indicate that, based on the given personality sketch and our assumptions, it is far more likely that Adam is enrolled in Computer Science than Business Administration.
