To calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we're considering two fields (business administration and computer science), we need to estimate the necessary probabilities:

1. **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam is studying a particular field.
2. **P(E|H):** The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch corresponds to a student in that field.
3. **P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood that Adam’s personality sketch does not correspond to a student in that field.

### Assumptions:

- **P(H)** (for both fields) can be approximated based on general distribution of graduate students in different fields.
- **P(E|H)** measures how well Adam's personality fits into each field.
- **P(E|\neg H)** is more complex and requires estimating how common Adam’s personality traits are in other fields.

### Business Administration:

1. **P(H)**: Graduate students in business administration make up a significant but not overwhelming percentage of all graduate students. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \) (10%).

2. **P(E|H)**: The personality traits like curiosity about nature, love for animals, and quietness might not strongly align with business administration, although his intelligence and understanding of hard work fit better. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \) (20%).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: This should be relative to how typical Adam’s traits are across all other fields. Given these traits might be more common in other fields like life sciences, psychology, or environmental studies, we can estimate it to be higher. Let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \) (30%).

### Computer Science:

1. **P(H)**: Graduate students in computer science also form a significant portion of the graduate student population. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15%).

2. **P(E|H)**: His intelligence, abstract thinking capabilities, and affinity for puzzles strongly align with computer science. However, elements like love for nature are less typical. Let’s assume \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \) (40%).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Should be similar as above since Adam’s traits might align well with other science and engineering fields too. Let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \) (30%).

To find **\( P(E) \)**:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H). \]

We're focusing on relative probabilities, specific \( P(E) \) is not necessary as it’s the same for both fields.

### Bayes’ Rule Calculation:

For **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.02}{P(E)} \]

For **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} = \frac(0.06}{P(E)} \]

### Normalizing Values:

Since comparison in relative terms:
- Business Administration: 0.02
- Computer Science: 0.06

Normalizing to sum to 1 for these two choices:
\[ \text{Sum} = 0.02 + 0.06 = 0.08 \]

\[ \frac{0.02}{0.08} = 0.25 \]
\[ \frac{0.06}{0.08} = 0.75 \]

### Final Answer:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.25,
  "computer science": 0.75
}
```
