To apply Bayes' Rule and compute the probability \(P(H|E)\) for each field, we'll evaluate the prior probabilities \(P(H)\), the likelihood \(P(E|H)\), and the evidence \(P(E)\). Here, \(P(H)\) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field, \(P(E|H)\) is the probability of the personality sketch given that he was enrolled in that field, and \(P(E|\neg H)\) is the probability of the personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in that field.

For the calculations:

### Business Administration:
- **Prior Probability, \(P(H)\)**: Assume a general distribution of graduate students in various fields. Let's say the probability of a random student being enrolled in business administration is 0.2.
- **Likelihood, \(P(E|H)\)**: Business administration students are typically interested in leadership, management, and possibly economics. Given Adam's interests and personality, the likelihood is probably low. Let's estimate it at 0.05.
- **Complementary Likelihood, \(P(E|\neg H)\)**: Given that Adam has a warm heart, empathy, and love for nature and animals, these traits are more common among students in other fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology. Assume \(P(E|\neg H)\) is higher, at 0.3.

### Computer Science:
- **Prior Probability, \(P(H)\)**: Let's assume the probability of a random student being enrolled in computer science is 0.15.
- **Likelihood, \(P(E|H)\)**: Computer science students often have high intelligence and enjoy solving puzzles, which fits Adam well. Let's estimate this likelihood at 0.3.
- **Complementary Likelihood, \(P(E|\neg H)\)**: Since Adam's traits fit some fields more than others, this is akin to business administration's analysis but slightly adjusted up because the fields Adam could align with are fewer but similar in nature. Assume \(P(E|\neg H)\) is 0.25.

Now, using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \(P(E)\) is the same for both fields and we are comparing the probabilities, we can compare the numerators directly:

### Calculation for Business Administration:
\[ P(\text{H}_{\text{BA}}|E) \propto P(E|\text{H}_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(\text{H}_{\text{BA}}) \]
\[ P(\text{H}_{\text{BA}}|E) \propto 0.05 \times 0.2 = 0.01 \]

### Calculation for Computer Science:
\[ P(\text{H}_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto P(E|\text{H}_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(\text{H}_{\text{CS}}) \]
\[ P(\text{H}_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto 0.3 \times 0.15 = 0.045 \]

Normalizing these values for comparison:

\[
P(\text{H}_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.045} \approx 0.182 
\]
\[
P(\text{H}_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.01 + 0.045} \approx 0.818
\]

Therefore, the probabilities are:

\[
\{
  "business administration": 0.182,
  "computer science": 0.818
\}
\]
