To calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field (business administration and computer science) given Adam's personality sketch \( E \), we need to consider the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the marginal likelihoods \( P(E|\neg H) \).

### Let's break these down:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in a specific field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in that specific field.

### Calculating \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \):

- **Business Administration:**
  1. **P(H):** Likely lower since business administration fields often attract extroverts and individuals focused on human interactions and managerial skills.
  2. **P(E|H):** Lower since Adam's interests in nature, puzzles, animals, and abstract concepts align less with typical business administration traits.
  3. **P(E|\neg H):** Higher because Adam’s profile is more characteristic of fields outside business administration.

- **Computer Science:**
  1. **P(H):** High, given that computer science often attracts individuals with intelligence, an affinity for solving puzzles, and a quiet demeanor.
  2. **P(E|H):** High since Adam’s traits align well with those of a computer science student.
  3. **P(E|\neg H):** Lower since fewer fields align as closely with Adam's personality sketch.

### Making Rational Estimates:

- For **Business Administration:**
  - \( P(H) \): 0.1 (since MBA programs attract people with different characteristics)
  - \( P(E|H) \): 0.2 (since only some of Adam's traits might match)
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \): 0.8 (many other fields match Adam's traits better)

- For **Computer Science:**
  - \( P(H) \): 0.4 (since many intelligent people interested in puzzles and abstract thinking go into CS)
  - \( P(E|H) \): 0.7 (Adam's traits align well with a CS student)
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \): 0.3 (fewer fields match Adam's traits as closely)

### Applying Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) for each field isn't given, the answer will be for relative comparison. Let's assume \( P(E) \) to be the same for both fields for ease of interpretation.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

### Calculating the Posterior Probabilities:

- For **Business Administration:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = 0.02 \]

- For **Computer Science:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.4}{P(E)} = 0.28 \]

Since \( P(E) \) is considered the same for relative comparison:

### Final Results:

\[
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.28
}
\]

Note: The values reflect the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in each field relative to the provided traits. This analysis assumes simplistic priors and likelihoods for illustrative purposes.
