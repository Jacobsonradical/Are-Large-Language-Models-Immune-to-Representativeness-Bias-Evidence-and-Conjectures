To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the fields of Computer Science and Business Administration given Adam's personality sketch, we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field (before considering the sketch)
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in the field
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in the field
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \)

We'll use general assumptions for the values of \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \):

### For Computer Science:
- \( P(H) \): Assume the prior probability for enrolling in Computer Science is 0.2 (20%), as many students enroll in this field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Given his personality traits (curiosity, high intelligence, puzzle-solving), we assume a probability of 0.3 (30%) that such a person would choose Computer Science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Assume the probability of observing the personality sketch if Adam were not in Computer Science is 0.2 (20%).

### For Business Administration:
- \( P(H) \): Assume the prior probability for enrolling in Business Administration is 0.15 (15%), as it's a common but slightly less STEM-specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam’s traits don’t strongly align with typical Business Administration profiles (like leadership, strategic thinking in business contexts), we assume a lower probability, say 0.1 (10%).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Assume the probability of observing the personality sketch if Adam were not in Business Administration is 0.25 (25%).

The Bayes' theorem computations for each hypothesis are:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Normalizing is not necessary, as we are not required to sum up to 1.

### Calculations:

#### Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E)_{cs} \propto 0.3 \cdot 0.2 = 0.06 \]

#### Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E)_{ba} \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.15 = 0.015 \]

### Results:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.06,
  "business administration": 0.015
}
```

Thus, based on the given personality traits and assumed probabilities, Adam is more likely to be enrolled in Computer Science (0.06) than Business Administration (0.015).
