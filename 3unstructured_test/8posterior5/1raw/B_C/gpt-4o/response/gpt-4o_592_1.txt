To compute \( P(H|E) \), we'll use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant and we'll only be comparing the two fields, we can focus on the numerator:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

For simplicity, let's assume \( P(H) \) (the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field) is equally likely for each field due to the lack of additional information about prior distributions. We'll denote \( P(H) = \frac{1}{N} \) where \( N \) is the number of potential fields. As it is unspecified, we assume \( P(H) \) to be uniform.

Let's consider two fields: business administration and computer science. 

1. **Business Administration:**

Assuming:
- \( P(H) \) (prior probability) = 0.5 (since we are considering 2 fields and assuming equal likelihood).
- \( P(E|H) \) (likelihood of the evidence given the field):

  Adam’s traits like high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work, are favorable but empathy and love for animals do not strongly correlate. Adam's interest in nature and puzzles seem to better fit another field than business administration.

  Thus, let's assume \( P(E|H) \) for business administration might be relatively low, let's approximate it at 0.2.

2. **Computer Science:**

Assuming:
- \( P(H) \) (prior probability) = 0.5

  Now, considering Adam’s traits:
  - High intelligence and abstract thinking fit well.
  - Problem-solving (puzzles) is common in computer science.
  - Empathy, while less directly relevant, is found in collaborative fields like user experience and AI ethics.
  
  Thus \( P(E|H) \) for computer science seems notably better.

  Let's assume \( P(E|H) \) here might be higher, say 0.7.

Now calculate \( P(H|E) \):

For business administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \cdot 0.5 = 0.1 \]

For computer science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.7 \cdot 0.5 = 0.35 \]

Therefore, normalizing these (optional here since we want to compare):

\[ P(H=business\_administration|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.1+0.35} \approx 0.222 \]
\[ P(H=computer\_science|E) = \frac{0.35}{0.1+0.35} \approx 0.778 \]

Finally, in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": 0.222,
  "computer science": 0.778
