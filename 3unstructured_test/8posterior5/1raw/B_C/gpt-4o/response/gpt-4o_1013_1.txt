First, let's provide some intuitive and rough estimates for the probabilities involved:

### Business Administration (H1)
- **P(H1)**: The probability of randomly selecting a graduate student in business administration.
  - Let's assume this is moderately common among graduate students, so we might estimate this around 0.2.

- **P(E|H1)**: The probability of observing E (Adam's personality sketch) given that he is in business administration.
  - Given that business administration typically involves skills like management, finance, and negotiation, which may not be directly related to Adam's love for nature, animals, and abstract concepts, let's assign this a relatively low value, perhaps 0.05.

- **P(E|¬H1)**: The probability of observing E given that Adam is not in business administration.
  - Since Adam's interests and qualities seem more aligned with fields like the sciences or humanities, we should assign this a higher value than P(E|H1). Let's say this is 0.3.

### Computer Science (H2)
- **P(H2)**: The probability of randomly selecting a graduate student in computer science.
  - Computer science is a popular field for graduate students, so let's estimate this around 0.3.

- **P(E|H2)**: The probability of observing E given that Adam is in computer science.
  - Due to Adam's high intelligence, appreciation for abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving skills, this seems relatively high. We might assign this 0.6.

- **P(E|¬H2)**: The probability of observing E given that Adam is not in computer science.
  - Because Adam's interests seem aligned with several other fields like biology or environmental science, we should assign this a slight bit lower than P(E|H2), maybe around 0.4.

Now let's compute the posterior probabilities using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's assume that P(E), the probability of observing the personality sketch regardless of the field, is roughly the same for each field being considered, so we can ignore it for the relative comparison.

#### For Business Administration:
\[ P(H1|E) \propto P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1) \]
\[ P(H1|E) \propto 0.05 \cdot 0.2 = 0.01 \]

#### For Computer Science:
\[ P(H2|E) \propto P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2) \]
\[ P(H2|E) \propto 0.6 \cdot 0.3 = 0.18 \]

Since we do not need to normalize the probabilities to sum to 1, we proceed to give the final comparative values:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.01,
  "computer science": 0.18
}
```

These values suggest that, given Adam's personality sketch, he is much more likely to be enrolled in a computer science program than a business administration program.
