To estimate the probability \( P(H|E) \) given the personality sketch \( E \) provided for Adam, we need to utilize Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is constant for all hypotheses \( H \), we can compare the probabilities based on the numerators:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Let's break this down for each field:

### Computer Science
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of a graduate student being enrolled in computer science. Let's assume a relatively moderate value \( \approx 0.3 \) (as computer science is a popular field).
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam having the given personality if he is a computer science student. Given that computer science often involves solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, and assuming some interest in nature isn't contradictory, let's set this at \( \approx 0.6 \).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of Adam having the given personality if he is not a computer science student. Given that his interests and traits can fit in a variety of fields, let's set this at \( \approx 0.5 \).

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of a graduate student being enrolled in business administration. Let's assume this is lower \( \approx 0.2 \), as business administration students are fewer and the field is less STEM-oriented.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam having the given personality if he is a business administration student. Based on his traits, it seems less likely, as business requires more extroverted skills and less focus on puzzles and abstract concepts. Set this at \( \approx 0.2 \).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of Adam having the given personality if he is not a business administration student. Given his traits, this is relatively high \( \approx 0.6 \).

Using these in proportion:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) \propto 0.6 \times 0.3 = 0.18 \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(\text{BA}|E) \propto 0.2 \times 0.2 = 0.04 \]

Normalizing these values so that their sum equals 1 (for comparative purposes):

\[ \text{Normalization factor} = 0.18 + 0.04 = 0.22 \]

Then:

\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.18}{0.22} \approx 0.82 \]
\[ P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.22} \approx 0.18 \]

Thus:

{
  "computer science": "0.82",
  "business administration": "0.18"
}
