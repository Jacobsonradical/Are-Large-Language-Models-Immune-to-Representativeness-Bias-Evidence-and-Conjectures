To use Bayes' rule to compute the probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch, we need to define and estimate several probabilities for each field. Specifically, we need \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each hypothesized field of study \( H \).

Let's first estimate these probabilities for each field:

### Business Administration

- **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration. Without specific data, let’s assume a rough estimate that could be e.g., 20% of graduate students might be in this field.
  
  \( P(H)_{BA} \approx 0.2 \)
  
- **P(E|H):** The likelihood of Adam having the given personality traits if he is studying Business Administration. Given Adam's strong curiosity about nature and appreciation for hard work, but considering that these traits may not be as directly related to the field, let's assume a moderate estimate.
  
  \( P(E|H)_{BA} \approx 0.3 \)
  
- **P(E|¬H):** The likelihood of Adam having these traits if he is not studying Business Administration. Given the wide variety of fields of study, many of which could relate closely to nature and empathy (e.g., biology, psychology), let's assume a higher likelihood.
  
  \( P(E|\neg H)_{BA} \approx 0.6 \)

Using Bayes’ rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

\( P(E) \) can be computed as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(E)_{BA} = (0.3 \times 0.2) + (0.6 \times 0.8) = 0.06 + 0.48 = 0.54 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{0.54} \approx 0.111 \]

### Computer Science

- **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science. Let’s assume e.g., 30% of graduate students might be in this field.
  
  \( P(H)_{CS} \approx 0.3 \)
  
- **P(E|H):** The likelihood of Adam having the given personality traits if he is studying Computer Science. Given his interest in puzzles and high intelligence, this may be directly related to Computer Science.
  
  \( P(E|H)_{CS} \approx 0.6 \)
  
- **P(E|¬H):** The likelihood of Adam having these traits if he is not studying Computer Science. Given other fields, we may assume a moderate probability.
  
  \( P(E|\neg H)_{CS} \approx 0.5 \)

Using Bayes’ rule again:
\[ P(E)_{CS} = (0.6 \times 0.3) + (0.5 \times 0.7) = 0.18 + 0.35 = 0.53 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.6 \times 0.3}{0.53} \approx 0.34 \]

Putting it all together, we get:

{
  "business administration": 0.111,
  "computer science": 0.34
}
