To compute the probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for both fields using Bayes' rule, we need:

1. The prior probability \(P(H)\).
2. The likelihood \(P(E|H)\), which is the probability of observing E given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
3. The marginal probability \(P(E | \neg H)\), which is the probability of observing E given that Adam is not enrolled in that field.

Bayes' Rule is expressed as:
\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

Since \(P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)\), we can compute \(P(H|E)\) for each field.

### Business Administration

#### Prior Probability, \(P(H)\)
- This is generally low for someone who enjoys nature, solving puzzles, and has a deep love for animals. However, we don’t have precise values, so let’s assume a small value \(P(H) = 0.05\).

#### Likelihood, \(P(E|H)\)
- The personality traits described do not closely align with typical business administration traits. Thus, \(P(E|H)\) will be low. Let's assume \(P(E|H) = 0.02\).

#### Likelihood, \(P(E|\neg H)\)
- The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in business administration is relatively higher since his interests could align with many other fields. Let's assume \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.1\).

Now, we can compute:
\[P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)\]
\[P(E) = 0.02 \cdot 0.05 + 0.1 \cdot (1 - 0.05)\]
\[P(E) = 0.001 + 0.095 = 0.096\]

Using Bayes' rule:
\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.02 \cdot 0.05}{0.096} \]
\[P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.001}{0.096} \approx 0.0104\]

### Computer Science

#### Prior Probability, \(P(H)\)
- Given Adam’s strong abstract thinking, intelligence, and love for puzzles, it is higher for computer science. Let's assume \(P(H) = 0.3\).

#### Likelihood, \(P(E|H)\)
- The personality sketch fits better with traits often associated with computer science. Thus, \(P(E|H)\) is higher. Let's assume \(P(E|H) = 0.2\).

#### Likelihood, \(P(E|\neg H)\)
- The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in computer science reflects a range of fields, so let’s assume \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.1\).

Now, we can compute:
\[P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)\]
\[P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.3 + 0.1 \cdot (1 - 0.3)\]
\[P(E) = 0.06 + 0.07 = 0.13\]

Using Bayes' rule:
\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{0.13} \]
\[P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.06}{0.13} \approx 0.4615\]

### Final Results

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0104,
  "computer science": 0.4615
}
```

These values suggest that given Adam's personality sketch, he is significantly more likely to be enrolled in computer science than in business administration.
