To calculate the probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we'll rely on the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we are focusing on two specific fields, we will compute relative probabilities and not absolute probabilities. This means we'll be comparing the relative likelihood of Adam being enrolled in each field based on his personality sketch.

Based on the personality sketch:
- Adam exhibits traits such as curiosity about nature, empathy, a love for animals, high intelligence, and an understanding of hard work.

Let's proceed with the estimations:

### Computer Science
- **P(H)**: The general probability of being enrolled in computer science as a graduate field may be considered moderate because it's a common graduate field in the U.S.
- **P(E|H)**: Based on Adam's traits, it's somewhat less likely for him to be in computer science since the field generally aligns more with individuals who have a deep interest in technology and algorithmic problem solving, rather than empathy and nature.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that Adam has his traits (E) and is not in computer science (H), considering other fields that might suit his traits better.

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: The general probability of being enrolled in business administration may also be moderate because it's a common graduate field in the U.S.
- **P(E|H)**: Based on Adam's traits, it is less likely for him to be in business administration because this field generally emphasizes leadership, management, and sometimes aggressive competitive traits, which do not align well with his warm heart and love for animals.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that Adam has his traits (E) and is not in business administration (H), considering other fields that might suit his traits better.

Given these considerations:

{
  "computer science": 0.25,
  "business administration": 0.10
}

These values reflect the relative likelihood of Adam being enrolled in computer science or business administration, based on his personality sketch and the common traits associated with each field.
