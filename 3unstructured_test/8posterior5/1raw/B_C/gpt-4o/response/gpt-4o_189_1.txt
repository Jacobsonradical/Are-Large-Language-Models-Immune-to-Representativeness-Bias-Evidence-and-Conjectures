Sure, let's analyze each field based on the provided information.

### 1. Business Administration

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration. Let's assume a somewhat moderate prior as business administration is a common graduate field but not uniquely suited to Adam's interests and personality described. Let's say P(H) = 0.15.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing E given H that Adam is enrolled in business administration. Adam's traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and intelligence in abstract concepts) do not strongly align with typical skills or interests emphasized in business administration. Let's estimate P(E|H) = 0.1.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing E given Adam is not enrolled in business administration. This will include all other fields. Given his strong match with fields like biology, environmental science, psychology, etc., we can reasonably set this higher. Let's set P(E|\neg H) = 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Substitute the values:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{0.1 \cdot 0.15 + 0.3 \cdot 0.85} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.015}{0.015 + 0.255} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.015}{0.27} \approx 0.056 \]

### 2. Computer Science

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science. Given that computer science is quite a popular field and his interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence could align well with it, let's say P(H) = 0.2.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing E given H that Adam is enrolled in computer science. Some of Adam's described personality traits (high intelligence, good at abstract concepts, solving puzzles) align with the skills needed for computer science, although others do not (love for nature, animals). Let's estimate P(E|H) = 0.3.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing E given Adam is not enrolled in computer science. Taking into account other more aligned fields like biology, psychology, and environmental science, let's set P(E|\neg H) = 0.25.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Substitute the values:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.25 \cdot 0.8} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.20} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.26} \approx 0.231 \]

Now let's present the results in the specified format:

  "business administration": 0.056,
  "computer science": 0.231
