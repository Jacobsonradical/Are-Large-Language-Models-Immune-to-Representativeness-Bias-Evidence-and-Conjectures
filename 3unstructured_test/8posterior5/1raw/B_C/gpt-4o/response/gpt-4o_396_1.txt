To estimate \(P(H|E)\) for the fields "computer science" and "business administration," we need to make some reasonable assumptions and judgments based on the personality sketch of Adam.

**1. Computer Science**

**Assumptions**:
- \(P(H)\): The prior probability of someone being a graduate student in computer science. Let's assume it to be 0.15 (15%) based on general enrollment statistics in the U.S.
- \(P(E|H)\): The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is a computer science student. Considering Adam's abstract thinking ability and problem-solving skills, let's assume it to be relatively high, say 0.7 (70%).
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not a computer science student. Given that these traits can be found in other fields as well, let's assume it to be moderately high, say 0.5 (50%).

**Bayes Rule Calculation**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since the exact value of \(P(E)\) (the overall probability of the personality sketch) is not known, we can express it in terms of other probabilities and normalize it later.

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.15) + (0.5 \cdot 0.85) = 0.105 + 0.425 = 0.53 \]

So,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.15}{0.53} = \frac{0.105}{0.53} \approx 0.198 \]

**2. Business Administration**

**Assumptions**:
- \(P(H)\): The prior probability of someone being a graduate student in business administration. Let's assume it to be 0.15 (15%) based on general enrollment statistics in the U.S.
- \(P(E|H)\): The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is a business administration student. Given the empathy and appreciation for hard work, but a possible lower match for his nature curiosity and abstract thinking, let's assume it to be moderate, say 0.4 (40%).
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): Assume this to be the same as above, 0.5 (50%).

**Bayes Rule Calculation**:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.4 \cdot 0.15) + (0.5 \cdot 0.85) = 0.06 + 0.425 = 0.485 \]

So,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.15}{0.485} = \frac{0.06}{0.485} \approx 0.124 \]

**Final Answers**:
