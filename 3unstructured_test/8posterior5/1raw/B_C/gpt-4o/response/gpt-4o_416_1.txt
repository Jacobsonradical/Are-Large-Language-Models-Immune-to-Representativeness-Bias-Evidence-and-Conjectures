To compute the probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for Adam being enrolled in business administration or computer science given his personality sketch \(E\), we'll use Bayes' Rule. Bayes' Rule is given by:

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

We'll need the following probabilities:
1. \(P(H)\) - The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field (business administration or computer science).
2. \(P(E|H)\) - The likelihood of Adam having personality sketch \(E\) given enrollment in each field.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\) - The likelihood of Adam having personality sketch \(E\) given that he is not enrolled in the specific field.

Given the personality sketch \(E\), let's judge the relevant probabilities:

### Business Administration:
1. **P(H) (Prior probability):** The probability of any random graduate student being enrolled in business administration. Let's suppose a broad estimate: \(P(H) = 0.15\).
  
2. **P(E|H) (Likelihood):** How likely is Adam to have his described personality if he was a business administration student? Given his interests and traits, which align more with fields like biology, environmental sciences, or psychology, this likelihood is relatively low:
   \[P(E|H) \approx 0.1\]

3. **P(E|\neg H) (Complement likelihood):** The likelihood of Adam having personality sketch \(E\) if he is **not** enrolled in business administration. This needs to capture how common Adam's personality is overall among students not in business administration. Since business administration doesn't directly relate to his personality type:
   \[P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3\]

### Computer Science:
1. **P(H) (Prior probability):** The probability of any random graduate student being enrolled in computer science. Let's estimate: \(P(H) = 0.3\).
  
2. **P(E|H) (Likelihood):** How likely is Adam to have his described personality if he was a computer science student? The problem-solving aspect might align well with his traits:
   \[P(E|H) \approx 0.3\]

3. **P(E|\neg H) (Complement likelihood):** The likelihood of Adam having personality sketch \(E\) if he is **not** enrolled in computer science. Given that his personality fits various fields:
   \[P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3\]

Now, using Bayesâ€™ rule for posterior probabilities \(P(H|E)\):

1. **Business Administration:**
\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)}\]

2. **Computer Science:**
\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)}\]

While we don't directly calculate \(P(E)\), it remains constant across the calculations. 

We should compare relative probabilities without necessarily normalizing them because they are only two out of many fields.

Given rough calculations:

**Business Administration**:
\[P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.015}{P(E)}\]

**Computer Science**:
\[P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.09}{P(E)}\]

To provide a simple ratio estimate:

{
  "business administration": 0.015,
  "computer science": 0.09
}

These results proportionally reflect that Adam's personality sketch fits better with computer science than business administration.
