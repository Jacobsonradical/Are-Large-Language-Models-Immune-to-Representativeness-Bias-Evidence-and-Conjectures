Let's compute the probabilities using Bayes' rule. Recall that Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We will estimate the values and reasoning for each field.

1. **Business Administration**

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that any graduate student is in business administration. Let's assume P(H) is around \(0.1\) (10%), as business administration is a common graduate program but not overwhelmingly so.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is in business administration. Considering that Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work don't necessarily align with business administration, let's assume P(E|H) is relatively low, say \(0.2\) (20%).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in business administration. Given the many other fields better suited to his personality, P(E|\neg H) may be relatively high, say \(0.8\) (80%).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \]

For the purposes of comparison:

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.02 \]

2. **Computer Science**

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that any graduate student is in computer science. Let's assume P(H) is around \(0.15\) (15%), as computer science is a popular graduate program.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is in computer science. Considering that Adam enjoys solving puzzles, is of high intelligence, and understands abstract concepts, P(E|H) is relatively high, say \(0.7\) (70%).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in computer science. Given there are many fields that might also suit his personality, P(E|\neg H) could again be relatively high, say \(0.8\) (80%).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.15}{P(E)} \]

For the purposes of comparison:

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.105 \]

Based on these calculations, here are the normalized approximate probabilities for each field:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.105
}
```

It's clear that, based on the personality sketch and assumptions made, Adam is more likely to have been enrolled in computer science than business administration.
