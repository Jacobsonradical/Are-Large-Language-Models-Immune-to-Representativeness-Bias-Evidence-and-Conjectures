To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Rule, we start with the following:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( H \) is the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in that particular field.
- \( E \) is the personality sketch of Adam.
- \( \neg H \) is the hypothesis that Adam was not enrolled in that field.

Let's break down the calculations for each field:

1. **Computer Science**

   - \( P(H) \): Let's assume the proportion of graduate students enrolled in computer science fields is moderate, say 0.15 (15%).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's personality sketch (enjoys puzzles, high intelligence, abstract concepts), it seems likely he could be in computer science. We'll estimate this probability to be quite high, say 0.7.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Assuming he was not in computer science, other fields might still fit his profile moderately well. Assume 0.2 as a rough average across other fields.

2. **Business Administration**

   - \( P(H) \): The proportion of graduate students enrolled in business administration might also be moderate, say 0.1 (10%).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's profile, it appears less likely he fits the typical business administration profile. We'll estimate this at 0.2.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Assuming he was not in business administration, other fields might fit his profile better. Let's assume the average likelihood here to be similar, or about 0.3.

Now, we use these values to calculate \( P(H|E) \):

### Computer Science:
\[ P(H) = 0.15 \]
\[ P(E|H) = 0.7 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Assuming \( P(E) \approx P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \):

\[
P(E) \approx (0.7 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.105 + 0.17 = 0.275
\]

Thus:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.15}{0.275} \approx 0.382
\]

### Business Administration:
\[ P(H) = 0.1 \]
\[ P(E|H) = 0.2 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Assuming \( P(E) \approx P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \):

\[
P(E) \approx (0.2 \times 0.1) + (0.3 \times 0.9) = 0.02 + 0.27 = 0.29
\]

Thus:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{0.29} \approx 0.069
\]

So, our final estimates are:

{
  "computer science": 0.382,
  "business administration": 0.069
}
