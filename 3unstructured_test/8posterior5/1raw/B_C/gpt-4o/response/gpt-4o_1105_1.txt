To address the problem, we need to evaluate the prior probabilities \(P(H)\), likelihoods \(P(E|H)\), and the complement likelihoods \(P(E|\neg H)\) for each field. Then we will calculate the posterior probabilities \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' theorem.

### Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**:
    - Assuming that graduate students are evenly distributed among various fields and that Computer Science is a popular field, let’s assume \(P(H_{\text{CS}})\) is moderate. Suppose it's 0.1.

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**:
    - The personality traits described do not strongly match the stereotypical interests for Computer Science, but he has high intelligence and enjoys solving puzzles, which are traits often found in this field. Let's assume \(P(E|H_{\text{CS}})\) is 0.3.

3. **Complement Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)**:
    - Considering the proportion of all the fields except Computer Science and how his traits might fit into those, assume \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}})\) is 0.2.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}})P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \]

Given:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx \frac{0.3 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \]

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**:
    - Business Administration is also a common graduate field, though perhaps less aligned with the subject's interests and personality. Suppose \(P(H_{\text{BA}})\) is 0.08.

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**:
    - The attributes described (warm heart, empathy, curiosity about nature) are not typical of Business Administration students. Let’s assume \(P(E|H_{\text{BA}})\) is 0.05.

3. **Complement Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)**:
    - For other fields besides Business Administration, assume the likelihood is similar to the previous calculation, \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}})\). Suppose it is 0.2 as well.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}})P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \]

Given:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \approx \frac{0.05 \times 0.08}{P(E)} \]

### Relative Posterior Probabilities

Since \(P(E)\) is the same for both fields, we can compare the numerators directly:

- \[ \text{Computer Science: } P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto 0.3 \times 0.1 = 0.03 \]
- \[ \text{Business Administration: } P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \propto 0.05 \times 0.08 = 0.004 \]

We normalize these relative posterior probabilities (approximately):

- \[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.004} \approx 0.88 \]
- \[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \approx \frac{0.004}{0.03 + 0.004} \approx 0.12 \]

Final answer:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.88,
  "business administration": 0.12
}
