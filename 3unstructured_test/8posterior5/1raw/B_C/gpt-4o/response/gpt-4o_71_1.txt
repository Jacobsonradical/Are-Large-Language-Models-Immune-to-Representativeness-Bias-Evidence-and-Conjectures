To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each of the given fields (computer science and business administration) using Bayes' rule, we need to assign values to \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Here's a step-by-step process for both fields:

**For Computer Science:**
1. **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. We might initially assume a uniform distribution over all possible fields of study, but computer science is a relatively popular field for graduate students, so let's say \( P(H) = 0.2 \) (20%).
2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given he was enrolled in computer science. Given Adam’s traits like high intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and appreciation for hard work, these might be slightly more common in computer science students. However, not all traits perfectly align (e.g., love for animals and nature). Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).
3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given he was not enrolled in computer science. This is the combined probability across all other fields. Given the diversity of other fields, let's set \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \) (assuming his traits are less likely overall outside computer science).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.2) + (0.1 \cdot 0.8) = 0.06 + 0.08 = 0.14 \]

So,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.14} = \frac{0.06}{0.14} \approx 0.4286 \]

**For Business Administration:**
1. **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Let's assume this is a less common field among graduate students relative to some others. Let's set \( P(H) = 0.1 \) (10%).
2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given he was enrolled in business administration. Business administration students might also value empathy, intelligence, and dedication, but Adam’s particular mix of traits doesn't strongly suggest business administration. Let’s estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: As before, the combined probability across all other fields. Assuming the same \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \) as above.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.1) + (0.1 \cdot 0.9) = 0.01 + 0.09 = 0.1 \]

So,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.1} = \frac{0.01}{0.1} = 0.1 \]

Therefore, the posterior probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": 0.4286,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
