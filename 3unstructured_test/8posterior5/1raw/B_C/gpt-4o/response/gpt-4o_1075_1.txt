To estimate the probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study, we can use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here's the general breakdown for each piece of the equation:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability that the personality sketch \( E \) would be observed if Adam were enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability that the personality sketch \( E \) would be observed if Adam were not enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \): The overall probability of the personality sketch \( E \).

### Hypothesis: Computer Science

1. **\( P(H) \)**: Assume some reasonable prior, e.g., 0.2 for computer science, as it is a popular field but not the majority.
2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: Considering Adam's characteristics, some relate well to computer science (high intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts). He doesn't fit the stereotype fully (e.g., strong empathy). Estimate around 0.4.
3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is the probability of Adamâ€™s personality sketch across all other fields. Given the traits are somewhat common in various fields, estimate around 0.2.
4. **\( P(E) \)**: Can be approximated from known values: \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H)) \). Estimate around 0.2.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.2}{0.2} = 0.4 \]

### Hypothesis: Business Administration

1. **\( P(H) \)**: Assume a reasonable prior, e.g., 0.1 for business administration.
2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: Characteristics like empathy and strong appreciation for hard work align with this field. Estimate around 0.3.
3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Based on the same reasoning as above. Estimate around 0.2.
4. **\( P(E) \)**: Using the prior computation, still reasonable to estimate around 0.2.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.1}{0.2} = 0.15 \]

So, the final values in the requested format are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.15 
}
