To estimate the probabilities, we can use the following variables:

- P(H_c): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science.
- P(H_b): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration.
- P(E|H_c): The likelihood of observing Adam's traits given he is a Computer Science student.
- P(E|H_b): The likelihood of observing Adam's traits given he is a Business Administration student.
- P(E|~H_c) and P(E|~H_b): The likelihood of observing Adam's traits given he's not in Computer Science or Business Administration respectively.
- P(H_c|E): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science given his traits.
- P(H_b|E): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration given his traits.

We will assume the prior probabilities P(H_c) and P(H_b) are 0.3 (30%) each, which is somewhat standard for graduate enrollment in broad fields. We will estimate the likelihoods based on the personality traits provided:

- P(E|H_c): Computer Science students often have characteristics of high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts. However, strong empathy and a deep love for animals may not be as common. I'm estimating this at around 0.6.
- P(E|H_b): Business Administration students might less frequently exhibit traits like solving puzzles and having a deep love for nature and animals. I estimate this at around 0.2.
- P(E|~H_c) and P(E|~H_b): Since Adam's traits are somewhat unique and may not fit well into either field, these values will be similar for both subfields.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Since we're mainly interested in relative comparisons, we can ignore the denominator P(E) as it's a normalizing constant just used to ensure probabilities sum to 1.

Let's compute the posterior probabilities:
\[ P(H_c|E) = \frac{P(E|H_c) \cdot P(H_c)}{P(E|H_c) \cdot P(H_c) + P(E|~H_c) \cdot P(~H_c)} \]
\[ P(H_b|E) = \frac{P(E|H_b) \cdot P(H_b)}{P(E|H_b) \cdot P(H_b) + P(E|~H_b) \cdot P(~H_b)} \]

Using the values:
\[ P(H_c|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.3}{0.6 \cdot 0.3 + (1-0.6) \cdot (1-0.3)} = \frac{0.18}{0.18 + 0.28} = \frac{0.18}{0.46} \approx 0.39 \]
\[ P(H_b|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{0.2 \cdot 0.3 + (1-0.2) \cdot (1-0.3)} = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.56} = \frac{0.06}{0.62} \approx 0.097 \]

Putting these into the requested format:
{
  "computer science": 0.39,
  "business administration": 0.097
}
