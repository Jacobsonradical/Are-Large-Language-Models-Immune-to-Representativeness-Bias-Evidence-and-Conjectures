To compute the probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for each field using Bayes' rule, I'll first need to estimate the following probabilities for **computer science** and **business administration**:

1. \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
2. \(P(E|H)\): The probability of the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.

### Assessing Computer Science
1. **\(P(H)\)**: Given that a significant number of graduate students in the U.S. are enrolled in computer science, I will assign this a moderately high prior probability, say \(P(H) = 0.2\).
2. **\(P(E|H)\)**: For computer science, Adam's intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts fit well, but his strong empathy, warm heart, and deep love for animals may not align as explicitly with this field. I will estimate it at \(P(E|H) = 0.4\).
3. **\(P(E|\neg H)\)**: This will depend on other fields, but given Adam's interests, I'll estimate \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.2\).

### Assessing Business Administration
1. **\(P(H)\)**: Business administration is another commonly chosen field among graduate students. I'll assign it a moderate prior probability, say \(P(H) = 0.1\).
2. **\(P(E|H)\)**: Adam’s intelligence and understanding of hard work and dedication might fit this field, but other elements like his love for nature and animals are less relevant. I will estimate it at \(P(E|H) = 0.2\).
3. **\(P(E|\neg H)\)**: As we have already assessed, this will be roughly the same as for computer science, so I'll keep \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.2\).

Using Bayes' rule to compute \(P(H|E)\):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

where \(P(E)\) can be computed as:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

Let’s calculate \(P(H|E)\) for each field.

### For Computer Science:
\[
P(E) = (0.4 \cdot 0.2) + (0.2 \cdot 0.8) = 0.08 + 0.16 = 0.24
\]

\[
P(H|E)_{cs} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.24} = \frac{0.08}{0.24} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.333
\]

### For Business Administration:
\[
P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) = 0.02 + 0.18 = 0.20
\]

\[
P(H|E)_{ba} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.20} = \frac{0.02}{0.20} = 0.1
\]

Finally, summarizing the posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.333,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These posterior probabilities reflect how likely it is that Adam was enrolled in each respective field, given the personality sketch \(E\).
