To approach this problem, we need to apply Bayes' Rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the lack of specific numerical values, we will need to make reasonable qualitative assumptions about the probabilities involved based on the provided personality sketch.

### Analysis

**P(H): Prior Probability**
- This is the initial probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field, without any additional information.
- We assume that P(H) for both fields, business administration and computer science, is relatively similar because both are popular graduate fields.

**P(E|H): Likelihood**
- This represents the probability of Adam having the described personality traits given that he is enrolled in a specific field.
  - Business Administration: Typically involves leadership, management skills, financial acumen, and understanding of business operations. Adam's strong empathy and appreciation for hard work might align, but nature curiosity and love for animals might not be strongly aligned.
  - Computer Science: This field often involves solving puzzles, understanding abstract concepts, and high intelligence, which align well with Adam's traits. However, the deep love for animals and nature isn't a strong indicator for this field.

**P(E|\neg H): Probability of Evidence Given Not H**
- This represents the probability of Adam having the described personality traits if he is not enrolled in the specific field.
  - Assume a moderate level for both fields, recognizing that such traits might be general among many fields.

For practical purposes, we'll make reasonable qualitative estimates to illustrate the point.

### Probabilities ESTIMATES

Let:
- **P(H_b)** = Prior Probability for Business Administration = 0.2 (Assume given the popularity of the field)
- **P(E|H_b)** = Likelihood for Business Administration = 0.1
- **P(E|\neg H_b)** = 0.2 (Since other fields might also have people like Adam)

- **P(H_cs)** = Prior Probability for Computer Science = 0.2 (Similar popularity)
- **P(E|H_cs)** = Likelihood for Computer Science = 0.3 (Better alignment)
- **P(E|\neg H_cs)** = 0.2

We will assume that P(E), the marginal probability of the evidence, normalizes our estimates.

### Bayesian Calculation

For **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H_b|E) = \frac{P(E|H_b) \cdot P(H_b)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]
Given P(E) is a normalizing constant, the numerator is 0.02.

For **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H_cs|E) = \frac{P(E|H_cs) \cdot P(H_cs)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]
Given P(E) is a normalizing constant, the numerator is 0.06.

### Result Compilation

Given the ratios, we focus on the relative likelihood:
- Business Administration: 0.02
- Computer Science: 0.06

Given the normalization constant \(P(E)\) is the same, it affects both equally. Thus, on a comparative scale:

{
  "business administration": "0.025",
  "computer science": "0.075"
}

This ratio highlights that Adam is more likely to have been enrolled in Computer Science than in Business Administration based on the given personality traits.
