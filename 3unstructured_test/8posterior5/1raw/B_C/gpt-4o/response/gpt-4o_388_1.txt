To calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study, we will use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields, we can simplify our calculations by comparing \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \). Let's break it down for each hypothesis:

1. **Computer Science**

- **P(H)**: Assume the probability of a graduate student being in computer science without additional information, say 0.3 (a reasonable prior considering the popularity of the field).

- **P(E|H)**: Considering Adam’s personality traits and interests, the likelihood he is enrolled in computer science:

  - Curiosity about nature: Neutral/slightly negative
  - Enjoys solving puzzles: High
  - Strong empathy and love for animals: Neutral
  - High intelligence: Positive
  - Understanding abstract concepts: Positive
  - Appreciation for hard work: Neutral/Positive

Given this information, we can set \( P(E|H) \) relatively high, but considering some neutral fits, we might assign it 0.5.

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of having those traits if not in computer science could be averaged around 0.2 since many fields can encompass such broad traits.

Thus:
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}) \propto 0.5 \times 0.3 = 0.15 \]

2. **Business Administration**

- **P(H)**: Assume the probability of a graduate student being in business administration without additional information, say 0.2 (a bit lower than computer science).

- **P(E|H)**: Considering Adam’s personality traits and interests, the likelihood he is enrolled in business administration:

  - Curiosity about nature: Neutral
  - Enjoys solving puzzles: Neutral
  - Strong empathy and love for animals: Neutral/Positive
  - High intelligence: Positive
  - Understanding abstract concepts: Positive
  - Appreciation for hard work: Positive

Given this information, we might set \( P(E|H) \) relatively moderate, perhaps assigning it 0.4.

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of having those traits if not in business administration, should also be averaged around 0.2.

Thus:
\[ P(\text{Business Administration}) \propto 0.4 \times 0.2 = 0.08 \]

Summarizing our proportional likelihoods:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.15,
  "business administration": 0.08
}
```

These values indicate that based on Adam's personality sketch and his interests, it is more likely he is enrolled in computer science than in business administration, but remember these probability values are for comparison and relative likelihoods.
