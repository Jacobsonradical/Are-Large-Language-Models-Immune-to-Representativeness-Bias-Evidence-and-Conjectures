Let's analyze the given fields and fill in the corresponding probabilities for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). We will then use Bayes' Rule to compute \( P(H|E) \) for those fields.

### Assumptions & Estimations
1. **Prior Probability \(( P(H) )\)**:
   - For graduate students in general, let's denote generic prior probabilities for being in the fields of business administration and computer science. These are assumptions and can be refined based on actual data.
   - \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.2 \)
   - \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.15 \)

2. **Likelihoods \(( P(E|H) )\)**:
   - Let's evaluate how likely Adam's personality sketch fits with students in those fields:
     - Business Administration:
       - Curiosity about nature and love for animals might not highly correlate with this field.
       - Empathy and understanding hard work could fit.
       - Estimated \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.3 \)
     - Computer Science:
       - Solving puzzles and high intelligence in abstract concepts align well.
       - Nature curiosity and empathy might not strongly correlate.
       - Estimated \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.5 \)

3. **Likelihood of the Evidence not in those Fields \(( P(E|\neg H) )\)**:
   - This represents the likelihood of Adam's personality across all other fields not considered.
     - Given more fields generally fit different traits, we assume reasonable balancing.
     - Estimated \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.4 \)
     - Estimated \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.5 \)

### Bayes' Rule Application:
Bayes' Rule: \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \)

Given \( P(E) \) can be computed using total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) P(H) + P(E|\neg H) P(\neg H) \]

#### For Business Administration:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.4 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(\neg H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.8 \)

\[ P(E) = (0.3 \times 0.2) + (0.4 \times 0.8) = 0.06 + 0.32 = 0.38 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{0.38} \approx 0.158 \]

#### For Computer Science:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.85 \)

\[ P(E) = (0.5 \times 0.15) + (0.5 \times 0.85) = 0.075 + 0.425 = 0.5 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{0.5 \times 0.15}{0.5} = 0.15 \]
