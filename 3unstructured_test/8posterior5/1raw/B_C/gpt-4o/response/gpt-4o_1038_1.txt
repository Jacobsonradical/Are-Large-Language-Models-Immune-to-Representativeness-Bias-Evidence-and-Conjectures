To calculate the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch, we will use Bayes' theorem which is stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \).

Let's consider each field one by one:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H_{CS}) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science. Let's assume this is moderate, say 0.2.
   - \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): The likelihood of having Adam's personality if he is enrolled in computer science. Considering the personality sketch mentions curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts, this is fairly likely. Let's assume 0.6.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \): The likelihood of having Adam's personality if he is not enrolled in computer science. Since many fields can also explain this personality set, let's assume a moderate value, e.g., 0.3.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H_{BA}) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration. Given the absence of personality traits typically aligned with business administration in the sketch, let's assume a lower value, say 0.1.
   - \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): The likelihood of having Adam's personality if he is enrolled in business administration. This seems less likely as the traits don't strongly correlate with business administration. Let's assume 0.2.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \): Again, let's assume the likelihood of observing the personality sketch if Adam is not in business administration, giving a moderate value, say 0.4.

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field.

### For Computer Science:

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.6 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]

### For Business Administration:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \]

### Normalizing by Total Probability \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Simplifying for ease (as we do not have all other fields perfectly defined, the terms are normalized in proportions):
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \approx \frac{0.6 \times 0.2}{0.6 \times 0.2 + 0.2 \times 0.1} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{0.6 \times 0.2 + 0.2 \times 0.1} \]

Normalized:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \approx \frac{0.12}{0.14} \approx 0.86 \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx \frac{0.02}{0.14} \approx 0.14 \]

Thus, the final normalized probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.86,
  "business administration": 0.14
}
```
