To compute the probabilities, we are going to use Bayes' Theorem, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we'll need to estimate some of the probabilities. Please note that these will be rough estimates.

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being in a given field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam is in field \(H\).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam is not in field \(H\).

P(E) can be considered as a normalizing constant, given by:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

However, because we don't have the specific values for each of these, we can make rough estimates and still compare probabilities relatively.

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of a graduate student being in business administration. Let's estimate this as \(0.2\).
2. **P(E|H)**: How likely is Adam's personality sketch given he's in business administration? Given the nature of the field, a student with strong empathy and understanding for hard work could fit. Let's estimate this as \(0.1\).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability of Adam's personality if he's not in business administration. Since personality traits like empathy and problem-solving can be common across other fields, let's estimate this as \(0.5\).

So,

\[
P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.02}{0.42} \approx 0.048
\]

### Computer Science

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of a graduate student being in computer science. Let's estimate this as \(0.3\).
2. **P(E|H)**: How likely is Adam's personality sketch given he's in computer science? High intelligence, problem-solving, and abstract thinking fit well here. Let's estimate this as \(0.6\).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability of Adam's personality if he's not in computer science. Given the traits listed still fit many other fields, let's estimate it to be around \(0.3\).

So,

\[
P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.3}{0.6 \cdot 0.3 + 0.3 \cdot 0.7} = \frac{0.18}{0.18 + 0.21} = \frac{0.18}{0.39} \approx 0.462
\]

Therefore, the relative probabilities that Adam is enrolled in the given fields based on his personality sketch are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.048,
  "computer science": 0.462
}
```

These are approximate values, and adjusting them based on more precise data would yield different results.
