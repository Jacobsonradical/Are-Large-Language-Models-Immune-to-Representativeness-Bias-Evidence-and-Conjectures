To solve this problem using Bayes' theorem, we need to utilize the following formula:

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

where:
- \(P(H|E)\) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specified field given his personality sketch.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in the specified field.
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specified field.
- \(P(E)\) is the overall probability of the personality sketch.

Considering the provided fields, let's analyze:

### For Business Administration:

- **P(H)**: This denotes the prior probability that Adam enrolled in Business Administration. Since graduate students are spread across many fields, assume a common reasonable starting point of \(0.1\) for any specific field.
- **P(E|H)**: Considering the personality traits like love for nature, animals, and puzzles, Business Administration might not align with his traits as well as other fields might. Let's estimate this at \(0.05\).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch if he was not in Business Administration. Given a vast array of other fields might better match these traits, let's estimate \(0.2\).

Let's calculate \(P(H|E)\):

\[P(H|E)_{business\ administration} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.05 \times 0.1}{P(E)}\]

Since P(E) is a normalizing constant, it will be the same for both fields when we compare them.

### For Computer Science:

- **P(H)**: Assume the same prior probability (\(0.1\)) for consistency.
- **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's traits of solving puzzles, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and empathy, Computer Science fits well. Estimate this as \(0.7\).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Like before but considering he's not in Computer Science, remains at \(0.2\).

Let's calculate \(P(H|E)\):

\[P(H|E)_{computer\ science} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \times 0.1}{P(E)}\]

### Calculation and Normalization:

Since we're comparing the relative probabilities, the normalizing constant \(P(E)\) in our comparisons can be factored out:

\[
\begin{align*}
P_{\text{business administration}} & = 0.05 \cdot 0.1 = 0.005, \\
P_{\text{computer science}} & = 0.7 \cdot 0.1 = 0.07.
\end{align*}
\]

The ratio of the probabilities is what matters for comparing the fields:

- Normalize these two values:

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Sum} &= 0.005 + 0.07 = 0.075, \\
P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} & = \frac{0.005}{0.075} \approx 0.0667, \\
P(H|E)_{\text{computer science}} & = \frac{0.07}{0.075} \approx 0.9333.
\end{align*}
\]

### Final Answer:

\{
  "business administration": 0.0667,
  "computer science": 0.9333
\}

This indicates Adam is much more likely to have been enrolled in Computer Science given his personality sketch.
