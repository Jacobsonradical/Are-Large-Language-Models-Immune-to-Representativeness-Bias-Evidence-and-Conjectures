To answer this question, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Bayes' theorem is defined as follows:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(H|E)\) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \(H\) given evidence \(E\).
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of evidence \(E\) given hypothesis \(H\).
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of hypothesis \(H\).
- \(P(E)\) is the total probability of evidence \(E\).

Given that \(P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)\)

For simplicity, let's assume:

1. Adam could be equally likely to enroll in any graduate field initially (prior \(P(H) = 0.5\) for both fields).
2. Likelihood \(P(E|H)\) and \(P(E|\neg H)\) are our subjective judgment based on the given personality sketch.

Let's assume the values for the parameters based on the personality sketch:

- Computer Science (\(P(E|H_{cs})\)): Given Adam's high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts, as well as his puzzle-solving interest, computer science seems like a plausible field:
  - \(P(E | H_{cs}) = 0.6\)
  - \(P(E | \neg H_{cs}) = 0.4\)

- Business Administration (\(P(E|H_{ba})\)): Given Adam's preference for nature, empathy, and dedication, business administration seems less aligned but possible:
  - \(P(E | H_{ba}) = 0.3\)
  - \(P(E | \neg H_{ba}) = 0.7\)

Now we calculate \(P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)\):

For computer science:
\[ P(E) = 0.6 \cdot 0.5 + 0.4 \cdot 0.5 = 0.5 \]

\[ P(H_{cs} | E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = 0.6 \]

For business administration:
\[ P(E) = 0.3 \cdot 0.5 + 0.7 \cdot 0.5 = 0.5 \]

\[ P(H_{ba} | E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = 0.3 \]

Combining these insights, we get the following probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

This means, given Adam's personality sketch, he is more likely to have been enrolled in a computer science program in 2021 compared to a business administration program.
