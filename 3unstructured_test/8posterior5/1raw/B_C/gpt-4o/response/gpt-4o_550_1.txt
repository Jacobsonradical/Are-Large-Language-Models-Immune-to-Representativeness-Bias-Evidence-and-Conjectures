To compute \( P(H|E) \), we will need to use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we need the probabilities of Adam being in specific fields given his personality sketch (E), we'll estimate the necessary probabilities.

### Assumptions:
1. Let's assume the prior probability \( P(H) \) for each field varies based on general graduate student distribution in the U.S.:
   - \( P(H_{CS}) \) for computer science might be higher given its popularity.
   - \( P(H_{BA}) \) for business administration might be lower compared to computer science.

2. For \( P(E|H) \):
   - The likelihood of E given computer science might be medium as Adam's traits align with problem-solving and intelligence.
   - The likelihood of E given business administration might be lower since Adamâ€™s traits do not strongly align with typical business characteristics.

3. For \( P(E|\neg H) \) (the likelihood of E given any other field):
   - We will assume a relatively moderate probability since Adam's personality can align with many fields.

### Estimates:
- \( P(H_{CS}) \approx 0.3 \) (based on the assumption that computer science is a common graduate field)
- \( P(H_{BA}) \approx 0.2 \)

- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \approx 0.5 \) (Adam's traits are somewhat fitting for CS, but not exclusively so)
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \approx 0.1 \) (Adam's traits seem less fitting for business)

- \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \) (medium likelihood given any other field)

### Calculation:
For computer science:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E|\neg H)} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.3}{0.3} = 0.5 \]

For business administration:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E|\neg H)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.3} \approx 0.067 \]

### Results:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.067
}
```

These values reflect the relative likelihood that Adam was enrolled in each specific field given his personality attributes.
