To apply Bayes' Rule and compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we'll need the following probabilities:
1. Prior probability \( P(H) \), the initial likelihood of Adam enrolling in a given field.
2. Likelihood \( P(E|H) \), the probability of observing personality sketch \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \) is true.
3. Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \), the probability of observing personality sketch \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \) is not true.

Bayes' rule states:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing \( E \).

Given we are evaluating "business administration" and "computer science," let's break it down:

**Business Administration:**
- **\( P(H_{BA}) \)**: Approximately 0.1 (assuming 10% of graduate students might enroll in business administration).
- **\( P(E|H_{BA}) \)**: Since business administration is not directly related to Adam's interests and personality traits (nature, plants, animals, empathy), this is fairly low. I'll estimate it at 0.03.
- **\( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he is not in business administration should be higher, as his traits lean towards fields like natural sciences or animal studies. I'll estimate this at 0.2.

\[
P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.03 \times 0.1}{P(E)}
\]

**Computer Science:**
- **\( P(H_{CS}) \)**: Approximately 0.2 (assuming 20% of graduate students might enroll in computer science).
- **\( P(E|H_{CS}) \)**: Given Adam’s high intelligence and interest in puzzles, this likelihood is moderate. I'll estimate it at 0.15.
- **\( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \)**: The likelihood of observing Adam’s personality traits if he is not in computer science should be a bit lower, given other fields like natural sciences might better match his traits. I'll estimate this at 0.25.

\[
P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.15 \times 0.2}{P(E)}
\]

To simplify, let's assume \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields:

\[
P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.003}{P(E)}, \quad P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.03}{P(E)}
\]

Based on these values:

{
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.003}{P(E)} \),
  "computer science": \( \frac{0.03}{P(E)} \)
}

This yields:

{
  "business administration": \( \frac{1}{P(E)} \times 0.003 \approx 0.01 \),
  "computer science": \( \frac{1}{P(E)} \times 0.03 \approx 0.1 \)
}

Note: These are estimates based on general assumptions. Final probabilities for \( P(H|E) \) can vary depending on more precise estimations or known data about graduate enrolment distributions and exact match of personality traits to study fields.

{
  "business administration": 0.01,
  "computer science": 0.1
}

These calculated values are approximations and indicate that it’s more likely Adam would be in computer science than in business administration, given his personality sketch.
