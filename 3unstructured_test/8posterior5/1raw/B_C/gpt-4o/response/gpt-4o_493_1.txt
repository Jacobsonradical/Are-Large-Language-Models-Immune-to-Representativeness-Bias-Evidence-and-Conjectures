To use Bayes' Rule to compute \( P(H|E) \), we need to make reasonable estimates for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Here, \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field, \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the given personality sketch if Adam were in that field, and \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the given personality sketch if Adam were in any other field.

Let's set rough estimates for these probabilities:

1. **Business Administration**
   - **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is studying business administration isn't particularly high for someone with his described personality but we can't rule it out. Let's estimate \( P(H) \) to be 0.05.
   - **P(E|H)**: The likelihood that Adam, with a deep love for nature, empathy for animals, and strong puzzle-solving skills, is studying business administration seems relatively low. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) to be 0.01.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of observing the given personality sketch for someone not studying business administration. Considering the vast number of other fields, let's estimate this to be higher, about 0.3.

   Using Bayes' Rule:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.01 \cdot 0.05}{0.01 \cdot 0.05 + 0.3 \cdot 0.95}
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.0005}{0.0005 + 0.285}
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.0005}{0.2855} \approx 0.00175 \approx 0.002
   \]

2. **Computer Science**
   - **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is studying computer science is more plausible given his strong intelligence and aptitude for abstract problem-solving. Let's estimate \( P(H) \) to be 0.1.
   - **P(E|H)**: The likelihood that Adam, who enjoys solving puzzles and has a high intelligence, is studying computer science seems reasonable. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) to be 0.6.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of observing his personality sketch for someone not studying computer science remains the same. Let's keep this at 0.3.

   Using Bayes' Rule:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.1}{0.6 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9}
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.27}
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.33} \approx 0.182
   \]

Here's the result in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": 0.002,
  "computer science": 0.182
