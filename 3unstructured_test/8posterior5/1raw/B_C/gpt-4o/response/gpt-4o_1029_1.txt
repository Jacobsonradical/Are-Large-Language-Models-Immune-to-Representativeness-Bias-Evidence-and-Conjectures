To determine the probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each of the fields of study, we need to focus on how well Adam's personality and interests align with each field.

Let's break this down for each field:

### Business Administration
- **P(H):** The probability that any given student is in business administration. Since it’s a common field, let's assign a moderate prior probability.
- **P(E|H):** The likelihood of someone with a business administration background having Adam's traits, which include curiosity about nature, puzzle-solving, empathy, and a love for animals. These aren't strongly associated with business administration.
- **P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood of someone not in business administration having these traits is relatively higher since these traits seem more generic and not tied to a specific academic field.

### Computer Science
- **P(H):** The probability that any given student is in computer science. It's a popular field, so let's assign a moderate to high prior probability.
- **P(E|H):** The likelihood of someone with a computer science background having Adam's traits. High intelligence and puzzle-solving are strongly associated with computer science. However, a strong love for nature, empathy, and animals is less typical.
- **P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood of someone not in computer science having these traits should be similar due to the broad nature of many of these traits.

Given these qualitative assessments, we can ascribe rough numerical values:

### Business Administration
- **P(H):** 0.15 (moderate prior probability that a student could be in business administration)
- **P(E|H):** 0.05 (low likelihood that someone in business administration has these specific traits)
- **P(E|\neg H):** 0.3 (Since the traits are somewhat common and not specific to a field)

### Computer Science
- **P(H):** 0.2 (moderate to high prior probability that a student is in computer science)
- **P(E|H):** 0.15 (higher likelihood for puzzle-solving and intelligence, but some traits less typical)
- **P(E|\neg H):** 0.3 (same reasoning as before)

Using Bayes’ theorem \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \). \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence and is computed as \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

For simplicity, let’s assume the world of graduate fields can be adequately modeled by just these two hypotheses, we can then normalize within this context:

### Business Administration
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.05 \cdot 0.15 + 0.3 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.0075 + 0.255 = 0.2625 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.15}{0.2625} \approx 0.0286 \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.15 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.03 + 0.24 = 0.27 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.15 \cdot 0.2}{0.27} \approx 0.1111 \]

Thus, the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in the specified fields of graduate study, given his personality traits, are:

{
  "business administration": "0.0286",
  "computer science": "0.1111"
}
