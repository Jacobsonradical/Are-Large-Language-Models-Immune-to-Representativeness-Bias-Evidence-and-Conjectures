To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence (personality sketch) given that Adam was in the specific field.
- \( P(E| \neg H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence given that Adam was not in the specific field.
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the specific field given the evidence.

Let's evaluate each part step-by-step for computer science and business administration.

1. **Computer Science**

   - \( P(H) \): Given the general popularity of computer science, let's assume it has a moderate prior probability. Set it at 0.15.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence, which is consistent with skills needed in computer science, this could be reasonably high. Set it at 0.7.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Consider all other fields where Adam's personality could fit. Considering the diverse nature of other fields, this might also be significant. Set it at 0.5.

2. **Business Administration**

   - \( P(H) \): Given the practical and broad application of business administration, let's assume it has a moderate prior probability. Set it at 0.10.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Business administration generally requires strong interpersonal skills and a focus on human behavior, but less on puzzle-solving. This could be moderately likely. Set it at 0.3.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Using similar logic as above, this should still be significant. Set it at 0.5.

Given \( P(E) \) is the same for both cases and can be calculated but is not strictly necessary for comparing the two, we can compute a proportional representation of \( P(H|E) \).

3. **Application of Bayes' Rule**

   For computer science, we get:
   \[
   P(H|E \text{ for CS}) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)}
   \]
   For business administration, we get:
   \[
   P(H|E \text{ for BA}) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.10}{P(E)}
   \]

Since \( P(E) \) remains consistent, we essentially compare:
   \[
   P(H|E \text{ for CS}) \propto 0.105
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E \text{ for BA}) \propto 0.03
   \]

Normalizing to see probabilities summing up to 1 (for proportional representation):
   \[
   0.105 + 0.03 = 0.135
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E \text{ for CS}) \approx \frac{0.105}{0.135} = \approx 0.777
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E \text{ for BA}) \approx \frac{0.03}{0.135} = \approx 0.222
   \]

Therefore, the computed probabilities are as follows:

{
  "computer science": 0.777,
  "business administration": 0.222
}

These values are normalized for comparison purposes and show that, given his personality sketch, Adam is more likely to be studying computer science than business administration.
