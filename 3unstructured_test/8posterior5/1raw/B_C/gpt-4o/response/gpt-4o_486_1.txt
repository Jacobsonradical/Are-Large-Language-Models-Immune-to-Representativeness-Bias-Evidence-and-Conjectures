To calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is in each field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not in each field.

Bayes' theorem is given as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(E) \) is a normalization factor and can be ignored for comparing relative probabilities.

Here's a simplified approach for calculations:

**Business Administration:**
- \( P(H) \): Let's assume the prior probability of graduates in business administration is relatively average. Say 0.1.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam's characteristics fitting a business administration profile seems low since the traits of empathy, love for animals, curiosity about nature, and solving puzzles are not typically associated with this field. Estimate 0.2.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of someone not in business administration having Adam's traits is probably higher given the wider pool. Estimate 0.5.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.02}{P(E)} \]

**Computer Science:**
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability considering a similar assumption as above. Say 0.1.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam's traits fitting a computer science profile is quite high given the tendency for abstract thinking, problem-solving, and possibly animal-related projects in areas like AI or simulation. Estimate 0.6.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of someone not in computer science having Adam's traits may be lower. Estimate 0.3.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.06}{P(E)} \]

Given \( P(E) \) is a normalization factor, the relative probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.06
}
```

These values can suggest the likelihoods relative to each other. Since direct \( P(E) \) normalization isn't calculated in this context, the absolute values reflect the general likelihood of Adam being in each field based on the provided sketch.
