Let's break it down step-by-step.

### 1. Computer Science

- **P(H):** The probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Assume P(H) = 0.1 (a standard assumption for prior probability without additional information).
- **P(E|H):** The probability of E given that H is true. Given Adam's high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, and love for puzzles, the probability that he fits the personality sketch if he was in computer science is relatively high. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.8.
- **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of E given that H is false. This means the probability of Adam having these characteristics if he was not in computer science. Since these characteristics might be common across fields where intelligence and abstract thinking are appreciated, let's assume P(E|\neg H) = 0.4.

Using Bayes Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \) 

Here, \( P(\neg H) = 0.9 \):

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.4 \cdot 0.9) = 0.08 + 0.36 = 0.44 \]

Finally, 

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.44} = \frac{0.08}{0.44} \approx 0.1818 \]

### 2. Business Administration

- **P(H):** The probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Assume P(H) = 0.05.
- **P(E|H):** The probability of E given that H is true. The characteristics described (empathy, strong understanding & appreciation for hard work) somewhat align with business administration but not as strongly as with computer science. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.4.
- **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of E given that H is false. Characteristics like empathy and hard work are common but somewhat less aligned with business fields. Assume P(E|\neg H) = 0.5.

Using Bayes Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Using the previously calculated \( P(E) = 0.44 \):

Finally, 

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.05}{0.44} = \frac{0.02}{0.44} \approx 0.0455 \]
