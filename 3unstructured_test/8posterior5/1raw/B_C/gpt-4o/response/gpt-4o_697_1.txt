Let's go through the reasoning step-by-step for calculating \( P(H|E) \) for both fields: computer science and business administration.

### Step 1: Define Prior Probabilities, \( P(H) \)
In the absence of specific data, let's assume that the prior probability of a graduate student being enrolled in either computer science or business administration is relatively even among a multitude of fields. Given that both fields are relatively popular:

- \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.1 \)

### Step 2: Define \( P(E|H) \)
We examine how likely Adam's personality sketch fits students in each field:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Curiosity about nature and solving puzzles fit well (high).
   - Strong empathy and love for animals may not be typical but not excluding (moderate).
   - Understanding abstract concepts fits well (high).
   - Appreciation for hard work fits (high).

   Therefore, \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \approx 0.7 \)

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Curiosity about nature and solving puzzles fit less (low).
   - Strong empathy and love for animals may fit some, especially in leadership or CSR roles (moderate).
   - Understanding abstract concepts fits (moderate).
   - Appreciation for hard work fits (high).

   Therefore, \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \approx 0.5 \)

### Step 3: Define \( P(E|\neg H) \)
This represents the probability of the personality sketch given Adam is not in the specific fields. While this can be complex, weâ€™ll assume a generic fit among all other fields except the two given ones:

- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.4 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.4 \)

### Step 4: Apply Bayes' Rule to Calculate \( P(H|E) \)
Bayes' Rule: \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \)

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

#### For Computer Science:

\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.1) + (0.4 \cdot 0.9) = 0.07 + 0.36 = 0.43 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.43} \approx 0.163 \]

#### For Business Administration:

\[ P(E) = (0.5 \cdot 0.1) + (0.4 \cdot 0.9) = 0.05 + 0.36 = 0.41 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.1}{0.41} \approx 0.122 \]

### Conclusion

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.163,
  "business administration": 0.122
}
```

These probabilities show a higher likelihood that Adam is enrolled in the computer science program compared to business administration, given his personality sketch.
