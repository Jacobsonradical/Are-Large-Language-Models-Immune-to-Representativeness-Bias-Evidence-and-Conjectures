To calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to compute the following probabilities for each field:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.

Then, we use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, \( P(E) \) is common for all the hypotheses and can be considered a normalization constant. Therefore, we just need to find the numerator \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for each field to compare the relative probabilities.

Let's assess each field:

### Computer Science

- **\( P(H_{CS}) \)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science. Let's assume a prior probability of 0.1 for graduate students enrolling in Computer Science.
  
- **\( P(E|H_{CS}) \)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality traits (curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, puzzle-solving, empathy) given that he is in Computer Science. Given that many Computer Science students might have these traits, but maybe not all, let's assume a moderate likelihood of 0.3.
  
- **\( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he was not in Computer Science. Given the diversity of other fields, we assume that these traits could be moderately likely in other fields as well, so let's assign a value of 0.4.

### Business Administration

- **\( P(H_{BA}) \)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration. Let's assume a prior probability of 0.05 for graduate students enrolling in Business Administration.
  
- **\( P(E|H_{BA}) \)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality traits given that he is in Business Administration. Considering that Adam's traits (especially the love for nature and empathy) are less stereotypically associated with Business Administration, let's assume a lower likelihood of 0.1.
  
- **\( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he was not in Business Administration. This would be the same as before, 0.4.

Now, we calculate the numerators for each hypothesis:

For **Computer Science**:
\[ P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) = 0.3 \cdot 0.1 = 0.03 \]

For **Business Administration**:
\[ P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) = 0.1 \cdot 0.05 = 0.005 \]

To find \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we can compare the relative values. Since \( P(E) \) is a constant factor for normalization, we can directly use the above numerators as relative probabilities without full normalization.

Thus, the relative probabilities of these fields given Adam's personality sketch are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.03,
  "business administration": 0.005
}
```

These values indicate that, based on the given personality sketch, Adam is more likely to have been in Computer Science than in Business Administration.
