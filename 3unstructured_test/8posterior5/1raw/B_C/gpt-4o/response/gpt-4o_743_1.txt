To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for both computer science and business administration using Bayes' rule, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Define the prior probability \( P(H) \)**: We need to make an assumption about the likelihood for a given student to be enrolled in either field.
2. **Define the likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of Adam having his personality traits given that he is in a certain field.
3. **Define the probability of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is the probability of Adam's traits if he is not in the specified field.

Given the data:

### Prior Probability \( P(H) \)

- We will assume that the prior probability for any single field being chosen by a graduate student is equal. Since no specific assumption is provided, we can assume \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) = P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.1 \). This is just a hypothetical assumption for the sake of calculation. 

### Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)

- **Computer Science**: Considering Adam's attributes like high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving skills, there's a relatively high likelihood for computer science.
  
  Let's assume \( P(E | H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.7 \)

- **Business Administration**: While Adam has a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication and a warm heart, these traits might be less indicative of a perfect fit for business administration compared to computer science.
  
  Let's assume \( P(E | H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.4 \)

### Probability of the Evidence Given Not the Hypothesis \( P(E| \neg H) \)

We need to estimate the probability of Adam's personality traits independent of any field. This is a bit tricky but let's estimate it as an average likelihood.

If we take an average field, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.4 \) and similarly, \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.5 \).

### Applying Bayes' Rule

Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \)

### Calculation for Computer Science

1. Prior Probability: \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.1 \)
2. Likelihood: \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.7 \)
3. Evidence: We will combine likelihoods for average probabilities across all fields:
   \[ P(E) = (0.7 \times 0.1) + (0.4 \times 0.9) = 0.07 + 0.36 = 0.43 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.1}{0.43} \approx \frac{0.07}{0.43} \approx 0.163 \]

### Calculation for Business Administration

1. Prior Probability: \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.1 \)
2. Likelihood: \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.4 \)
3. Evidence: We will combine likelihoods for average probabilities across all fields:
   \[ P(E) = (0.4 \times 0.1) + (0.5 \times 0.9) = 0.04 + 0.45 = 0.49 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.1}{0.49} \approx \frac{0.04}{0.49} \approx 0.082 \]

### Final Answer

{
  "computer science": 0.163,
  "business administration": 0.082
}
