To solve this problem, let's first define the various probability terms needed for Bayes' Theorem:

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field (e.g., business administration or computer science).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in that field.

Bayes' Theorem allows us to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \), let's breakdown the problem:

### Business Administration
1. **Prior \( P(H) \):
   - Assume the prior probability for any single graduate field specialization is reasonably small, say \( P(H) = 0.05 \) (5%).

2. **Conditional Probability \( P(E|H) \):
   - The characteristics described in the sketch (curiosity about nature, empathy, love of animals, etc.) do not strongly align with business administration. Let's assume - \( P(E|H) = 0.01 \) (1%).

3. **Conditional Probability \( P(E|\neg H) \):
   - Given the large number of fields, we can assume that many fields could match the personality sketch better than business administration. Let's estimate this at - \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.05 \) (5%).

### Computer Science
1. **Prior \( P(H) \):
   - Assume the prior probability for any single graduate field specialization is reasonably small, say \( P(H) = 0.05 \) (5%).

2. **Conditional Probability \( P(E|H) \):
   - The characteristics described (e.g., high intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts, enjoys solving puzzles) align more closely with traits often associated with computer science. Let's estimate this at - \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \) (20%).

3. **Conditional Probability \( P(E|\neg H) \):
   - Given there are many other fields that could match the personality sketch but not as well as computer science. Let's estimate this at - \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.05 \) (5%).

### Calculations
Let's calculate \( P(E) \) for both fields and then use it to compute \( P(H|E) \).

#### Business Administration:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.01 \cdot 0.05 + 0.05 \cdot 0.95 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.0005 + 0.0475 = 0.048 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01 \cdot 0.05}{0.048} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.0005}{0.048} \approx 0.0104 \]

#### Computer Science:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.05 + 0.05 \cdot 0.95 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.01 + 0.0475 = 0.0575 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.05}{0.0575} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.01}{0.0575} \approx 0.1739 \]

### Final Posterior Probabilities
Therefore, the likelihood of Adam being in each field, given his personality sketch, is as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0104,
  "computer science": 0.1739
}
