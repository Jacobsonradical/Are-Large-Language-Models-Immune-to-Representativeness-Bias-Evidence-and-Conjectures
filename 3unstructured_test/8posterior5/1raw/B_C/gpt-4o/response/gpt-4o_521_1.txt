To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \), we use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that \( P(E) \) is the same for both hypotheses and doesn't need to be computed to compare probabilities, we focus on the relative values of \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

1. **Business Administration**

- **P(H):** Business administration is a common field, but not necessarily aligned with Adam's interests and personality sketch. Suppose \( P(H) \) is moderate, let's say around 0.15.
- **P(E|H):** This is how well Adam's sketch fits someone in business administration. Adam's traits suggest he might not fit as well in business administration compared to other fields. Suppose \( P(E|H) \) is low, say 0.1.
- **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of observing Adam’s traits in someone not in business administration might be moderate to high, let's say 0.8.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.15}{P(E)} \]

2. **Computer Science**

- **P(H):** Computer science is a common field, especially for students with high intelligence and good abstract thinking skills. Suppose \( P(H) \) is moderate, around 0.2.
- **P(E|H):** This is how well Adam's sketch fits someone in computer science. Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and problem-solving skills align quite well with this field. Suppose \( P(E|H) \) is high, say 0.7.
- **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of observing Adam’s traits in someone not in computer science might be moderate, let's say 0.5.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]

Now, we don't have the exact values for \( P(E) \), but we can compare the numerators to estimate the probabilities:

For business administration:
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) \approx 0.1 \times 0.15 = 0.015 \]

For computer science:
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) \approx 0.7 \times 0.2 = 0.14 \]

To get a rough estimate scale:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.015,
  "computer science": 0.14
}
```

These values give a relative sense that Adam is far more likely to be enrolled in computer science than in business administration.
