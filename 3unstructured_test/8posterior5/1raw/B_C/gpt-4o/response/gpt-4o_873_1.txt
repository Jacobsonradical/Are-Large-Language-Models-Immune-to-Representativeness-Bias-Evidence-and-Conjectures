To compute \( P(H|E) \), the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the field H.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence E given H.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence E given not H.
- \( P(E) \) can be expressed using the law of total probability: \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

However, for simplicity, we will assume that \(\ P(H) \) is somewhat balanced between the given fields, and focus more on the alignment of personality traits with the fields.

Let's consider the two given fields one by one.

### Computer Science

**Assumptions**:
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability. Let's assume it's reasonably frequent for students to enroll in computer science, but not dominant over all other fields: \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \).

- \( P(E|H) \): People in computer science tend to have high problem-solving skills and high intelligence, which aligns well with Adam's traits. Therefore, \( P(E|H) \) is high: \(P(E|H) \approx 0.7 \).

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of having such a personality sketch in fields other than computer science might be moderately less common, since not all other fields emphasize problem-solving and abstract thinking to the same extent: \(P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \).

### Business Administration

**Assumptions**:
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability of enrolling in business administration. Let's assume a similar base rate: \(P(H) \approx 0.2 \).

- \( P(E|H) \): People in business administration may have strong empathy and appreciation for hard work, but the alignment with characteristics like a love for nature, animals, or specifically problem-solving puzzles is less clear. Thus, \(P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \).

- \(P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing this mix of traits in other fields could still be moderately likely: \(P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \).

### Calculation using Bayes' Theorem

For computer science (\(CS\)):
\[ P(CS|E) = \frac{P(E|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(E) = P(E|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(E|\neg CS) \cdot P(\neg CS) \]

Let's calculate:

\[ P(E) \approx (0.7 \cdot 0.2) + (0.2 \cdot 0.8) = 0.14 + 0.16 = 0.30 \]

\[ P(CS|E) \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.3} \approx \frac{0.14}{0.3} \approx 0.467 \]

For business administration (\(BA\)):
\[ P(BA|E) = \frac{P(E|BA) \cdot P(BA)}{P(E)} \]

Again:
\[ P(E) \approx (0.3 \cdot 0.2) + (0.2 \cdot 0.8) = 0.06 + 0.16 = 0.22 \]

\[ P(BA|E) \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.22} \approx \frac{0.06}{0.22} \approx 0.273 \]

So, the probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": 0.467,
  "business administration": 0.273
}
