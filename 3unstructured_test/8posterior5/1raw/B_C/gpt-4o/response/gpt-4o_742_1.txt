To solve this, we need to use Bayes' rule, which is stated as:

\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We will need to make some reasonable assumptions about the probabilities involved. Let's denote the probabilities for each field as follows:

- **Business Administration (BA)**: 
  - \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \) = Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration.
  - \( P(E | H_{\text{BA}}) \) = Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in Business Administration.
  - \( P(E | \neg H_{\text{BA}}) \) = Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not enrolled in Business Administration.

- **Computer Science (CS)**:
  - \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \) = Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Computer Science.
  - \( P(E | H_{\text{CS}}) \) = Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in Computer Science.
  - \( P(E | \neg H_{\text{CS}}) \) = Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not enrolled in Computer Science.

### Assumptions and Reasoning:

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - Assume Adam is equally likely to be in any given field.
   - \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1 \)
   - \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.3 \)

2. **Likelihoods**:
   - For **Business Administration**:
     - Given Adam's traits (love of nature, empathy, interest in puzzles), it seems less likely for someone in Business Administration.
     - \( P(E | H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.05 \)
     - Generic traits of other fields may be more consistent with this personality sketch.
     - \( P(E | \neg H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.2 \)

   - For **Computer Science**:
     - Adam seems highly intelligent and enjoys solving puzzles, which are traits more aligned with people in Computer Science.
     - \( P(E | H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.25 \)
     - Generic traits of other fields may be less consistent.
     - \( P(E | \neg H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.15 \)

3. **Normalization Factor**:
   - To find \( P(E) \), we can use the law of total probability:
     \[ P(E) = P(E | H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E | H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + \ldots \]

4. **Bayes' Rule**:
   - Using Bayes' Rule to find \( P(H_{\text{BA}} | E) \) and \( P(H_{\text{CS}} | E) \).

### Calculations:

**For Business Administration**:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}} | E) = \frac{P(E | H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \]

**Numerator**:
\[ P(E | H_{\text{BA}}) \times P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.05 \times 0.1 = 0.005 \]

**Denominator (P(E))**:
\[ P(E) = P(E | H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E | H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + \mathcal{X} \]
where \( \mathcal{X} \) denotes the contribution of other fields.

Assuming other fields contribute \(0.085 \approx (0.15 \times 0.6) / 2 \) to \( P(E) \) for simplicity.
\[ P(E) = 0.005 + (0.25 \times 0.3) + 0.085 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.005 + 0.075 + 0.085 = 0.165 \]

Thus,
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}} | E) = \frac{0.005}{0.165} \approx 0.03 \]

**For Computer Science**:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}} | E) = \frac{P(E | H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \]

**Numerator**:
\[ P(E | H_{\text{CS}}) \times P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.25 \times 0.3 = 0.075 \]

Thus
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}} | E) = \frac{0.075}{0.165} \approx 0.45 \]

### Final Answer:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.03,
  "computer science": 0.45
}
```
