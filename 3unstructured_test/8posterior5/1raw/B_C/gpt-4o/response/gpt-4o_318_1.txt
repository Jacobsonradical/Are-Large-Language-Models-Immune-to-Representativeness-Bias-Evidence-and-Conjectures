To apply Bayes' rule, we first need to estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field of study. Let's break this down for each of the fields mentioned.

**1. Computer Science (H = Adam was enrolled in Computer Science):**

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science. Let's assume a modest prior probability of 0.2 (or 20%), given that Computer Science is a common field for graduate students but not overwhelmingly dominant.

- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam having these personality traits given that he was enrolled in Computer Science. Given that Computer Science often involves problem-solving and abstract thinking, but may not align directly with his love for nature and animals, let's estimate this as 0.3 (or 30%).

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam having these personality traits if he was not enrolled in Computer Science. Given that fields like biology or environmental science might align better with these traits, let's estimate this as 0.7 (or 70%).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be calculated as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Assuming \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.8 \), we have:

\[ P(E) = 0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.7 \cdot 0.8 = 0.06 + 0.56 = 0.62 \]

So:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.62} \approx \frac{0.06}{0.62} \approx 0.097 \]

**2. Business Administration (H = Adam was enrolled in Business Administration):**

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability Adam was enrolled in Business Administration. Let’s assume this to be lower, say 0.1 (or 10%), since this field is less likely for someone with Adam’s traits.

- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam having these personality traits given that he was enrolled in Business Administration. This is likely lower, as the field does not particularly align with his traits. Estimate it as 0.1 (or 10%).

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam having these personality traits if he was not enrolled in Business Administration. Given the same reasoning as above, estimate it as 0.7 (or 70%).

Using the same Bayes' rule approach:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Where \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.9 \), we have:

\[ P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.1 + 0.7 \cdot 0.9 = 0.01 + 0.63 = 0.64 \]

So:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.64} \approx \frac{0.01}{0.64} \approx 0.016 \]

To sum up the probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.097,
  "business administration": 0.016
}
