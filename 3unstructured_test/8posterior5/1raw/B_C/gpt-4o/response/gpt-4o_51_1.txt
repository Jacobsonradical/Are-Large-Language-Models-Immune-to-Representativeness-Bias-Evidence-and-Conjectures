To utilize Bayes' Theorem in this context, we need to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) given the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence probability \( P(E) \). This is computed via the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To derive this, we need subjective estimates for each of the probabilities.

### Business Administration

- **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**: Let's assume the prior probability for a random graduate student to be in business administration is around 0.15 (since graduate programs are diversified and business administration is reasonably popular).

- **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: Given that Adam has a deep appreciation for nature, empathy, and solving puzzles—qualities not directly linked to a typical business administration course—we assume a lower likelihood. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.05 \).

- **Evidence Probability \(P(E)\)**: To normalize our results, we must estimate the overall probability of the given personality sketch. Given the diversity in graduate programs, we can use a rough estimate that this personality aligns well with a few specialized fields but not all, let's assume \( P(E) = 0.1 \).

So, the posterior probability using Bayes' rule for business administration would be:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.15}{0.1} = 0.075 \]

### Computer Science

- **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**: Let's assume the prior probability for a random graduate student to be in computer science is higher due to its current popularity, say around 0.25.

- **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: Given Adam's interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, traits well correlated with computer science, we can assume a higher likelihood. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).

- **Evidence Probability \(P(E)\)**: \( P(E) \) remains the same at 0.1 (the same personality sketch).

Using Bayes' rule for computer science:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.25}{0.1} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the results can be compiled as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.075,
  "computer science": 0.75
}
