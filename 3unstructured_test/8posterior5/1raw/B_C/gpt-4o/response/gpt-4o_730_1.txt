Let's analyze and estimate the probabilities step by step using Bayes' rule.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

### For Business Administration:
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration:
   - Business administration is a common graduate field but less likely considering Adam's interests in nature, plants, animals, and empathy, which are less related to business.
   - Let's estimate P(H) for business administration as \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1 \).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given that he is in business administration:
   - The personality traits mentioned (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy) are less typical for business administration students.
   - Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.05 \).

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given that he is NOT in business administration:
   - The personality traits fit more with other fields, especially those related to nature and animals.
   - Let's estimate \( P(E|¬H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.3 \).

4. **P(E)**: The overall probability of the personality sketch:
   - This needs to be normalized but compared to other fields, it might be moderate.
   - Let's assume \( P(E) \approx 0.25 \).

### For Computer Science:
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science:
   - Computer science is a broad field and quite popular among graduate students, with a substantial number having high intelligence and problem-solving skills.
   - Let's estimate P(H) for computer science as \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.3 \).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given that he is in computer science:
   - High intelligence and solving puzzles are traits that align well with this field.
   - Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.4 \).

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given that he is NOT in computer science:
   - Again, assuming other fields might fit less well with his traits.
   - Let's estimate \( P(E|¬H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.2 \).

4. **P(E)**: The overall probability of the personality sketch:
   - This needs to be normalized but considering higher overlap with CS traits, it might be higher.
   - Let's assume \( P(E) \approx 0.3 \).

### Calculations:
1. For business administration:
   \[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{0.25} = 0.02 \]

2. For computer science:
   \[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{0.3} = 0.4 \]

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

These values suggest that it is more probable for Adam to be enrolled in computer science than business administration, given his personality sketch.
