First, we need to determine three probabilities for each field: 
1. P(H): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in that field, based on general knowledge about the popularity of different fields of study among graduate students.
2. P(E|H): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is enrolled in that field.
3. P(E|¬H): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is not enrolled in that field (effectively considering all other fields combined).

After these, we can use Bayes' Rule to compute P(H|E), the posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field given the personality sketch.

### Business Administration
1. P(H): Business Administration is a common field, so let's assume a moderate prior probability. For instance, P(H) = 0.2.
2. P(E|H): Personality traits like a curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy are less typical for business administration students. Therefore, P(E|H) might be lower, say 0.05.
3. P(E|¬H): This is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch across all other fields. Given that his traits are more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, etc., this value might be somewhat higher but still low across the whole population. Let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.1.

Using Bayes' Rule,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
We approximate P(E) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]
\[
P(E) = (0.05 \cdot 0.2) + (0.1 \cdot 0.8) = 0.01 + 0.08 = 0.09
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.2}{0.09} \approx 0.111
\]

### Computer Science
1. P(H): Computer Science is also a common field, so let's assume a prior probability. For instance, P(H) = 0.25.
2. P(E|H): The traits such as love for puzzles, abstract thinking, and high intelligence are aligned with computer science students, but his curiosity about nature and love for animals are less so. Let's give a moderate value, say 0.15.
3. P(E|¬H): This is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch across all other fields. Given that his traits are more aligned with fields like biology and environmental science, this value might be similar to the one assumed above. Let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.1.

Using Bayes' Rule,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Using the law of total probability to approximate P(E),
\[
P(E) = (0.15 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) = 0.0375 + 0.075 = 0.1125
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.15 \cdot 0.25}{0.1125} \approx 0.333
\]

Thus, the Bayesian posterior probabilities for Adam being enrolled in either field, given the personality sketch, are as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.111,
  "computer science": 0.333
}
