To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular graduate field based on his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' rule. The rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we don't have specific numerical values, I will make reasonable assumptions and provide qualitative estimates.

### For Computer Science:

1. **P(H)** - Prior probability that he was enrolled in Computer Science:
   - Considering the popularity of computer science as a graduate field, let's assume this to be moderately high.
   - Estimated: 0.25

2. **P(E|H)** - Probability of the evidence given that Adam was in Computer Science:
   - Adam's interest in solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts fit well with a computer science background.
   - Estimated: 0.7

3. **P(E|\neg H)** - Probability of the evidence given that Adam was not in Computer Science:
   - These traits can also be found in students from other fields, such as mathematics, physics, and engineering.
   - Estimated: 0.2

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.25}{P(E)} \]

To compute \(P(E)\):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) = 0.175 + 0.15 = 0.325 \]

So,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.175}{0.325} \approx 0.538 \]

### For Business Administration:

1. **P(H)** - Prior probability that he was enrolled in Business Administration:
   - Business administration is also a popular graduate field, though it may not align well with Adam's interests and personality.
   - Estimated: 0.15

2. **P(E|H)** - Probability of the evidence given Adam was in Business Administration:
   - Traits like empathy and understanding of hard work fit within a business context, but the deep love for nature and animals does not align.
   - Estimated: 0.3

3. **P(E|\neg H)** - Probability of the evidence given that Adam was not in Business Administration:
   - These traits fit well with other fields like biology, environmental science, etc.
   - Estimated: 0.25

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \]

To compute \(P(E)\):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.15) + (0.25 \cdot 0.85) = 0.045 + 0.2125 = 0.2575 \]

So,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.2575} \approx 0.175 \]

Based on these estimates, our results are:

{
  "computer science": 0.538,
  "business administration": 0.175
}
