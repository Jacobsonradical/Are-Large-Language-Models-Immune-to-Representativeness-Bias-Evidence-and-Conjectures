Sure, let's evaluate the probabilities step by step.

### Computer Science

**1. Prior Probability, P(H) - Computer Science:**
Computer Science is a common field with many graduate students, but it's not overwhelmingly dominant.

Let's assign P(H) = 0.2 (20%).

**2. Likelihood, P(E|H) - Adam's characteristics given Computer Science:**
Adam is intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, which fits well with Computer Science. However, his strong empathy and deep love for animals are not typical characteristics highlighted in Computer Science.

Let's assign P(E|H) = 0.4 (40%).

**3. Likelihood, P(E|\neg H) - Adam's characteristics given he is not in Computer Science:**
Having empathy, a love for animals, and interest in nature might be more typical in fields related to environmental science or even psychology. Since Computer Science is a broad field, these characteristics might be less likely in this context.

Let's assign P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 (60%).

### Business Administration

**1. Prior Probability, P(H) - Business Administration:**
Business Administration is also quite common among graduate students but might attract individuals with different characteristics, such as leadership skills and strong communication.

Let's assign P(H) = 0.15 (15%).

**2. Likelihood, P(E|H) - Adam's characteristics given Business Administration:**
Adam's empathy and understanding of hard work might suit Business Administration, but his curiosity about nature and deep love for animals are less relevant.

Let's assign P(E|H) = 0.2 (20%).

**3. Likelihood, P(E|\neg H) - Adam's characteristics given he is not in Business Administration:**
His characteristics (empathy, intelligence, love for animals, and curiosity about nature) might be more fitting in other fields, making it less likely for him to be in Business Administration if he is not in there.

Let's assign P(E|\neg H) = 0.7 (70%).

### Bayes Rule

Let's calculate P(H|E) for each field using Bayes Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \)

#### For Computer Science

\[ P(E) = 0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.6 \cdot (1 - 0.2) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.6 \cdot 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.48 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.56 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.56} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.56} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.143 \]

#### For Business Administration

\[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.15 + 0.7 \cdot (1 - 0.15) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.15 + 0.7 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.03 + 0.595 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.625 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{0.625} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.625} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.048 \]

### Results

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.143,
  "business administration": 0.048
}
```

This completes the Bayesian inference for Adam's probable field of study.
