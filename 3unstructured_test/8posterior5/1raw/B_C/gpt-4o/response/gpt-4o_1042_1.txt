To make the calculations based on Bayes' Theorem, we need to evaluate the probabilities:

P(H) - the prior probability that Adam was studying the field.
P(E|H) - the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was studying the field H.
P(E|¬H) - the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was not studying the field H.

Then we use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have actual prior statistics, I will make reasonable assumptions based on the description.

Let’s evaluate each field of study step by step:

### Business Administration
1. **P(H) for Business Administration**:
   - Business Administration is a fairly common field, but based on Adam's interests and personality (empathy, love for animals, curiosity about nature), it might not be his top choice. Let’s assume P(H) = 0.1 (10%).

2. **P(E|H) for Business Administration**:
   - While there are some aspects of business administration that could resonate with Adam’s traits (appreciation for hard work and dedication), the field generally doesn’t align strongly with curiosity about nature and love for animals. Let’s assume P(E|H) = 0.2 (20%).

3. **P(E|¬H) for Business Administration**:
   - If Adam is not in Business Administration, he could be in many other fields that fit his personality better (e.g., Biology, Environmental Science). Thus, let P(E|¬H) = 0.8 (80%).

4. Applying Bayes’ Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
   Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields and others, it will act as a normalizer. We can calculate:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \cdot 0.1 = 0.02 \]

### Computer Science
1. **P(H) for Computer Science**:
   - Computer Science is a frequently chosen field and Adam's high intelligence and affinity for solving puzzles fit well. Let’s assume P(H) = 0.15 (15%).

2. **P(E|H) for Computer Science**:
   - His high intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles are strong indicators for this field. Let’s assume P(E|H) = 0.6 (60%).

3. **P(E|¬H) for Computer Science**:
   - If Adam is not in Computer Science, he is less likely to be in other fields that fit his personality as precisely. Let P(E|¬H) = 0.5 (50%).

4. Applying Bayes’ Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
   Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields and others, we calculate:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.6 \cdot 0.15 = 0.09 \]

Aggregating results for a normalized comparison:

{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.09
}

Please note these are comparative values and not absolute probabilities since they don’t sum to 1. The actual probabilities require normalization over all possible hypotheses.
