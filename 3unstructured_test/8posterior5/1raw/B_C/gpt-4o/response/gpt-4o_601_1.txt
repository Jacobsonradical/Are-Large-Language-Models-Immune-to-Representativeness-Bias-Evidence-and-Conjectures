To evaluate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Theorem, we need to use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need three probabilities for each hypothesis (field):

1. \( P(H) \) - The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
2. \( P(E|H) \) - The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in that field.

First, let's assign reasonable values for each probability. Note that these values are just educated guesses based on general knowledge and could vary.

### Computer Science

1. \( P(H) \) (Prior for Computer Science)
   - The prior probability of Adam being in computer science, given that he is a graduate student. Let’s say the probability of a random graduate student being in computer science is about 0.2 (common field, but many others exist as well).

2. \( P(E|H) \) (Likelihood of E given H for Computer Science)
   - Given Adam's personality sketch (E) and abstract-thinking skills, his likelihood of being in computer science might be fairly high, say 0.7. Computer science often requires problem-solving skills and a curiosity about abstract concepts.

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) (Likelihood of E given not H for Computer Science)
   - If Adam is not in computer science, the likelihood of his personality traits fitting into fields such as biology, psychology, etc., could be a bit lower, say 0.4. 

### Business Administration

1. \( P(H) \) (Prior for Business Administration)
   - The prior probability for Business Administration. Business Administration is also a common field, but considering the general pool of graduate students, let’s also use 0.2.

2. \( P(E|H) \) (Likelihood of E given H for Business Administration)
   - Given Adam's personality traits (focus on nature, animals, and empathy), the likelihood of him being in Business Administration would be lower, say 0.1. This field typically doesn't align as closely with these traits.

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) (Likelihood of E given not H for Business Administration)
   - If Adam is not in Business Administration, we would expect similar traits in other fields (such as sciences). So let's also use 0.4.

### Calculating Posteriors

For Computer Science:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

Note that \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields, representing the overall likelihood of Adam’s traits.

For Business Administration:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

To simplify and provide the results only in relative terms (without computing an exact \( P(E) \), which cancels out), we directly compare:

### Results

Based on the assumptions:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.14",
  "business administration": "0.02"
}
```

These values are relative and not normalized. Given the simplifications and assumptions, we observe that Adam is more likely to be in Computer Science than in Business Administration based on his personality sketch E.
