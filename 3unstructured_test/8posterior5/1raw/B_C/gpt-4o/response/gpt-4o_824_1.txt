To approach this problem using Bayes’ theorem, we need to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field, given the personality sketch \( E \). Bayes’ theorem is applied as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \) (the likelihood that Adam was enrolled in a given field before knowing the details of his personality).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing \( E \) given the negation of \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence, which can be derived as \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Let’s denote these parameters based on reasonable assumptions and calculations.

1. **Business Administration**
    - **Prior Probability (\( P(H) \))**: Let’s assume a modest prior probability, as business administration is a common field but not particularly aligned with Adam's interests.
        - \( P(H) = 0.15 \)
    - **Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \))**: Given the personality traits (interest in nature, love for animals, intelligence, empathy), it seems less typical for a business administration student.
        - \( P(E|H) = 0.30 \)
    - **Likelihood of \( E \) given \( \neg H \) (\( P(E|\neg H) \))**: If Adam were enrolled in any other field, he might display these traits somewhat frequently (especially in nature-related fields).
        - \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.50 \)

2. **Computer Science**
    - **Prior Probability (\( P(H) \))**: Moderately likely given the popularity of computer science among graduate students.
        - \( P(H) = 0.30 \)
    - **Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \))**: The traits fit fairly well with a computer science student (curiosity about nature, problem-solving skills, empathy).
        - \( P(E|H) = 0.70 \)
    - **Likelihood of \( E \) given \( \neg H \) (\( P(E|\neg H) \))**: This value remains constant as it does not change for different fields.
        - \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.50 \)

Next, we calculate the normalization constant \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]
Where \( H_1 \) and \( H_2 \) are hypotheses for business administration and computer science respectively.

\[ P(E) = 0.30 \cdot 0.15 + 0.70 \cdot 0.30 + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
Assuming \( P(\neg H) = 0.55 \):
\[ P(E) = 0.045 + 0.21 + 0.50 \cdot 0.55 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.045 + 0.21 + 0.275 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.53 \]

Now apply Bayes’ theorem for the given hypotheses:

- **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.30 \cdot 0.15}{0.53} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.53} \approx 0.085 \]

- **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.70 \cdot 0.30}{0.53} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.21}{0.53} \approx 0.396 \]

Putting these results into the required format:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.085,
  "computer science": 0.396
}
