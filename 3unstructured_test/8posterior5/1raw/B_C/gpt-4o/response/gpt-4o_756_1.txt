To determine the probabilities of Adam's enrollment in computer science or business administration given his personality sketch, we will use Bayes' theorem. First, let's define terms:

- P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
- P(E|H): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in that specific field.
- P(E|¬H): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was **not** enrolled in that specific field.
- P(H|E): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch (what we want to calculate).

Given that Adam was a graduate student in the U.S., we'll assume equal prior probabilities (P(H)) for each of the fields considered:

- P(H) for computer science students: 0.02 (2%)
- P(H) for business administration students: 0.2 (20%)

Noting that our total does not need to add up to 1, we will now assign probability values for P(E|H) and P(E|¬H) based on Adam’s personality sketch. Since Adam's traits are more aligned with fields that require understanding abstract concepts and genuine curiosity:

### Computer Science
- **P(E|H_computer_science)**: High because Adam's intelligence, problem-solving skills, and understanding of abstract concepts align with this field. Let's say 0.8.
- **P(E|¬H_computer_science)**: Moderate because these traits could fit other fields. Let's say 0.4.

### Business Administration
- **P(E|H_business_administration)**: Lower because Adam's affinity for nature, animals, and problem-solving skills doesn't typically align with typical business administration traits. Let's say 0.3.
- **P(E|¬H_business_administration)**: Moderate-to-high because his traits, while not overly typical, can still fit within a wide range of non-business fields. Let's say 0.6.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) \) can be considered as a normalization constant.

Given the above calculations and Bayes' formula, we need to calculate P(H|E) without normalizing (since the totals need not be 1).

Let's not worry about normalizing over other fields and directly compare relative probabilities:

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{cs}} \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.02 = 0.016 \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{ba}} \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.3 \cdot 0.2 = 0.06 \]

### Output
Given the above calculations and assumptions:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.016,
  "business administration": 0.06
}
```
These values provide the unnormalized relative probabilities. Note that we can infer Business Administration has a higher probability given the prior assumption, however,  Adam's specific characteristics might better match theoretical fields like computer science despite the computed probabilities.
