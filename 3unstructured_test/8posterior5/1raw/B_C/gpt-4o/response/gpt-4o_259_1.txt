To judge the probabilities needed for applying Bayes' rule, let's consider the following:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of being enrolled in a specific field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of the personality sketch given the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in the specified field.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood of the personality sketch given Adam was not enrolled in the specified field.
4. **P(H|E)**: The posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in the field given the personality sketch.

### Business Administration

#### Prior (P(H)):
Assuming equal probabilities among various fields (given no additional context):

P(H_BA) ≈ 1/N, where N is the number of major fields of study.
For simplicity, if N = 10, then:
P(H_BA) = 0.1

#### Likelihood (P(E|H)):
The likelihood that someone with Adam's personality traits is in business administration, a field typically associated with leadership, management, and less direct engagement with nature, animals, and puzzles:

P(E|H_BA): Low to Moderate, let's say 0.2.

#### Likelihood (P(E|¬H)):
The likelihood of Adam’s personality if he is not in business administration:

P(E|¬H_BA): Higher than being in the field, as business doesn't directly align with his traits, so let's assume 0.8.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.8 \cdot (1 - 0.1)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.72} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} = \frac{0.02}{0.74} ≈ 0.027 \]

### Computer Science

#### Prior (P(H)):
Assuming equal probabilities among various fields:

P(H_CS) ≈ 1/N, where N is the number of major fields of study.
For simplicity, if N = 10, then:
P(H_CS) = 0.1

#### Likelihood (P(E|H)):
The likelihood that someone with Adam's traits (high intelligence, love for puzzles, abstract thinking) is in computer science:

P(E|H_CS): High, let's say 0.7.

#### Likelihood (P(E|¬H)):
The likelihood of Adam’s personality traits if he is not in computer science:

P(E|¬H_CS): Lower than being in the field, but still reasonably high as his traits can fit several fields, assume 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.7 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot (1 - 0.1)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} = \frac{0.07}{0.07 + 0.27} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} = \frac{0.07}{0.34} ≈ 0.206 \]
