To solve this problem using Bayes' Rule, we need to follow the following steps for each field:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits if he is in the given field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits if he is not in the given field.
4. Use Bayes' Rule to calculate \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability of Adam being in the given field, given his personality traits.

Since the priors are not given, we will assume uniform priors for simplicity; that is, we will assume that Adam is equally likely to be in any of the fields.

Given the personality traits in the sketch, we make some educated assumptions about \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \) based on how well the traits match typical characteristics in those fields. 

Here's my judgment based on the personality sketch provided:

### Computer Science
- \( P(H) \): Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.5 \) 
- \( P(E|H) \): Computer science requires high intelligence and the ability to solve puzzles, which fits well with Adam's characteristics. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of having the same personality traits but not being in computer science could be somewhat lower, possibly because similar traits are spread across various other fields. Let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \)

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): Again, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(E|H) \): Business administration does appreciate understanding and dedication, but Adam's traits like strong empathy and deep love for animals might be less characteristic. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of having similar traits but not being in business administration may be relatively high, as empathy and dedication are valued in various other fields too. Let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \)

Now, let's calculate the posterior probabilities using Bayes' Rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

where

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

Here’s the breakdown of the calculations:

#### Computer Science
\[
P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.5) + (0.4 \cdot 0.5) = 0.6
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.6} = \frac{0.4}{0.6} \approx 0.67
\]

#### Business Administration
\[
P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.5) + (0.6 \cdot 0.5) = 0.45
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.5}{0.45} = \frac{0.15}{0.45} \approx 0.33
\]

So we get:

{
  "computer science": 0.67,
  "business administration": 0.33
}
