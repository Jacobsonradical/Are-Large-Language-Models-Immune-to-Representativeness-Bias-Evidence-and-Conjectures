To answer the question using Bayes' Rule, we need to estimate the prior probability \( P(H) \) of Adam being enrolled in either business administration or computer science, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of his personality sketch given each field, and the probability \( P(E | \neg H) \) of his personality sketch given he is not in each of those fields. 

Here are my approximations:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H_{BA}) \) (Prior): The probability of a randomly selected graduate student being in business administration might be moderate, say around \( 0.15 \) or \( 15\% \).
   - \( P(E|H_{BA}) \) (Likelihood): The likelihood that someone with Adam's personality ends up in business administration is probably low, as the described personality traits (love for nature, animals, puzzle solving) do not strongly align with typical traits seen in business administration. Let's set it at \( 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \) (Likelihood of not being in business administration): Given that graduate students in other fields may also share Adam's characteristics, we can assume this to be higher, say around \( 0.5 \).

2. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H_{CS}) \) (Prior): The probability of a randomly selected graduate student being in computer science might be moderately high, let's say around \( 0.20 \) or \( 20\% \).
   - \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) (Likelihood): The likelihood that Adam's personality traits—including high intelligence and logical problem-solving—make him a fit for computer science is quite high. Let's say \( 0.7 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \) (Likelihood of not being in computer science): As other fields may also attract individuals with similar traits, let's estimate this around \( 0.4 \).

Next, calculate the posterior \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Here, \( P(E) \) is common in both denominators for the given hypotheses, and \( P(E) \approx P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

However, since we are looking for comparative values, we can focus on the numerators for the practical purposes of assigning relative values.

### For Business Administration
\[
P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} 
\approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{0.5} \approx 0.03
\]

### For Computer Science
\[
P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)}
\approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.4} \approx 0.35
\]

These are comparative probabilities, not exact posteriors.

So, in the asked format:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.03,
  "computer science": 0.35
}
```
