To use Bayes' theorem to compute \(P(H|E)\), we need the following probabilities:

1. \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field.
2. \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We can simplify \(P(E)\) as a normalization factor since we are only comparing two hypotheses, and our values do not need to add up to 1 as specified.

### 1. Computer Science
- **\(P(H)\)**: Assuming nearly equal probabilities for a random student being in any given field, we might use a generic prior probability, say 0.1 for computer science.
- **\(P(E|H)\)**: Given Adam's interest in nature, animals, and understanding abstract concepts, it's reasonable to think computer science could align well, particularly regarding solving puzzles and high intelligence. Let's estimate this as 0.4.
- **\(P(E|\neg H)\)**: The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch fits someone not in computer science needs to consider many other fields. If 0.1 is our baseline for each field, this might be somewhere around 0.1.

\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.1}{0.4 \cdot 0.1 + 0.1 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.04}{0.13} \approx 0.3077 \]

### 2. Business Administration
- **\(P(H)\)**: Prior probability could still be around 0.1, assuming equal distribution of students across fields.
- **\(P(E|H)\)**: Adamâ€™s strong appreciation for hard work could suit business administration, but the strong empathy and love for animals might correlate less directly. Let's estimate this as 0.2.
- **\(P(E|\neg H)\)**: Will likely be similar to computer science approximation, around 0.1.

\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.1 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.02}{0.11} \approx 0.1818 \]

Putting it all together in the specified format:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3077,
  "business administration": 0.1818
}
