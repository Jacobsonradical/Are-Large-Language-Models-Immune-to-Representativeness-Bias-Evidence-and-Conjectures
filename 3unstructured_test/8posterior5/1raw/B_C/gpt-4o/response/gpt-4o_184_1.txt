Let's analyze the two fields (computer science and business administration) based on the given personality sketch of Adam and use Bayesian reasoning to determine the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \).

### 1. Computer Science

#### Prior Probability (\( P(H) \))
Computer Science is a common field for graduate students, so let's assign a moderate prior probability.
\( P(\text{Computer Science}) = 0.3 \)

#### Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \))
Adam has attributes such as high intelligence, an enjoyment of solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts, which align well with characteristics often found in computer science students.
\( P(E \mid \text{Computer Science}) = 0.7 \)

#### Likelihood for Other Fields (\( P(E|\neg H) \))
Given that we are considering all other fields except computer science, and since these characteristics can be moderately common in various other fields, let's assign a likelihood of:
\( P(E \mid \neg \text{Computer Science}) = 0.4 \)

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[
P(\text{Computer Science} \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid \text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science})}{P(E)}
\]
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid \text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science}) + P(E \mid \neg \text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\neg \text{Computer Science}) \]
\[ 
P(E) = (0.7 \times 0.3) + (0.4 \times 0.7) = 0.21 + 0.28 = 0.49 
\]
\[
P(\text{Computer Science} \mid E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.3}{0.49} \approx 0.43 
\]

### 2. Business Administration

#### Prior Probability (\( P(H) \))
Business Administration is also a common graduate field but may not be as aligned with Adam's traits.
\( P(\text{Business Administration}) = 0.2 \)

#### Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \))
Attributes like strong empathy and appreciation for hard work align well with business administration, but other key attributes such as curiosity about nature and love for animals may be less common. Let's assign a moderate likelihood value.
\( P(E \mid \text{Business Administration}) = 0.4 \)

#### Likelihood for Other Fields (\( P(E|\neg H) \))
Again, considering all fields except business administration, similar to before:
\( P(E \mid \neg \text{Business Administration}) = 0.5 \)

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[
P(\text{Business Administration} \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid \text{Business Administration}) \cdot P(\text{Business Administration})}{P(E)}
\]
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid \text{Business Administration}) \cdot P(\text{Business Administration}) + P(E \mid \neg \text{Business Administration}) \cdot P(\neg \text{Business Administration}) \]
\[ 
P(E) = (0.4 \times 0.2) + (0.5 \times 0.8) = 0.08 + 0.4 = 0.48 
\]
\[
P(\text{Business Administration} \mid E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.2}{0.48} \approx 0.17 
\]

Finally, combining both results:

{
  "computer science": 0.43,
  "business administration": 0.17
}
