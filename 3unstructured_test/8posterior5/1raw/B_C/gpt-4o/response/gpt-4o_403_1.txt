To estimate the likelihood (P) of Adam being enrolled in business administration or computer science based on the given personality sketch E, according to Bayes' rule, we need to follow these steps:

Bayes' rule is:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where,
- \( P(H) \) = Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) = Likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) = Likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in another field.
- \( P(H|E) \) = Posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field given the personality sketch.

### Business Administration

P(H) = (Assumed prior probability of Adam being in business administration): Let's assume this is 0.1 (since business administration is a common field, but Adam's personality traits seem less aligned with this field).

P(E|H) = Likelihood of having the given personality traits if Adam is in business administration: Let's estimate this to be low, say 0.2, because the traits mentioned (empathy, love for nature and animals, interest in puzzles, etc.) are not strongly indicative of a typical business administration student.

P(E|\neg H) = Likelihood of having these personality traits if not in business administration: Since the traits seem more likely in other fields (e.g., environmental sciences, psychology), we can assume a higher value, say 0.8.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{(0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.8 \cdot 0.9)} = \frac{0.02}{0.74} \approx 0.027 \]

### Computer Science

P(H) = (Assumed prior probability of Adam being in computer science): Let’s assume this is 0.15 (since computer science is a popular field, and interest in puzzles and high intelligence aligns somewhat with this field).

P(E|H) = Likelihood of having the given personality traits if Adam is in computer science: Let's estimate this to be moderate, say 0.6, because intelligence and solving puzzles are typical attributes in computer science students, but the strong empathy and love for nature are less common.

P(E|\neg H) = Likelihood of having these personality traits if not in computer science: Given Adam’s traits, he could be in various other fields such as environmental science, requiring us to estimate higher, say 0.6.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.15}{(0.6 \cdot 0.15 + 0.6 \cdot 0.85)} = \frac{0.09}{0.54} = \frac{0.09}{0.54} \approx 0.167 \]

Please note that these calculations are based on rough estimations and assumptions about prior probabilities and likelihoods which can vary.
