First, let's consider the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field. We don't have explicit data, so we'll assign them equal priors for simplicity, assuming that the chances of Adam being in any given graduate field are equally likely.

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}) = P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.5 \]

Next, we consider the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \). 

### Computer Science (CS)
**P(E|H_CS):** Adam's interest in nature, high intelligence, and enjoyment of solving puzzles fit quite well with Computer Science, given its heavy reliance on analytical problem-solving and abstract thinking. However, his strong empathy and dedication may not be as strongly associated with CS fields compared to other traits.

Let's estimate this as moderately aligned:

\[ P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.6 \]

**P(E|\neg H_CS):** If Adam is not in Computer Science, he could be in many other fields that also highly value intelligence and puzzle-solving abilities, such as physics, biology, or engineering. Therefore, traits such as empathy and a love for animals might be more strongly aligned outside of CS.

Let's estimate this as slightly lower than \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \):

\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.4 \]

### Business Administration (BA)

**P(E|H_BA):** Adam's empathy, dedication, and appreciation for hard work fit quite well with Business Administration. Business often involves understanding people's needs and behaviors, and those working in the field must be dedicated and hardworking. However, his strong love for nature, curiosity about plants, and enjoyment of solving puzzles may not be as directly aligned with BA, which tends to focus more on organizational, strategic, and financial elements.

\[ P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.5 \]

**P(E|\neg H_BA):** If Adam is not in Business Administration, his traits could be well-suited to fields involving nature, problem-solving, and empathy, such as environmental sciences, biology, or social work. This would make the complement probability somewhat aligned but not extremely high.

\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.5 \]

Now, we'll use Bayes' Rule to compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) \text{ can be expanded as: }  P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) \]

### For Computer Science (CS):
\[ P(E)_{\text{CS}} = 0.6 \cdot 0.5 + 0.4 \cdot 0.5 = 0.3 + 0.2 = 0.5 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = 0.6 \]

### For Business Administration (BA):
\[ P(E)_{\text{BA}} = 0.5 \cdot 0.5 + 0.5 \cdot 0.5 = 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = 0.5 \]

Therefore, the posterior probabilities are:

\[
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.5
}
\]
