Let's break down the given fields, apply Bayes' Rule, and calculate the conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis.

**1. Computer Science:**
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science. Without specific data, we'll assume it is one of many possible fields he could be in. For simplicity, suppose there are 10 major fields of study, so \( P(H) \) might be around 0.1.
  
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was a Computer Science student. Computer Science typically involves problem-solving skills and high intelligence, which fits part of Adam's description, but less emphasis may be on nature, empathy, and love for animals. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) to be moderate, such as 0.3.

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was not a Computer Science student. Other fields (like biology or psychology) might better fit Adam's profile. We might estimate this higher, around 0.5.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assuming \( P(E) \approx P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \):
\[ P(E) \approx (0.3 \times 0.1) + (0.5 \times 0.9) = 0.03 + 0.45 = 0.48 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.1}{0.48} \approx 0.0625 \]

**2. Business Administration:**
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration, which we'll also assume is around 0.1.

- **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was a Business Administration student. This field typically values hard work and dedication but may not necessarily align with the strong curiosity about nature or love for animals. Estimate \( P(E|H) \) to be low, such as 0.1.

- **P(E|\neg H)**: Approximately the same as the previous, around 0.5.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(E) \approx (0.1 \times 0.1) + (0.5 \times 0.9) = 0.01 + 0.45 = 0.46 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.1}{0.46} \approx 0.0217 \]

So, the probabilities are:

```
{
  "computer science": 0.0625,
  "business administration": 0.0217
}
```
