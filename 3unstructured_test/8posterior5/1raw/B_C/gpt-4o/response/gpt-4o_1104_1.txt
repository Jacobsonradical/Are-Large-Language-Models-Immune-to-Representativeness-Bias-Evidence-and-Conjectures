To evaluate the likelihood that Adam was enrolled in specific graduate programs given his personality sketch, let's make some reasonable assumptions based on the provided information. The personality sketch of Adam suggests certain strengths and interests that might align more closely with particular fields of study. We will use Bayesian reasoning to estimate the probabilities.

First, let's denote:
- \( H_{CS} \): Adam is enrolled in a computer science graduate program.
- \( H_{BA} \): Adam is enrolled in a business administration graduate program.
- \( E \): The personality sketch of Adam.

### Step 1: Establishing Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)

Given that these fields are common, we might assign general prior probabilities to each:
- \( P(H_{CS}) \approx 0.2 \) (20% chance)
- \( P(H_{BA}) \approx 0.2 \) (20% chance)

For simplicity and consistency, we'll assume equal prior probabilities for each field.

### Step 2: Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)

Next, we estimate how likely Adam's personality sketch is for each field:

- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \approx 0.6 \): Computer science students often have high intelligence and are good at solving abstract problems. Adam’s empathy and warmth are less typical but not improbable.
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \approx 0.2 \): Business administration students might not typically exhibit the same level of curiosity about nature and abstract concepts; these traits are less aligned with a business focus.

### Step 3: Likelihood of \( E \) given Not \( H \)

Now, we estimate the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch, given that he is not in each field:

- \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.3 \): If not in computer science, he might still fit into various other fields—biology, environmental science, etc.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.5 \): If not in business administration, his profile likely matches other non-business oriented fields more closely, hence a higher probability.

### Step 4: Applying Bayes' Rule

Finally, compute the posterior probabilities:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

#### For Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{0.6 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.24} = \frac{0.12}{0.36} \approx 0.333 \]

#### For Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.2 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.4} = \frac{0.04}{0.44} \approx 0.091 \]

### Final Answer:

  "computer science": 0.33,
  "business administration": 0.09
