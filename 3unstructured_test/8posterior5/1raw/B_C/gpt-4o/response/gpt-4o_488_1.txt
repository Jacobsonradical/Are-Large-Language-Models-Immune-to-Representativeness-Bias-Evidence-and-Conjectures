Certainly! To compute \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' Rule, we need to determine the values of \(P(H)\), \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E|\neg H)\) for each field. Bayes' Rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's denote:
\( H_1 \) = Adam was enrolled in computer science.
\( H_2 \) = Adam was enrolled in business administration.

### Computer Science
1. **\( P(H_1) \)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science. Assuming equal likelihood for all fields initially, but considering computer science is a common field, let's assume \( P(H_1) = 0.25 \).
2. **\( P(E|H_1) \)**: The probability of observing E given H_1. Considering his traits like high intelligence, solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts, it's fairly high. Let's say \( P(E|H_1) = 0.7 \).
3. **\( P(E|\neg H_1) \)**: The probability of observing E given he is not in computer science. This would be lower because the personality traits fit particularly well with computer science. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_1) = 0.3 \).

### Business Administration
1. **\( P(H_2) \)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration. Assuming equal likelihood for all fields initially, let's assume \( P(H_2) = 0.25 \).
2. **\( P(E|H_2) \)**: The probability of observing E given H_2. Given his empathy, warm heart, and appreciation for hard work, let's assume it's moderate. Let's say \( P(E|H_2) = 0.4 \).
3. **\( P(E|\neg H_2) \)**: The probability of observing E given he is not in business administration. This would be higher since many fields can have individuals with his traits. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_2) = 0.5 \).

Let's compute the posterior probabilities using Bayes' Rule:

### For Computer Science:
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields, we can compare the numerators directly for relative probability.

\[ P(H_1|E) \propto P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) = 0.7 \cdot 0.25 = 0.175 \]

### For Business Administration:
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_2|E) \propto P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) = 0.4 \cdot 0.25 = 0.1 \]

Normalizing the values by comparing their ratios:
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.175}{0.175 + 0.1} = \frac{0.175}{0.275} \approx 0.636 \]
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.175 + 0.1} = \frac{0.1}{0.275} \approx 0.364 \]

Thus, the probabilities based on the given fields and personality sketch are:

{
  "computer science": 0.636,
  "business administration": 0.364
