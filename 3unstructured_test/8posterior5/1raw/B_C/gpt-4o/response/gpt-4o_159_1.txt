To calculate the probability that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or computer science given the personality sketch \( E \), we can use Bayes' theorem, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given the negation of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence \( E \), which can be computed using the law of total probability but isn't necessary for comparing relative probabilities.

Let's evaluate each field:

### Business Administration
1. **\( P(H) \) (Business Administration):**
   - Let's assume a moderate prior probability, as business administration is a common graduate fieldâ€”but not the most common given Adam's characteristics.
   - \( P(H) = 0.1 \)

2. **\( P(E|H) \) (Likelihood of Adam's characteristics given Business Administration):**
   * While genuine curiosity about nature and animals isn't strongly related to business administration, being highly intelligent and understanding abstract concepts could fit.
   - \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \)

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \) (Likelihood of Adam's characteristics given not Business Administration):**
   - Considering many other fields might align better with Adam's characteristics.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.01}{P(E)} \]

### Computer Science
1. **\( P(H) \) (Computer Science):**
   - Given Adam's interest in puzzles, intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts, it seems a more reasonable assumption.
   - \( P(H) = 0.3 \)

2. **\( P(E|H) \) (Likelihood of Adam's characteristics given Computer Science):**
   - High intelligence, solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts fit well with computer science.
   - \( P(E|H) = 0.6 \)

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \) (Likelihood of Adam's characteristics given not Computer Science):**
   - Similar to business administration, we can use a value considering the diverse suitability of his traits for other fields.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} = \frac{0.18}{P(E)} \]

Now comparing the two:

### Normalizing Factors
For practical purposes, we do not need the exact value of \( P(E) \) as we are comparing relative probabilities:

{
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.01}{P(E)} \approx 0.033 \),
  "computer science": \( \frac{0.18}{P(E)} \approx 0.6 \)
}

Thus, the results (unnormalized) favor computer science due to better alignment with Adam's characteristics.

### Final Answer
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.033,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```
