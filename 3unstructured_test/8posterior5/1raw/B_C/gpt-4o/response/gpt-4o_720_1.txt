To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science or business administration based on his personality sketch, we need to use Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability of the hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that the hypothesis \( H \) is true.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \) being true.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of observing the evidence \( E \).

Let's consider the two fields: computer science and business administration.

### Computer Science

**Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Suppose we assign a generic prior probability that any given graduate student could be in computer science, let's say \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.2 \).

**Evidence Given Computer Science \( P(E|H_{CS}) \)**: Based on Adam's personality sketch, his strong intelligence, interest in solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts align well with someone in computer science. Let's assume \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.6 \).

**Evidence Given Not Computer Science \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \)**: For fields other than computer science, the probability is lower but not zero since these traits could still be somewhat relevant in other fields. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.3 \).

**Posterior Probability \( P(H_{CS}|E) \)**: Using Bayes' rule,

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \cdot P(\neg H_{CS}) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.6 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8 = 0.12 + 0.24 = 0.36 \]

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{0.36} = \frac{0.12}{0.36} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.33 \]

### Business Administration

**Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Suppose we assign a generic prior probability that any given graduate student could be in business administration, let's say \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.2 \).

**Evidence Given Business Administration \( P(E|H_{BA}) \)**: Adam's traits of empathy and understanding/appreciation for hard work and dedication could be relevant in business administration, but less clearly aligned than in computer science. Let's assume \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.3 \).

**Evidence Given Not Business Administration \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \)**: For fields other than business administration, the probability remains. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.3 \).

**Posterior Probability \( P(H_{BA}|E) \)**: Using Bayes' rule,

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \cdot P(\neg H_{BA}) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8 = 0.06 + 0.24 = 0.3 \]

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.3} = \frac{0.06}{0.3} = 0.2 \]
