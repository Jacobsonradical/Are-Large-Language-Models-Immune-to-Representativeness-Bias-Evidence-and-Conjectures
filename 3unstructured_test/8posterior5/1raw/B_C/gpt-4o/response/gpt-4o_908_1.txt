Sure, let's start by evaluating the probabilities step by step.

1. **Computer Science**

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science. In general, given that Computer Science is a popular field of study, let's assume this to be moderate, say around 0.2.
  
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in Computer Science. Given that his interests and personality traits are more aligned with fields like biology, natural sciences, or environmental studies, this probability might be lower. Let's assign a value of 0.1.
  
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in Computer Science. Given that his traits are more aligned with other fields, let's assign a value of 0.25.

Using Bayes' rule to calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields and for simplicity, we do not need to calculate it exactly. We only need the numerator to compare probabilities.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{P(E)} \]

2. **Business Administration**

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration. Business Administration is another common field, so we'll assume a similar probability to Computer Science, say 0.2.
  
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in Business Administration. Given Adam's empathy, love for nature, and animals, it is less likely that he is in Business Administration. Let's assign a value of 0.05.
   
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in Business Administration. Similar to the previous scenario, let's assign a value of 0.25.

Using Bayes' rule to calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01}{P(E)} \]

Finally, the values can be represented in the below format:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.02 / P(E),
  "business administration": 0.01 / P(E)
}
```

If we normalize these values for comparison purposes (since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields), we can see that Computer Science has a higher posterior probability than Business Administration given Adam's personality sketch.

Since the absolute values without normalization are:

- Computer Science: 0.02
- Business Administration: 0.01

After normalization:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.67,
  "business administration": 0.33
}
```

This means it's more likely that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science than in Business Administration given his personality traits.
