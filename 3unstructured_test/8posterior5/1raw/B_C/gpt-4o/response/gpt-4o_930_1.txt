To calculate the probabilities $\text{P(H|E)}$ for each field using Bayes' rule, we first need to estimate the following probabilities:

1. $\text{P(H)}$: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field.
2. $\text{P(E|H)}$: The likelihood that we observe Adam's personality sketch given that he is in each field.
3. $\text{P(E|\neg H)}$: The likelihood that we observe Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in each field.

Bayes' rule is given by:

$$\text{P(H|E)} = \frac{\text{P(E|H)} \cdot \text{P(H)}}{\text{P(E)}}$$

Here, $\text{P(E)}$ is the normalizing constant and is the same for both fields, so we can compare the relative values of $\text{P(H|E)}$ without needing to explicitly calculate $\text{P(E)}$. We'll focus on calculating the numerator, $\text{P(E|H)} \cdot \text{P(H)}$.

### Computer Science

1. **P(H) for Computer Science**:
   - Let's assume that the prior probability that a graduate student is in computer science is relatively high due to the popularity of the field. Let's say $\text{P(H)} = 0.2$.
   
2. **P(E|H) for Computer Science**:
   - A genuine curiosity about nature, a warm heart, empathy, and a love for animals are not typically associated with computer science graduate students. The fit is not very strong. Let's estimate $\text{P(E|H)} = 0.1$.
   
3. **P(E|\neg H) for Computer Science**:
   - The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch among all non-computer science students needs to be considered broadly. Let's estimate $\text{P(E|\neg H)} = 0.8$.

### Business Administration

1. **P(H) for Business Administration**:
   - Business administration is also a common field, though perhaps less so than computer science for graduate studies overall. Let's set $\text{P(H)} = 0.15$.
   
2. **P(E|H) for Business Administration**:
   - The personality traits described fit somewhat better with fields involving human connection and empathy but are still not a perfect fit for business administration. Let's estimate $\text{P(E|H)} = 0.15$.
   
3. **P(E|\neg H) for Business Administration**:
   - As before, $\text{P(E|\neg H)}$ would be the aggregate likelihood over all other fields. Let's set $\text{P(E|\neg H)} at 0.85$.

Let's compute $\text{P(H|E)}$:

For Computer Science:
$$\text{P(H|E)} \propto \text{P(E|H)} \cdot \text{P(H)} = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02$$

For Business Administration:
$$\text{P(H|E)} \propto \text{P(E|H)} \cdot \text{P(H)} = 0.15 \cdot 0.15 = 0.0225$$

The normalized probabilities (still comparing relative likelihoods):

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.02,
  "business administration": 0.0225
}
```

Given the comparable values are very close to each other and indicate almost similar likelihoods for both fields, albeit with Business Administration being slightly more fitting by a small margin based on the given information.
