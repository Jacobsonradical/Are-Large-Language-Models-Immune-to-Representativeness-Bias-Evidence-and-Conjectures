To apply Bayes' rule, we will estimate the probabilities needed and then plug them into the formula. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, computing these probabilities exactly requires extensive data which we do not have. Instead, we will make reasonable assumptions to estimate these values.

### For Business Administration:

#### Prior Probability (P(H)):
We will assume business administration to be a popular field, but not necessarily the default choice for someone with Adam's characteristics.

Assumed value: \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.1 \)

#### Likelihood (P(E|H)):
The personality sketch suggests Adam has traits that are not as typical for someone in a business administration program. Business administrations is more often associated with leadership, management, and less about nature, puzzles, and animals.

Assumed value: \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.1 \)

#### Complement Likelihood (P(E|¬H)):
To judge Adam's characteristics in any other field than business administration.

Assumed value: \( P(E|¬H_{BA}) = 0.9 \)

Now, applying Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.01}{P(E)} \]

### For Computer Science:

#### Prior Probability (P(H)):
Computer Science is a common field for someone with high intelligence and a knack for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts.

Assumed value: \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.15 \)

#### Likelihood (P(E|H)):
Adam's characteristics fit well with the traits typically found in computer science students.

Assumed value: \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.6 \)

#### Complement Likelihood (P(E|¬H)):
To judge Adam's characteristics in any other field than computer science.

Assumed value: \( P(E|¬H_{CS}) = 0.4 \)

Now, applying Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.09}{P(E)} \]

Since both fields share the same \( P(E) \), we can compare the ratios without the exact value of \( P(E) \):

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto 0.01 \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto 0.09 \]

Normalizing these proportions relative to each other:
\[ \text{Total} = 0.01 + 0.09 = 0.10 \]

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.10} = 0.1 \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.10} = 0.9 \]

Therefore, our final answers are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.9
}
```
