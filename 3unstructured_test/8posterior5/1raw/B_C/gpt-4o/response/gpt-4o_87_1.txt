Sure, I'll assess the likelihoods and compute the probabilities based on Bayes' rule for each field.

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Without further information, we can assume a relatively low prior probability for this since the personality sketch does not align strongly with typical traits for this field.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in business administration. This might be quite low because business administration typically does not strongly correlate with a deep love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles.
- **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in business administration. Given Adam's interest in nature, high intelligence, and love for animals, it seems more likely that his personality is associated with a field other than business administration.

To quantify these:
- P(H) = 0.1 (assuming business administration is less likely)
- P(E|H) = 0.1
- P(E|¬H) = 0.5

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \).

\[ P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.1) + (0.5 \times 0.9) = 0.01 + 0.45 = 0.46 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.1}{0.46} \approx 0.0217 \]

### Computer Science
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Higher than business administration due to his high intelligence and interest in solving puzzles.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam’s personality given he is in computer science. Given that computer science often involves solving puzzles and abstract thinking, this is reasonably high.
- **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of Adam’s personality given he is not in computer science. This remains relatively high due to other possible matches, but perhaps not as high.

To quantify these:
- P(H) = 0.3 (assuming computer science is more likely)
- P(E|H) = 0.6
- P(E|¬H) = 0.4

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(E) = (0.6 \times 0.3) + (0.4 \times 0.7) = 0.18 + 0.28 = 0.46 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.3}{0.46} \approx 0.3913 \]

To summarize:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0217,
  "computer science": 0.3913
}
