To answer this question, we'll need to go through the reasoning for each field. We'll judge the likelihood of Adam fitting into each field based on the provided personality sketch. Then, we'll use Bayes' rule to compute the probabilities.

### Business Administration
#### P(H) - Prior Probability
Let's assume a moderate prior probability that Adam could be in business administration, as it's a common field for graduate students. We'll set P(H_business) = 0.1.

#### P(E|H) - Likelihood of Evidence Given Hypothesis
Adam's traits, like curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and preference for solving puzzles, are less directly aligned with business administration, which often focuses on management, finance, and operations. Although empathetic and hardworking people fit in business settings, the specific nature-related interests are less congruent. Let's estimate P(E|H_business) = 0.3.

#### P(E|\neg H) - Likelihood of Evidence Given Not the Hypothesis
The likelihood of a person with Adam's traits fitting into a field that's not business administration may be higher, as other fields (like environmental sciences, biology, etc.) may align better with his interests. Let's estimate P(E|\neg H_business) = 0.7.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)(1-P(H))}
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.1}{0.3 \times 0.1 + 0.7 \times 0.9} = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.63} = \frac{0.03}{0.66} \approx 0.045
\]

### Computer Science
#### P(H) - Prior Probability
Given the growing prevalence of computer science, let's start with a moderate prior probability. We'll set P(H_cs) = 0.1.

#### P(E|H) - Likelihood of Evidence Given Hypothesis
Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence align well with computer science. The interest in nature and empathy could fit within certain specializations like bioinformatics or ethics in AI. Let's estimate P(E|H_cs) = 0.5.

#### P(E|\neg H) - Likelihood of Evidence Given Not the Hypothesis
People with Adam's characteristics could still align well with multiple other fields. Let's estimate P(E|\neg H_cs) = 0.7.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)(1-P(H))}
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{0.5 \times 0.1}{0.5 \times 0.1 + 0.7 \times 0.9} = \frac{0.05}{0.05 + 0.63} = \frac{0.05}{0.68} \approx 0.074
\]
