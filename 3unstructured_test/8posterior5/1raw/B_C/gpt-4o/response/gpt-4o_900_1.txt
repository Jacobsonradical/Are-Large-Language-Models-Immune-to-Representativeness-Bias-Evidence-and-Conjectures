To address this problem, I'll first provide reasonable estimates for the probabilities P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|¬H) for each field, and then use Bayes' theorem to find P(H|E).

Let's denote:
- P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the specified field.
- P(E|H): The probability of observing E assuming Adam was enrolled in the specified field.
- P(E|¬H): The probability of observing E assuming Adam was not enrolled in the specified field.
- P(H|E): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the specified field given the description E.

### Business Administration

**Prior Probability, P(H):**
Given that Business Administration is one of many graduate fields, I'll estimate a prior probability.
- P(H): 0.1 (10% chance Adam was in Business Administration)

**Likelihood, P(E|H):**
Business Administration students can have varied interests, but the specific traits mentioned (like a deep interest in nature, puzzles, high empathy) are less typical for Business Administration.
- P(E|H): 0.01 (1% chance that an average Business Administration student has these traits)

**Complement Likelihood, P(E|¬H):**
Given the general nature of graduate studies, assume generally:
- P(E|¬H): 0.02 (2% chance that a non-Business Administration student has these traits)

### Computer Science

**Prior Probability, P(H):**
I estimate a somewhat higher chance for Computer Science because it's a common field of study.
- P(H): 0.15 (15% chance Adam was in Computer Science)

**Likelihood, P(E|H):**
Computer Science students often enjoy problem-solving and abstract thinking, which aligns well with the description:
- P(E|H): 0.3 (30% chance that an average Computer Science student has these traits)

**Complement Likelihood, P(E|¬H):**
Given the general nature of graduate studies:
- P(E|¬H): 0.02 (2% chance that a non-Computer Science student has these traits)

Now, apply Bayes' rule to find P(H|E):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \].

### Calculations

#### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01 \times 0.1}{(0.01 \times 0.1) + (0.02 \times 0.9)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.001}{0.001 + 0.018} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.001}{0.019} \approx 0.0526 \]

#### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.15}{(0.3 \times 0.15) + (0.02 \times 0.85)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.017} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.062} \approx 0.7258 \]

So, based on this analysis, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0526,
  "computer science": 0.7258
}
```
