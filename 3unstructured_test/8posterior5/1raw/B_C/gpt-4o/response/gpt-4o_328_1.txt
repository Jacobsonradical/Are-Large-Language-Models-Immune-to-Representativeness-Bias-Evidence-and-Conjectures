To determine \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we can use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field, \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of Adam having the described personality sketch if he is in field \( H \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of having the described personality sketch if he is not in field \( H \).

Let's make reasonable assumptions for these probabilities based on the personality sketch provided:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Computer science is a common field for high intelligence, good abstract thinking, and enjoying solving puzzles, but it's hard to assess how many graduate students actually enroll in computer science. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given the personality aligns well with traits beneficial for computer science, let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Without being specific to computer science, such traits might still exist in non-CS fields but less likely. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

2. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): Business administration is also a popular field. Let’s assume \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The personality of Adam doesn't directly seem to align with typical business administration traits which might focus more on leadership, negotiation, etc., so let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Similar reasoning as above. Let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

We'll compute \( P(H|E) \) for both fields:

### Computer Science

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \).

\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) = 0.14 + 0.24 = 0.38 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.38} = \frac{0.14}{0.38} \approx 0.3684 \]

### Business Administration

\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.15) + (0.3 \cdot 0.85) = 0.03 + 0.255 = 0.285 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{0.285} = \frac{0.03}{0.285} \approx 0.1053 \]

Thus, the values for \( P(H|E) \) are:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3684",
  "business administration": "0.1053"
}
