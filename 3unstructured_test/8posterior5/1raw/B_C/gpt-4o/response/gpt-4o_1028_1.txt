To compute \( P(H|E) \), we need to apply Bayes' rule, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we are interested in the comparative likelihoods, so we only need to find \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for each field to compare them.

Given the personality sketch E of Adam, let's estimate the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and conditional probabilities \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H_{cs}) \): Probability that a random graduate student is in Computer Science.
     Let's estimate it as 0.2, since Computer Science is a popular field.
   - \( P(E|H_{cs}) \): Probability that a Computer Science student has personality E.
     Given that Adam has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication, and high intelligence, which fits with computer science students; however, the specific traits like curiosity about nature and love for animals are not typical. Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{cs}) \) as 0.4.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{cs}) \): Probability that a non-Computer Science student has personality E.
     Considering that many fields can match his profile but not specifically Computer Science, let's estimate it as 0.3.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H_{ba}) \): Probability that a random graduate student is in Business Administration.
     Let's estimate it as 0.15, as it is also a popular field but slightly less than Computer Science.
   - \( P(E|H_{ba}) \): Probability that a Business Administration student has personality E.
     Given his curiosity about nature and love for animals, which is less typical in business fields, plus strong empathy and warmth which are important in business but not strongly indicative for this profile, let's estimate \( P(E|H_{ba}) \) as 0.3.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{ba}) \): Probability that a non-Business Administration student has personality E.
     Same reasoning as above, let's estimate it as 0.3.

Now let's compute the values \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for each field:

- For Computer Science:
  \[
  P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs}) = 0.4 \cdot 0.2 = 0.08
  \]

- For Business Administration:
  \[
  P(E|H_{ba}) \cdot P(H_{ba}) = 0.3 \cdot 0.15 = 0.045
  \]

We compare these values to find the relative likelihoods \( P(H|E) \):

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.08,
  "business administration": 0.045
}
```

These values represent the relative likelihoods of Adam being enrolled in each field given the personality sketch provided.
