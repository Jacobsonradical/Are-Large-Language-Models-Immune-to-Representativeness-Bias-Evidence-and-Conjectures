To evaluate the hypotheses \( H \) for Adam's potential graduate fields using Bayes' rule, we need to determine the probabilities for the following:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field with no additional information.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in some other field.
- \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field given his personality sketch.

We use Bayes' rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the evidence \( E \), computed as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Given that this is a simplified exercise, accurate probabilities for these fields based on Adam's personality sketch can only be estimated qualitatively. 

Let's denote:
- \( H_{CS} \): Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( H_{BA} \): Adam was enrolled in business administration.

### For Computer Science
1. **P(H_{CS}) (Prior probability)**: Generally, many graduate students are in computer science, but specific priors can be complex. We use a moderate prior due to the popularity of the field.
   - Estimated \( P(H_{CS}) \approx 0.20 \)

2. **P(E|H_{CS}) (Likelihood)**: Considering Adam's traits, which include high intelligence and a proclivity for problem-solving and understanding abstract concepts, this aligns moderately well with computer science.
   - Estimated \( P(E|H_{CS}) \approx 0.60 \)

3. **P(E|\neg H_{CS}) (Inverse likelihood)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is not in computer science, which could be somewhat high since his traits are not exclusive to computer science.
   - Estimated \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \approx 0.30 \)

### For Business Administration
1. **P(H_{BA}) (Prior probability)**: Business administration is also a commonly chosen field; however, his personality sketch seems less directly aligned with this field compared to his affinity for understanding abstract concepts.
   - Estimated \( P(H_{BA}) \approx 0.10 \)

2. **P(E|H_{BA}) (Likelihood)**: Adam's traits of high intelligence, hard work appreciation, and empathy are valuable in business administration as well, though perhaps less directly fitting compared to his affinity for puzzles and animals.
   - Estimated \( P(E|H_{BA}) \approx 0.40 \)

3. **P(E|\neg H_{BA}) (Inverse likelihood)**: The probability of observing Adam's traits if he is not in business administration might be higher, given his broader set of interests aligning more with sciences.
   - Estimated \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \approx 0.40 \)

We can simplify and focus on the product of likelihood and prior, normalizing later:

### Posterior Probabilities
Using:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

1. For Computer Science:

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto 0.60 \times 0.20 = 0.12 \]

2. For Business Administration:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto 0.40 \times 0.10 = 0.04 \]

To normalize the values to obtain posterior probabilities:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \approx \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.04} = \frac{0.12}{0.16} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx \frac{0.04}{0.12 + 0.04} = \frac{0.04}{0.16} = 0.25 \]

Here are the computed probabilities:
