To determine the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in a specific field based on his personality sketch \( E \), we need to consider the following:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the field
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in the field
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is not enrolled in that field

We'll then use Bayes' rule: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, let's assume that the prior probability \( P(H) \) for each field is equal and that \( P(E) \) can be adjusted appropriately across different fields. 

### Computer Science
- \( P(H) \), Prior: For simplicity, let’s assume \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.1 \) (hypothetical value).
- \( P(E|H) \): Considering Adam’s intelligence, sound understanding of abstract concepts, and curiosity about nature (which could include computational aspects of nature), it's reasonable to assume \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \) is high. Let's estimate a value of 0.6.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): This would be the general probability of having such personality traits irrespective of field, assumed to be 0.2 for illustration.

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.1}{0.6 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.18} = \frac{0.06}{0.24} = 0.25 \]

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \), Prior: For simplicity, let’s assume \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1 \) (hypothetical value).
- \( P(E|H) \): Business administration may not align as closely with Adam's personality traits. Let's estimate a value of 0.1.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): This general probability remains 0.2.

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.1 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.18} = \frac{0.01}{0.19} \approx 0.053 \]

Thus, the calculated posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.25,
  "business administration": 0.053
}
