To compute \( P(H|E) \) for the given fields (business administration and computer science), we'll start by estimating \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

1. **Baseline Assumptions**:
   - \( P(H) \) is the baseline probability that Adam is enrolled in each field.
   - \( P(E|H) \) is the probability that E (Adam's personality sketch) is true given that Adam is in that field.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability that E is true given Adam is not in that field. 

### For Business Administration:

1. **P(H) (Baseline Probability)**:
   Business administration is a common program, but given Adam's traits and interests, it's not very likely. Let's assume:
   \[
   P(\text{H}_{BA}) = 0.1
   \]

2. **P(E|H) (Probability of E given H)**:
   Adam’s traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy, solving puzzles) seem less aligned with a business administration profile:
   \[
   P(E|\text{H}_{BA}) = 0.1
   \]

3. **P(E|\neg H) (Probability of E given not H)**:
   Given that Adam's characteristics might better fit other fields:
   \[
   P(E|\neg \text{H}_{BA}) = 0.4
   \]

Now calculate \( P(\text{H}_{BA}|E) \) using Bayes' Rule:
\[
P(\text{H}_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{H}_{BA}) \cdot P(\text{H}_{BA})}{P(E)}
\]
Where:
\[
P(E) = P(E|\text{H}_{BA}) \cdot P(\text{H}_{BA}) + P(E|\neg \text{H}_{BA}) \cdot P(\neg \text{H}_{BA})
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.1 + 0.4 \cdot 0.9 = 0.01 + 0.36 = 0.37
\]
\[
P(\text{H}_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.37} \approx 0.027
\]

### For Computer Science:

1. **P(H) (Baseline Probability)**:
   Given Adam's high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts, he's quite likely to be in computer science:
   \[
   P(\text{H}_{CS}) = 0.3
   \]

2. **P(E|H) (Probability of E given H)**:
   Adam’s traits align well with computer science:
   \[
   P(E|\text{H}_{CS}) = 0.7
   \]

3. **P(E|\neg H) (Probability of E given not H)**:
   Since E fits computer science better than most other fields, assuming a lower probability:
   \[
   P(E|\neg \text{H}_{CS}) = 0.3
   \]

Now calculate \( P(\text{H}_{CS}|E) \) using Bayes' Rule:
\[
P(\text{H}_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{H}_{CS}) \cdot P(\text{H}_{CS})}{P(E)}
\]
Where:
\[
P(E) = P(E|\text{H}_{CS}) \cdot P(\text{H}_{CS}) + P(E|\neg \text{H}_{CS}) \cdot P(\neg \text{H}_{CS})
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.7 \cdot 0.3 + 0.3 \cdot 0.7 = 0.21 + 0.21 = 0.42
\]
\[
P(\text{H}_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.3}{0.42} \approx 0.5
\]

So, we get the probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.027,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```
