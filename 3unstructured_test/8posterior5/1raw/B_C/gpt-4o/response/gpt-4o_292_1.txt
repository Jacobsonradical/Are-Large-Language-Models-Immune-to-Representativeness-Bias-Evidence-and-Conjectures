To solve this using Bayes' theorem, we start by defining the terms and expressions involved:

1. **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.
2. **P(E|H):** The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in a particular field.
3. **P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not in that particular field.
4. **P(H|E):** The posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, since we are comparing two fields and only need the relative probabilities, the constant term \( P(E) \) can be normalized out.

### Business Administration

- **P(H):** Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in Business Administration.
  - Graduate programs in business administration are widespread, but not as common as some other fields like computer science.
  - Let's assume: \( P(H) \approx 0.05 \)

- **P(E|H):** Likelihood of the personality sketch given he is in Business Administration.
  - Highly empathetic, quiet, and love for nature and animals are not typical traits for business administration but are not impossible either.
  - Let's assume: \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \)

- **P(E|\neg H):** Likelihood of the personality sketch given he is not in Business Administration.
  - Given that Adam's traits seem less common in Business Administration, it's more likely he's in another field.
  - Let's assume: \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \)

### Computer Science

- **P(H):** Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in Computer Science.
  - Computer Science is a popular graduate field.
  - Let's assume: \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \)

- **P(E|H):** Likelihood of the personality sketch given he is in Computer Science.
  - Enjoying solving puzzles and high intelligence fits well with computer science. Empathy and interest in nature are less typical but not impossible.
  - Let's assume: \( P(E|H) \approx 0.4 \)

- **P(E|\neg H):** Likelihood of the personality sketch given he is not in Computer Science.
  - Assuming computer science has a higher likelihood of matching his traits compared to the general field,
  - Let's assume: \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \)

### Using Bayes' Theorem:

For Business Administration:
\[ P(\text{Business Admin}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{Business Admin}) \cdot P(\text{Business Admin})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{Business Admin}|E) \approx \frac{0.005}{P(E)} \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) \approx \frac{0.08}{P(E)} \]

To compare the likelihoods relatively:
\[ \frac{P(\text{Computer Science}|E)}{P(\text{Business Admin}|E)} = \frac{0.08/P(E)}{0.005/P(E)} = \frac{0.08}{0.005} = 16 \]

Thus:
\[ P(\text{Business Admin}|E) \approx \frac{1}{16 + 1} = \frac{1}{17} \approx 0.059 \]
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) \approx \frac{16}{17} = 0.941 \]

Final Answer:
{
  "business administration": 0.059,
  "computer science": 0.941
}
