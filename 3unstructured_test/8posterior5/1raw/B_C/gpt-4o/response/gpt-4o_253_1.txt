To compute the probabilities, we need to make some reasonable estimates:

1. P(H) — The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field.
2. P(E|H) — The probability that Adam has the personality sketch given he is in each field.
3. P(E|¬H) — The probability that Adam has the personality sketch given he is not in each field.

Without specific data, we'll use reasonable assumptions to estimate these probabilities based on typical attributes of students in these fields.

### Computer Science
- **P(H)**: The likelihood of Adam studying computer science as a graduate student. This could be estimated based on common enrollment in STEM fields.
  - Let's assume P(H) = 0.25 (25%), recognizing the high popularity of computer science.

- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality traits if he were in computer science.
  - Given Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and problem-solving skills, these align well with computer science, though the strong empathy and love for animals could be less common.
  - Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.5 (50%).

- **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality traits if he were not in computer science.
  - If he were not in computer science, these traits could still align with a variety of other fields but don't specifically argue against it.
  - Let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.4 (40%).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|¬H) \times P(¬H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \times 0.25}{0.5 \times 0.25 + 0.4 \times 0.75} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.125}{0.125 + 0.3} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.125}{0.425} \approx 0.294 \]

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: The likelihood of Adam studying business administration. This could be estimated based on common enrollment in non-STEM fields.
  - Let's assume P(H) = 0.15 (15%).

- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality traits if he were in business administration.
  - Adam's traits seem less aligned with the stereotypical personality of a business administration student, who might be more extroverted.
  - Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.3 (30%).

- **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality traits if he were not in business administration.
  - If he were not in business administration, his traits might align better with other fields.
  - Let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.45 (45%).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|¬H) \times P(¬H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.15}{0.3 \times 0.15 + 0.45 \times 0.85} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.3825} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.4275} \approx 0.105 \]

Therefore, our final results are:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.294,
  "business administration": 0.105
}
```
