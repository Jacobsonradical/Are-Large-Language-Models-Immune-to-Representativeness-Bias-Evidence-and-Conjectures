To begin, let's lay out our components for Bayes' theorem:

1. **P(H)** is the prior probability of Adam being in a given field.
2. **P(E|H)** is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch E if Adam were in a given field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)** is the probability of observing the personality sketch E if Adam were not in a given field.
4. **P(H|E)** is the posterior probability of Adam being in a given field given the personality sketch.

### Business Administration

- **P(H)**: The base rate for a student being enrolled in business administration. Let's assume P(H) is 0.2.
- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of a student in business administration having Adam's personality traits. Since business administration often involves an extroverted and people-focused skill set, this might be lower. Let's assign a value of 0.05.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of a student not in business administration having Adam's personality traits. Let's assume this is somewhat higher as Adam's traits are more fitting to fields outside traditional business administration. Let's say this is 0.3.

Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ P(E) = (0.05 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) = 0.01 + 0.24 = 0.25 \]

Therefore:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.2}{0.25} = \frac{0.01}{0.25} = 0.04 \]

### Computer Science

- **P(H)**: The base rate for a student being enrolled in computer science. Let's assume P(H) is 0.3.
- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of a student in computer science having Adam's personality traits. Given that computer science attracts individuals who are quiet, enjoy solving puzzles, and are intelligent, this likelihood is higher. Let's assign a value of 0.3.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of a student not in computer science having Adam's personality traits. Let's assign this a value of 0.15.

Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.3) + (0.15 \cdot 0.7) = 0.09 + 0.105 = 0.195 \]

Therefore:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.3}{0.195} = \frac{0.09}{0.195} \approx 0.462 \]

Putting it all together, we get the following posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.04,
  "computer science": 0.462
}
```
