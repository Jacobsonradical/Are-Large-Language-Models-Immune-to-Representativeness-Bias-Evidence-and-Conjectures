To calculate the probability \( P(H|E) \) of Adam being in a specific field given his personality sketch (E), we employ Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in the specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch given he is in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) represents the probability of observing his personality sketch given he is not in the specified field.

Since \( P(E) \) is common for both fields and in this context, we will consider relative probabilities. We need estimates or informed guesses for these values. 

### Business Administration
- **P(H):** Let's assume there is a broad distribution of graduate fields, and business administration is moderately common, though not as much as some technical fields. We might estimate \( P(\text{Business Administration}) \) to be around 0.1.
- **P(E|H):** Someone studying business administration typically might not align as closely with Adam's personality traits related to nature, empathy, and love for animals. Let's give this a 0.1.
- **P(E|\neg H):** Adam's traits are still somewhat rare, but there are other fields where his traits might be more common. Let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H)=0.2 \).

### Computer Science
- **P(H):** Let’s assume the prior for computer science is higher since it’s a popular graduate field, say 0.2.
- **P(E|H):** Adam’s traits involving high intelligence and abstract thinking are very compatible with computer science. Let’s assign this a 0.4.
- **P(E|\neg H):** Same as before, 0.2 since these traits are not exceedingly common across all fields.

Now applying Bayes' theorem:

### Business Administration
\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{Business Administration}) \cdot P(\text{Business Administration})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.2} = 0.05 \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.2} = 0.4 \]

Thus:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```
