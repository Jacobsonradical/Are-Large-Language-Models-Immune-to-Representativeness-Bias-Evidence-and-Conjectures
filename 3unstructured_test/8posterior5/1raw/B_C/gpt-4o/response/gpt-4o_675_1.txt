To tackle this question, let's evaluate each term for the fields of computer science and business administration as follows:

For each field \( H \):
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in that field without any additional information.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch (denoted by E) given that he is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in that field.

These will then be used to calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule: 

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, we will consider the relative probabilities, as the denominator \( P(E) \) would be the same for all comparisons.

### Computer Science (CS)

1. **\( P(H_{CS}) \)**: This can be estimated from general data on graduate fields. Let's assume there's a 15% chance Adam could be in CS.
2. **\( P(E|H_{CS}) \)**: Given that Adam enjoys solving puzzles, is of high intelligence, and good at abstract concepts, this aligns well with a CS student. Let's assign this a high value, say 0.8.
3. **\( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \)**: Given that Adam's personality sketch matches other fields as well, let's assume there is a 40% chance that someone not in CS could also have this personality, so 0.4.

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) = 0.8 \times 0.15 = 0.12 \]

### Business Administration (BA)

1. **\( P(H_{BA}) \)**: Assume there's a 10% chance Adam could be in Business Administration.
2. **\( P(E|H_{BA}) \)**: His strong empathy and understanding of dedication might slightly align with Business Administration, but it aligns less well than with CS. Let's assign this a moderate value, say 0.3.
3. **\( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \)**: Given that his personality sketch could fit other fields too, let's assume the same 40% chance, so 0.4.

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) = 0.3 \times 0.1 = 0.03 \]

Therefore, according to our calculations:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.12,
  "business administration": 0.03
}
```

This indicates that based on Adam's personality sketch, he is more likely to be enrolled in a computer science program than a business administration program.
