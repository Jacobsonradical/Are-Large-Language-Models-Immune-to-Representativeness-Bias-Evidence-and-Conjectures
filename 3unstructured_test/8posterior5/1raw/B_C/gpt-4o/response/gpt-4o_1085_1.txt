To solve this problem using Bayes' Rule, we need to calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis based on the provided personality sketch \( E \) of Adam. The formula for Bayes' Rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we don't have explicit values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \), we'll need to make reasonable assumptions based on general knowledge.

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: The general probability that a graduate student might be in Business Administration. Let's assume a reasonable starting value of 0.15.
2. **P(E|H)**: Given the personality traits provided, how likely is it that someone in Business Administration fits this description? Considering it's less typical for Business Administration students to have a strong focus on nature, puzzles, and animals, we can assume a low value around 0.05.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Given the personality traits, how likely are students in other fields (other than Business Administration) to fit this description? Since there are fields more aligned with Adam’s traits such as biology or environmental science, we assume 0.2 as a general estimate.

### Computer Science

1. **P(H)**: The general probability that a graduate student might be in Computer Science. Let's assume a reasonable starting value of 0.2.
2. **P(E|H)**: Given Adam’s personality traits, how likely is it that someone in Computer Science fits this description? Considering his love for solving puzzles and high intelligence, let’s assume this value is higher around 0.3.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Given the personality traits, how likely are students in fields other than Computer Science to fit this description? Given that this description is somewhat uncommon but fits Computer Science students moderately well, we’ll assume about 0.15.

Now we can apply Bayes’ Rule to calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field, where \( P(E) \) is the normalization factor ensuring the probabilities sum to 1 across all potential fields. Since we are not accounting for all possible fields, we simply compare the relative strengths of the outcomes for these two fields.

### Business Administration

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \]

### Computer Science

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

### Comparison

To make a relative comparison without calculating \( P(E) \), we simply look at the numerator terms:

For Business Administration:
\[ 0.05 \cdot 0.15 = 0.0075 \]

For Computer Science:
\[ 0.3 \cdot 0.2 = 0.06 \]

Upon normalization by the same factor \( P(E) \), Computer Science will have a much higher probability.

Here are the relative likelihoods:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

These values are not absolute probabilities but express the relative likelihood given the personality description and training data assumptions.
