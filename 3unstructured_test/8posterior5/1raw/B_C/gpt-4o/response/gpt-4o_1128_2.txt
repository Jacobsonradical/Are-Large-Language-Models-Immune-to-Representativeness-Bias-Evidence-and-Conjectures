To compute \( P(H|E) \) for both business administration and computer science fields using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate:

1. **Prior Probability (\(P(H)\))**: The initial probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field without considering the personality sketch.
2. **Likelihood (\(P(E|H)\))**: The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was in a certain field.
3. **Marginal Likelihood (\(P(E)\))**: The overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \), which can be calculated using \( P(E|H) \) and the prior probabilities for all hypotheses (both \( H \) and \( \neg H \)).
4. **Posterior Probability (\(P(H|E)\))**: The probability that Adam was in a certain field given the personality sketch, calculated using Bayes' rule.

Bayes' rule: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we don't have detailed data, we'll use reasonable assumptions about the likelihoods and priors:

### Business Administration

- **P(H)**: The base rate for business administration students among all graduate students can be assumed to be moderate. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.25 \).
- **P(E|H)**: The personality sketch \( E \) suggests a strong inclination towards nature, animals, and puzzles, which aligns less with typical business administration studies. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability of the personality traits \( E \) given Adam is not in business administration can be relatively higher since he may fit more naturally into other fields. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

So,
\[ P(H|E)_{business\ administration} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H)) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.4 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.025 + 0.3 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.325 \]

So,
\[ P(H|E)_{business\ administration} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.325} \approx 0.077 \]

### Computer Science

- **P(H)**: The base rate for computer science students among all graduate students is quite high. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.3 \).
- **P(E|H)**: Adam's traits such as high intelligence, abstract thinking, puzzle-solving, and empathy can align well with many areas in computer science. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.5 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability of these traits if not in computer science can be moderate. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.35 \).

So,
\[ P(H|E)_{computer\ science} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H)) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.5 \cdot 0.3 + 0.35 \cdot 0.7 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.15 + 0.245 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.395 \]

So,
\[ P(H|E)_{computer\ science} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.3}{0.395} \approx 0.38 \]
