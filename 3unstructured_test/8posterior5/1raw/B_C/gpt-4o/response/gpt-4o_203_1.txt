In order to calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis, we'll need to estimate the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihoods of the evidence not given the hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H) \). Here's the evaluation:

### Business Administration

- **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Business administration is a popular field, so let's assign a moderate prior probability: \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, etc.), it seems somewhat less likely he would enroll in business administration. People in business administration are often perceived to have different personality traits. Let's estimate: \( P(E|H) = 0.05 \).
- **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Considering the variety of fields other than business that might attract someone like Adam, this is relatively higher. Let's say: \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.25 \).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{0.05 \cdot 0.1 + 0.25 \cdot 0.9} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.225} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.23} \approx 0.0217 \]

### Computer Science

- **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Computer science is a very common graduate field, so let's assign a moderate prior: \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam’s puzzle-solving abilities and intelligence might align well with fields like computer science. So, a reasonably high estimate: \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \).
- **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: There are other fields that might also attract someone with Adam’s characteristics. Let's say: \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.15}{0.4 \cdot 0.15 + 0.3 \cdot 0.85} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.255} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.315} \approx 0.1905 \]

Here's the final output in the desired format:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0217,
  "computer science": 0.1905
}
```
