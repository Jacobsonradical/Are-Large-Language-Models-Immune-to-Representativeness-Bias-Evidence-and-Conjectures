To calculate the probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' Rule, we need to use the formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assuming we do not know exact prior probabilities or likelihoods for Adam's field of study without additional data, we can provide qualitative estimates based on his personality traits and interests.

Let's denote the hypotheses:
- \(H_{BA}\): Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \(H_{CS}\): Adam was enrolled in computer science.

To make reasonable estimates for:
1. \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field, without knowing anything about his personality sketch.
2. \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in a specific field.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not in a specific field.
4. \(P(E)\): The overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch, which can be derived, but we will compare relative likelihoods.

### Business Administration
- Adam's natural curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals do not strongly align with typical traits required for business administration.
- \(P(H_{BA})\): Let's assume prior equal likelihoods without extra data, so say 0.1 as a placeholder.
- \(P(E|H_{BA})\): Given Adam's traits, this doesn't strongly suggest business administration. Let's assign it a lower value, say 0.2.
- \(P(E|\neg H_{BA})\): Higher likelihood for other fields, say 0.8.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

### Computer Science
- Adam's high intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and understanding of abstract concepts strongly suggest computer science.
- \(P(H_{CS})\): Similar prior, say 0.1.
- \(P(E|H_{CS})\): High likelihood given his traits, say 0.7.
- \(P(E|\neg H_{CS})\): Lower compared to direct CS likelihood, say 0.3.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

Comparing the relative posterior probabilities (note: \(P(E)\) cancels in relative comparisons):

For business administration:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.1 = 0.02 \]

For computer science:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto 0.7 \cdot 0.1 = 0.07 \]

## Final Probabilities Based on Relative Likelihoods:
Normalized such that total = 1 for these 2 cases:

{
  "business administration": \( 0.02 / (0.02 + 0.07) = 0.22 \),
  "computer science": \( 0.07 / (0.02 + 0.07) = 0.78 \)
}

{
  "business administration": "0.22",
  "computer science": "0.78"
}
