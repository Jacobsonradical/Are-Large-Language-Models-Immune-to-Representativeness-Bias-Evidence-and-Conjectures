To estimate the probabilities, we'll need to make some logical assumptions based on the given information and typical characteristics of students in the specified fields.

Firstly, let's denote:
- \( H_{BA} \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( H_{CS} \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science.

Given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam:
- He enjoys nature, solving puzzles, has empathy, loves animals, and has high intelligence.

### Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)

We'll assume some prior probabilities based on the general distribution of graduate students in 2021. Let:
- \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.2 \) (20%)
- \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.25 \) (25%)

### Conditional Probabilities

Next, weâ€™ll judge \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \):

#### For Business Administration (BA):
- Traits like high intelligence and appreciation for hard work might fit, but love for nature, solving puzzles, and empathy are less strongly associated.
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \approx 0.1 \) (10%)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \approx 0.5 \) (50%)

#### For Computer Science (CS):
- High intelligence, solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts fit well. While love for nature and animals might be less common, they do not necessarily exclude someone from this field.
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \approx 0.3 \) (30%)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \approx 0.4 \) (40%)

### Bayes' Rule Calculation

To calculate \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We do not need the exact value of \( P(E) \) as we are only comparing the values for each field:

#### For Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.1 \times 0.2 + 0.5 \times 0.8} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.42} \approx 0.0476 \]

#### For Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \approx \frac{0.3 \times 0.25}{0.3 \times 0.25 + 0.4 \times 0.75} \approx \frac{0.075}{0.375} \approx 0.20 \]

Summarizing the final results:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0476,
  "computer science": 0.20
}
```

These probabilities suggest that given the personality sketch, Adam is more likely to have been enrolled in computer science than in business administration.
