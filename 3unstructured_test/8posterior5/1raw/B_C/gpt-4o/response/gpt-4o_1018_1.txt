To compute the probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science (H_CS) or business administration (H_BA) given the personality sketch (E) using Bayes' rule, we need to carefully estimate the prior probabilities \(P(H)\), likelihoods \(P(E|H)\), and the likelihoods of the evidence under the alternative hypothesis \(P(E|\neg H)\).

Let's start by making informed estimations:

1. **Prior Probabilities \(P(H)\)**:
   - The overall prior probability that a graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in computer science or business administration needs to be estimated. Without exact data, we can suggest approximate values:
     - \(P(H_{CS})\): Let's say about 10% of graduate students are in computer science.
     - \(P(H_{BA})\): Let's say about 15% of graduate students are in business administration.

2. **Likelihoods \(P(E|H)\)**:
   - For computer science:
     - Adam shows traits such as high intelligence, solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts, which seem compatible with computer science.
     - \(P(E|H_{CS})\): A heuristic estimate might be 0.4 (since many in computer science might share these traits, but they are not exclusive to the field).

   - For business administration:
     - While business administration requires intelligence and understanding hard work, Adam’s warm heart, empathy, and love for animals might be less typical in this field.
     - \(P(E|H_{BA})\): A heuristic estimate might be 0.1 (since the traits aren’t as closely aligned and might be rarer in the business administration field).

3. **Likelihoods of the evidence under the alternative hypothesis \(P(E|\neg H)\)**:
   - These represent the probability of observing Adam's traits if he is *not* in the specified field. Using a rough heuristic (considering a broad range of other fields):
     - For computer science:
       - \(P(E|\neg H_{CS})\): A heuristic value might be around 0.1, considering other fields like biology, psychology, etc.
     - For business administration:
       - \(P(E|\neg H_{BA})\): A heuristic value might be around 0.15, reflecting the wide variety of other disciplines that might match Adam’s personality traits.

Now we can use Bayes’ Rule to compute the posterior probabilities \(P(H|E)\):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

where \(P(E)\) can be computed using the law of total probability:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

For **computer science**:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \cdot P(\neg H_{CS})
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.4 \cdot 0.1 + 0.1 \cdot 0.9 = 0.04 + 0.09 = 0.13
\]
\[
P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.1}{0.13} \approx 0.3077
\]

For **business administration**:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \cdot P(\neg H_{BA})
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.15 + 0.15 \cdot 0.85 = 0.015 + 0.1275 = 0.1425
\]
\[
P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{0.1425} \approx 0.1053
\]

Summarizing the results:

{
  "computer science": 0.3077,
  "business administration": 0.1053
}

These are rough heuristic values based on the traits provided and common characteristics associated with these fields of study.
