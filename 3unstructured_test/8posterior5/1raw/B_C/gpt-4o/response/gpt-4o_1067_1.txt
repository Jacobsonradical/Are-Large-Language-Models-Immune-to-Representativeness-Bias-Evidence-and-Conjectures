To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' Theorem, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we don't need to compute \( P(E) \) explicitly if we are only comparing the relative probabilities of different hypotheses (fields of study) given the evidence (personality sketch). This is because \( P(E) \) is the same for all hypotheses and would cancel out when comparing relative probabilities.

Let's assign values to each component for both fields:

### Business Administration
Let's denote:
- P(H) = Prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in business administration.
- P(E|H) = Probability of observing E given that the student is in business administration.
- P(E|\neg H) = Probability of observing E given that the student is not in business administration.

Assumptions:
- P(H) for business administration: A relatively common graduate field, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
- P(E|H): The traits described don't particularly match the typical profile of a business administration student. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
- P(E|\neg H): Probability of observing E in non-business students. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

### Computer Science:
Let's denote:
- P(H) for computer science: Also a significant but common graduate field, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.25 \).
- P(E|H): The traits like solving puzzles and high intelligence with abstract concepts align well with computer science. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.6 \).
- P(E|\neg H): Probability of observing E in non-computer science students. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

Using Bayes' Theorem, we calculate:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

We can represent the results qualitatively as:

### Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

### Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.6 \cdot 0.25 = 0.15 \]

For simplicity and normalizing these representative values (optional), but in relative terms, they suggest that computer science is more likely.

Final Results:

{
  "business administration": "0.02",
  "computer science": "0.15"
