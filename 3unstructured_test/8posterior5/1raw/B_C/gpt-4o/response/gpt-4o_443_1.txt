To calculate the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\) for the fields "computer science" and "business administration," I'll use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the given field.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given he is enrolled in the field.
- \(P(E)\) is the normalizing constant (total probability of \(E\)), which can be calculated as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

We need to make some assumptions to estimate these probabilities:

### Computer Science
- **P(H) (prior for Computer Science)**: Let's assume there's a 20% chance Adam is enrolled in Computer Science.
  - \(P(H) = 0.20\)
  
- **P(E|H) (likelihood that Adam's personality fits given Computer Science)**: Given his high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and interest in puzzles, it seems moderately likely.
  - \(P(E|H) = 0.60\)
  
- **P(E|\neg H) (likelihood that Adam's personality fits given he is not in Computer Science)**: This includes all other fields, many of which might fit his profile as well.
  - \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.40\)
  
### Business Administration
- **P(H) (prior for Business Administration)**: Let's assume there's a 10% chance Adam is enrolled in Business Administration.
  - \(P(H) = 0.10\)
  
- **P(E|H) (likelihood that Adam's personality fits given Business Administration)**: While his traits like empathy and appreciation for hard work fit, his love for nature and solving puzzles is somewhat less typical.
  - \(P(E|H) = 0.30\)
  
- **P(E|\neg H) (likelihood that Adam's personality fits given he is not in Business Administration)**: Similar reasoning as above, though excluding a smaller set of fields.
  - \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.45\)

Let's calculate the posterior probabilities using these estimates.

### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.60 \cdot 0.20 + 0.40 \cdot 0.80 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.32 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.44 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.60 \cdot 0.20}{0.44} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.44} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.27 \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.30 \cdot 0.10 + 0.45 \cdot 0.90 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.03 + 0.405 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.435 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.30 \cdot 0.10}{0.435} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.435} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.07 \]

Thus,

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.27,
  "business administration": 0.07
}
```
