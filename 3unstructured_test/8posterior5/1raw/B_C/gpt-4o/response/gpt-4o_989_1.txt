To evaluate the probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch (E), we need to use Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule is given by: 

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality traits given he is not enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the personality traits across all potential fields (though we only compute relative probabilities).

Since we are only given high-level information, we will have to make reasonable assumptions about these probabilities.

**Business Administration:**
- \( P(H_{\text{business}}) \): Business Administration is a common graduate field, so let's assume a generic moderate probability. Say, \( P(H_{\text{business}}) = 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \): Considering Adam's love for nature, puzzles, animals, and abstract thinking, these traits might not be highly typical for business students. Let's assume a lower probability. Say, \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) = 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}}) \): The probability of observing these traits in students enrolled in other fields, let's set this to a moderate probability because traits like curiosity and empathy are common in many fields. Say, \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}}) = 0.5 \).

**Computer Science:**
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): Computer Science is also a common field. So let's assume a similar probability as business. Say, \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): Considering Adam's high intelligence, interest in solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts, this seems more probable. Say, \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.6 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \): The probability of observing these traits in students enrolled in other fields remains the same as for the business case. Say, \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.5 \).

To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

### Business Administration
\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}})}{P(E)} \]
Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing factor that will be the same for both fields, it can be ignored for relative comparison:

\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}}) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.6 \cdot 0.2 = 0.12 \]

### Normalizing These Values for Comparison:
Since \( P(H_{\text{business}}|E) + P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = 0.02 + 0.12 = 0.14 \):

- Normalized \( P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.14} \approx 0.14 \) 
- Normalized \( P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.14} \approx 0.86 \)

Based on these calculations:
\[ 
{
  "business administration": 0.14,
  "computer science": 0.86
}
\]
