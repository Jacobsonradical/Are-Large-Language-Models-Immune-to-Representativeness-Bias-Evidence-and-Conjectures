Sure, let's apply Bayes' rule to compute the probability that Adam is enrolled in each of the mentioned fields based on his personality sketch.

We will use the following steps:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in that field.
- \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch, calculated using Bayes' rule.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have exact numerical data, we will make reasonable assumptions for these probabilities.

Let's assume the following:
- Prior probabilities \( P(H) \):
  - Business administration has a moderate prevalence among graduate students, so we might assume \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.2 \).
  - Computer science is also quite common, so let's set \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.3 \).

- Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \):
  - For business administration, the personality traits such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy might be less aligned. We can assume \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.1 \).
  - For computer science, traits like solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts fit well. We can assume \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.5 \).

- Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \): This represents the likelihood of Adam's personality regardless of the specific fields. Given our assumptions, let's estimate:
  - \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.4 \) (as some aspects still align with other fields).
  - \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.2 \) (higher given the stronger fit of the personality traits with CS).

Now, let's calculate the posterior probabilities using Bayes' rule:

1. **Business Administration:**
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is constant in both cases, we will just focus on the numerator for relative comparison:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

2. **Computer Science:**
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]

Similarly, focusing on the numerator:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) = 0.5 \cdot 0.3 = 0.15 \]

To make the total probability add up to 1, we can normalize these results:

Normalization factor = \( 0.02 + 0.15 = 0.17 \)

Normalized probabilities:

1. **Business Administration:**
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.17} \approx 0.1176 \]

2. **Computer Science:**
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.15}{0.17} \approx 0.8824 \]

Thus, the probabilities that Adam is enrolled in each field, given his personality sketch, are:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1176",
  "computer science": "0.8824"
}
