To estimate the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to consider prior probabilities \( P(H) \), and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \). We then use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, we'll assume that \( P(H) \), the prior probability of being enrolled in a particular field, is roughly equal among all fields of graduate study. However, we need to adjust our priors slightly considering the nature of the fields involved.

### Business Administration

**P(H):** Business Administration is a common graduate field, but given Adam's personality sketch, it seems less likely. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.15 \).

**P(E|H):** The characteristics given in Adam's personality sketch (interest in nature, empathy, love for animals, etc.) don't typically align with someone studying Business Administration. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.05 \).

**P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood of E given not in Business Administration (meaning he could be in any other field) should reflect the fact that his traits might be more common in other fields. Assume this is \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

Using these estimates:

\[ \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E))} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.15}{0.05 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85} \approx 0.042 \]

### Computer Science

**P(H):** Computer Science is another common graduate field, and given Adam's intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles, this might fit better. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.25 \).

**P(E|H):** The characteristics (high intelligence, solving puzzles, understanding abstract concepts) align much more closely with Computer Science. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \).

**P(E|\neg H):** Here, we can assume as before that this is \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

Using these estimates:

\[ \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.25}{0.4 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75} \approx 0.571 \]

Thus, our final answers are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.042,
  "computer science": 0.571
}
