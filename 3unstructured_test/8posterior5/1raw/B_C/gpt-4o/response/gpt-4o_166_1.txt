To estimate the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch using Bayes' rule, we follow these steps:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll need to assign reasonable estimates for \(P(H)\), \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E|\neg H)\) for each of the fields. Here’s how we can approach it:

1. **Assign Prior Probabilities \(P(H)\)**: These represent the initial likelihoods of Adam enrolling in each field, before considering his personality sketch.
2. **Assign Likelihoods \(P(E|H)\)**: These represent how likely it is that someone enrolled in a particular field would have the attributes described in the personality sketch.
3. **Assign \(P(E|\neg H)\)**: These represent how likely it is that someone not enrolled in that particular field would have the attributes described.

### Business Administration

- **P(H)**: Business administration is a common field, but given Adam's traits (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals), it seems somewhat less likely.
  - Estimate: \(P(H) = 0.1\)

- **P(E|H)**: The personality traits described (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals) are not particularly associated with business administration students.
  - Estimate: \(P(E|H) = 0.05\)

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of these traits in the general graduate student population not studying business administration.
  - Estimate: \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.15\)

### Computer Science

- **P(H)**: Computer science is a broad and popular field. Adam’s intelligence and problem-solving ability fit well, but his specific interests in nature and animals make it a bit less likely.
  - Estimate: \(P(H) = 0.2\)

- **P(E|H)**: The combination of his traits fit only some computer science specializations (like AI related to natural sciences or bioinformatics), making it relatively less likely.
  - Estimate: \(P(E|H) = 0.1\)

- **P(E|\neg H)**: Likelihood of these traits in the general graduate population not studying computer science.
  - Estimate: \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.15\)

### Computing Posterior Probabilities

Now we apply Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probabilities \(P(H|E)\):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

For business administration:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{0.05 \cdot 0.1 + 0.15 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.135} \approx 0.0357 \]

For computer science:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.15 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.12} \approx 0.1429 \]

Given these calculations, the estimates for \(P(H|E)\) are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0357,
  "computer science": 0.1429
}
```

These posterior probabilities indicate that, given his personality sketch, Adam is more likely to be a student in computer science than in business administration, but both probabilities are relatively low, suggesting other fields might be more likely given his attributes.
