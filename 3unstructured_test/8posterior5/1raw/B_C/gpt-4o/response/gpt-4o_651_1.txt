To calculate \(P(H|E)\) for each field, we'll use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to estimate:

1. \( P(H) \) - The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or business administration.
2. \( P(E|H) \) - The probability that Adam's personality sketch E would be observed given that he was in the respective field H.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - The probability that Adam's personality sketch E would be observed given that he was not in the respective field H.

Finally, we'll assume \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields for simplicity since we're comparing relative probabilities.

### Computer Science

1. \(P(H)\): Let's assume computer science is a moderately popular field for graduate studies. We might set this prior as somewhat high, say 0.3.
2. \(P(E|H)\): Given Adam's characteristics such as high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and enjoyment of puzzles, he seems well-suited to computer science. Let's assign a high probability, say 0.7.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): For simplicity, we assume Adam's characteristics could broadly fit several fields, but not perfectly align like they do with computer science. Assume 0.4.

### Business Administration

1. \(P(H)\): Business administration is also a popular field, but a bit less traditional for someone with Adam's characteristics. Let's set the prior as lower than computer science, say 0.2.
2. \(P(E|H)\): Given Adam's characteristics of empathy, appreciation for hard work, and intelligence, he still fits this field reasonably well. Let's assign a moderate probability, say 0.5.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): Similar to computer science, but slightly higher due to more general applicability of the traits. Assume 0.5.

### Bayes' Rule Calculations

#### Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} = \frac{0.21}{P(E)} \]

#### Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1}{P(E)} \]

Since \(P(E)\) is the same in both cases, we compare the numerators directly:

\[ \frac{0.21}{P(E)} \text{ for computer science versus } \frac{0.1}{P(E)} \text{ for business administration} \]

In relative terms:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.21,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These values show that given Adam's personality traits, he is more likely to have been enrolled in computer science than in business administration, though the actual numerical probabilities would depend on the true value of \(P(E)\).
