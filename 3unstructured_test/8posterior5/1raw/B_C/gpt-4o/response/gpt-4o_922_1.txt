In order to compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch, we use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we don't have exact values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), or \( P(E|\neg H) \). Instead, we base our judgments on qualitative assessments and typical frequencies of students in different fields. Let's proceed with these assessments for business administration and computer science.

### Business Administration

1. **P(H):** The prior probability that a student is enrolled in business administration—let's arbitrarily assume this to be \(0.1\) (roughly 10% of grad students might be in business-related fields).

2. **P(E|H):** Given that a student is in business administration, how likely are they to have this personality sketch?
   - Not especially high: while some traits like understanding hard work might fit, curiosity about nature, love for animals and strong empathy aren't typically pertinent to business administration.
   - Let's estimate this as \(0.05\).

3. **P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood of having this personality sketch in any other field.
   - Might be relatively high since traits like empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature could fit fields like biology or environmental science.
   - Let's estimate this as \(0.5\).

### Computer Science

1. **P(H):** The prior probability that a student is enrolled in computer science—more popular among grad students, so let's assume \(0.2\) (roughly 20%).

2. **P(E|H):** Given that a student is in computer science, how likely are they to have this personality sketch?
   - A higher match: good fit for puzzle-solving, high intelligence, and abstract concepts.
   - Let's estimate this as \(0.3\).

3. **P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood of having this personality sketch in any other field.
   - Relatively high for reasons similar to the previous assessment.
   - Let's estimate this as \(0.5\).

Now, let's calculate using Bayes' rule:

#### Business Administration

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

#### Computer Science

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

Since we are only comparing two hypotheses, \(P(E)\) can be ignored as a normalizing factor for comparison purposes:

#### Business Administration:

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.005 \]

#### Computer Science:

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.06 \]

To get comparable probabilities, normalize these:

- Total \( = 0.005 + 0.06 = 0.065 \)
- Normalize each:

#### Business Administration:

\[ \frac{0.005}{0.065} \approx 0.077 \]

#### Computer Science:

\[ \frac{0.06}{0.065} \approx 0.923 \]

Therefore, our posterior probabilities would be:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.077,
  "computer science": 0.923
}
