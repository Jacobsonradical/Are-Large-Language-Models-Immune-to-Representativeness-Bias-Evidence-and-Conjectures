To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we'll need to estimate the values of \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \):

Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

### Computer Science
1. **P(H):** Probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Since computer science is a popular field but not overwhelming for someone with Adam's personality traits, let's estimate \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \).

2. **P(E|H):** Probability of E given Adam is enrolled in computer science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts fit well with computer science, though not all aspects (like nature and plants) align. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.4 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H):** Probability of E given Adam is not enrolled in computer science. This covers many fields where his traits might fit, so let’s estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

We'll need \( P(E) \), which can be approximated from \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \). Estimating:

\[ P(E) \approx (0.4 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) = 0.04 + 0.18 = 0.22 \]

Thus,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.1}{0.22} \approx 0.1818 \]

### Business Administration
1. **P(H):** Probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Given typical business administration students, let's estimate \( P(H) \approx 0.05 \).

2. **P(E|H):** Probability of E given Adam is enrolled in business administration. Business administration doesn't typically require a deep love for nature or animals but can involve empathy and intelligence. Let’s estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H):** As before, broadening to many fields makes \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} \]

Using the same \( P(E) \approx 0.22 \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.05}{0.22} \approx 0.0455 \]

Therefore, the results are:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.1818",
  "business administration": "0.0455"
}
