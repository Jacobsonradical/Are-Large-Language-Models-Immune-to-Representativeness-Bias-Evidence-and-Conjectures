To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis using Bayes' rule, we'll break down the individual components and then combine them. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where \( P(E) \) can be computed as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

We'll need to make some assumptions about the priors (\( P(H) \)) and likelihoods (\( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \)). These assumptions will be based on general knowledge of the fields and the personality sketch of Adam.

1. Business Administration (H = Business Administration)
    - \( P(H) \): Generally, assume that being a graduate student in business administration has a modest probability. Let's say \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

    - \( P(E|H) \): The personality traits described in E do not strongly align with typical traits required for success in business administration. We might expect a lower probability here. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): This is the probability that Adam's personality sketch is true given that he is not in business administration. Since there are many other fields that may better match his description, this will be relatively high. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.9 \).

2. Computer Science (H = Computer Science)
    - \( P(H) \): Being a graduate student in computer science has become increasingly common. Let's say \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

    - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's traits such as high intelligence, problem-solving skills, and appreciation for hard work align significantly with the field of computer science. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).

    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the personality traits given that he is not in computer science might still be substantial but somewhat less than the direct match. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \).

We can now compute \( P(E) \) for each hypothesis:

For Business Administration:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.1) + (0.9 \times 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.01 + 0.81 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.82 \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \times 0.2) + (0.6 \times 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.14 + 0.48 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.62 \]

Now we use Bayes' rule for each:

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.1}{0.82} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.82} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.012 \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.2}{0.62} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.14}{0.62} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.226 \]

Thus, the probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": 0.012,
  "computer science": 0.226
}
