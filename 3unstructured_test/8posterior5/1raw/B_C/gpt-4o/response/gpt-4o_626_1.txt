Sure, let's break this down step-by-step for each field. We will denote the probabilities as follows:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in the field \( H \).
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam, given his personality sketch \( E \), is enrolled in the field \( H \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that Adam, given his personality sketch \( E \), is not enrolled in the field \( H \).
- \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in the field \( H \), given his personality sketch \( E \).

### Business Administration

- **\( P(H) \)** (prior): Business Administration is a popular field, but not overwhelmingly so among all graduate students. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
- **\( P(E|H) \)** (likelihood if in field): The traits described in the personality sketch – empathy, love for nature and animals, high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work – aren't particularly typical for business administration students, but they are also not incompatible. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).
- **\( P(E| \neg H) \)** (likelihood if not in field): Given that these traits might be more common in other fields (like life sciences or environmental studies), let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E| \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.3 \cdot 0.1 + 0.6 \cdot 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.03 + 0.54 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.57 \]

Thus,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.57} = \frac{0.03}{0.57} \approx 0.053 \]

### Computer Science

- **\( P(H) \)** (prior): Computer Science is a very common field for graduate students in the U.S. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
- **\( P(E|H) \)** (likelihood if in field): The traits described – high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, enjoying solving puzzles – are quite typical for computer science students. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.6 \).
- **\( P(E| \neg H) \)** (likelihood if not in field): Given his traits might be common in other fields but to a bit lesser degree, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

Using Bayes' theorem again:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E| \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.6 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.32 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.44 \]

Thus,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{0.44} = \frac{0.12}{0.44} \approx 0.273 \]

Putting it all together, we have:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.053,
  "computer science": 0.273
}
```

These probabilities indicate that given Adam's personality sketch, he is much more likely to be enrolled in computer science than business administration, though neither probability sums to 1 due to the existence of other fields he could be enrolled in.
