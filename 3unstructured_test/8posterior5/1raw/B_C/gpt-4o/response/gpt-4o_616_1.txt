Certainly! To apply Bayes' rule, we need to determine the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of being enrolled in each field (business administration or computer science).
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam having the personality sketch \( E \) given he is enrolled in a specific field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam having the personality sketch \( E \) given he is not enrolled in the specific field.
4. \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability of being enrolled in each field given the personality sketch \( E \).

For simplicity, let's assume that \( P(H) \) is the same for both business administration and computer science, but realistically, these priors would depend on the popularity of these fields among graduate students.

For \( P(E|H) \):

1. Business administration typically attracts individuals with a focus on leadership, management, and human resources rather than a deep curiosity about nature and abstract problem-solving.
2. Computer science attracts individuals with strong problem-solving skills, appreciation for abstract concepts, and often an interest in nature through subjects like bioinformatics, robotics, or environmental simulations.

So, we can reasonably approximate \( P(E|H) \):

\[
P(E|H=\text{business administration}) \approx 0.1
\]
\[
P(E|H=\text{computer science}) \approx 0.5
\]

For \( P(E|\neg H) \):

- Assuming "not being in business administration" or "not being in computer science" leads to a broad range of other fields, the probabilities might be lower because other fields would also have specific personality fit criteria.

\[
P(E|\neg H=\text{business administration}) \approx 0.2
\]
\[
P(E|\neg H=\text{computer science}) \approx 0.3
\]

Let's assume \( P(H) \) uniformly (for simplicity):

\[
P(H=\text{business administration}) = 0.1
\]
\[
P(H=\text{computer science}) = 0.1
\]

Applying Bayes' rule:

For business administration:

\[
P(H=\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|H=\text{business administration}) \cdot P(H=\text{business administration})}{P(E)}
\]

\( P(E) \) includes all possible fields (it will be part of normalization so we can ignore it for relative comparison):

\[
P(H=\text{business administration}|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.1 = 0.01
\]

For computer science:

\[
P(H=\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|H=\text{computer science}) \cdot P(H=\text{computer science})}{P(E)}
\]

\[
P(H=\text{computer science}|E) \propto 0.5 \times 0.1 = 0.05
\]

Normalizing \( P(H|E) \):

\[
P(H=\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.05} = \frac{1}{6} \approx 0.167
\]

\[
P(H=\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.05}{0.01 + 0.05} = \frac{5}{6} \approx 0.833
\]

Therefore, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.167,
  "computer science": 0.833
}
```
