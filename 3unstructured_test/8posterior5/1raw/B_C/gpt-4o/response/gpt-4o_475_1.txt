Let's use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field, given the personality sketch of Adam.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field given the personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch.

For simplicity, \( P(E) \) can be considered a normalizing factor to ensure the probabilities sum up to 1 for all possible fields. However, since we don't have all the fields and our requirements don't need them to sum up to 1, we can ignore \( P(E) \) in the calculation as long as we keep the relative ratios.

Let's try to make reasonable estimations:

1. **Business Administration**
   - \( P(H) \): Prior probability of a graduate student being in business administration.
     - Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \) based on the general distribution of fields in graduate programs.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Probability of observing the personality sketch given Adam is in business administration. 
     - Business administration students might have strong empathy and appreciation for hard work, but curiosity about nature, love for animals, and interest in puzzles aren't strongly associated with this field. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of observing the personality sketch given Adam is in any other field.
     - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \) as a rough average.

2. **Computer Science**
   - \( P(H) \): Prior probability of a graduate student being in computer science.
     - Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.3 \) based on the general distribution of fields in graduate programs.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Probability of observing the personality sketch given Adam is in computer science.
     - Curiosity, interest in puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts align well with computer science. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of observing the personality sketch given Adam is in any other field.
     - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \) as a rough average.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

### Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.02}{P(E)} \]

### Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} = \frac{0.21}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is just a normalizing factor:

{
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.21} \approx 0.087 \),
  "computer science": \( \frac{0.21}{0.02 + 0.21} \approx 0.913 \)
}

So the answer is:

{
  "business administration": "0.087",
  "computer science": "0.913"
}

This means that given the personality sketch of Adam, it is much more likely that he was enrolled in computer science rather than business administration.
