To apply Bayes' rule effectively and compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field, let's first break down the steps:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in that field.

For simplicity, let's assume generic prior probabilities for each field and calculate \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \) based on the typical characteristics and compatibilities of the fields with Adam's personality.

### Business Administration

1. **\( P(H) \)**: Let's assume the prior probability \( P(H) \) of enrolling in Business Administration is fairly common.
   \[
   P(\text{BA}) = 0.2
   \]

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: Business Administration students may vary widely in personality, but characteristics like a strong appreciation for hard work might be beneficial. However, curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and love for animals are less common traits in this field.
   \[
   P(E|\text{BA}) = 0.1
   \]

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The general likelihood of the personality traits (empathy, love for nature and animals, etc.) across all other fields.
   \[
   P(E|\neg \text{BA}) = 0.8
   \]

Using Bayes' rule:
\[
P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{BA}) \cdot P(\text{BA})}{P(E)}
\]
Where \( P(E) = P(E|\text{BA}) \cdot P(\text{BA}) + P(E|\neg \text{BA}) \cdot P(\neg \text{BA}) \).

\[
P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.8 \cdot 0.8 = 0.02 + 0.64 = 0.66
\]

\[
P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.66} \approx 0.030
\]

### Computer Science

1. **\( P(H) \)**: Let's assume the prior probability \( P(H) \) of enrolling in Computer Science is also fairly common.
   \[
   P(\text{CS}) = 0.2
   \]

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: Computer Science students often have high intelligence and skills in abstract thinking and problem-solving, which align well with Adam's love for solving puzzles.
   \[
   P(E|\text{CS}) = 0.6
   \]

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The general likelihood of the personality traits (high intelligence, strong empathy, and love for animals) across all other fields.
   \[
   P(E|\neg \text{CS}) = 0.3
   \]

Using the same method:
\[
P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(E)}
\]
Where \( P(E) = P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(E|\neg \text{CS}) \cdot P(\neg \text{CS}) \).

\[
P(E) = 0.6 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8 = 0.12 + 0.24 = 0.36
\]

\[
P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{0.36} \approx 0.333
\]

### Summary

Thus, the probabilities computed using Bayes' rule interpreted in terms of Adam's personality traits are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.030,
  "computer science": 0.333
}
