To calculate the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to follow these steps:
1. **Assign prior probabilities** \( P(H) \) for each field.
2. **Estimate \( P(E|H) \)**, which is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in the field.
3. **Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \)**, which is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is *not* enrolled in the field.
4. Use Bayes' rule to calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where \( P(E) \) is the same for all fields and can be considered as a normalizing constant.

Since the actual values are not given, we'll make some reasonable assumptions for these probabilities.

### Business Administration
1. **Prior Probability (\( P(H) \))**:
   - Let's assume a prior probability of 0.1 for this field because Business Administration is fairly common, but considering Adam’s personality sketch, it seems less directly related to his interests.

2. **Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \))**:
   - Given Adam's personality (interest in nature, solving puzzles, empathy, love for animals), it seems less likely he’d be in this field. Let’s assume \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).

3. **Likelihood of Not Enrolled (\( P(E|\neg H) \))**:
   - This is the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch being observed given he is not in Business Administration. Assuming all other fields, let's set \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.8 \).

### Computer Science
1. **Prior Probability (\( P(H) \))**:
   - Let's assume a prior probability of 0.2 for this field as Computer Science is also quite common among graduate programs, and Adam's high intelligence and affinity for solving puzzles fit this field well.

2. **Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \))**:
   - Given his love for abstract concepts and problem-solving, this seems more aligned with Computer Science. Let’s assume \( P(E|H) = 0.6 \).

3. **Likelihood of Not Enrolled (\( P(E|\neg H) \))**:
   - This reflects the likelihood of Adam's personality if he’s not in Computer Science. Assuming all other fields, let’s set \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \).

### Bayes' Rule Calculation
Now, let's calculate \( P(H|E) \):

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.02}{P(E)} \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.6 \times 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.12}{P(E)} \]

Combining these probabilities:
\[ P(E) = \sum (P(E|H) \cdot P(H)) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \times 0.1 + 0.6 \times 0.2) + \text{other fields} \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.02 + 0.12 = 0.14 \]

### Final Probabilities
For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.14} \approx 0.143 \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.14} \approx 0.857 \]

Thus, the probabilities are:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.143,
  "computer science": 0.857
}
```

These numbers suggest it's significantly more likely, given his personality sketch, that Adam is in a Computer Science program rather than Business Administration.
