To determine \( P(H|E) \), we need to use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the personality sketch of Adam, let's assess the probabilities for each field:

### For Business Administration

- **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that Adam is in Business Administration. Since we have no specific prior information about Adam's likelihood of being in different fields, we can assume it to be relatively low for Business Administration given his interests.
  - Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

- **P(E|H)**: The probability of the evidence given that Adam is in Business Administration. Given his strong ability in abstract concepts, this might be relevant, but his love for nature, animals, and puzzles doesn't align well with typical characteristics for business administration.
  - Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of the evidence given that Adam is not in Business Administration. This includes all fields except Business Administration, including potentially Computer Science.
  - Considering his interests align more with other fields (like natural sciences), \( P(E | \neg H) \) would be higher.
  - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \).

### For Computer Science

- **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that Adam is in Computer Science. Given his analytical nature and interest in puzzles, this might be higher than Business Administration.
  - Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

- **P(E|H)**: The probability of the evidence given that Adam is in Computer Science. His skills in abstract thinking align well with Computer Science, though his love for nature and plants might not be a direct fit.
  - Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.5 \).

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of the evidence given that Adam is not in Computer Science. This includes all other fields including potentially fields closely aligned with his interests.
  - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \) (same as above, as his evidence strongly suggests non-CS fields as well).

Now we calculate \( P(H|E) \):

### Business Administration

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assuming \( P(E) \approx 0.5 \) (a rough average for normalization in this context):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.5} = \frac{0.02}{0.5} = 0.04 \]

### Computer Science

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.5} = \frac{0.1}{0.5} = 0.2 \]

Thus, using the values calculated above, our final answer for the probabilities is:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.04,
  "computer science": 0.2
}
