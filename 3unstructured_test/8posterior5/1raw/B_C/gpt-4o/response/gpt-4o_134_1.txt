To evaluate the probability that Adam was enrolled in each field, we can use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll need to estimate:
1. \( P(H) \): the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): the probability that Adam would have the described personality sketch given that he is enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): the probability of the personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in that field.
4. \( P(E) \): the overall probability of the personality sketch, which can be derived from \( P(E|H) \) for each field, weighted by \( P(H) \).

We will make the following estimations:

### Business Administration

1. \( P(H) \):
   - Assume the probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in business administration is around 0.1.

2. \( P(E|H) \):
   - Business administration students typically focus on management, entrepreneurship, finance, etc., which does not strongly correlate with the described personality sketch. However, some may still have similar traits. Estimate \( P(E|H) \) to be fairly low, say 0.1.

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \):
   - Given that there are many fields that can fit Adam's personality better, let's estimate this probability to be higher, say 0.3.

### Computer Science

1. \( P(H) \):
   - Assume the probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in computer science is around 0.15.

2. \( P(E|H) \):
   - Computer science students may be more likely to enjoy solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, which fits well with Adam's personality. Estimate \( P(E|H) \) to be relatively high, say 0.5.

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \):
   - Similar reasoning as in the business administration case. Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) to be around 0.3.

Now, let's calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each:

### Business Administration
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) = 0.1 \times 0.1 + 0.3 \times (1 - 0.1) = 0.01 + 0.27 = 0.28 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.1}{0.28} \approx 0.0357 \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) = 0.5 \times 0.15 + 0.3 \times (1 - 0.15) = 0.075 + 0.255 = 0.33 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.5 \times 0.15}{0.33} \approx 0.227 \]

Thus, collecting these together:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.0357",
  "computer science": "0.227"
}
```

These values provide an approximate relative likelihood of Adam being enrolled in each of these fields given his personality traits and background.
