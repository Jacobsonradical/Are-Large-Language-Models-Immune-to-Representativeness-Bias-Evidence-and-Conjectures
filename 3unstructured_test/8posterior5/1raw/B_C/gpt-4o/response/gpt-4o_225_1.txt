To apply Bayes' theorem to this problem, we need to consider the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field without any additional information.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in a specific field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in that specific field.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the evidence.

We will make some reasonable assumptions to proceed with the calculation.

### Prior Probability \( P(H) \)
Let's assume the prior probability \( P(H) \) for each field is the same, given that there are many fields Adam could be enrolled in:

\[ P(H) = \frac{1}{N} \]

For simplicity, let's assume there are 10 possible fields (N=10). So,
\[ P(H) = \frac{1}{10} = 0.1 \]

### Likelihood \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \)
Now estimate the likelihood based on the personality sketch provided:

- **Business Administration**: This field may involve less direct engagement with nature and abstract concepts, and may not necessarily align well with a love for animals or solving puzzles.
  - \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): Low (e.g., 0.1)

- **Computer Science**: This field involves solving puzzles, abstract concepts, and possibly some applications involving nature and empathy (e.g., AI for conservation).
  - \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): High (e.g., 0.6)

For \( P(E|\neg H) \), let's approximate it as the average likelihood of the personality traits across all other fields (for simplicity).

If we assume the average \( P(E|\neg H) \) for other fields is around 0.3.

### Calculation using Bayes' Theorem
Now compute \( P(H|E) \) for both fields.

\[
P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)}
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)}
\]

### Simplifying for relative comparison
Since \( P(E) \) is the same in both cases, we focus on the numerators for relative comparison:

- For Business Administration:
\[ \text{Numerator for } H_{\text{BA}} = 0.1 \times 0.1 = 0.01 \]

- For Computer Science:
\[ \text{Numerator for } H_{\text{CS}} = 0.6 \times 0.1 = 0.06 \]

From these, we observe \( P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \) is relatively higher because of the higher likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \).

### Normalized Probabilities
To get more precise, we normalize these probabilities by their sum:

\[
P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.06} \approx 0.1429
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.01 + 0.06} \approx 0.8571
\]

So, the resulting probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1429,
  "computer science": 0.8571
}
```
