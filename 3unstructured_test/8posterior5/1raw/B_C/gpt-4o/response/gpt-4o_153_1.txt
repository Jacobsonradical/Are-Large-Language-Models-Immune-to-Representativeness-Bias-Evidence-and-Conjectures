First, let's break down the required probabilities for both fields.

### Field: Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: The general probability that a graduate student is enrolled in Business Administration.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is in Business Administration.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is not in Business Administration.

### Field: Computer Science

1. **P(H)**: The general probability that a graduate student is enrolled in Computer Science.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is in Computer Science.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is not in Computer Science.

### Assumptions and Estimations

- **P(H) for Both Fields**: Let's assume the following estimations based on general popularity and availability of programs:
  - Business Administration: 0.2 (20%)
  - Computer Science: 0.3 (30%)

- **P(E|H) for Business Administration**: The sketch does not fit the typical business administration profile closely; a subject with a strong focus on nature, puzzles, animals, and abstract concepts might less likely be in this field:
  - Estimated: 0.1 (10%)

- **P(E|H) for Computer Science**: The sketch fits reasonably well with computer science, which involves high intelligence, abstract thinking, and problem-solving. However, the nature and empathy aspect might be less common:
  - Estimated: 0.4 (40%)

- **P(E|\neg H)**: For both, assume the presence of Adam's traits is somewhat unique compared to the general grad student population:
  - Business Administration: 0.2 (20%) assuming non-H could include any field
  - Computer Science: 0.2 (20%) assuming non-H could include any field

### Calculations Using Bayes Rule

#### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.2 \cdot (1-0.2)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.16} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.02}{0.18} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} \approx 0.111 \]

#### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{0.4 \cdot 0.3 + 0.2 \cdot (1-0.3)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.14} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.12}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} \approx 0.462 \]
