To apply Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probabilities \(P(H|E)\), we need to consider the following:

- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability that a student is in a particular field (e.g., computer science or business administration).
- \(P(E|H)\) is the probability of observing the evidence given that the student is enrolled in the field.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\) is the probability of observing the evidence given that the student is not enrolled in the field.

Given that there are other fields not specified in the hypothesis, the total may not add up to 1.

However, without specific data on each of these probabilities, we can make reasonable assumptions to estimate them, based on the given personality sketch of Adam.

### Computer Science:

**P(H):** Let's assume a small prior probability, given there are many possible fields. Let's denote this as 0.1.

**P(E|H):** Computer science students often exhibit high intelligence and an ability to understand abstract concepts, but the strong empathy, love for animals, and nature curiosity might be less aligned with typical computer science characteristics. Let's estimate this probability at 0.3.

**P(E|\neg H):** The evidence provided is general enough that it could apply to many fields. Let's estimate this as 0.4.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have \( P(E) \) directly, we consider it as a normalizing constant across different fields. The relative value is enough for comparison.

### Business Administration:

**P(H):** Let's assume the prior is the same as for computer science, which is 0.1.

**P(E|H):** Business administration students might not typically be characterized by a love for nature or solving puzzles, but they can have high intelligence and an appreciation for hard work. Let's estimate this as 0.2.

**P(E|\neg H):** Same as for computer science, let's estimate this as 0.4.

Using Bayes' rule, the calculation steps are similar.

Given these qualitative assessments and for simplicity, let's normalize and present the results. Using Bayes' ruleâ€™s relative relationships, we would get:

\[
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H)
\]

**For computer science:**
\[
P(H|E) \propto 0.3 \cdot 0.1 = 0.03
\]

**For business administration:**
\[
P(H|E) \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.1 = 0.02
\]

Normalizing these values (which would mean dividing by their sum for proportional comparison):

Total sum = 0.03 + 0.02 = 0.05

**Normalized values:**
\(
\text{Computer science estimate} = \frac{0.03}{0.05} = 0.6
\)
\(
\text{Business administration estimate} = \frac{0.02}{0.05} = 0.4
\)

So, our estimates are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.4
}
```
