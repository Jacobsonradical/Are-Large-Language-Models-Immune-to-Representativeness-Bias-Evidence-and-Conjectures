To answer this question, we need to carefully consider the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis is false \( P(E|\neg H) \). Then, we use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \).

Let's break it down for each field:

### Business Administration

#### Step 1: Estimate \( P(H) \)
This is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a business administration program. Without specific data, we can assume a general estimate based on the popularity of various graduate programs.

Let's assume:
\[ P(\text{business administration}) = 0.1 \]

#### Step 2: Estimate \( P(E|H) \)
This is the likelihood that Adam's personality traits match those typically associated with business administration students. Business administration students might not typically have a strong emphasis on nature, animals, or solving puzzles, so we might rate this as relatively low.

Let's assume:
\[ P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.05 \]

#### Step 3: Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \)
This would be the probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he were not in a business administration program. Given his traits seem more aligned with other fields like biology or environmental science, we might rate this higher than for business administration.

Let's assume:
\[ P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) = 0.3 \]

### Step 4: Compute \( P(\text{business administration}|E) \)
Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} \]

Where:

\[ P(E) = P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) + P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) \cdot P(\neg \text{business administration}) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.05 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) = 0.005 + 0.27 = 0.275 \]

Thus,

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{0.275} = \frac{0.005}{0.275} = 0.018 \]

### Computer Science

#### Step 1: Estimate \( P(H) \)
Again, let's assume a general estimate based on the popularity of various graduate programs.

Let's assume:
\[ P(\text{computer science}) = 0.2 \]

#### Step 2: Estimate \( P(E|H) \)
This is the likelihood that Adam's personality traits match those typically associated with computer science students. Given his high intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles, this likelihood is higher.

Let's assume:
\[ P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.4 \]

#### Step 3: Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \)
This would be the probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he was not in a computer science program.

Let's assume:
\[ P(E|\neg \text{computer science}) = 0.25 \]

### Step 4: Compute \( P(\text{computer science}|E) \)
Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} \]

Where:

\[ P(E) = P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) + P(E|\neg \text{computer science}) \cdot P(\neg \text{computer science}) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.4 \cdot 0.2) + (0.25 \cdot 0.8) = 0.08 + 0.2 = 0.28 \]

Thus,

\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.28} = \frac{0.08}{0.28} = 0.286 \]

### Final Results

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.018,
  "computer science": 0.286
}
```

Note that these values are hypothetical and provided based on assumed probabilities. In a real-world scenario, you'd need more specific data to make accurate estimations.
