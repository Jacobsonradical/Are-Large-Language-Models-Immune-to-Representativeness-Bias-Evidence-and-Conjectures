To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or computer science given his personality sketch \(E\), we use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in that particular field.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in that particular field.

Let's analyze each field separately:

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that a graduate student is in business administration. Let's assume a general distribution of fields and assign a value, like 0.1.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is in business administration. A genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and solving puzzles seem less common in business administration but not impossible. Let's assume it to be relatively low, say 0.1.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is not in business administration. Given that Adam's traits are more aligned with other fields like natural sciences, let's assume this to be higher, say 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.1}{0.1 \times 0.1 + 0.9 \times 0.3} = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.27} = \frac{0.01}{0.28} \approx 0.036 \]

### Computer Science
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that a graduate student is in computer science. Assuming a value like 0.2.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is in computer science. His intelligence, appreciation for abstract concepts, puzzles, and empathy can align well with computer science. Let's assume a relatively high probability, say 0.3.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is not in computer science. Let's assume this to be, say 0.2.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.3}{0.2 \times 0.3 + 0.8 \times 0.2} = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.16} = \frac{0.06}{0.22} \approx 0.273 \]

Therefore, the posteriors are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.036,
  "computer science": 0.273
}
