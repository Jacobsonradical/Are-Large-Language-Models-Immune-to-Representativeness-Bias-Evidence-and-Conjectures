To compute the probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for each field, we can use Bayes' Rule as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

We need to estimate:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in that field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not enrolled in that field.

Considering Adam's personality sketch, let's assign some reasonable estimates:

### Computer Science:
1. **P(H)**: Let’s assume that the probability of a student being enrolled in computer science is fairly common compared to other fields.
2. **P(E|H)**: Students in computer science tend to have high intelligence and good problem-solving skills, but a strong empathy and love of nature are less directly associated.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Calculating the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not in computer science. 

### Business Administration:
1. **P(H)**: Probability of a student being enrolled in business administration, considered fairly common.
2. **P(E|H)**: Students in business administration tend to have a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work but might not necessarily have the same propensity for deep empathy or love for nature and animals.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Calculating the probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in business administration.

Given the sketch, the probabilities might look something like this:

- **P(computer science)** = 0.3
- **P(E | computer science)** = 0.4
- **P(E | not computer science)** = 0.2

- **P(business administration)** = 0.3
- **P(E | business administration)** = 0.3
- **P(E | not business administration)** = 0.35

Now applying Bayes’ theorem for both hypotheses:

### Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{0.4 \cdot 0.3 + 0.2 \cdot 0.7} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.14} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.12}{0.26} \approx 0.46 \]

### Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.3}{0.3 \cdot 0.3 + 0.35 \cdot 0.7} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.245} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.09}{0.335} \approx 0.27 \]

So, the results can be summarized as:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.46,
  "business administration": 0.27
}
```

These probabilities indicate that, given Adam's personality sketch, it's more probable he was enrolled in computer science than in business administration, even if the difference isn't entirely definitive.
