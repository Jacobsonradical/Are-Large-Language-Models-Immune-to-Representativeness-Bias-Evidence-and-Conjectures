To use Bayes' rule effectively and compute the probability \( P(H|E) \), we first need to estimate the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the marginal likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \). Based on Adam's personality sketch \( E \), we will judge these values for both fields: computer science and business administration.

### For Computer Science:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H_{CS}) \)**:
   - Computer science is a common field, especially in the U.S. for graduate students.
   - Let's assume \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.1 \) (10%).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{CS}) \)**:
   - Curiosity about nature and plants is less common in CS students.
   - Empathy, love for animals, and a warm heart are neutral traits for CS students.
   - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are high probability traits for CS students.
   - Overall, given the personality sketch, these traits are partially consistent with someone in CS.
   - Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.4 \) (40%).

3. **Marginal Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \)**:
   - Using the average across all other fields to understand how likely these traits are in a field other than CS.
   - Given Adam's unique traits, we can estimate that these are moderately likely in general.
   - Let's set \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.2 \) (20%).

Using Bayesian updating:
\[
P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.1}{0.2} = 0.2
\]

### For Business Administration:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H_{BA}) \)**:
   - Business administration is also a common field, especially for graduates in the U.S.
   - Let's assume \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.1 \) (10%).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{BA}) \)**:
   - Curiosity about nature and plants may not be particularly common in business studies.
   - Empathy, a warm heart, and a love for animals are neutral or slightly relevant traits in modern business contexts (e.g., Corporate Social Responsibility).
   - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are high probability traits for business students focused on analytics or strategy.
   - Overall, given the personality sketch, these traits are partially consistent with someone in business.
   - Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.3 \) (30%).

3. **Marginal Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \)**:
   - Similar rationale as prior.
   - Let's set \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.2 \) (20%).

Using Bayesian updating:
\[
P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.2} = 0.15
\]

Thus, the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.15
}
```
