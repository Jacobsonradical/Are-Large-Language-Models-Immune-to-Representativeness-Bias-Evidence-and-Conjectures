Sure, let's proceed step by step for each field.

### Business Administration (H1)

1. **P(H1):** The prior probability of a random graduate student being enrolled in business administration. Let's assume it's 0.2 (20%).

2. **P(E|H1):** The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in business administration.
   - Business administration students may display curiosity, empathy, and intelligence, but less often in a natural, quiet boy with a deep love for animals.
   - Let's assume this probability is 0.1 (10%).

3. **P(E|\neg H1):** The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in business administration. Considering the other fields available and the provided traits, he fits less likely into business administration.
   - Let's assume this probability is 0.7 (70%).

### Computer Science (H2)

1. **P(H2):** The prior probability of a random graduate student being enrolled in computer science. Let's assume it's 0.3 (30%).

2. **P(E|H2):** The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in computer science.
   - Computer science students are often intelligent and good at solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts. However, consulting nature and animals is less specific to this field.
   - Let's assume this probability is 0.3 (30%).

3. **P(E|\neg H2):** The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in computer science.
   - Considering other fields available and the provided traits, not being in computer science does not align well either.
   - Let's assume this probability is 0.6 (60%).

Now we can compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, \( P(E) \) is common and can be derived as follows:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1) + P(E|\neg H1) \cdot P(\neg H1) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.7 \cdot 0.8 = 0.02 + 0.56 = 0.58 \]

\[ P(E) = P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2) + P(E|\neg H2) \cdot P(\neg H2) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.3 \cdot 0.3 + 0.6 \cdot 0.7 = 0.09 + 0.42 = 0.51 \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.58} \approx 0.0345 \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.3}{0.51} \approx 0.176 \]

Thus,

{
  "business administration": 0.0345,
  "computer science": 0.176
