To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in fields of business administration and computer science based on the personality sketch \( E \), we need to assess:

1. \( P(H) \) - the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the respective field.
2. \( P(E|H) \) - the probability of observing the personality sketch if Adam was enrolled in the respective field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - the probability of observing the personality sketch if Adam was not enrolled in the respective field.

Given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam and considering the nature of each field, we can approximate the probabilities as follows:

### Business Administration

1. **\( P(H) \) for Business Administration**
   - Graduate students in business administration are quite common, but they typically have traits such as leadership, strategic thinking, and an entrepreneurial mindset, which are not specifically aligned with Adam's description. Let's assign \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

2. **\( P(E|H) \) for Business Administration**
   - Adam's traits like a love for nature, empathy, high intelligence, and curiosity about plants are less typical for business administration students, who generally focus on financial, managerial, and entrepreneurial aspects.  Let's assign \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \) for Business Administration**
   - The probability of having Adam's personality sketch if he is not in business administration could be relatively high, considering other fields match better. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.2) + (0.4 \times 0.8) = 0.02 + 0.32 = 0.34 \]

So:

\[ P(H|E)_{Business Administration} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.34} \approx 0.059 \]

### Computer Science

1. **\( P(H) \) for Computer Science**
   - Computer science is a common field among graduate students with high intelligence and an interest in abstract concepts. Let's assign \( P(H) = 0.3 \).

2. **\( P(E|H) \) for Computer Science**
   - Adam's problem-solving skills, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with computer science students, although interests in nature and animals are less typical. Let's assign \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \) for Computer Science**
   - The probability of observing such traits if Adam were not in computer science could be somewhat lower, assuming fields related to Adam's interests in nature and animals fit better. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.4 \times 0.3) + (0.3 \times 0.7) = 0.12 + 0.21 = 0.33 \]

So:

\[ P(H|E)_{Computer Science} = \frac{0.4 \times 0.3}{0.33} \approx 0.364 \]
