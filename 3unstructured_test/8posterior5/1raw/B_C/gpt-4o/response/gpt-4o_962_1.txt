We can calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given:
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Probability that the personality sketch \( E \) describes Adam given that he was enrolled in that particular field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability that the personality sketch \( E \) describes Adam given that he was not enrolled in that particular field.
- \( P(E) \): Marginal probability that the personality sketch \( E \) describes Adam.

**For Business Administration:**
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability, without specific data, let's assume it's relatively low given Adam's described interests, say 0.05.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch given Business Administration. Adam's characteristics do not align strongly with typical traits for this field, perhaps 0.1.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch given any other field, let's assume an average probability, say 0.5.

**For Computer Science:**
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability, again assuming without specific data, let’s say it is more likely given his interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence, perhaps 0.2.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch given Computer Science. Aligning very well with his traits, perhaps 0.8.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch given any other field, let’s assume an average probability, say 0.5.

Now let's calculate:

For Business Administration (\(H_1\)):
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]
Assume \( P(E) \approx 0.1 \times 0.05 + 0.5 \times 0.95 \)
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.05}{(0.1 \times 0.05) + (0.5 \times 0.95)} \]
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.475} \]
\[ P(H_1|E) \approx 0.0104 \]

For Computer Science (\(H_2\)):
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) P(H_2)}{P(E)} \]
Assume \( P(E) \approx 0.8 \times 0.2 + 0.5 \times 0.8 \)
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.2}{(0.8 \times 0.2) + (0.5 \times 0.8)} \]
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.16}{0.16 + 0.4} \]
\[ P(H_2|E) \approx 0.2857 \]

Hence, our Bayesian calculations yield:

  "business administration": 0.0104,
  "computer science": 0.2857
