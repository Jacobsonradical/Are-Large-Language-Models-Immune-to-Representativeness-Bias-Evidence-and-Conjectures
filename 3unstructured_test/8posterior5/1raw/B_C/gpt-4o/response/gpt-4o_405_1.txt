Let's analyze the probabilities for each field step by step using Bayes' theorem:

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(H|E)\) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \(P(E)\) is the probability of the evidence.

Given the personality sketch \(E\) of Adam, we need to estimate \(P(H)\), \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E|\neg H)\) for each field.

### Hypothesis: Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**:
   - Let's assume that among the graduate fields, business administration has certain representation, but isn't extremely common. We might assign a prior somewhat lower than 0.5. Let's use \(P(H) = 0.2\).

2. **Probability of Evidence given Hypothesis \(P(E|H)\)**:
   - Business administration students might occasionally have a strong appreciation for nature, empathy, and intelligence, but it's not a dominant feature of the field. Let's assign \(P(E|H) = 0.1\).

3. **Probability of Evidence given Hypothesis \(P(E|\neg H)\)**:
   - The probabilities of these traits among other fields are varied, but these characteristics might be less common. Let's assign \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.3\).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.3} = \frac{0.02}{0.3} \approx 0.067 \]

### Hypothesis: Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**:
   - Computer science is a common field for graduate students and might carry a higher prior. Let's assume \(P(H) = 0.3\).

2. **Probability of Evidence given Hypothesis \(P(E|H)\)**:
   - Computer science students often have high intelligence, enjoy solving puzzles, and might have empathy and diverse interests. This makes the evidence quite consistent with this hypothesis. Let's assign \(P(E|H) = 0.4\).

3. **Probability of Evidence given Hypothesis \(P(E|\neg H)\)**:
   - Among all other fields, these traits might not be as concentrated. Let's use \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.2\).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.3}{0.2} = \frac{0.12}{0.2} = 0.6 \]

### Final Results

\[ \{ 
   "business administration": 0.067, 
   "computer science": 0.6 
\} \]

These calculated values suggest that based on Adam's personality sketch, it is significantly more likely that he was enrolled in computer science compared to business administration.
