Certainly. Let's break down the task to compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule for the fields "business administration" and "computer science." 

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) assuming the given hypothesis \( H \) is true.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the given hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of observing the evidence \( E \).

We need to estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field:

### For Business Administration:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Business administration is a common graduate field, but it might not be the field most associated with a person with Adam's personality sketch, characterized by a love for nature, animals, and abstract thinking.
   - Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.10 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - The personality traits listed in \( E \) do not align strongly with the typical profile of a business administration student. Business administration students are often more focused on leadership, finance, management, and enterprise.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.05 \).

3. **Likelihood Given Not H \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - Considering all other fields, certain fields like environmental science, biology, etc., would likely be a better match for Adam's personality traits.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.15 \).

### For Computer Science:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Computer science is also a common graduate field. While the field often attracts students who are good at solving puzzles and abstract concepts, it does not particularly emphasize empathy, warmth, and a love for nature.
   - Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.10 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - The personality traits of liking puzzles and understanding abstract concepts could fit a computer science student, but the deep love for nature and animals seems less aligned.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.20 \).

3. **Likelihood Given Not H \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - Again, considering all other fields, certain fields like environmental science, biology, etc., would likely be a better match for Adam's personality traits.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.15 \).

### Normalizing Constant \( P(E) \):

To compute \( P(E) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)\cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H)\cdot P(\neg H) \]

Since we have only considered two fields and not accounted for others, we will treat these calculations independently, knowing they are not exhaustive.

### Calculations:

1. **For Business Administration**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{(0.05) \cdot (0.10)}{(0.05 \cdot 0.10) + (0.15 \cdot 0.90)}
   \]
   \[
   P(E) = 0.05 \cdot 0.10 + 0.15 \cdot 0.90 = 0.005 + 0.135 = 0.14
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.14} \approx 0.036
   \]

2. **For Computer Science**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{(0.20) \cdot (0.10)}{(0.20 \cdot 0.10) + (0.15 \cdot 0.90)}
   \]
   \[
   P(E) = 0.20 \cdot 0.10 + 0.15 \cdot 0.90 = 0.02 + 0.135 = 0.155
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.155} \approx 0.129
   \]

Thus, the approximate posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.036,
  "computer science": 0.129
}
```
