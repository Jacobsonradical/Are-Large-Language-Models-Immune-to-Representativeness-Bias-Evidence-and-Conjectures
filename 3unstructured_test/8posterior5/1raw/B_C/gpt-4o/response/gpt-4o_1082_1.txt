To calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we can apply the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in that particular field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in that particular field.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.

Given the information in the personality sketch of Adam, let's evaluate for each field:

### Business Administration
1. **Prior probability \( P(H) \):** 
   Let's assume the baseline probability of being enrolled in Business Administration for graduate students is around 0.10 (10%).

2. **Probability of E given H \( P(E|H) \):**
   Given Adam's personality sketch, it is less likely (though not impossible) he fits the typical profile for Business Administration students. Let's estimate this at 0.02 (2%).

3. **Probability of E given not H \( P(E|\neg H):**
   Given the diversity of other fields, let's assume generically that there is a 0.10 probability of such a personality sketch appearing in a field other than Business Administration.

### Computer Science
1. **Prior probability \( P(H) \):**
   Let's assume the baseline probability of being enrolled in Computer Science for graduate students is around 0.15 (15%).

2. **Probability of E given H \( P(E|H) \):**
   Given Adam's high intelligence, enjoyment of puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts, it is more likely he fits the profile for computer science students. We'll estimate this at 0.20 (20%).

3. **Probability of E given not H \( P(E|\neg H):**
   Similar to before, let's assume generically that there is a 0.10 (10%) chance of such a personality sketch appearing in fields other than Computer Science.

### Calculations
We now compute \( P(H|E) \) for both fields using Bayes' Rule. We normalize by assuming the probabilities of E are equivalent where needed.

For **Business Administration**:
\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{Business Administration}) \cdot P(\text{Business Administration})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.02 \cdot 0.10}{P(E)} \]

For **Computer Science**:
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.20 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is common and just relates to the overall probability of E arising from any field, we look at the relative values:

- Business Administration: \( 0.002 \)
- Computer Science: \( 0.030 \)

Since these are not normalized, the relative belief ratios indicate the likelihood.

### Normalizing these relative probabilities:

Sum of relative probabilities for normalization:
\[ 0.002 + 0.030 = 0.032 \]

Normalized values:

- \( P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.002}{0.032} \approx 0.0625 \)
- \( P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.030}{0.032} \approx 0.9375 \)

Final results:

{
  "business administration": "0.0625",
  "computer science": "0.9375"
}
