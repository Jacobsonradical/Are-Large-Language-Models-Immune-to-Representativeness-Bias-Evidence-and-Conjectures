Let's analyze the probabilities for each field based on Adam's personality sketch (E).

**Field 1: Computer Science (CS)**

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Since this is a common field of study among graduate students, let's use a rough prior probability of 0.2.
  
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam was in computer science. While computer science students don't necessarily need a love for nature or animals, the interest in puzzles and high intelligence aligns well with this field. Let's give it a moderate value of 0.4.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam was in any field other than computer science. Since these characteristics might not be very common in other fields, let's give it a somewhat lower chance, say 0.3.

4. **Using Bayes' Rule**:
   
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.24} = \frac{0.08}{0.32} = 0.25
\]

**Field 2: Business Administration (BA)**

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. This is also a relatively common field, so we can use a similar prior probability of 0.2.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam was in business administration. These traits don't strongly align with the typical characteristics of business administration students. Let's give it a lower value of 0.1.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam was in any field other than business administration. We can use the same value as before, 0.3.

4. **Using Bayes' Rule**:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.24} = \frac{0.02}{0.26} \approx 0.077
\]

Based on the analysis, the posterior probabilities for each field are:

\{
  "computer science": 0.25,
  "business administration": 0.077
}
