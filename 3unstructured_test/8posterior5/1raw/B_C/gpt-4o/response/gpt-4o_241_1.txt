To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given Adam's personality sketch using Bayes' rule, we need to assess:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a certain field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in the field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in the field.

Let's make educated guesses for each field:

### Business Administration
1. \( P(H_{\text{business}}) \): Business administration is a common field for graduate students, but based on Adam's love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles, it might be less likely. Let's assume \( P(H_{\text{business}}) = 0.2 \).
2. \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \): Given Adam's traits, he seems less typical of a business administration student who might be more focused on human dynamics and organizational skills rather than nature and puzzles. Let's say \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) = 0.1 \).
3. \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}}) \): This is a broader field, given Adam's traits match more closely with fields like biology, environmental science, or even computer science. Let's say \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}}) = 0.4 \).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.32} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.34} \approx 0.059 \]

### Computer Science
1. \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): Computer Science is also a common field for graduate students, often involving solving puzzles and abstract concepts. Let's assume \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.3 \).
2. \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): Adam's traits such as solving puzzles, intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts align well with computer science. Let's say \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.5 \).
3. \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \): This is harder to pinpoint, but assuming many other fields could match less well with Adam's traits. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.3 \).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.3}{0.5 \cdot 0.3 + 0.3 \cdot 0.7} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.21} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.15}{0.36} \approx 0.417 \]

### Result Summary

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.059,
  "computer science": 0.417
}
```

These values indicate that, based on the provided personality sketch, Adam is much more likely to be enrolled in a field like Computer Science compared to Business Administration. However, other fields more closely related to his interest in nature and animals could also be likely candidates but are not considered in this specific analysis.
