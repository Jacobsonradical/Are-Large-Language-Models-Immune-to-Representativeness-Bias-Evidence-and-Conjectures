To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field of graduate study using Bayes' rule, we need to follow these steps:

1. Define prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field. These represent the initial beliefs about Adam's enrollment in each field before taking the personality sketch into account.
2. Define the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), which are the probabilities of seeing the personality sketch given each field.
3. Define the likelihoods \( P(E|\neg H) \), which are the probabilities of seeing the personality sketch given any field other than the one in question.
4. Apply Bayes' rule to find \( P(H|E) \), the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field given his personality sketch.

Assumptions:
- Priors \( P(H) \) are chosen based on typical enrollment numbers in graduate programs and some plausible estimation given Adam's interests.
- Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \) are chosen based on the compatibility of Adam's personality traits with each field.

Using these assumptions, let's start with some estimated values:

1. **Business Administration (BA):**
   - Prior Probability \( P(\text{BA}) = 0.1 \)
   - Likelihood \( P(E|\text{BA}) = 0.3 \) (Personality traits are somewhat less likely in business, which often emphasizes leadership and competition over empathy and nature)
   - Likelihood \( P(E|\neg\text{BA}) = 0.7 \) (Personality traits are more likely outside of business)

2. **Computer Science (CS):**
   - Prior Probability \( P(\text{CS}) = 0.1 \)
   - Likelihood \( P(E|\text{CS}) = 0.5 \) (High intelligence and puzzle solving suggest a higher compatibility)
   - Likelihood \( P(E|\neg\text{CS}) = 0.5 \) (Personality traits are somewhat equally found outside CS)

Given these values, we can apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we don't have \( P(E) \) (the total evidence probability), we will focus on comparing the numerators as relative measures:

1. **Business Administration:**

\[ P(\text{BA}|E) \propto P(E|\text{BA})P(\text{BA}) = 0.3 \times 0.1 = 0.03 \]

2. **Computer Science:**

\[ P(\text{CS}|E) \propto P(E|\text{CS})P(\text{CS}) = 0.5 \times 0.1 = 0.05 \]

Therefore:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.03,
  "computer science": 0.05
}
```

These values are relative scales indicating the compatibility of Adam's personality with potential fields of study in Business Administration and Computer Science. Note that while these values suggest a higher compatibility with Computer Science, they do not add up to 1 as there could be other graduate fields more closely aligned with his personality traits.
