To solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem, we need to estimate the various probabilities involved. Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \) (Adam was enrolled in a specific field).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the evidence \( E \) (Adam's personality sketch) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of the evidence \( E \) given the negation of \( H \) (Adam was not enrolled in the specific field).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence \( E \), which can be expressed as the average probability of \( E \) over all fields.

Given the lack of exact numerical data, we'll provide rough estimates based on the personality sketch provided.

### Computer Science
- \( P(H_{cs}) \) (Prior probability of Adam being a computer science graduate): Let's assume a rough prior of \( 0.15 \), because computer science is a fairly common field among students with high intelligence and abstract thinking skills.
- \( P(E|H_{cs}) \) (Probability of the personality sketch given Adam is a computer science student): Given Adam’s aptitude for puzzles and intelligence, this seems somewhat likely, but the love for nature and animals isn't very characteristic. Let's estimate this at \( 0.4 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H_{cs}) \) (Probability of the personality sketch given he is not a computer science student): Given many non-CS fields also fit Adam’s nature-related interests, this might be slightly higher. Let's say \( 0.6 \).

### Business Administration
- \( P(H_{ba}) \) (Prior probability of Adam being a business administration student): Business Administration might be less common among those who are interested in abstract concepts and nature. Let's estimate \( 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|H_{ba}) \) (Probability of the personality sketch given Adam is a business administration student): Adam's personality and interests don’t strongly align with typical business traits. Let's estimate this at \( 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H_{ba}) \) (Probability of the personality sketch given he is not a business administration student): Higher due to many other fields fitting better. Let's estimate \( 0.75 \).

For the sake of simplicity, let's assume \( P(E) \) is an average scenario that balances these fields’ likelihoods, roughly \( 0.5 \).

Now calculating:
1. For Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.15}{0.5} = 0.12 \]

2. For Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{ba}) \cdot P(H_{ba})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.5} = 0.04 \]

Based on these calculations, we have:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.12,
  "business administration": 0.04
}
