To estimate the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch, we'll apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem can be represented as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in the field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch if Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the personality sketch, which can be calculated as \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Since we don't have the exact values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \), we will have to make reasonable assumptions based on typical characteristics associated with each field and the given personality sketch.

### Computer Science
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Let's assume that the probability of anyone at random being enrolled in computer science as a graduate student in the U.S. is moderate. Estimate: \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's high intelligence, aptitude for solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts, it is quite likely he would fit well in computer science. However, his strong empathy and love for animals might make him less likely than someone who is purely analytically inclined. Estimate: \( P(E|H) \approx 0.4 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of having this personality sketch given that Adam is not in computer science but possibly in another field (such as environmental science or biology) may be moderate to high. Estimate: \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \).

### Business Administration
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The general baseline for a graduate student being in business administration might be lower compared to computer science, especially given the skills and interests described. Estimate: \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The personality sketch suggests less focus on business-related skills (e.g., financial analysis, leadership) and more on empathetic and nature-related interests. Estimate: \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Similar to the previous case, the probability of having this personality sketch given that Adam is not in business administration might be quite high. Estimate: \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.6 \).

### Applying Bayes' Theorem
#### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.8} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.4} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.48} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.167 \]

#### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.1 \cdot 0.1 + 0.6 \cdot 0.9} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.54} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.55} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.018 \]

### Results
The results of the calculations are:

{
  "computer science": "0.167",
  "business administration": "0.018"
