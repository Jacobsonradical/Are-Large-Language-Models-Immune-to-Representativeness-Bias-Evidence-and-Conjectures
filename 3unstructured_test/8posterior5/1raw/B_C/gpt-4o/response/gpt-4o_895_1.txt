To compute the conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or computer science, given the provided personality sketch \(E\), we will use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since \(P(E)\) is constant for both fields when we're only interested in the relative probabilities, it will effectively cancel out. Hence, we don't need to calculate \(P(E)\) explicitly to compare the relative likelihoods of Adam being enrolled in each field.

Assumptions (these are subjective estimations based on common knowledge):

- \( P(H_{\text{business admin}}) \) and \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) \) range between 0 and 1 but should not necessarily add up to 1.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business admin}}) \): Probability of exhibiting personality \(E\) given enrollment in business administration.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \): Probability of exhibiting personality \(E\) given enrollment in computer science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of exhibiting personality \(E\) given enrollment in any other field.

For business administration:
- P(H) might be slightly lower, given the personality sketch (more oriented towards logical, analytical, and nature-appreciating traits).
- P(E|H) might also be slightly lower, as these traits do not strongly align with typical business administration stereotypes.
- P(E|¬H) represents the compatibility of the sketch with non-business administration fields.

For computer science:
- P(H) might be higher due to the logical, puzzle-solving, and abstract thinking traits fitting well with a typical computer science student.
- P(E|H) would likely be higher due to these aligning traits.

Estimations:
- \( P(H_{\text{business admin}}) \approx 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business admin}}) \approx 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|{\neg H_{\text{business admin}}}) \approx 0.4 \)

- \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) \approx 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \approx 0.7 \)
- \( P(E|{\neg H_{\text{computer science}}}) \approx 0.4 \)

Now applying Bayes’ theorem:

\[ P(H_{\text{business admin}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business admin}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business admin}})}{P(E)} \]

\[ \approx  \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{0.4}  = 0.15 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}})}{P(E)} \]

\[ \approx \frac{0.7 \times 0.3}{0.4} = 0.525 \]

Thus, based on the provided information and our assumptions:

{
  "business administration": "0.15",
  "computer science": "0.525"
}
