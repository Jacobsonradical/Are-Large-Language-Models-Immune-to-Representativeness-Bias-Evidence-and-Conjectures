To determine the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for "business administration" and "computer science" given the personality sketch of Adam, we'll use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This is our initial estimation about the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in the respective fields purely based on general knowledge.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.

3. **Marginal Likelihood \( P(E) \)**: This is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch, obtained by summing over all fields. Since we only have comparative information here, we use relative likelihoods instead.

4. **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in the specific field.

### Judging the Values:

#### Business Administration:

1. **P(H) for Business Administration**: Low to medium. The general stereotype of a business administration student may not fully align with Adam's interests and personality traits.
    - Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

2. **P(E|H) for Business Administration**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and empathy might not strongly align with business administration, where the focus is more on management and business skills.
    - Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H) for Business Administration**: Adam's traits might be more common outside business administration.
    - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

#### Computer Science:

1. **P(H) for Computer Science**: Medium to high. The field of computer science often attracts people who enjoy solving puzzles and have high intelligence.
    - Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.3 \).

2. **P(E|H) for Computer Science**: This aligns well since computer science often attracts those who like puzzles and abstract concepts.
    - Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.6 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H) for Computer Science**: This would represent other fields excluding computer science.
    - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

### Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\( P(E) \) is common for both and can be seen as a normalizing factor. We use relative probabilities to compare.

#### For Business Administration:

\[ P(\text{Business}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.6 \cdot 0.3} \]
\[ = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.18} \]
\[ = \frac{0.02}{0.20} \]
\[ = 0.10 \]

#### For Computer Science:

\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.3}{0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.6 \cdot 0.3} \]
\[ = \frac{0.18}{0.02 + 0.18} \]
\[ = \frac{0.18}{0.20} \]
\[ = 0.90 \]

### Result:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.10,
  "computer science": 0.90
}
```

These probabilities are calculated based on the assumed values. They suggest that given Adam's personality traits, it's much more likely that he was enrolled in a graduate program in computer science compared to business administration.
