To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, let's first recall the rule itself:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given:

- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he was not enrolled in that field.

Let's make some reasonable assumptions for these probabilities based on the personality sketch of Adam and typical attributes of students in each field. 

We assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \) for both fields under consideration, as they are two possibilities among many graduate fields. This is a simplification, as actual proportions can vary.

### Computer Science

- **P(H):** We assume a moderate prior that Adam could be in computer science: 0.1.
- **P(E|H):** There's a good chance Adam's interest in puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts fit well with computer science students. Let's estimate this at 0.4.
- **P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood of someone having Adam's personality traits without being in computer science could also be reasonably high since these traits are not exclusive to computer science students. Estimate this at 0.2.

### Business Administration

- **P(H):** We assume a moderate prior that Adam could be in business administration: 0.1.
- **P(E|H):** Adam's empathy, warm heart, and understanding of hard work align somewhat with business administration students. Let's give this a lower likelihood since those attributes are less common in a hard MBA context: 0.2.
- **P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood of someone having Adam's traits without being in business administration is high since these traits are more typical for other fields as well. Estimate this at 0.25.

### Compute \( P(H|E) \)

Given differences in \( P(E) \) for both fields are minor for comparability context, \( P(E) \) can be considered a constant and omitted from detailed calculation (as normalization can adjust final probabilities). Hence,

\[
P(H|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

For computer science:

\[
P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.4 \times 0.1}{constant} 
\]

For business administration:

\[
P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{constant}
\]

Thus, normalizing the comparison between these computed rough-valuations:

```json
{
  "computer science": "estimated around 0.67 (0.4*0.1 adjusted)",
  "business administration": "estimated around 0.33 (0.2*0.1 adjusted)"
}
```

These values denote relative probabilities rather than absolute, deemed through Bayes noting Adam's profile is highly suggestive but not determinative on limitations posed by substantial flexibility across academic domains styled here for Adam.
