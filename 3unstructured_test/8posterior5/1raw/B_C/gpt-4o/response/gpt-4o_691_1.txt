To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis using Bayes' rule, we need to follow these steps for both fields:

1. **Estimate \( P(H) \) (the prior probability):** 
   - This represents the probability that Adam was enrolled in each field before considering any specific evidence about his personality.

2. **Estimate \( P(E|H) \) (the likelihood):**
   - This is the probability of observing the evidence (Adam's personality sketch) given that he is enrolled in the field.

3. **Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) (the probability of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis):**
   - This is the probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is not enrolled in the field.

4. **Compute \( P(H|E) \) (the posterior probability):**
   - This is the probability that Adam was enrolled in the field given his personality sketch, calculated using Bayes' rule:
     \[
     P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
     \]
   - Note that \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Given these steps, let's estimate these probabilities for each field as best as we can:

### Computer Science
1. **\( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \):**
   - Assume a reasonable prior that students could be enrolled in various fields; let's estimate \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.15 \).

2. **\( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \):**
   - Adam's intelligence and aptitude for abstract concepts fit well with computer science, but his empathy, love for animals, and warm heart are less typical. Hence, \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.3 \).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \):**
   - These personality traits could be present more broadly among other fields. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.5 \).

### Business Administration
1. **\( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \):**
   - Another reasonable choice, though potentially less likely than some others like social sciences, assuming roughly \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1 \).

2. **\( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \):**
   - Business administration typically emphasizes leadership and strategic thinking rather than curiosity about nature and love for animals. Hence, let's assign \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1 \).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \):**
   - Again, Adam's traits could be seen in fields other than business administration. \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.5 \).

Now, using Bayes' rule:

### Computer Science
\[
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)}
\]
For \( P(E) \) in the denominator:
\[
P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{CS}})
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.3 \cdot 0.15 + 0.5 \cdot 0.85 = 0.045 + 0.425 = 0.47
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.15}{0.47} = \frac{0.045}{0.47} \approx 0.096
\]

### Business Administration
\[
P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)}
\]
For \( P(E) \) in the denominator:
\[
P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{BA}})
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.1 + 0.5 \cdot 0.9 = 0.01 + 0.45 = 0.46
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.46} = \frac{0.01}{0.46} \approx 0.022
\]

Putting it all together:

  "computer science": 0.096,
  "business administration": 0.022
