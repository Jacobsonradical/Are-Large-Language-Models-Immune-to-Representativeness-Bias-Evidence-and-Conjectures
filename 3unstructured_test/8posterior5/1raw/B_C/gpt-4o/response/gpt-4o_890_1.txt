Firstly, let's interpret the information from the personality sketch and use it to derive the probabilities.

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field. Without any additional information, we'll assume all fields are equally likely. However, when some features (like his interest in nature, empathy, etc.) might be particularly aligned with certain fields, we can adjust these priors.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch of Adam given he is enrolled in a particular field. 

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch of Adam given he is not enrolled in a particular field.

### For Business Administration
- P(H): A prior assumption might be relatively lower for Business Administration given Adam's strong inclination towards nature and less practical, business-oriented traits.
  - Let's assume P(H) = 0.1.
  
- P(E|H): Adam's characteristics fit less with Business Administration due to his main interests and personality traits.
  - Assuming P(E|H) = 0.01.

- P(E|¬H): Given Adam's characteristics, the probability of observing this profile if he is in any field other than Business Administration would be relatively higher given wider other possibilities.
  - Assuming P(E|¬H) = 0.05.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|¬H)(1 - P(H)) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.01 \cdot 0.1) + (0.05 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.001 + 0.045 = 0.046 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01 \cdot 0.1}{0.046} \approx 0.0217 \]


### For Computer Science
- P(H): A reasonable assumption here, given his interest in puzzles and abstract concepts.
  - Let's assume P(H) = 0.2.
  
- P(E|H): Adam's interest in solving puzzles and his intelligence fit better with Computer Science.
  - Assume P(E|H) = 0.6.

- P(E|¬H): Similar to the previous calculation for non-related fields.
  - We'll assume P(E|¬H) = 0.05.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|¬H)(1 - P(H)) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.6 \cdot 0.2) + (0.05 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.04 = 0.16 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{0.16} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the calculated probabilities of Adam being in each field of study are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0217,
  "computer science": 0.75
}
