To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \), we can calculate \( P(H|E) \).

First, we should estimate the probabilities involved:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is enrolled in a specific field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is not enrolled in that specific field.

Let's make some qualitative assessments:

1. **Business Administration**:

    - \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): The overall probability that a graduate student is in business administration. We can assume this is moderately likely.
    - \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): The traits described (curiosity about nature, love for animals, warmth, empathy) seem less common for business administration students, who might be more focused on quantitative skills and leadership.
    - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \): The probability of those traits if Adam is not in business administration is likely higher as they could fit many other fields.
    
    Assumptive values:
    - \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.15 \)
    - \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1 \)
    - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.3 \)

    Calculation:
    \[
    P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{\text{BA}})) = 0.1 \cdot 0.15 + 0.3 \cdot 0.85 = 0.15 + 0.255 = 0.285
    \]
    \[
    P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{0.285} \approx 0.053
    \]

2. **Computer Science**:

    - \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): The overall probability that a graduate student is in computer science is fairly high given its popularity.
    - \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): The traits (intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, puzzle solving) fit well with a computer science background.
    - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \): These traits are desirable in many other fields as well.

    Assumptive values:
    - \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.25 \)
    - \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.4 \)
    - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.2 \)

    Calculation:
    \[
    P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{\text{CS}})) = 0.4 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75 = 0.1 + 0.15 = 0.25
    \]
    \[
    P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.25}{0.25} = 0.4
    \]

Considering the estimations and calculations performed, the values for \( P(H|E) \) are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.053,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```
