To evaluate the probability that Adam was enrolled in specific graduate fields based on his personality sketch (E), we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is in the field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch, which is constant across hypotheses and can be ignored when we are comparing fields.

Given the information in the prompt, we make some reasonable assumptions to estimate these probabilities:

1. **Business Administration:**
   - Personality traits such as a genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy are less correlated with Business Administration.
   - Therefore, \( P(E|H_{BA}) \) is likely to be low.
   - \( P(H_{BA}) \), the base rate probability of a graduate student being in Business Administration, is substantial given the popularity of this field.
   
   Let's assign:
   - \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.2 \) (20%)
   - \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.05 \) (Low due to mismatch in personality traits)

2. **Computer Science:**
   - High intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles align well with Computer Science.
   - Therefore, \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) is high.
   - \( P(H_{CS}) \), the base rate probability of a student being in Computer Science, is substantial given the popularity of this field among graduate students.
   
   Let's assign:
   - \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.2 \) (20%)
   - \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.4 \) (Higher due to better alignment with personality traits)

Given these assumptions, we can now compare the posterior probabilities \( P(H_{BA}|E) \) and \( P(H_{CS}|E) \):

- For Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.01}{P(E)} \]

- For Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.08}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both cases and we are only comparing relative probabilities, we just need to normalize these values:

\[ \text{Normalization constant} = \frac{0.01 + 0.08}{P(E)} \]

So the final relative probabilities can be written (ignoring \( P(E) \)) as:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.09} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.09} \]

Thus, the relative probabilities are:

- Business Administration: \( \frac{0.01}{0.09} \approx 0.111 \)
- Computer Science: \( \frac{0.08}{0.09} \approx 0.889 \)

Given these relative values, we get:

{
  "business administration": 0.111,
  "computer science": 0.889
}
