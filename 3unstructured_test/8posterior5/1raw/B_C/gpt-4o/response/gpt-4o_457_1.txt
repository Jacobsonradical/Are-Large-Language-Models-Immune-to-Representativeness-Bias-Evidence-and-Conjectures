Sure. To compute \(P(H|E)\) for both business administration and computer science, we'll need to estimate \(P(H)\), \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E|\neg H)\) for each field. 

### Definitions:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field without any additional information.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the evidence (personality sketch and attributes) given that Adam was enrolled in that particular field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the evidence if Adam was NOT enrolled in that particular field.
- \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field given the evidence.

### Business Administration:

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**:
   - Let's assume \(P(H)\) for business administration is 0.2 (since it is one of many fields Adam could be in).

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**:
   - An individual in business administration may not strongly correlate with a deep love for nature, animals, and abstract concepts. Let's estimate this value as 0.1.

3. **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)**:
   - We should think about the likelihood of these traits existing if Adam were not in business administration. Many other fields could have higher likelihoods of these traits. We'll set this at 0.4.

Applying Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|\text{business administration}) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.32} = \frac{0.02}{0.34} \approx 0.0588 \]

### Computer Science:

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**:
   - Let's assume \(P(H)\) for computer science is 0.2 (again, one of many possible fields).

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**:
   - An individual in computer science might more strongly correlate with solving puzzles, understanding abstract concepts, and high intelligence. Let's estimate this value as 0.5.

3. **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)**:
   - Traits such as love for nature and animals may be less specific to computer science and more general. We'll set this at 0.4, considering these traits could be attributed to other fields too.

Applying Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|\text{computer science}) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.5 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.1}{0.1 + 0.32} = \frac{0.1}{0.42} \approx 0.2381 \]

Thus, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0588,
  "computer science": 0.2381
}
```
