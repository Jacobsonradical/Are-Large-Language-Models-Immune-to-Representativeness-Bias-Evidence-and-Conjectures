Certainly! Here is a structured approach to estimate the probabilities:

1. **Prior Probability, P(H)**: This is the general likelihood of a person specializing in a given field among all possible fields. This is influenced by general trends and statistics within the context, but we'll need to make some reasonable assumptions based on typical graduate program enrollments.

2. **Likelihood, P(E|H)**: This is the probability of Adam's personality sketch (E) given that he is enrolled in a particular field (H). We'll consider how well the traits match commonly observed characteristics in these fields.

3. **Complementary Likelihood, P(E|¬H)**: This is the probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in that particular field. This will be broad and will consider the general graduate student population.

Finally, we'll use Bayes' Rule to compute the posterior probability, P(H|E).

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)** for business administration:
   - Let's assume that about 10% of graduate students might be enrolled in business administration.
   - P(H) = 0.10

2. **P(E|H)** for business administration:
   - Business administration students typically have skills in management, decision-making, and often a focus on business-oriented goals. The personality sketch does not align very strongly with these traits as it focuses more on nature, puzzles, and empathy.
   - P(E|H) might be relatively low, let's estimate it at 0.05

3. **P(E|¬H)** for business administration:
   - Considering all other fields, which can include sciences, humanities, and other diverse areas, the personality traits described (love for nature, puzzles, empathy) might fit more generally.
   - P(E|¬H) could be estimated at a broader level about 0.20

Using Bayes’ Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) = (P(E|H) \cdot P(H)) + (P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H)) \)

\[ P(E) = (0.05 \cdot 0.10) + (0.20 \cdot 0.90) = 0.005 + 0.18 = 0.185 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.10}{0.185} \approx 0.027 \]

### Computer Science

1. **P(H)** for computer science:
   - Let's assume that about 15% of graduate students might be enrolled in computer science.
   - P(H) = 0.15

2. **P(E|H)** for computer science:
   - Computer science students often exhibit traits such as problem-solving, intelligence, and sometimes an interest in abstract concepts, which aligns quite well with Adam's personality sketch.
   - P(E|H) might be relatively high, let's estimate it at 0.30

3. **P(E|¬H)** for computer science:
   - Considering all other fields, the probability might be similar to the general estimate.
   - P(E|¬H) could be around 0.20

Using Bayes’ Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) = (P(E|H) \cdot P(H)) + (P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H)) \)

\[ P(E) = (0.30 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) = 0.045 + 0.17 = 0.215 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.30 \cdot 0.15}{0.215} \approx 0.209 \]
