Let's break down the probabilities as follows:

1. **Computer Science**
    - **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Computer Science. Since we don't have specific details about the proportion of graduate students in each field, let's assume it is reasonable to start with an equal base rate for each field, say \( P(\text{H}) = 0.5 \).
    - **P(E|H):** The probability that Adam would have the characteristics described (E) if he were in Computer Science. Given his high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts, it is quite likely, but his strong empathy and love for animals are less typical traits for a Computer Science student. So, let's say \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \).
    - **P(E|\neg H):** The probability that Adam would have these characteristics if he were not in Computer Science. There are many fields where such characteristics could be applicable. We'll need to distribute some probability here. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \).

Applying Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.4 \cdot 0.5) + (0.6 \cdot 0.5) = 0.2 + 0.3 = 0.5 \]

Thus:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = 0.4 \]

2. **Business Administration**
    - **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration. Similarly, we'll assume \( P(H) = 0.5 \).
    - **P(E|H):** The probability that Adam would have the given characteristics if he were in Business Administration. Given his empathy, appreciation for hard work, and warm heart, these characteristics can align well with Business Administration students focusing on leadership and teamwork. So, let's say \( P(E|H) = 0.5 \).
    - **P(E|\neg H):** As before, letâ€™s assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

Applying Bayes' Rule for Business Administration:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.5 \cdot 0.5) + (0.5 \cdot 0.5) = 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5 \]

Thus:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = 0.5 \]

Summarizing the results:
