To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in a certain field, we apply Bayes' Rule. Below are the respective values and computations for the fields of business administration and computer science.

1. **Business Administration (H)**
- P(H): Let's assume the prior probability of being enrolled in business administration is moderately low, say 10%, or 0.1.
- P(E|H): Given Adam's personality sketch, including traits like a genuine curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals, these attributes are less typical for business administration. Let's give this a low likelihood, say 0.2.
- P(E|\neg H): Given that "E" describes a person with certain traits that are more likely to fit into various other fields (e.g., environmental sciences, biology, psychology), let's assign a moderate value, say 0.5.

Bayes' Rule formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Although we don't know P(E), it remains constant across all fields for comparative purposes.

2. **Computer Science (H)**
- P(H): Let's assume the prior probability of being enrolled in computer science is moderately high, say 20%, or 0.2.
- P(E|H): Given Adam's personality sketch, including strong intelligence and appreciation for abstract concepts, these are quite compatible with computer science. But the traits such as curiosity about nature and love for animals might be less directly relevant, let's give this a likelihood of 0.5.
- P(E|\neg H): Similar to business administration, there are many graduate fields where Adam's personality could fit well. Let's use the same moderate value, say 0.5.

Bayes' Rule formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Now, substituting and simplifying for comparative purposes:

- For business administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \times P(H) = 0.2 \times 0.1 = 0.02 \]

- For computer science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \times P(H) = 0.5 \times 0.2 = 0.1 \]

Since we don't calculate the exact P(E), proportional values can be used for comparison. Computer science yields a proportion of 0.1 compared to 0.02 for business administration.

Result:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.1
}
