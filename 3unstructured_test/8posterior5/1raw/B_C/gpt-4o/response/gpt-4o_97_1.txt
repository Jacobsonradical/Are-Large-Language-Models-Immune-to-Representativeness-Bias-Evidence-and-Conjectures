To compute posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field (business administration and computer science) given Adam's personality sketch (E), we'll need to use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) (the probability of Adam's personality sketch) is constant across all hypotheses (fields), it can be considered a normalizing factor. Here we'll only compute the numerator of Bayes' rule, \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \), for each field and compare them.

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)**: The general prior probability that a graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in business administration. This is relatively common but less so compared to fields like computer science. Let's estimate \( P(H) \) as 0.15.
2. **P(E|H)**: Business administration students usually need social skills, strategic thinking, and might be less focused on nature and animals specifically. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) to be relatively low, perhaps around 0.05.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Given that many fields could potentially lead to the observed personality sketch, we'll assume \( P(E|\neg H) \) is distributed over many other fields. Let's estimate it as 0.0125 (considering many other fields).

\[ P(H|E)_{BA} \propto P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) = 0.05 \cdot 0.15 = 0.0075 \]

### Computer Science
1. **P(H)**: The general prior probability that a graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in computer science. This is a very common field. Let's estimate \( P(H) \) as 0.25.
2. **P(E|H)**: Computer science students are often analytical, enjoy solving puzzles, and can be introspective. Adam's personality sketch fits well with these characteristics. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) as 0.2.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Again, considering distribution across many other fields, let's estimate it as 0.0125.

\[ P(H|E)_{CS} \propto P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) = 0.2 \cdot 0.25 = 0.05 \]

### Comparison and Normalization

Since we only need a relative comparison and \( P(E) \) is a common factor:

\[ \text{Normalized } P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.0075}{0.0075 + 0.05} \approx 0.13 \]
\[ \text{Normalized } P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.05}{0.0075 + 0.05} \approx 0.87 \]

### Result
Given these calculations, we have:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.13,
  "computer science": 0.87
}
```

These values reflect the relative likelihoods of Adam being enrolled in business administration or computer science based on his personality sketch.
