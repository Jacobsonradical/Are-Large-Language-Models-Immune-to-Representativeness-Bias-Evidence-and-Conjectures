To calculate \( P(H|E) \) for both business administration and computer science, we'll use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to estimate the following probabilities for each field:

1. \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field (based on general likelihoods).
2. \( P(E|H) \): Probability of the given personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of the given personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in another field.

### Business Administration

#### Prior Probability: \( P(H) \)
- Let's estimate \( P(H) \) generally. Graduate students in the U.S. have diverse fields of study, and business administration is a relatively common field.
  - We may assign a somewhat moderate probability, say \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

#### Likelihood: \( P(E|H) \)
- Consider how likely the personality sketch \( E \) is for someone in business administration:
  - Curiosity about nature and plants: Unlikely but not impossible for a business admin student.
  - Enjoys solving puzzles: Possible, especially if interested in problem-solving aspects of business.
  - Strong empathy and love for animals: Can be common but not defining for business administration.
  - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts: Possible for business strategy and analytics.
  - Overall, let's estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \).

#### Likelihood: \( P(E|\neg H) \)
- Measure how likely it is for the rest of the graduate population to fit the profile:
  - Many fields (like psychology, biology, environmental science) closely align with his description.
  - This value would be higher, say \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \).

### Computer Science

#### Prior Probability: \( P(H) \)
- Computer Science is a common graduate field, especially in the U.S. Given its prevalence:
  - Let's assign \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

#### Likelihood: \( P(E|H) \)
- Consider how likely the personality sketch \( E \) fits someone in computer science:
  - Curiosity about nature and plants: Atypical but not exclusive (think of computational biology, etc.).
  - Enjoys solving puzzles: Very likely for CS students.
  - Strong empathy and love for animals: Less typical for CS, but possible, especially if interdisciplinary (e.g., AI for animal behavior).
  - High intelligence and abstract thinking: Highly likely for CS students.
  - Overall, let's estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \).

#### Likelihood: \( P(E|\neg H) \)
- This would be similar to above non-specific fields but still on the higher side:
  - Let's consider \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \).

### Calculations

Now let's apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have \( P(E) \) explicitly, we'll use the values we have:

#### Business Administration:
\[ \text{Numerator} = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \cdot 0.1 = 0.02 \]
\[ \text{Denominator} = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H)) = 0.02 + 0.4 \cdot 0.9 = 0.38 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.38} \approx 0.053 \]

#### Computer Science:
\[ \text{Numerator} = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.3 \cdot 0.2 = 0.06 \]
\[ \text{Desnominator} = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H)) = 0.06 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8 = 0.38 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.38} \approx 0.158 \]

Resulting in the values:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.053,
  "computer science": 0.158
}
