To calculate the probability \( P(H|E) \) through Bayes' rule, we'll work through the following steps for each field:

1. Estimate \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field.
2. Estimate \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam has the personality sketch \( E \) given that he is enrolled in that field.
3. Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that Adam has the personality sketch \( E \) given that he is not enrolled in that field.
4. Apply Bayes' rule: 
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   For simplicity, we can assume the same normalization constant since exact values of \( P(E) \) are not given and not needed for relative comparison.
   
Since we are comparing only two specific fields, let's assume some reasonable priors based on the nature of the fields and the information provided about Adam. Note that these are qualitative estimates:

1. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H) \): This is generally less likely due to the mismatch between Adam’s described interests and typical interests in business administration.
   
     \( \approx 0.2 \)
   
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's personality sketch fits poorly with the typical personality that would choose business administration (e.g., interests in nature, empathy towards animals, puzzles).
   
     \( \approx 0.1 \)
   
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam having this personality sketch while not being in business administration.
     
     \( \approx 0.7 \)
     
   Hence:
   \[
   P(H|E)_{business\; administration} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \propto 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02
   \]

2. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): This is more likely due to Adam’s high intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and understanding of abstract concepts.
     
     \( \approx 0.4 \)
     
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam’s personality and interests align well with computer science (e.g., puzzle-solving, intelligence, appreciation for hard work).
     
     \( \approx 0.6 \)
     
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam having this personality sketch while not being in computer science.
     
     \( \approx 0.3 \)
   
   Hence:
   \[
   P(H|E)_{computer\; science} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \propto 0.6 \times 0.4 = 0.24
   \]

Now, normalizing these proportional values:
- For business administration: 
  \[
  \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.24} \approx 0.077
  \]
- For computer science:
  \[
  \frac{0.24}{0.02 + 0.24} \approx 0.923
  \]

Thus, the respective probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being in business administration and computer science are approximately:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.077,
  "computer science": 0.923
}
