To estimate the probabilities, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Here’s a structured approach:

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, directly calculating \( P(E) \) precisely is difficult without comprehensive data, but we can make relative comparisons. We'll leverage the values of \( P(E|H) \) and use reasonable assumptions for \( P(H) \) based on common enrollment statistics.

Assumptions and Simplifications:
1. \( P(H) \) denotes the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
2. \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in \( H \).
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of personality sketch \( E \) given Adam was not enrolled in \( H \).

For simplicity, let's assume:
- \( P(H) \) for both fields is approximately proportional (assuming some broad equal prior), so we can set them both as equal or relative commonness.
- \( P(H) \sim 0.1 \) to show that graduates might be evenly distributed among various fields.

### Business Administration:
- Curiosity about nature and empathy might not align strongly with typical business administration traits, but it’s not impossible.
- \( P(E|H_{business}) \) might be relatively low.

### Computer Science:
- High intelligence and interest in solving puzzles fit well within the context of computer science.
- \( P(E|H_{cs}) \) might be relatively high.

We assign:
- \( P(E|H_{business}) \approx 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{business}) = \frac{P(E) - P(E|H_{business}) \cdot P(H_{business})}{1 - P(H_{business})} \approx 0.5 \)
- \( P(E|H_{cs}) \approx 0.8 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{cs}) = \frac{P(E) - P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs})}{1 - P(H_{cs})} \approx 0.4 \)

### Applying Bayes' Theorem:
For Business Administration:
\[ 
P(H_{business}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{business}) \cdot P(H_{business})}{P(E)} 
\approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.5 \cdot 0.9} 
= \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.45} 
\approx 0.042
\]

For Computer Science:
\[ 
P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs})}{P(E)} 
\approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.4 \cdot 0.9} 
= \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.36} 
\approx 0.182
\]

Summarizing:



{
  "business administration": 0.042,
  "computer science": 0.182
}

Note: These calculations are based on approximate judgments for the probabilities. More accurate data can refine these values, but the above serves as a reasonable estimation given the context.
