Sure, let's proceed with estimating the probabilities. We will make educated guesses to provide values for each field using Bayes' theorem. Remember that this is a simplification and the true values might vary.

### **Hypothesis Estimation:**
1. **P(H)** - the prior probability of the hypothesis without additional information.
2. **P(E|H)** - the probability of evidence given that the hypothesis is true.
3. **P(E|\neg H)** - the probability of evidence given that the hypothesis is false.
4. **P(H|E)** - the probability of hypothesis given evidence (calculated using Bayes' theorem).

### **Bayes' Theorem:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \)

Let's denote,

- **H1:** Adam is enrolled in business administration.
- **H2:** Adam is enrolled in computer science.

We then estimate:

- \( \neg H1 \) denotes Adam is not enrolled in business administration.
- \( \neg H2 \) denotes Adam is not enrolled in computer science.

### **Assumptions:**
- **P(H1)**: Prior probability of a graduate student being in business administration.
- **P(H2)**: Prior probability of a graduate student being in computer science.

Considering the nature of the evidence, Adam’s personality sketch:

### Estimations:

#### Business Administration:
- **P(H1)**: For example, let’s assume 20% of graduate students are in business administration.
- **P(E|H1)**: Given the personality, it's less likely for someone with such traits to be in business administration. Let's assume 0.1.
- **P(E|\neg H1)**: Assuming Adam's traits not being in business administration spread relatively equally among other fields, let's estimate 0.2.

#### Computer Science:
- **P(H2)**: Let's assume 25% of graduate students are in computer science.
- **P(E|H2)**: Given Adam's high intelligence, curiosity about abstract concepts, and problem-solving skills, it's plausible. Let’s assume 0.5.
- **P(E|\neg H2)**: Again, considering similar distribution of Adam’s traits among other fields, let's estimate 0.15.

### Calculations:

#### Business Administration:
Using Bayes’ theorem:
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1) + P(E|\neg H1) \cdot P(\neg H1) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.2 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.16 = 0.18 \]

So,
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.18} \approx 0.111 \]

#### Computer Science:
Using Bayes’ theorem:
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2) + P(E|\neg H2) \cdot P(\neg H2) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.5 \cdot 0.25) + (0.15 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.125 + 0.1125 = 0.2375 \]

So,
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.25}{0.2375} \approx 0.526 \]

### Conclusion:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.111,
  "computer science": 0.526
}
```

These probabilities are estimated based on the given personality sketch and assumptions used to fill in the missing data. Adjusting the assumptions can lead to different probability estimates.
