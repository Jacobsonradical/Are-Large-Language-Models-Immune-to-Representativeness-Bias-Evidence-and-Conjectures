To determine the likelihood that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or computer science given his personality sketch, we need to estimate certain probabilities and apply Bayes' rule.

Firstly, let's break down each term:

- P(H): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- P(E|H): The probability of observing the evidence (personality sketch) given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- P(E|¬H): The probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is not enrolled in that field.
- P(H|E): The posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in that field given the evidence (personality sketch).

Next, we will input our judgments for these fields:

1. **Business Administration**:
    - P(H1): The general likelihood that a graduate is in business administration might be moderate, say around \(0.2\) (20%).
    - P(E|H1): Given Adam's personality traits, it does not strongly connect to business administration, making this low, say \(0.05\) (5%).
    - P(E|¬H1): Assuming that Adam's traits from nature-related fields (like environmental sciences) or psychology are more likely, we should reflect this larger probability in the denominator, say around \(0.2\) (20%).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1)}{P(E)} \]

Since we are more interested in the comparative posterior probabilities between fields, we can simplify:

\[ P(H1|E) \propto P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1) \]

2. **Computer Science**:
    - P(H2): Let's estimate this to be around \(0.15\) (15%), considering graduate distribution.
    - P(E|H2): Given Adam's high intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles, this would be moderate to high, say \(0.6\) (60%).
    - P(E|¬H2): As with the other field, we could consider around \(0.2\) (20%) for consistency in other likely fields.

Now using Bayes' rule similarly:
\[ P(H2|E) \propto P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2) \]

Let's compare the posterior probabilities with approximate values and compare:

For business administration:
\[ P(H1|E) = 0.05 \cdot 0.2 = 0.01 \]

For computer science:
\[ P(H2|E) = 0.6 \cdot 0.15 = 0.09 \]

Thus, the normalized (not necessarily summing to 1 but reflecting comparative likelihood):

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.01,
  "computer science": 0.09
}
```

This shows that given Adam’s personality sketch, it’s significantly more likely (albeit not certain) that he was enrolled in a field like computer science compared to business administration.
