To follow the Bayesian inference process, let's assign some reasonable probabilities.

1. **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a certain field.
2. **P(E|H):** The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he's in that field.
3. **P(E|¬H):** The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he's not in that field.

### Computer Science
#### Let's assign:
- **P(H):** Prior probability of a graduate student being in computer science. We'll set this to 0.25 as a rough average given the popularity of the field.
- **P(E|H):** Given Adam's characteristics (high intelligence, good at abstract concepts, enjoys solving puzzles), he fits well with someone in computer science. We'll set this to 0.8.
- **P(E|¬H):** The likelihood of Adam having these characteristics if he is not in computer science. Considering there's a diverse range of fields, this may be around 0.4.

Now, applying Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be expanded as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

So:

\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.4 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.2 + 0.3 = 0.5 \]

Using this:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.5} = \frac{0.2}{0.5} = 0.4 \]

### Business Administration
#### Let's assign:
- **P(H):** Prior probability of a graduate student being in business administration. This could be set to 0.15 given it is a common but less common field in some university settings.
- **P(E|H):** Adam's characteristics (empathy, warm heart, love for animals) are less strongly associated with business administration, so we might set this to 0.3.
- **P(E|¬H):** The likelihood of Adam having these characteristics if he is not in business administration, considering the wide range of other fields, around 0.5.

Now, applying Bayes' rule:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

So:

\[ P(E) = 0.3 \cdot 0.15 + 0.5 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.045 + 0.425 = 0.47 \]

Using this:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.15}{0.47} = \frac{0.045}{0.47} \approx 0.096 \]
