Let's begin by making some reasonable assumptions about the probabilities:

### Assumptions
We'll start with some rough estimates of the prior probabilities \( P(H) \):
- \( P(H_{cs}) \): Probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(H_{ba}) \): Probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in business administration.

For the sake of this problem, let's assume:
- \( P(H_{cs}) = 0.2 \): Computer science is a popular field among graduate students.
- \( P(H_{ba}) = 0.2 \): Business administration is also a popular discipline, comparable in popularity to computer science.

Next, let's consider the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) for each field:
- \( P(E|H_{cs}) \): Probability of E given Adam is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H_{ba}) \): Probability of E given Adam is enrolled in business administration.

Based on Adam's personality sketch:
- His genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work suggest that he may be less likely to be in business administration, where competitive and high-stress environments are common. Instead, these traits could be more compatible with fields like ecological sciences, environmental science, psychology, or computer science (given his puzzle-solving and abstract thinking skills).
  
Let's roughly estimate:
- \( P(E|H_{cs}) = 0.3 \): Traits such as high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving align well with computer science. However, the empathy and love for animals are not typical for the field but not incongruent.
- \( P(E|H_{ba}) = 0.05 \): Traits like strong empathy, love for animals, and strong appreciation for hard work make it less likely for Adam to pursue business administration.

Finally, consider the likelihoods \( P(E|\neg H) \) for not being in each field:
- \( P(E|\neg H_{cs}) = 0.1 \): Graduate students not in computer science still share some, but fewer common traits with Adam's profile.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{ba}) = 0.7 \): Students not in business administration are significantly more likely to share Adam's empathetic and nature-loving traits.

Now let's apply Bayes' Rule to compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs}) + P(E|\neg H_{cs}) \cdot P(\neg H_{cs}) \):
\[  P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.2)  + (0.1 \cdot 0.8)  = 0.06 + 0.08 = 0.14 \]

And \( P(H|E) = \frac{(0.3) \cdot (0.2)}{0.14} \approx 0.4286 \)

Similarly for 
\[  P(E|H_{ba}) \cdot P(H_{ba}) + P(E|\neg H_{ba}) \cdot P(\neg H_{ba}) \]
\[  P(E) = (0.05 \cdot 0.2) + (0.7 \cdot 0.8) = 0.01 + 0.56 = 0.57 \]

The probability
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}  \]
\[  P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{(0.05) \cdot (0.2)}{0.57} \approx 0.01754 \]

### Final Judgments
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4286,
  "business administration": 0.01754
}
``` 
These are just estimated probabilitiesâ€”the actual probabilities could differ based on more accurate prior knowledge and assumptions.
