To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to calculate the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). Given that we need to compare the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in business administration or computer science based on his personality sketch \( E \), let's start with evaluating the required probabilities:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This is the initial probability of Adam being enrolled in each field without considering the evidence.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in each specific field.

3. **Probability of the Evidence \( P(E) \)**: This is the overall probability of observing the evidence \( E \), which we can calculate as:

   \[
   P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ba}}) + P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}}) + \text{probabilities for other fields}
   \]

Since the question does not specify what percentage of graduate students are in each field, we will make educated assumptions for our calculations.

### Business Administration
**P(H) (Prior)**: Let's assume a fairly generic distribution of graduate enrollments, with business fields being popular but not dominant:
\[ P(H_{\text{ba}}) = 0.2 \]

**P(E|H) (Likelihood)**: Consider the personality traits and interests. Adam's interests in nature, plants, animals, and solving puzzles seem less aligned with typical business administration traits, where skills in management, economics, and quantitative analysis are more important:
\[ P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) = 0.1 \]

**P(E|¬H) (Complement Likelihood)**: Business administration students who do not share Adam's traits:
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{ba}}) \approx 1 - 0.1 = 0.9 \]

### Computer Science
**P(H) (Prior)**: Computer science is a common graduate field, especially in the U.S., but still assume it’s a moderate probability:
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.15 \]

**P(E|H) (Likelihood)**: Adam's intelligence, abstract thinking, and problem-solving abilities align well with the traits of a computer science student. His empathy and love for animals are not usual determining factors but don't conflict:
\[ P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.6 \]

**P(E|¬H) (Complement Likelihood)**: Computer science students who do not share Adam's specific set of traits and interests:
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}}) \approx 1 - 0.6 = 0.4 \]

Now, we employ Bayes' theorem to find \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For calculating \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ba}}) + P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}}) + \text{Other fields sum} \]

Assume the sum of other fields probability contributions is constant.

### Calculation

**Business Administration**

\[ P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ba}}) = 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02 \]

**Computer Science**

\[ P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.6 \times 0.15 = 0.09 \]

Hence,

\[ P(E) \approx 0.02 + 0.09 = 0.11 \]

Now,

**Business Administration**

\[ P(H_{\text{ba}}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.11} \approx 0.18 \]

**Computer Science**

\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.11} \approx 0.82 \]

### Final Answer
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.18,
  "computer science": 0.82
}
```
