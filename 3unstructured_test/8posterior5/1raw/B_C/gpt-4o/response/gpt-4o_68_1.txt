To address the given problem with the help of Bayes' theorem, we will estimate the relevant probabilities and then use these estimates to compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field (computer science and business administration).

Firstly, we denote:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the specified field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the evidence (the personality sketch) given that Adam is enrolled in the specified field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is not enrolled in the specified field.
- \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in the specified field given his personality sketch.

Let's break down the computations for each field:

### Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Based on enrollment statistics in various graduate fields, let's assume an average graduate student has about a 10% chance of being in computer science.
   \[
   P(H)_{\text{CS}} = 0.10
   \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The personality sketch suggests analytical intelligence, problem-solving skills, and interest in abstract concepts, which are traits conducive to computer science. Therefore, let's assume a fairly high likelihood:
   \[
   P(E|H)_{\text{CS}} = 0.7
   \]

3. **Evidence \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of observing such personality traits in students not enrolled in computer science (considering a broad graduate student population) might be moderate since such traits are valuable in many fields:
   \[
   P(E|\neg H)_{\text{CS}} = 0.2
   \]

Using Bayes' theorem, we compute:
\[
P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} = \frac{P(E|H)_{\text{CS}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{CS}}}{P(E|H)_{\text{CS}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{CS}} + P(E|\neg H)_{\text{CS}} \cdot P(\neg H)_{\text{CS}}}
\]
Assuming \( P(\neg H)_{\text{CS}} = 1 - P(H)_{\text{CS}} \):
\[
P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.10}{0.7 \cdot 0.10 + 0.2 \cdot 0.90} = \frac{0.07}{0.07 + 0.18} = \frac{0.07}{0.25} = 0.28
\]

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Letâ€™s assume an average graduate student has about a 10% chance of being in business administration.
   \[
   P(H)_{\text{BA}} = 0.10
   \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The personality sketch is less indicative of typical business administration traits (compared to technical problem-solving and abstract concepts). We assign a lower likelihood:
   \[
   P(E|H)_{\text{BA}} = 0.3
   \]

3. **Evidence \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's traits in students not enrolled in business administration might be higher, considering the diverse graduate population:
   \[
   P(E|\neg H)_{\text{BA}} = 0.25
   \]

Again, using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} = \frac{P(E|H)_{\text{BA}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{BA}}}{P(E|H)_{\text{BA}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{BA}} + P(E|\neg H)_{\text{BA}} \cdot P(\neg H)_{\text{BA}}}
\]
Assuming \( P(\neg H)_{\text{BA}} = 1 - P(H)_{\text{BA}} \):
\[
P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.10}{0.3 \cdot 0.10 + 0.25 \cdot 0.90} = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.225} = \frac{0.03}{0.255} \approx 0.12
\]

#### Combined Results

\[
\{
  "computer science": 0.28,
  "business administration": 0.12
\}
\]

Note: The above probabilities are based on assumed values for prior probabilities and conditional probabilities. Real-world data may yield different results.
