To determine \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need the following components:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.

Then, Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we are comparing fields rather than looking for absolute probabilities, we can generally simplify our calculations by focusing on the relative probabilities without needing the exact value of \( P(E) \).

Let's evaluate each field:

### Business Administration

1. **\( P(H) \)**: Graduate programs in business administration are popular fields, so assuming no other information, let’s assign a moderate prior probability, say 0.2.

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: Given the personality sketch, it seems less likely that someone with a strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, and interest in abstract concepts would naturally fit into business administration, which typically focuses less on these areas. I would assign a relatively low probability, say 0.1.

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of someone with this sketch being in any other field is presumably higher, given the broad range of other areas that could match these personality traits. Let's assign a value of 0.9 for this.

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{(0.1 \times 0.2) + (0.9 \times 0.8)} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.72} = \frac{0.02}{0.74} \approx 0.027 \]

### Computer Science

1. **\( P(H) \)**: Computer science is also a popular field and more compatible with high intelligence and interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts. Assign a moderate prior probability, say 0.3.

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam’s traits (solving puzzles, high intelligence, abstract concepts), there is a higher likelihood that he is in computer science. Assign a high probability, say 0.7.

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of having this personality sketch in other fields that are not computer science is moderately high, due to the broad scope of other fields. Assign a value of 0.6.

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.7 \times 0.3}{(0.7 \times 0.3) + (0.6 \times 0.7)} = \frac{0.21}{0.21 + 0.42} = \frac{0.21}{0.63} \approx 0.333 \]

Combining the results, we have:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.027,
  "computer science": 0.333
}
```

These values should be interpreted relatively, indicating that with the given personality sketch, Adam is more likely to be enrolled in computer science than in business administration.
