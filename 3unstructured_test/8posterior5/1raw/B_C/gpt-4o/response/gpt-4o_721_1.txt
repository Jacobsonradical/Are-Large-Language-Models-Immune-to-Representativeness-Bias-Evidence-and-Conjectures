To address this problem using Bayes' rule, we need to go through the following steps for each field:

1. Define \( P(H) \) - the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
2. Define \( P(E|H) \) - the likelihood of observing E given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
3. Define \( P(E|\neg H) \) - the likelihood of observing E given that Adam is not enrolled in that field.
4. Use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \) - the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field given the personality sketch.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

To make a reasonable estimation for each field, we'll assume priors and likelihoods based on typical associations of the described traits with different fields.

### Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
   - Assume the base rate of a student being in computer science is relatively common, say \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   - Traits like high intelligence and an affinity for solving puzzles align well with computer science, so let’s estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   - The likelihood of having such traits among all non-computer science students might be moderately common, so let’s say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

Using the provided values, we get:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.7 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.14}{0.14 + 0.32} ≈ \frac{0.14}{0.46} ≈ 0.304 \]

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
   - Assume the base rate of a student being in business administration is also common, say \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   - Traits like genuine curiosity about nature, empathy, and strong appreciation for hard work may not be as strongly associated with business administration. Therefore, let’s estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   - The likelihood of having such traits among all non-business administration students might be fairly similar to general population, so let’s say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

Using the provided values, we get:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.4} ≈ \frac{0.06}{0.46} ≈ 0.13 \]

### Final Answers

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.304,
  "business administration": 0.13
}
```

This result suggests that, based on the personality sketch provided, Adam is more likely to have been enrolled in a computer science program compared to a business administration program.
