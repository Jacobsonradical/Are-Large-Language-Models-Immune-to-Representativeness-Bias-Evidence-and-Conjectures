Let's analyze the given information and make reasonable assumptions to estimate the probabilities for each field of study.

Firstly, let’s outline our assumptions:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being in each of these fields.
   - Since there are many possible fields of graduate study, the prior for each specific field is relatively low. However, we can assume some fields might be slightly more likely than others based on common trends.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is in the specific field.
   - Adam's personality traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, solving puzzles) and background can suggest a higher fit for some fields over others. 

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that Adam is not in the specific field.
   - This is the complement probability to account for the various other fields he could be in.

With these in mind, let’s estimate:

### For Business Administration:
- **P(H)**: Business programs are common, but considering Adam’s interests in nature and puzzles, business might be less likely than a field like biology or environmental science. Let's estimate P(H) ≈ 0.05.
- **P(E|H)**: Business administration does not strongly correlate with a love for animals or nature, implying P(E|H) is low. Let’s estimate P(E|H) ≈ 0.01.
- **P(E|¬H)**: Given the diverse range of other fields, P(E|¬H) should be similar across non-business areas. Let's estimate a higher P(E|¬H) ≈ 0.05.

Using Bayes' Rule: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where 
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|¬H) \times P(¬H) \]
\[ P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) \]

\[
\begin{align*}
P(E) &= (0.01 \times 0.05) + (0.05 \times 0.95) \\
&= 0.0005 + 0.0475 \\
&= 0.048
\end{align*}
\]

\[
\begin{align*}
P(H|E) &= \frac{0.01 \times 0.05}{0.048} \\
&= \frac{0.0005}{0.048} \\
&≈ 0.0104 
\end{align*}
\]

### For Computer Science:
- **P(H)**: Computer Science is a very common graduate field, especially appealing to those who enjoy solving puzzles. Let's estimate P(H) ≈ 0.15.
- **P(E|H)**: Traits like high intelligence and appreciation for puzzles fit well, so P(E|H) is reasonably high. Let’s estimate P(E|H) ≈ 0.2.
- **P(E|¬H)**: Given the wide range of other fields and the match of personality traits, P(E|¬H) should be lower. Let's estimate P(E|¬H) ≈ 0.05.

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[
\begin{align*}
P(E) &= (0.2 \times 0.15) + (0.05 \times 0.85) \\
&= 0.03 + 0.0425 \\
&= 0.0725 
\end{align*}
\]

\[
\begin{align*}
P(H|E) &= \frac{0.2 \times 0.15}{0.0725} \\
&= \frac{0.03}{0.0725} \\
&≈ 0.4138 
\end{align*}
\]

Based on our estimates and calculations, we have:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0104,
  "computer science": 0.4138
}
```
These values reflect the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in each specified field, given his described personality traits.
