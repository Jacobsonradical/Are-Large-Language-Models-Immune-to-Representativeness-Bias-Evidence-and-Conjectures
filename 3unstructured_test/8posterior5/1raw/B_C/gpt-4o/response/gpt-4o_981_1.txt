To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the marginal likelihoods \( P(E|\neg H) \). However, without specific data, I will make reasonable assumptions based on Adam's personality sketch and the typical attributes associated with these fields.

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Prior, \( P(H) \): Assume computer science is a relatively common graduate field, let's say \( P(\text{CS}) = 0.2 \).
   - Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \): Adam's strong intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts are highly relevant to computer science, but his deep love for nature and animals doesn't necessarily correlate. Assume \( P(E|\text{CS}) = 0.4 \).
   - Marginal likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \): Assume other fields could match Adam's personality better, so \( P(E|\neg \text{CS}) = 0.6 \).

   Using Bayes' rule:
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(E)}
   \]
   where \( P(E) \) can be computed, but for simplicity and keeping \( P(E) = 1 \) as a normalization constant:
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.6 \cdot (1 - 0.2)} \approx \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.48} \approx 0.14
   \]

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Prior, \( P(H) \): Assume business administration is also a relatively common field, say \( P(\text{BA}) = 0.15 \).
   - Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \): Adam's warm heart and empathy might play a role, but business administration typically might not strongly match someone deeply motivated by nature and love for animals. Assume \( P(E|\text{BA}) = 0.2 \).
   - Marginal likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \): Similarly, assume \( P(E|\neg \text{BA}) = 0.6 \).

   Using Bayes' rule:
   \[
   P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{BA}) \cdot P(\text{BA})}{P(E)}
   \]
   where normalization happens similar to above,
   \[
   P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{0.2 \cdot 0.15 + 0.6 \cdot (1 - 0.15)} \approx \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.51} \approx 0.06
   \]

Given these assumptions, summarizing the answers:

  "computer science": 0.14,
  "business administration": 0.06
