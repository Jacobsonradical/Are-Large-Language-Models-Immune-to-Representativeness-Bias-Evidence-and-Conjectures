To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \), we start by considering the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood of the evidence given any other hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H) \). We will use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that:
- \( H \) can be "business administration" or "computer science".
- \( E \) denotes the personality sketch of Adam.

Here are the steps to estimate \( P(H|E) \):

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
    - Assume \( P(H) \) represents the prior probability of a graduate student being enrolled in a specific field. Let's assume equal priors as a starting point for simplicity and given no additional information:
    
    \[ P(\text{business administration}) = 0.1 \]
    \[ P(\text{computer science}) = 0.1 \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
    - **Business Administration**: Adam's curiosity about nature and love for animals do not strongly correlate with business administration but his empathy and appreciation for hard work may somewhat. So, we might estimate:
    
    \[ P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.1 \]
    
    - **Computer Science**: Adam's intelligence and interest in puzzles align more with computer science, although his empathy and love for animals do not strongly indicate this field, we might estimate:
    
    \[ P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.3 \]
    
3. **Evidence Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
    - This involves the probability of the evidence given that Adam is not in the specified fields, which is more complex but let's assume itâ€™s about the same level for general graduate fields, suggesting curiosity, empathy, and love for animals lean towards natural sciences.
    
    \[ P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) = 0.7 \]
    \[ P(E|\neg \text{computer science}) = 0.7 \]

4. **Normalization by Evidence \( P(E) \)**:
    - The sum over all possible hypothesis in specific fields plus the general baseline, though realistically the normalization factor usually ensures the total probability sums to 1.

Given all this, we can apply Bayes' Rule:

### Business Administration:
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.7} = \frac{0.01}{0.7} \approx 0.014 \]

### Computer Science:
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.7} = \frac{0.03}{0.7} \approx 0.043 \]

Based on these calculations, the approximate probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.014,
  "computer science": 0.043
}
```

Note the assumption of priors and likelihoods here is illustrative; actual values could differ based on more nuanced or detailed real-world data.
