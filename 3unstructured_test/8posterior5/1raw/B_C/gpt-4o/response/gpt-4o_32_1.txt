Let's break down the information given and apply Bayes' theorem to calculate \( P(H|E) \), the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given the personality sketch \( E \).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in a certain field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given he is in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given he is not in that field.

Let's define our hypotheses:
- \( H_{CS} \): Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( H_{BA} \): Adam was enrolled in business administration.

### Step-by-step Breakdown:

#### Computer Science
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H_{CS}) \)**:
   Based on general knowledge of graduate programs, the prior probability of any given student being in computer science might be relatively moderate but not overwhelmingly large.

   Let's assume \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.3 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{CS}) \)**:
   - Curiosity about nature and plants: Not highly related to computer science.
   - Enjoys solving puzzles: Strongly related to computer science.
   - Empathy and love for animals: Not highly related.
   - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: Strongly related.
   - Appreciation for hard work: Related to any graduate field.

   We may say \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) is moderately high due to the alignment with problem-solving and abstract thinking.

   Let's assume \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.6 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \)**:
   This would involve considering how likely the sketch is for other students not in computer science. Given the general nature, we can assume it's somewhat probable.

   Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.4 \).

#### Business Administration
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H_{BA}) \)**:
   Again, using general knowledge, we can assume the prior probability is moderate.

   Let's assume \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.2 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{BA}) \)**:
   - Curiosity about nature: Not highly related to business administration.
   - Enjoys solving puzzles: Somewhat related.
   - Empathy and love for animals: Not highly related.
   - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: Required but not as essential as in computer science.
   - Appreciation for hard work: Related to any graduate field.

   We may say \( P(E|H_{BA}) \) is moderate but lower than for computer science.

   Let's assume \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.4 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \)**:
   Similar to the previous consideration for fields outside of business administration.

   Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.5 \).

### Calculate \( P(H|E) \):
#### Computer Science
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{CS}))} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.3}{0.6 \cdot 0.3 + 0.4 \cdot 0.7} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.18}{0.18 + 0.28} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.18}{0.46} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \approx 0.39 \]

#### Business Administration
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{BA}))} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.8} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.4} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.48} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx 0.17 \]

### Final Answer
{
  "computer science": 0.39,
  "business administration": 0.17
