To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field through Bayesâ€™ rule, we first need to estimate the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Let's structure our approach for the fields of business administration and computer science.

### 1. Business Administration

#### Prior Probability, \( P(H) \):
- Business administration is a common field of study in graduate programs.
- Let's assume \( P(H) \) to be 0.2 (20%).

#### Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \):
- A personality with a genuine curiosity about nature, appreciation for hard work, empathy, and love for animals might not typically align with the skills and personality traits usually associated with business administration.
- Let's assume \( P(E|H) \) to be 0.1 (10%).

#### Complement Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \):
- Since the likes of nature, puzzles, and animals are not specifically aligned with business administration, \( P(E|\neg H) \) might be higher.
- Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) \) to be 0.4 (40%).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.1 \times 0.2 + 0.4 \times 0.8} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.32} = \frac{0.02}{0.34} \approx 0.059 \]

### 2. Computer Science

#### Prior Probability, \( P(H) \):
- Computer science is also a common field of graduate study.
- Let's assume \( P(H) \) to be 0.2 (20%).

#### Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \):
- Computer science aligns well with high intelligence, solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts which matches Adam's personality.
- Let's assume \( P(E|H) \) to be 0.6 (60%).

#### Complement Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \):
- Even if Adam wasn't in computer science, his traits (curiosity, empathy, etc.) might suggest an alignment with fields requiring detailed analysis.
- Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) \) to be 0.3 (30%).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.2}{0.6 \times 0.2 + 0.3 \times 0.8} = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.24} = \frac{0.12}{0.36} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.333 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.059,
  "computer science": 0.333
}
```
