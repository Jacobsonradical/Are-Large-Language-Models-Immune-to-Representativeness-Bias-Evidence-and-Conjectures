To solve this problem, we first need to evaluate several probabilities for each field: 

1. P(H): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the given field.
2. P(E|H): The probability that we would observe the personality sketch E if Adam is enrolled in the given field.
3. P(E|¬H): The probability that we would observe the personality sketch E if Adam is not enrolled in the given field.
4. Using these probabilities, we can compute P(H|E) using Bayes' Rule: \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \).

Since we don't have exact numbers, we need to make educated guesses based on the personality sketch provided.

1. **Business Administration**:
   - P(H): Let's assume that the probability of any random student choosing Business Administration is moderate. We might set P(H)=0.2 (20%).
   - P(E|H): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is a business administration student seems relatively low because traits like high empathy and a deep love for animals are not strongly associated with business administration. Let’s say P(E|H)=0.1 (10%).
   - P(E|¬H): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is not in business administration might be higher as these traits can be common among students in fields such as biology, psychology, or environmental science. Let's assume P(E|¬H)=0.4 (40%).

2. **Computer Science**:
   - P(H): The prior probability of any random student choosing computer science could be moderate to high. We might set P(H)=0.3 (30%).
   - P(E|H): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is a computer science student seems more fitting because of his intelligence and interest in solving puzzles. Let’s say P(E|H)=0.3 (30%).
   - P(E|¬H): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is not in computer science would be similar to the above, P(E|¬H)=0.4 (40%).

Now we will compute P(H|E) using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since P(E) is the same for both calculations, we'll skip the normalization constant.

For **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.02}{P(E)} \]

For **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.3}{P(E)} = \frac{0.09}{P(E)} \]

To compare these proportions, we do not need the exact value of P(E). It's clear that:

\[ P(H|E \text{ for Computer Science}) > P(H|E \text{ for Business Administration}) \]

So let's represent this in our final format:

{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.09
}
