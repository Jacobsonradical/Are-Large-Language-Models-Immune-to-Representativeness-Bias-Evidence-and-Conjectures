To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) through Bayes' Rule, we need to determine the necessary probabilities:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given that he was enrolled in the given field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given that he was not enrolled in the given field.

Bayes' Rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be derived as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Without precise values, we'll use reasonable assumptions based on general knowledge and Adam's personality sketch.

### For Computer Science

- **P(H)**: The likelihood of any given male graduate student in the U.S. being enrolled in Computer Science.
  - Let's assume a prior: \( P(H) = 0.2 \)

- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality given he is in Computer Science.
  - Given his high intelligence, abstract thinking, and love for problem-solving, this boosts the probability: \( P(E|H) = 0.5 \)

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality given he is not in Computer Science.
  - Given his traits are somewhat common in fields outside Computer Science but less so than within, we estimate: \(  P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \)

### For Business Administration

- **P(H)**: The likelihood of any given male graduate student in the U.S. being enrolled in Business Administration.
  - Let's assume a prior: \( P(H) = 0.15 \)

- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality given he is in Business Administration.
  - His love for nature and animals slightly less aligns with typical characteristics in business administration, though his empathy and intelligence help: \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \)

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality given he is not in Business Administration.
  - Since these traits are also somewhat common in other fields: \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.15 \)

### Computing Bayes' Rule
We should compute \( P(E) \) for Computer Science and Business Administration respectively to determine \( P(H|E) \) for each field. 

However, to simplify (assuming a baseline without additional context):

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

Let's denote \( P(\neg H) \approx 0.8 \) (assuming a wide range of fields):

For Computer Science:
\[ P(E) = 0.5 \times 0.2 + 0.1 \times 0.8 = 0.1 + 0.08 = 0.18 \]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.18} \approx 0.555
\]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(E) = 0.3 \times 0.15 + 0.15 \times 0.85 = 0.045 + 0.1275 = 0.1725 \]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.15}{0.1725} \approx 0.261
\]

So, the final results are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.555,
  "business administration": 0.261
}
