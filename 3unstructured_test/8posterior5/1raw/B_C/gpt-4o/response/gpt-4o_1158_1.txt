To solve this problem using Bayes' rule, we'll need to use the following formula to compute the posterior probability of Adam being in each field given his personality sketch \( E \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we need only the relative values, we can ignore \(P(E)\) (which acts as a normalizing constant) and focus on the terms \(P(H)\), \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E|\neg H)\).

1. **Business Administration**
   - \(P(H)\): Probability of being enrolled in Business Administration. Assuming no prior information, we can assume an equal likelihood for any field or that P(H) is relatively similar for all fields.
   - \(P(E|H)\): Probability of the personality sketch given enrollment in Business Administration.
     - Business Administration students may have empathy, intelligence, or appreciation for hard work, but are less likely to have a strong curiosity about nature, puzzles, or a deep love for animals. Thus, \(P(E|H)\) should be low.
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\): Probability of the personality sketch given enrollment in any other field besides Business Administration. Given the sketch, curiosity about nature and abstract concepts might fit other fields better (e.g., natural sciences, psychology), making \(P(E|\neg H)\) relatively high.

2. **Computer Science**
   - \(P(H)\): Likelihood of being enrolled in Computer Science. Similar to above, we assume an approximately equal likelihood.
   - \(P(E|H)\): Probability of the personality sketch given enrollment in Computer Science.
     - Computer Science students are likely to be good at solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts. Thus, \(P(E|H)\) should be relatively high.
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\): Probability of the personality sketch given enrollment in any other field besides Computer Science. Given Adam's characteristics, \(P(E|\neg H)\) should be relatively balanced but lower than for fields specifically matching the sketch.

For simplicity, assume:
- \(P(H)\) (both fields have equal prior probability) = 0.5
- \(P(E|BusinessAdmin) \approx 0.2\)
- \(P(E|\neg BusinessAdmin) \approx 0.8\)
- \(P(E|CompSci) \approx 0.7\)
- \(P(E|\neg CompSci) \approx 0.3\)

Using Bayes' Rule, we get:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) = 0.2 \cdot 0.5 = 0.1 \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) = 0.7 \cdot 0.5 = 0.35 \]

Normalizing to get probabilistic values:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.1 + 0.35} = \frac{0.1}{0.45} \approx 0.222 \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.35}{0.1 + 0.35} = \frac{0.35}{0.45} \approx 0.778 \]

Thus, the results are approximately:

{
  "business administration": 0.222,
  "computer science": 0.778
}
