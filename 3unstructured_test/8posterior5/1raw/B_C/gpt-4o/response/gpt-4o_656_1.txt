Sure, let's break down the process to compute \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' Rule. Bayes' Rule states:

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

We need to estimate the following probabilities for each field:

- \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in the field.

Since we don't have specific data, we'll make reasonable assumptions based on typical distributions and characteristics associated with these fields.

### For Computer Science

#### \(P(H)\)
Let's assume a moderate prior that Adam could be enrolled in Computer Science. Computer Science is a common graduate field, so:

\[P(H_{CS}) = 0.15\]

#### \(P(E|H)\)
Given Adam's characteristics:
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts: fits well.
- Enjoys solving puzzles: highly relevant.
- Quiet, warm-hearted, loves nature and animals: not directly relevant but not contradictory.

\[P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.60\]

#### \(P(E|\neg H)\)
This would be influenced by Adam being in fields other than Computer Science. Given that we are considering many possible fields:

\[P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.40\]

### For Business Administration

#### \(P(H)\)
Let's assume a slightly smaller prior for Business Administration as it generally attracts people with a more extroverted and business-oriented personality:

\[P(H_{BA}) = 0.10\]

#### \(P(E|H)\)
Given Adam's characteristics:
- High intelligence: still relevant.
- Enjoys solving puzzles and abstract thinking: less relevant.
- Quiet, warm-hearted, loves nature and animals: relatively less relevant.

\[P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.30\]

#### \(P(E|\neg H)\)
Similarly to Computer Science, considering the average characteristics:

\[P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.50\]

### Combining These for \(P(H|E)\)

#### For Computer Science

\[P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)}\]

Where,

\[P(E) = P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \cdot P(\neg H_{CS})\]

Substituting the values:

\[P(E) = 0.60 \cdot 0.15 + 0.40 \cdot 0.85 = 0.09 + 0.34 = 0.43\]

Thus,

\[P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.60 \cdot 0.15}{0.43} = \frac{0.09}{0.43} \approx 0.21\]

#### For Business Administration

\[P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)}\]

Where,

\[P(E) = P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \cdot P(\neg H_{BA})\]

Substituting the values:

\[P(E) = 0.30 \cdot 0.10 + 0.50 \cdot 0.90 = 0.03 + 0.45 = 0.48\]

Thus,

\[P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.30 \cdot 0.10}{0.48} = \frac{0.03}{0.48} \approx 0.0625\]

Now, here is the requested format:

  "computer science": 0.21,
