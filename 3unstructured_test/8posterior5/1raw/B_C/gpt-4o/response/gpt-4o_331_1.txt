To determine the probability of Adam being enrolled in either "computer science" (H\_CS) or "business administration" (H\_BA), given his personality sketch (E), we need to apply Bayes' rule. Here's a step-by-step approach:

### Bayes' Rule
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, \(P(E)\) can be considered constant when comparing the relative probabilities of different fields, allowing us to use the proportional form:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

### Estimations
Let's make some reasoned estimations based on Adam's personality and general knowledge about graduate fields:

#### Computer Science
- **P(H\_CS)** (Prior probability): Let's assume the usual enrollment rate for computer science is moderate, say 0.20.
- **P(E|H\_CS)** (Likelihood of personality given computer science): Adam's intelligence and puzzle-solving skills are highly consistent with computer science, but his strong empathy and love for nature and animals are less characteristic. So we might estimate this as 0.30.
- **P(E|\neg H\_CS)** (Likelihood of personality given not computer science): Given the variety of graduate fields, we could consider this to be 0.15.

#### Business Administration
- **P(H\_BA)** (Prior probability): Letâ€™s assume the enrollment rate for business administration is also moderate, around 0.20.
- **P(E|H\_BA)** (Likelihood of personality given business administration): Adam's empathy and appreciation for hard work could fit, but his curiosity about nature and puzzle-solving might be less relevant. So let's estimate it as 0.15.
- **P(E|\neg H\_BA)** (Likelihood of personality given not business administration): Similar to computer science, this is also 0.15.

### Applying Bayes' Rule
We can use these estimations to compute the relative probabilities:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Calculating proportional values:
1. **Computer Science**
\[ P(H\_CS|E) \propto P(E|H\_CS) \cdot P(H\_CS) = 0.30 \cdot 0.20 = 0.06 \]

2. **Business Administration**
\[ P(H\_BA|E) \propto P(E|H\_BA) \cdot P(H\_BA) = 0.15 \cdot 0.20 = 0.03 \]

### Final Probabilities
Now let's normalize these values to create relative probabilities:

\[ \text{Sum} = 0.06 + 0.03 = 0.09 \]

\[ P(H\_CS|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.09} \approx 0.67 \]

\[ P(H\_BA|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.09} \approx 0.33 \]

### Conclusion
Based on the provided analysis and estimations:

{
  "computer science": 0.67,
  "business administration": 0.33
