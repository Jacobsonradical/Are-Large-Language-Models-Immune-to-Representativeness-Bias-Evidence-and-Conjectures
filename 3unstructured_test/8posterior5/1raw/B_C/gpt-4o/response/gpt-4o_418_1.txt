To compute \( P(H|E) \) through Bayes' rule for the given fields, we need to hypothesize the probabilities and conditional probabilities based on the personality sketch E.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in the field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch (which would be the normalization factor).

### Hypotheses and Assumptions:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) \) (prior): Computer science is a common field, so let's assume \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.3 \)
   - \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Given his intelligence, love for puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts, we can assume Adam fits well. Let's take \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.6 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \): Assuming there's a diverse range of other fields, and considering Adam's nature traits are not exclusively matched to CS. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.3 \).

2. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \) (prior): Business administration is also a common field but may not attract people with an explicit passion for nature and animals. Let's assume \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): Given his empathy and understanding of hard work and dedication, but not a direct match to love for nature. Let's assume \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \): Similar assumption as with computer science. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.35 \).

### Calculations:

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same in both denominators and for simplicity, we can express these as relative probabilities:

\[ \text{Relative probability for Computer Science} = 0.6 \cdot 0.3 = 0.18 \]
\[ \text{Relative probability for Business Administration} = 0.2 \cdot 0.2 = 0.04 \]

To normalize:
Let the total probability (for normalized calculation) be:
\[ \text{Sum of relative probabilities} = 0.18 + 0.04 = 0.22 \]

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.18}{0.22} \approx 0.82 \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.22} \approx 0.18 \]

Given these calculations:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.82,
  "business administration": 0.18
}
```

These values provide a relative sense of likelihood based on the given personality sketch and priors assumed.
