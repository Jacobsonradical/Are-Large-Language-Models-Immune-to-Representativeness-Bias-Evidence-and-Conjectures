To solve this problem using Bayes' rule, we need to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study. We can use the formula for Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For each specialization, we need to estimate:
1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the evidence given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the evidence given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.

Because there are other potential fields not listed, we can't calculate \( P(E) \) exactly, but for a comparative analysis, we can focus on \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

### Assumptions:
1. **Priors (\(P(H)\)):**

- **Business Administration:** Let’s assume roughly 15% of graduate students are enrolled in business administration.
- **Computer Science:** Let’s assume roughly 20% of graduate students are enrolled in computer science. 

2. **Likelihoods (\(P(E|H)\)):**

- **Business Administration:** The attributes described for Adam (interest in nature, animals, puzzles, high intelligence) do not strongly align with the typical interests and skills of business administration students. We might estimate \( P(E|H) \) as 0.1 for business administration.
- **Computer Science:** Adam's skills in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts fit well with computer science students. We estimate \( P(E|H) \) as 0.7 for computer science.

3. **Likelihoods (\(P(E|\neg H)\)):**

- **Business Administration:** Considering all other possible fields, \( P(E|\neg H) \) may be lower. Let’s estimate it as 0.2 for non-business administration fields (since many other fields like humanities may not match his description well).
- **Computer Science:** For fields other than computer science, \( P(E|\neg H) \) would be lower. Let’s estimate it as 0.3 for non-computer science fields.

### Calculating Posterior Probabilities:

We don't need to compute \( P(E) \) explicitly if we are comparing two fields as the denominator will cancel out. Using the proportionality:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

For each field, we calculate:

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{field}} \propto P(E|H)_{\text{field}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{field}} \]

#### Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{business}} \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.15 = 0.015 \]

#### Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{cs}} \propto 0.7 \cdot 0.20 = 0.14 \]

Summarizing:

{
  "business administration": 0.015,
  "computer science": 0.14
