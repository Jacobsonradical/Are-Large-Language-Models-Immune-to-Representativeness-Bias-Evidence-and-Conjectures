To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to follow these steps:

1. Assign prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each hypothesis.
2. Determine likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) for each field given the personality sketch E.
3. Compute the terms for Bayes' rule.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is constant across our hypotheses, it simplifies comparisons.

Here's an estimate of the necessary probabilities for each field:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - Prior probability \( P(H) \): Let's assume about 15% of graduate students in the U.S. are in Computer Science, so \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.15 \).
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): Given Adam's interests in puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts, Computer Science is a reasonable fit. So, suppose \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.7 \).
   - Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \): If not CS, assume the generic fit of this personality to other fields is lower, say \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.2 \).

2. **Business Administration:**
   - Prior probability \( P(H) \): Assume roughly 10% of graduate students are in Business Administration, so \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.10 \).
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): Business Administration is less of a fit given Adam's traits (empathy works, but love for animals/nature and puzzles don't fit as well). Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.3 \).
   - Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \): Assume again \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.2 \).

Now applying Bayes' rule to make the calculations more straightforward:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

We don't need to explicitly calculate \( P(E) \) since we're only comparing between fields. So let's just use the product approach:

1. **Computer Science:**
   \[
   P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto 0.7 \cdot 0.15 = 0.105
   \]

2. **Business Administration:**
   \[
   P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \propto 0.3 \cdot 0.10 = 0.03
   \]

Normalizing these to make them sum up to 1 for the sake of comparison:

Total = \(0.105 + 0.03 = 0.135\)

\[
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.105}{0.135} \approx 0.78
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.135} \approx 0.22
\]

Therefore, the estimated values are:

{
  "computer science": "0.78",
  "business administration": "0.22"
}
