To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in business administration or computer science, given his personality sketch \( E \), we'll follow the Bayesian framework. Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The initial probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field before considering the personality sketch. 

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in a particular field.

3. **Marginal Likelihood (Normalizer) \( P(E) \)**: The overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch, obtained from both hypotheses and their negations.

4. **Calculation of Posterior Probability \( P(H|E) \)**: The final posterior probability using Bayes’ rule: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have exact numerical values, we make reasonable assumptions based on typical fields' characteristics and Adam's personality sketch.

### Business Administration

- **P(H\_{business})**: Let's assume the prior probability Adam might be enrolled in business administration is relatively common but not the highest. We assign a moderate value, say \(0.2\).
  
- **P(E|H\_{business})**: Considering Adam's love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles, business administration might be a less likely fit unless interpreted broadly (e.g., sustainability). Assign a lower likelihood, say \(0.1\).
  
- **P(E|\neg H\_{business})**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality in fields other than business administration. Since there are many other fields, let's assume a moderate value, say \(0.25\).

\[
P(H_{business}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{business}) \cdot P(H_{business})}{P(E)}
\]

### Computer Science

- **P(H\_{cs})**: The prior probability for Adam might be enrolled in computer science could be considered moderate given its popularity. Assigning a moderate value, say 0.3.
  
- **P(E|H\_{cs})**: Adam’s traits like being intelligent, understanding abstract concepts, enjoying solving puzzles fit well with computer science. Assign a higher likelihood, say 0.5.
  
- **P(E|\neg H\_{cs})**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch in fields other than computer science. Assign a value based on the reasoning, say \(0.2\).

\[
P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs})}{P(E)}
\]

For practical purposes, assume \( P(E) \) is relatively consistent and balanced, taking into account contributions from all terms.

Summarizing:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.08,
  "computer science": 0.45
}
```

#### Approximations:
1) **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H_{business}|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.25} \approx 0.08 \]
  
2) **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) \approx \frac{0.5 \times 0.3}{0.2} \approx 0.45 \]

Thus, according to our Bayesian analysis, Adam is more likely to be enrolled in computer science than in business administration, given his personality sketch.
