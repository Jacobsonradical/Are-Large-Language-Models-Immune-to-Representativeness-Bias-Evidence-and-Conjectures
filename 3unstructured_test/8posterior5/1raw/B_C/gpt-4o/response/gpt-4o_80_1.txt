To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study (computer science and business administration), we need to evaluate the following probabilities for each field:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam’s personality sketch being true given that he was enrolled in the specific field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam’s personality sketch being true given that he was not enrolled in the specific field (collectively for all other fields).

We then apply Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) = \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \), where \( \neg H \) denotes the complement of \( H \) (i.e. not being enrolled in that specific field).

Given the personality sketch, let's make some reasonable estimates:

- **Computer Science**:
  - \( P(H) \): The prior for Adam being in this field, let's assume 0.15, as Computer Science is a common field for high intelligence, puzzle-solving individuals.
  - \( P(E|H) \): Adam’s personality is somewhat consistent with Computer Science if we consider abstract thinking and intelligence. So we might estimate this at 0.7.
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \): This is less specific, but given other fields, we'll estimate it broadly at around 0.4.

\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.15}{(0.7 \cdot 0.15 + 0.4 \cdot 0.85)} \]

- **Business Administration**:
  - \( P(H) \): The prior for Adam being in this field, let's assume 0.10, as it is less consistent with his personality traits compared to other fields.
  - \( P(E|H) \): Adam’s personality seems less aligned with Business Administration (especially given his fondness for nature and animals), so we might estimate this at 0.2.
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Again, we will keep the same broad estimate at around 0.4.

\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.10}{(0.2 \cdot 0.10 + 0.4 \cdot 0.90)} \]

Now let's compute the actual values:

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.15}{(0.7 \cdot 0.15 + 0.4 \cdot 0.85)} \approx \frac{0.105}{(0.105 + 0.34)} \approx \frac{0.105}{0.445} \approx 0.236 \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.10}{(0.2 \cdot 0.10 + 0.4 \cdot 0.90)} \approx \frac{0.02}{(0.02 + 0.36)} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.38} \approx 0.053 \]

Summarizing the results:
