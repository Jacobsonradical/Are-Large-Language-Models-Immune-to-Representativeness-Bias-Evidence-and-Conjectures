Let's first analyze and articulate our values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field of specialization. Given the information about Adam, we will make reasonable assumptions for these probabilities.

### Business Administration:
- \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): The prior probability of Adam being in Business Administration. Given that we have no specific distribution, we might assume it's a relatively less likely field for someone with Adam's characteristics. Let's assign \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.2 \).

- \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): The likelihood of Adam having his personality traits if he is in Business Administration. Given his love for plants, animals, and nature, business administration seems less aligned. Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.2 \).

- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \): The probability of Adam's personality given that he is not in Business Administration, considering the broad spectrum of other fields. Let's estimate this as \( 0.8 \).

### Computer Science:
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): The prior probability of Adam being in Computer Science. Given Adam's high intelligence and interest in solving puzzles, this seems more plausible. Let us assign \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.3 \).

- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality traits given his enrollment in Computer Science. His curiosity and intelligence align well here; assign \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.5 \).

- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \): The probability of Adam having these personality traits given he's not in Computer Science. Let's estimate this as \( 0.7 \).

Now, utilizing Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

### Business Administration:
\[ P(E_{\text{BA}}) = (0.2 \times 0.2) + (0.8 \times 0.8) = 0.04 + 0.64 = 0.68 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.2}{0.68} \approx \frac{0.04}{0.68} \approx 0.059 \]

### Computer Science:
\[ P(E_{\text{CS}}) = (0.5 \times 0.3) + (0.7 \times 0.7) = 0.15 + 0.49 = 0.64 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.5}{0.64} \approx \frac{0.15}{0.64} \approx 0.234 \]

Therefore, the given probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.059,
  "computer science": 0.234
}
```

These calculations suggest that, based on his personality and interests, Adam is more likely to have been enrolled in Computer Science than in Business Administration.
