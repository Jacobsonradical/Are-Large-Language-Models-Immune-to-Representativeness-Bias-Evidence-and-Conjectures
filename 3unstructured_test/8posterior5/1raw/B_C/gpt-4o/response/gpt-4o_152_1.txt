To calculate the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field of study given his personality sketch (E), we'll use Bayes' rule. Here's the structured process for each field:

1. **Business Administration (H1)**
    - **P(H1)**: The prior probability that any given graduate student is in business administration.
    - **P(E|H1)**: The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch if he is in business administration.
    - **P(E|\neg H1)**: The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch if he is not in business administration.
   
2. **Computer Science (H2)**
    - **P(H2)**: The prior probability that any given graduate student is in computer science.
    - **P(E|H2)**: The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch if he is in computer science.
    - **P(E|\neg H2)**: The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch if he is not in computer science.

### Assumptions:
For simplicity, suppose:
- \( P(H1) = 0.1 \) (10% of graduate students are in business administration)
- \( P(H2) = 0.15 \) (15% of graduate students are in computer science)
- \( P(E|\neg H1) = 0.05 \) (5% probability of his personality sketch under any other field but business administration)
- \( P(E|\neg H2) = 0.05 \) (5% probability of his personality sketch under any other field but computer science)

Based on Adam’s personality sketch, he seems more aligned with fields that require high intelligence, abstract thinking, and appreciation for nature and animals. Business administration may not perfectly align with these traits.

Let’s determine:

### Calculations:

1. **Business Administration (H1)**
    - \( P(E|H1) \approx 0.01 \) (low, as the sketch doesn’t strongly match typical business administration traits)
    - Using Bayes' Rule: \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \)

    For P(H1|E):
    \[
    P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1) * P(H1)}{P(E)}
    \]
    Suppose \( P(E) = 0.02 \) for simplicity based on given information,
    \[
    P(H1|E) = \frac{0.01 * 0.1}{0.02} = 0.05
    \]

2. **Computer Science (H2)**
    - \( P(E|H2) \approx 0.2 \) (relatively higher because high intelligence and problem-solving strongly align with computer science)
    - Using Bayes' Rule: \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \)
    
    For P(H2|E):
    \[
    P(H2|E) = \frac{P(E|H2) * P(H2)}{P(E)}
    \]
    Suppose \( P(E) = 0.1 \) due to complexity of his profile match better fitting CS,
    \[
    P(H2|E) = \frac{0.2 * 0.15}{0.1} = 0.3
    \]

So, the resulting probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

This output suggests Adam is more likely to have been enrolled in computer science than business administration given his personality sketch.
