Using Bayes' Theorem, we need to find \( P(H|E) \), the probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field of study given his personality sketch \( E \). Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assuming we have no prior knowledge leading us to prefer one field over another \( P(H) \) or \(P(\neg H) \), we will assign them a default uniform probability. Let's consider the following values:

- \( P(H) \): Prior probability of Adam being in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Probability of observing his personality sketch given he is in a specific field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of observing his personality sketch given he is not in that specific field.

For simplicity, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.01 \) (considering there are roughly 100 different graduate fields of specialization; this is a rough estimate).

Now, let's make educated guesses for \( P(E|H) \) based on the available information in the personality sketch:

### Computer Science
1. Possibility of Adam being curious about nature and plants: Medium
2. Enjoying solving puzzles: High
3. Warm heart, strong empathy and love for animals: Medium
4. High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: High
5. Appreciation for hard work and dedication: Medium to High

Given this, \( P(E|H) \) for Computer Science might be quite high, say around \( 0.7 \).

### Business Administration
1. Possibility of Adam being curious about nature and plants: Low
2. Enjoying solving puzzles: Medium
3. Warm heart, strong empathy and love for animals: Low to Medium
4. High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: Medium
5. Appreciation for hard work and dedication: High

Given this, \( P(E|H) \) for Business Administration might be moderate, say around \( 0.3 \).

To simplify calculations, let's assume \( P(E) \) is constant for both fields and does not need explicit calculation since we are comparing probabilities.

### Applying Bayes' Theorem

#### Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} \approx \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.01}{P(E)} \]

#### Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} \approx \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.01}{P(E)} \]

Here \( P(E) \) is a common factor, so we can focus on the numerator for comparison:

\[ P(H|E)_{CS} \approx 0.007 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} \approx 0.003 \]

Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in each field given his personality sketch can be relatively stated as:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
