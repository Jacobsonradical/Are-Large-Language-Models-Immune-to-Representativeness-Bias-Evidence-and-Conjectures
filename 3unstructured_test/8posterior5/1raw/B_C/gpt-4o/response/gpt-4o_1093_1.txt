To apply Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \) for each of the fields, we need to estimate the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in a given field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in that field.

While I don't have exact statistical data, I can provide reasonable estimates based on Adam's personality and the nature of the fields. For simplicity, let's assume each field has an equal prior probability of enrollment among all possible fields. 

Let's denote:
- \( H_{CS} \): Adam is enrolled in Computer Science.
- \( H_{BA} \): Adam is enrolled in Business Administration.

Now let's estimate each part:

**Computer Science:**

1. \( P(H_{CS}) \): This is a general prior probability, say 0.1 (10%).
2. \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Given that Adam enjoys solving puzzles, has high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts, these traits are common among computer science students. Let's estimate this as 0.7 (70%).
3. \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \): Since there are many fields, and Adam's traits could apply to several others but not as strongly as in CS, let’s say 0.2 (20%).

Applying Bayes' Rule:
\[ 
P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \times P(H_{CS})}{P(E|H_{CS}) \times P(H_{CS}) + P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \times P(\neg H_{CS})} 
\]

\[
P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.1}{0.7 \times 0.1 + 0.2 \times 0.9} = \frac{0.07}{0.07 + 0.18} = \frac{0.07}{0.25} = 0.28
\]

**Business Administration:**

1. \( P(H_{BA}) \): Assume another general prior of 0.1 (10%).
2. \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): Traits such as a warm heart, empathy, dedication, and perhaps appreciation for hard work can be valuable in business, but they are not as directly aligned as in computer science. Let's estimate 0.4 (40%).
3. \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \): Similar reasoning as before, let’s say 0.2 (20%).

Applying Bayes' Rule:
\[
P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \times P(H_{BA})}{P(E|H_{BA}) \times P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \times P(\neg H_{BA})}
\]

\[
P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.1}{0.4 \times 0.1 + 0.2 \times 0.9} = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.18} = \frac{0.04}{0.22} \approx 0.18
\]

So, the final probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": "0.28",
  "business administration": "0.18"
}
