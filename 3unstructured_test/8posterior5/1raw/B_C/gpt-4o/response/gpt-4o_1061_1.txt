To evaluate \( P(H|E) \) for both "business administration" and "computer science," we need to use Bayes' Rule, which is formulated as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the evidence given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of the evidence given that Adam is not enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence (which can be computed using the law of total probability).

Given the personality sketch of Adam:
- High intelligence
- Curiosity about nature and plants
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- Strong empathy and love for animals
- Appreciation for hard work
- Was a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021

Let's break this down individually:

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of a graduate student studying Business Administration is moderate to high because it's a common field. Let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam would have the listed personality traits if he were studying Business Administration is relatively low. Fields like Business Administration might not necessarily attract individuals with a strong curiosity about nature, a deep love for animals, and a preference for solving abstract puzzles. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood that someone who is NOT in Business Administration still has this personality profile may be higher, as these traits could belong to students in fields like biology, environmental science, psychology, etc. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \).

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) \approx (0.1 \cdot 0.3) + (0.2 \cdot 0.7) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.03 + 0.14 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.17 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.3}{0.17} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.03}{0.17} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.176 \]

### Computer Science

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of a graduate student studying Computer Science is relatively high, as it's a popular and widespread field. Letâ€™s assume \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam would have the listed personality traits if he were studying Computer Science is relatively higher than Business Administration but still not extremely high (fields like Cognitive Science, AI might align). Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.25 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood that someone who is NOT in Computer Science has this personality profile is non-negligible, as these traits can align with other scientific fields. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \).

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) \approx (0.25 \cdot 0.3) + (0.2 \cdot 0.7) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.075 + 0.14 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.215 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.25 \cdot 0.3}{0.215} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.075}{0.215} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.349 \]

Based on these calculations, the Bayesian posterior probabilities for the hypotheses "business administration" and "computer science" are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.176,
  "computer science": 0.349
}
