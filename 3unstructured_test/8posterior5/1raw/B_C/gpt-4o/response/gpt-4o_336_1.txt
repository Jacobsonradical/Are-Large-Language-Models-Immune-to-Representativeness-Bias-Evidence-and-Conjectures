To answer the question appropriately, we'll follow the Bayesian analysis approach. In a nutshell, we need to estimate the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for both fields and apply Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \).

Recall that Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, we will assume that the prior probabilities and likelihoods are within a normal range as per our assumptions from generalized data and interests that align with Adam's personality.

### Computer Science

- **\( P(H_{CS}) \) (Prior Probability in Computer Science)**: 
  Graduate students frequently enroll in computer science, so let's assume this probability as 0.2.

- **\( P(E|H_{CS}) \) (Likelihood of Adam's traits given Computer Science)**: 
  Computer Science students can have a genuine curiosity about nature, high intelligence, enjoy solving puzzles, etc., but not all of these traits align directly with the stereotypical profile. We'll set this likelihood as 0.3.

- **\( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \) (Likelihood of Adam's traits given he's not in Computer Science)**: 
  Considering other fields, these traits might be distributed among various disciplines. Let's set this as 0.1.

Without the actual value of \( P(E) \), we can just use proportional reasoning based on the given ratios since \( P(E) \) acts as a normalizing constant.

### Business Administration

- **\( P(H_{BA}) \) (Prior Probability in Business Administration)**: 
  Let's assume a modest prior because fewer graduate students typically choose Business Administration out of general interest. We'll set this as 0.1.

- **\( P(E|H_{BA}) \) (Likelihood of Adam's traits given Business Administration)**: 
  Business Administration is less likely to align with traits such as strong curiosity about nature and deep love for animals. This likelihood could be set at a low value, say 0.05.

- **\( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \) (Likelihood of Adam's traits given he's not in Business Administration)**: 
  Since other fields might better explain Adam's personality traits, we'll set this as higher, say 0.2.

With these assumptions, let's calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \).

\[
P(H_{CS}|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \cdot P(\neg H_{CS})}
\]
 
\[
P(H_{CS}|E) \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.1 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.08} \approx \frac{0.06}{0.14} \approx 0.4286
\]

\[
P(H_{BA}|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \cdot P(\neg H_{BA})}
\]

\[
P(H_{BA}|E) \approx \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{0.05 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.18} \approx \frac{0.005}{0.185} \approx 0.027
\]

Thus, the final answers using Bayes Rule calculations are:

{
  "computer science": 0.4286,
  "business administration": 0.027
}
