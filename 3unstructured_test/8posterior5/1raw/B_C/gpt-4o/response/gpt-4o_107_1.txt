To solve this question, we'll initially judge the prior probabilities, conditional probabilities, and then apply Bayes' Rule to update our beliefs in light of Adam's personality sketch.

Let's start with the prior probabilities, which represent a rough estimate of how likely Adam is to be enrolled in a certain field:

- P(H for business administration) = P(business administration) ≈ 0.1 (since it's less likely for someone with Adam's described traits to be in a business-related program based on his personality sketch)
- P(H for computer science) = P(computer science) ≈ 0.2 (since computer science aligns more closely with Adam's intelligence and abstract thinking skills)

Now, let's assess the conditional probabilities given Adam's personality sketch \( E \):

- P(E|H for business administration): This is the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is in a business administration program. Adam's traits like high intelligence, empathy, and puzzle-solving don't strongly align with business administration. Therefore, P(E|business administration) might be relatively low. Let's say ≈ 0.2.

- P(E|H for computer science): This is the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is in a computer science program. His traits align better with this field, particularly his intelligence and abstract thinking skills. Let's say ≈ 0.6.

Now, let's consider P(E|¬H), the probability of the evidence (Adam's personality) given that he is not in these fields. Since there are many fields Adam could be in:

- P(E|¬H for business administration) ≈ 0.8 (since maybe his personality aligns better with fields other than business administration)
- P(E|¬H for computer science) ≈ 0.4 (since his personality may align somewhat closely with fields other than computer science, but not as often)

Now, we use Bayes' Rule to compute the posterior probability P(H|E):

Bayes' Rule: \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) * P(H)}{P(E)} \)
Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|¬H) * P(¬H) \)

Let’s compute for each:

1. For business administration:
\[ P(E) = 0.2 * 0.1 + 0.8 * 0.9 = 0.02 + 0.72 = 0.74 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 * 0.1}{0.74} ≈ \frac{0.02}{0.74} ≈ 0.027 \]

2. For computer science:
\[ P(E) = 0.6 * 0.2 + 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.12 + 0.32 = 0.44 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 * 0.2}{0.44} ≈ \frac{0.12}{0.44} ≈ 0.273 \]

Thus, the updated probabilities given Adam's personality sketch are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.027,
  "computer science": 0.273
}
```
