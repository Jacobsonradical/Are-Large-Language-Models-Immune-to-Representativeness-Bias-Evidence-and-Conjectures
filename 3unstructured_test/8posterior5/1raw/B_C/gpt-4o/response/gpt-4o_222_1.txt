To correctly compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we first need to consider the following components:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field without any additional information.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality traits described in \( E \) if Adam is indeed enrolled in the given field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality traits described in \( E \) if Adam is not enrolled in the given field.

These values can be subjective without concrete statistical data, but we will make educated guesses based on the given information:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
   - Since there are numerous fields of study and assuming no bias, let's assume equal prior probabilities for every field initially. For simplicity, if these were the only two fields, we could set each prior \( P(H) \) to 0.5. However, acknowledging that there are many more fields, let's adjust it down, say \( P(H) = 0.1 \) for each.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H):**
   - **Business Administration:** It is less likely for business administration students to have a strong curiosity about nature and a deep love for animals. Students might be more interested in economics, management, and human interactions. Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{BA}) \) at 0.1.
   - **Computer Science:** Computer science encompasses a wide range of interests. Adam's traits of enjoying solving puzzles and having high intelligence are highly compatible with computer science. Students of computer science might also appreciate alternative hobbies related to nature as part of their personality. Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) at 0.6.

3. **Negative Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H):**
   - This measures the personality sketch occurring outside the specific field. For both,
     let's set this value to 0.2 as a rough estimate, representing that other fields like natural sciences or humanities, might align better with the given traits.

Now, applying Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \).

### Calculation:
#### Business Administration:
1. \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.1 \)
2. \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.1 \)
3. \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.2 \)
4. \( P(\neg H_{BA}) = 0.9 \)
5. Normalization factor \( P(E) = (0.1 * 0.1) + (0.2 * 0.9) = 0.01 + 0.18 = 0.19 \)
6. \( P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1 * 0.1}{0.19} \approx 0.0526 \)

#### Computer Science:
1. \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.1 \)
2. \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.6 \)
3. \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.2 \)
4. \( P(\neg H_{CS}) = 0.9 \)
5. Normalization factor \( P(E) = (0.6 * 0.1) + (0.2 * 0.9) = 0.06 + 0.18 = 0.24 \)
6. \( P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.6 * 0.1}{0.24} \approx 0.25 \)

Given these calculations, the posterior probabilities for each field are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0526,
  "computer science": 0.25
}
