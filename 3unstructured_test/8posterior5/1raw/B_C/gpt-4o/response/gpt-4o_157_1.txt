To determine the probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for both fields, computer science and business administration, we need to use Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

Here, \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of the hypothesis being true, \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis, and \(P(E)\) is the total probability of the evidence.

Since \(P(E)\) is the same for both hypotheses, we can focus on the numerator \(P(E|H) \cdot P(H)\) and compare the relative values.

Let's make some judgments about these probabilities:

**For Computer Science:**

- **\(P(H)\)**: In the U.S., computer science is a common field for graduate students, so let’s assume \(P(H) = 0.30\).
- **\(P(E|H)\)**: Adam's interest in solving puzzles, high intelligence, and comfort with abstract concepts fit well with computer science, so let’s assume \(P(E|H) = 0.60\).
- **\(P(E|\neg H)\)**: Adam’s interests might still somewhat align with fields other than computer science, given his personality traits, but less specifically, so let’s assume \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.20\).

**For Business Administration:**

- **\(P(H)\)**: Business administration is also a common field, so let's assume \(P(H) = 0.25\).
- **\(P(E|H)\)**: Adam's personality traits are less directly aligned with business administration, though empathy and appreciation for hard work might fit. Let’s assume \(P(E|H) = 0.30\).
- **\(P(E|\neg H)\)**: Similar to computer science, Adam's traits can still somewhat align with other fields, so let's also assume \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.20\).

Using these assumptions:

**For Computer Science:**

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.60 \cdot 0.30}{P(E)}\]

**For Business Administration:**

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.30 \cdot 0.25}{P(E)}\]

Since \(P(E)\) is the same for both conditions, we can compare:

\[P(H|E) \text{ for Computer Science} = 0.60 \times 0.30 = 0.18\]
\[P(H|E) \text{ for Business Administration} = 0.30 \times 0.25 = 0.075\]

Therefore, the normalized values (without actual \(P(E)\) but relative to each other):

{
  "computer science": 0.18,
  "business administration": 0.075
}
