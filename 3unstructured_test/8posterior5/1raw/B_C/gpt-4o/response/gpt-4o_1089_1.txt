To assess the probabilities, let's use the values of \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field, and then apply Bayes' rule:

The formula for Bayes' rule is:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we aren't given the exact priors and likelihoods, we'll need to make some reasonable assumptions based on the provided personality sketch.

Let's start with "computer science":

1. \( P(H \text{ for computer science}) \): This is the prior probability that Adam might be enrolled in computer science. Without specific data, let's assume a general prior probability for computer science among graduate fields, say \( 0.2 \) (20%).
2. \( P(E|H \text{ for computer science}) \): This is the likelihood that Adam's personality sketch fits someone in computer science. Given his high intelligence, curiosity, and puzzle-solving skills, it’s reasonable to think those in computer science could have similar traits. Let's assume \( 0.6 \) (60%).
3. \( P(E|\neg H \text{ for computer science}) \): This is the probability that someone not in computer science has Adam's personality traits. Considering the wide variety of other fields, let's assume this probability to be \( 0.2 \) (20%).

Now apply Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H \text{ for computer science}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{(\text{combined probability of E})} \]
Since we're only comparing two fields and not normalizing for total probability, we can consider the relative comparison directly:
\[ \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{0.6 \cdot 0.2 + 0.2 \cdot 0.8} \approx 0.43 \]

Now for "business administration":

1. \( P(H \text{ for business administration}) \): Assuming a similar general prior probability for business administration among graduate fields, say \( 0.2 \) (20%).
2. \( P(E|H \text{ for business administration}) \): Given his warm heart and empathy, those traits can be found in business administration students but perhaps not as dominantly as in computer science. Let’s assume \( 0.3 \) (30%).
3. \( P(E|\neg H \text{ for business administration}) \): Similarly, might assume this probability to be \( 0.2 \) (20%).

Now apply Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H \text{ for business administration}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{(\text{combined probability of E})} \]
Again, for relative comparison:
\[ \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.7 \cdot 0.8} \approx 0.12 \]

Thus, after evaluating the hypotheses:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.43,
  "business administration": 0.12
}
```

Keep in mind these numerical values are based on reasonable assumptions and not exact data points. The actual values could vary with more precise information.
