To estimate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Theorem, we need to know a few probabilities:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability that Adam has personality traits \( E \) given he is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability that Adam has personality traits \( E \) given he is not enrolled in that field.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing evidence \( E \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

Now, let’s analyze both fields:

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
   - The probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in business administration. Let's assume a uniform distribution over various fields, and since there are many fields, \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   - How likely is it that a business administration student has the traits described? Business administration students might not typically have a strong appreciation for personal traits related to nature, empathy, and animals. \( P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \).

3. **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   - How likely is it that a non-business administration student has these traits? Given the breadth of other fields (e.g., biology, environmental science), they might more commonly attract such individuals. \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \).

### Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
   - The probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in computer science. Given its popularity, let's estimate \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   - How likely is it that a computer science student has the traits described? Computer science students often have high intelligence and enjoy solving puzzles, which fits Adam’s description well. \( P(E|H) \approx 0.7 \).

3. **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   - How likely is it that a non-computer science student has these traits? Considering other fields, the combination of traits is somewhat common but not as much as within computer science. \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \).

### Calculations:

Now, using Bayes' Theorem:

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
\[ = (0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.5 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ = 0.02 + 0.45 \]
\[ = 0.47 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.47} \approx 0.0426 \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
\[ = (0.7 \cdot 0.2) + (0.4 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ = 0.14 + 0.32 \]
\[ = 0.46 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.46} \approx 0.3043 \]

### Final Answer:
