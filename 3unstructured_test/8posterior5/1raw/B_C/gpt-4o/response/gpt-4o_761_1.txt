To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch \( E \), we use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For both hypotheses \( H \), we need to estimate:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that his personality sketch matches what one might expect from a student in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that his personality sketch matches what one might expect from a student not in that field.

Given Adam's traits, let’s make the following assumptions:

### Computer Science
- \( P(H) \): We will assume that a moderate number of students choose computer science, so let’s estimate \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Computer science students are typically curious, intelligent, and enjoy solving puzzles, fitting many aspects of Adam’s personality. Let’s estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.6 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given Adam’s personality traits, they might also fit students in other fields of study (such as biology or environmental science). We’ll say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): We will assume that a moderate number of students also choose business administration, so let’s estimate \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Adam’s personality traits don’t strongly align with typical business administration profiles (which often emphasize leadership and management skills more). Let’s estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given the diverse range of non-business fields, we’ll say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

Now, we need to calculate using Bayes' Rule.

### For Computer Science:

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} 
\]

Since \( P(E) \) can be calculated as:

\[ 
P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) 
\]
\[ 
P(E) = (0.6 \times 0.15) + (0.3 \times 0.85) 
\]
\[ 
P(E) = 0.09 + 0.255 
\]
\[ 
P(E) = 0.345 
\]

Therefore:

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.15}{0.345} 
\]
\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.345} 
\]
\[ 
P(H|E) \approx 0.26 
\]

### For Business Administration:

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} 
\]

Since \( P(E) \) can be calculated as:

\[ 
P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) 
\]
\[ 
P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.15) + (0.4 \times 0.85) 
\]
\[ 
P(E) = 0.015 + 0.34 
\]
\[ 
P(E) = 0.355 
\]

Therefore:

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.15}{0.355} 
\]
\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{0.015}{0.355} 
\]
\[ 
P(H|E) \approx 0.04 
\]

So, the final probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.26,
  "business administration": 0.04
}
```
