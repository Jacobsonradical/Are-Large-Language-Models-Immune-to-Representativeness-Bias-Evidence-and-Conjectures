Sure, let's go through the process step-by-step for both fields: business administration and computer science.

### 1. Business Administration

#### Prior Probability (P(H))
- P(H) for business administration: This is the proportion of graduate students who enroll in business administration. Let's assume it is 0.10.

#### Likelihood (P(E|H))
- P(E|H) for business administration: Given Adam's personality sketch, it includes traits like curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work. These traits don't strongly indicate business administration. Therefore, let's assume P(E|H) for business administration is low, like 0.05.

#### Likelihood (P(E|¬H))
- P(E|¬H) for business administration: This indicates the probability that people with such a personality sketch are not in business administration. Given that these traits seem unrelated to business administration, P(E|¬H) might be relatively high. Let's assume it is 0.70.

#### Bayes Rule Calculation
Using Bayes rule: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E| \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Where \( P(\neg H) \) is the probability that Adam is in any other field, which is \(1 - P(H) \).

Substituting the values:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.10}{0.05 \cdot 0.10 + 0.70 \cdot 0.90} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.63} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.635} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0079 \]

### 2. Computer Science

#### Prior Probability (P(H))
- P(H) for computer science: This is the proportion of graduate students who enroll in computer science. Let's assume it is 0.15.

#### Likelihood (P(E|H))
- P(E|H) for computer science: Given Adam's personality sketch, traits like high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts indeed favor computer science. Therefore, let's assume P(E|H) for computer science is high, like 0.60.

#### Likelihood (P(E|¬H))
- P(E|¬H) for computer science: This indicates the probability that people with such a personality sketch are not in computer science. Given the specific traits, P(E|¬H) might still be high due to numerous other fields showing such personality traits. Let's assume this is around 0.50.

#### Bayes Rule Calculation
Using Bayes rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E| \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.60 \cdot 0.15}{0.60 \cdot 0.15 + 0.50 \cdot 0.85} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.425} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.515} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.1748 \]

Now, putting these results together in the requested format:
