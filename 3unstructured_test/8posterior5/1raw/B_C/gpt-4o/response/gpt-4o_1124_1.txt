To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the fields of computer science and business administration, we need to estimate:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.

Then, we apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be rewritten as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For simplicity, let's make some qualitative assessments for these fields:

### Computer Science

- **\( P(H) \)**: The likelihood of a graduate student being in computer science is relatively high due to the large number of students in this field. We'll assume \( P(H) \) is 0.2 for computer science.

- **\( P(E|H) \)**: Given that Adam has strong intelligence, problem-solving skills, and interest in abstract concepts, traits that are highly compatible with computer science, we can assign a high probability to \( P(E|H) \), approximately 0.6.

- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: We consider that Adam's traits are somewhat common among various fields, but not overly so for non-computer science fields. We might estimate this at 0.3.

### Business Administration

- **\( P(H) \)**: The likelihood of a graduate student being in business administration is also reasonable. We'll assume \( P(H) \) is 0.1.

- **\( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's personality sketch, which doesn't particularly emphasize traits like leadership or financial acumen typically highlighted in business administration, \( P(E|H) \) might be lower, around 0.2.

- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: As before, Adam's traits are quite general but more fitting for other fields than business administration. So, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) \) also at around 0.3.

Let's compute the probabilities:

### For Computer Science

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.6 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) = 0.12 + 0.24 = 0.36 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{0.36} \approx 0.333 \]

### For Business Administration

\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) = 0.02 + 0.27 = 0.29 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.29} \approx 0.069 \]

Therefore, the posterior probabilities that Adam was enrolled in these fields based on his personality sketch are:

\[ 
{
  "computer science": 0.333,
  "business administration": 0.069
}
\]

These values indicate that given Adam's personality traits, it is more likely that he was enrolled in computer science compared to business administration.
