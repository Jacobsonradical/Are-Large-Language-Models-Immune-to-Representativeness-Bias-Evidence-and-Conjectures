To estimate \( P(H|E) \), which is the probability that Adam was enrolled in each field given his personality sketch, we will use Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's break down the assumptions for each field:

### Computer Science
1. **P(H)**: The base rate probability of a graduate student being enrolled in computer science. This value might be around \(0.15\) since computer science is a common field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given the field. The interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts suggests a suitable fit. Hence, let's assume \(P(E|H) = 0.35\).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in computer science. Given his empathy and love for nature and animals, this could be common in fields like biology or environmental science. We can assume this probability to be lower, say \(0.20\).
4. **P(E)**: This is the overall probability of the personality sketch occurring in general, which is a normalization factor and can be approximated by summing over all related fields.

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)**: The base rate probability of a graduate student being enrolled in business administration. This field is also common, so let's arbitrarily set it to \(0.20\).
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given business administration. The traits mentioned do not strongly align with business administration. Let's assume \(P(E|H) = 0.10\).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in business administration. It would be similar to the overall prior, let's assume \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.25\).

Now, we can plug in the values into Bayes' rule.

### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{P(E|H)_{CS} \cdot P(H)_{CS}}{P(E)} = \frac{0.35 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{P(E|H)_{BA} \cdot P(H)_{BA}}{P(E)} = \frac{0.10 \cdot 0.20}{P(E)} \]

Let's assume \(P(E) \approx 0.30\) to simplify calculations.

### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.35 \cdot 0.15}{0.30} \approx 0.175 \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.10 \cdot 0.20}{0.30} \approx 0.067 \]

Combining the results we have:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.175,
  "business administration": 0.067
}
```

Note that the exact probabilities can vary with different assumptions about the base rates and probabilities, but the reasoning process remains consistent throughout.
