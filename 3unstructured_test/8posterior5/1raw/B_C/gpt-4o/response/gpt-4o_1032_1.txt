To answer this, I'll start by analyzing the provided information (E) and evaluating its compatibility with each graduate field (H). I'll then apply Bayes' Rule to estimate the probability of Adam being in that field given his personality sketch.

Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since P(E) is a normalization factor that ensures probabilities add up, we will focus on the relative probabilities.

Let's consider the fields:

### Computer Science
**Prior, \( P(H_{CS}) \):**
Assume the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Computer Science is 0.15, a conservative guess given many graduate students may be in diverse fields. 

**Likelihood, \( P(E|H_{CS}) \):**
Adam's characteristics align moderately well with Computer Science, especially his high intelligence and interest in problem-solving. However, his strong empathy and love for animals are less central to this field. Let’s assume \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.4 \).

**Complement, \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \):**
The probability that someone with Adam's profile exists outside of Computer Science may be higher because his set of traits can apply to various fields. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.6 \).

### Business Administration
**Prior, \( P(H_{BA}) \):**
Assume the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration is 0.10, as it is another common field but less likely for a person with his interests.

**Likelihood, \( P(E|H_{BA}) \):**
Adam's characteristics align poorly with Business Administration, which often values different traits such as leadership and strategic thinking over empathy and love for animals. Let’s assume \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.1 \).

**Complement, \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \):**
The probability that someone like Adam exists outside of Business Administration is high because of the misalignment. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.8 \).

### Applying Bayes' Rule
Let’s compute the probabilities:

\[
P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)}
\]
Since we’re interested in relative probabilities:
\[
P(H_{CS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})
\]
\[
P(H_{CS}|E) = 0.4 \cdot 0.15 = 0.06
\]

\[
P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)}
\]
\[
P(H_{BA}|E) \propto P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})
\]
\[
P(H_{BA}|E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.10 = 0.01
\]

### Normalizing
Since the total need not add up to 1, we are providing relative probabilities:
{
  "computer science": "0.06",
  "business administration": "0.01"
}
