To compute \(P(H|E)\) (the probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field given his personality sketch), we will use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here's the breakdown of the process for both computer science and business administration.

### Step 1: Define the probabilities.
- \(P(H)\): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the given field based on general statistics for graduate students.
- \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he were in the given field.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he were not in the given field.
- \(P(E)\): The total probability of observing Adam's personality sketch. This can be derived but isn't directly needed as it will cancel out in the ratio.

### Step 2: Assess the Prior Probabilities, \(P(H)\).
- \(P(H_{CS})\): Prior probability for computer science. Let's hypothesize 0.15 (15%) since it is a common field.
- \(P(H_{BA})\): Prior probability for business administration. Let's hypothesize 0.1 (10%) since it is also common but less so than computer science.

### Step 3: Assess the Likelihoods, \(P(E|H)\) and \(P(E|\neg H)\).
- Computer science generally attracts logical, puzzle-solving personalities but might be less associated with traits like strong empathy or deep love for animals.
  - \(P(E|H_{CS})\): Let's say 0.3 (30%).
  - \(P(E|\neg H_{CS})\): Likelihood for others. Considering a variety of fields: hypothesize 0.15 (15%).

- Business administration generally favors strong empathy and understanding but may not be strongly associated with deep love for animals and abstract concepts.
  - \(P(E|H_{BA})\): Let's hypothesize 0.2 (20%).
  - \(P(E|\neg H_{BA})\): Likelihood for others. Considering a variety of fields: hypothesize 0.15 (15%).

### Step 4: Compute the Posterior Probabilities, \(P(H|E)\).
Let's use \(\frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\). The constant \(P(E)\) cancels out, so the relative values can suffice.

#### Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.15}{0.\text{**}} = \text{normalize to } k \left(\approx 0.045 \right) \]

#### Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.\text{**}} = \text{normalize to } k \left(\approx 0.02 \right) \]

Next, we interpret and normalize the values:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \approx 0.7 \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx 0.3 \]

Choosing a plausible normalization factor to make probabilities manageable would give:

### Final Answer:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

This result suggests Adam is more likely to be in a field like computer science than business administration given his personality sketch.
