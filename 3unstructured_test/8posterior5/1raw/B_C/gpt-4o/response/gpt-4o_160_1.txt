To estimate the probability that Adam was enrolled in specific fields based on his personality sketch, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was in the field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch if Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch. This can often be difficult to determine directly, but it is used as a normalizing constant.

For simplicity, we'll assume that \( P(E) \) is the same across different hypotheses and focus on the ratios, realizing that it will only normalize the final probabilities.

We also need to make educated guesses on the likelihoods and priors based on typical characteristics associated with certain fields.

### Business Administration
- \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): Let's assume the prior probability of being enrolled in business administration is relatively high given the popularity of the field.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): Adam's characteristics (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy) aren't strongly associated with business administration. However, his intelligence and appreciation for hard work could fit.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \): This can be considered relatively higher as these traits are not particularly unique to business administration.

### Computer Science
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): Let's assume the prior probability for computer science is also relatively high given the field's popularity.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): Adam's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts strongly fit the profile of a computer science student. His love for solving puzzles is also a strong indicator.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \): Similar to the business administration case, since his traits are broad, this value might be lower than for business administration but still significant.

Given these assumptions, we can make qualitative estimates for the probabilities. Let's assume:

- \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \) = 0.2
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \) = 0.2
- Based on Adam's characteristics:
  - \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \) = 0.3
  - \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \) = 0.6
  - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \) = 0.8
  - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \) = 0.4

Next, we use these in Bayes' theorem:
- For Business Administration:
  \[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.06}{P(E)} \]

- For Computer Science:
  \[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.12}{P(E)} \]

Since these are probabilities relative to \( P(E) \), we can simplify and normalize them:
- Normalize: \[ \frac{0.06}{P(E)} + \frac{0.12}{P(E)} = 1 \]
- Thus relative proportions are:
  - \( P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \approx \frac{0.06}{0.18} = 0.33 \)
  - \( P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx \frac{0.12}{0.18} = 0.67 \)

Thus the probability distribution can be approximately:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.33,
  "computer science": 0.67
}
```
