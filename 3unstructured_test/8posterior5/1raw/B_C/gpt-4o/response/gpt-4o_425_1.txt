To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \), we'll use Bayes' theorem, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \) being true.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing evidence \( E \) given that hypothesis \( H \) is true.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing evidence \( E \) given that hypothesis \( H \) is false.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing evidence \( E \).

Since we're comparing two fields approximately, for simplicity, let's assume the following:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science or business administration, assuming all fields are equally likely.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is enrolled in the specified field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is not enrolled in the specified field.

Let's assign some plausible values based on the provided personality sketch:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): Low to medium, as computer science is a common field but may not fit perfectly with Adam's strong empathy and deep love for animals. Let's say \( 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Medium to high, since curiosity, intelligence, and problem-solving skills are beneficial. Let's say \( 0.7 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Low to medium, as the specific traits are quite specialized. Let's say \( 0.4 \).

2. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H) \): Medium to high, as business administration is versatile but not typically associated as directly with nature and animals. Let's say \( 0.3 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Low to medium, as business admin focuses more on organizational and management skills rather than those described in the sketch. Let's say \( 0.3 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): High, as the specific traits are more common outside this field. Let's say \( 0.6 \).

For simplicity, let's assume \( P(E) \) is the same for both hypotheses. Now we compute \( P(H|E) \):

For **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.14}{P(E)} \]

For **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.09}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a common factor and will cancel out when comparing the two probabilities, we can directly compare the numerators:

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.14 \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.09 \]

Given these approximations, we can say:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.14,
  "business administration": 0.09
}
```
This suggests that, based on the personality sketch provided, Adam is slightly more likely to be enrolled in computer science than in business administration.
