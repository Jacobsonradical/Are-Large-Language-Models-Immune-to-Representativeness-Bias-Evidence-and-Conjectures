To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science or business administration given his personality sketch \( E \), we can use Bayes' Rule. Here's a step-by-step outline of the process for each field:

1. **Define the base rates \( P(H) \)**: This is our prior belief about the proportion of graduate students in each field.
2. **Estimate the likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in a specific field.
3. **Estimate the likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in that specific field.
4. **Compute \( P(H|E) \)** using Bayes' Rule: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have specific data, we'll use reasonable assumptions to make an estimation. Let's assume:
- Base rate \( P(H) \) for computer science is relatively high because it's a popular graduate field.
- Base rate \( P(H) \) for business administration is also high for similar reasons.
- Based on Adam's personality sketch, we need to judge the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for each field, and the likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \).

### Computer Science

1. **Base rate \( P(H_{cs}) \)**:
\[ P(H_{cs}) \approx 0.2 \] (20%, assuming a high base rate due to the popularity of computer science)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{cs}) \)**:
Given Adam's personality sketch (curiosity, abstract thinking, puzzle-solving), he could fit well in computer science.
\[ P(E|H_{cs}) \approx 0.4 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{cs}) \)**:
Among other fields excluding computer science, his traits are still relatively common but perhaps less concentrated.
\[ P(E|\neg H_{cs}) \approx 0.1 \]

### Business Administration

1. **Base rate \( P(H_{ba}) \)**:
\[ P(H_{ba}) \approx 0.2 \] (20%, assuming a high base rate due to the popularity of business administration)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{ba}) \)**:
Considering Adam's traits, he seems less likely to fit the typical business administration student profile (which might emphasize social interaction over puzzles and appreciation of nature).
\[ P(E|H_{ba}) \approx 0.1 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{ba}) \)**:
Among other fields excluding business administration, his traits could be more common.
\[ P(E|\neg H_{ba}) \approx 0.3 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Rule:

For computer science:
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs})}{P(E)} \]
Since \( P(E) \) = \( P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs}) + P(E|\neg H_{cs}) \cdot P(\neg H_{cs}) \):
\[ P(E) \approx (0.4 \cdot 0.2) + (0.1 \cdot 0.8) = 0.08 + 0.08 = 0.16 \]

\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.16} = 0.5 \]

For business administration:
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{ba}) \cdot P(H_{ba})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) \approx (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) = 0.02 + 0.24 = 0.26 \]

\[ P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.26} \approx 0.077 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities, given the personality sketch \( E \), are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.077
}
```

These values indicate that it is more likely that Adam was enrolled in computer science than in business administration, given his personality traits.
