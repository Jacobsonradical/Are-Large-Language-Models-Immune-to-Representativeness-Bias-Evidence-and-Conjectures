To use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \), we need to determine the following probabilistic values for each hypothesis (H):

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the evidence (Adam's personality sketch) given that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the evidence given that Adam was not enrolled in the given field.
4. \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field given the evidence.

### For Business Administration

1. **\( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \)**: The prior probability Adam was enrolled in a business administration program. Assuming equal prior probabilities for various fields, we might assign a generic prior, say 0.1.

2. **\( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \)**: The fit between Adam's personality traits and a business administration program. Traits like strong empathy and understanding hard work might fit somewhat, but love for animals and nature might be less relevant. We'll assume a modest fit, say 0.2.

3. **\( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \)**: How common these traits are in students not enrolled in business administration. Given Adam's traits seem more suited to research and more nature-oriented fields, we'll give a higher value, say 0.3.

### For Computer Science

1. **\( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \)**: The prior probability Adam was enrolled in a computer science program. We'll assign 0.1 as a base level assumption.

2. **\( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \)**: The fit between Adam's traits and a computer science program. Interest in puzzles and high intelligence fit well, but less about nature/plants and animals. Therefore, we can assume a decent fit, say 0.5.

3. **\( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \)**: These traits are less common in fields outside of science and engineering, so we'll assume a value of 0.2.

Now let's apply Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For our purposes, \( P(E) \) can be ignored if we're only interested in relative comparisons:

### Business Administration
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \approx 0.02 \]
### Computer Science
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \approx 0.05 \]

Summarizing:

  "business administration": 0.02,
