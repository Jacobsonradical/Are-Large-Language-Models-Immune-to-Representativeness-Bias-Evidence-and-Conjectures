To use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \), we need to judge the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihoods under the negation \( P(E|\neg H) \). Here's how we can approach this:

### For Business Administration
- **Prior probability, \( P(H_{BA}) \)**: Given the range of graduate fields, let's assume the prior probability is moderate. Say, \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.1 \).
- **Likelihood, \( P(E|H_{BA}) \)**: Given Adam's interest in nature, animals, and solving puzzles, Business Administration does not naturally align with these interests. So, \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.05 \).
- **Likelihood under negation, \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \)**: Since many other fields (like biology, environment sciences, etc.) could fit Adam's personality better, we'll assume it's relatively high. Say, \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.5 \).

### For Computer Science
- **Prior probability, \( P(H_{CS}) \)**: Computer Science is a popular field among graduate students. We can assume a higher prior, say \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.2 \).
- **Likelihood, \( P(E|H_{CS}) \)**: Adam's high intelligence and problem-solving skills align with Computer Science, but his strong empathy and love for nature might not align as well. So, \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.3 \).
- **Likelihood under negation, \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \)**: Given there are many other suitable fields, we might assume \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.4 \).

Now let's use Bayes' Theorem for each field:

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) * P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

where \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the evidence \( E \).

Since we are looking at specific fields, \( P(E) \) will normalize the results and can be calculated as:

\[ 
P(E) = P(E|H_{BA}) * P(H_{BA}) + P(E|H_{CS}) * P(H_{CS}) + \ldots 
\]

For simplicity, we'll focus on the specific fields given:

### For Business Administration:
\[ 
P(E)_{BA} = P(E|H_{BA}) * P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA}) * P(\neg H_{BA}) = 0.05 * 0.1 + 0.5 * 0.9 = 0.005 + 0.45 = 0.455
\]
\[ 
P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) * P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.05 * 0.1}{0.455} \approx 0.011
\]

### For Computer Science:
\[ 
P(E)_{CS} = P(E|H_{CS}) * P(H_{CS}) + P(E|\neg H_{CS}) * P(\neg H_{CS}) = 0.3 * 0.2 + 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.06 + 0.32 = 0.38
\]
\[ 
P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) * P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 * 0.2}{0.38} \approx 0.158
\]

The computed values suggest that Adam is far more likely to be in Computer Science than in Business Administration based on his personality sketch \( E \).
