To determine the probabilities of Adam being enrolled in either business administration or computer science based on the given personality sketch (E), we'll use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote H1 as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in business administration and H2 as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For each field:

1. **Prior Probability (\(P(H)\))**: This is the initial probability of Adam being in that field without considering any additional information. This might be considered to be the general probability of a graduate student being enrolled in that field based on typical enrollment statistics.
2. **Likelihood (\(P(E|H)\))**: This is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
3. **Complement Likelihood (\(P(E|\neg H)\))**: This is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is NOT enrolled in that field.

We assume that:
- Business administration students typically might not exhibit strong curiosity about nature and deep love for animals, but might have high intelligence and appreciation for hard work.
- Computer science students might align more closely with curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, high intelligence, and abstract concepts.

For simplicity, let's use rough qualitative assessments based on these typical traits for each field. 

### Business Administration:
1. \(P(H1)\): Assume a typical prior probability for business administration might be around 0.25.
2. \(P(E|H1)\): Since the personality sketch does not strongly align with typical traits for business administration, we might set this at 0.1.
3. \(P(E|\neg H1)\): Since the personality sketch includes traits common in various fields (especially science-related fields), let's set this at 0.5.

### Computer Science:
1. \(P(H2)\): Typical prior probability for computer science might be around 0.3.
2. \(P(E|H2)\): The personality sketch fits better with typical computer science traits, so we can set this higher at 0.4.
3. \(P(E|\neg H2)\): This might be similar to the business administration complement likelihood, so we'll also set this at 0.5.

Using Bayes' theorem:

### Business Administration:
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant, calculated as: 
\[ P(E) = P(E|H1)\cdot P(H1) + P(E|\neg H1)\cdot P(\neg H1) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.5 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.025 + 0.375 = 0.4 \]
So:
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.4} = \frac{0.025}{0.4} = 0.0625 \]

### Computer Science:
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) \) for computer science would be:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H2)\cdot P(H2) + P(E|\neg H2)\cdot P(\neg H2) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.4 \cdot 0.3) + (0.5 \cdot 0.7) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.35 = 0.47 \]
So:
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{0.47} = \frac{0.12}{0.47} \approx 0.255 \]

Putting these together:

{
  "business administration": 0.0625,
  "computer science": 0.255
}
