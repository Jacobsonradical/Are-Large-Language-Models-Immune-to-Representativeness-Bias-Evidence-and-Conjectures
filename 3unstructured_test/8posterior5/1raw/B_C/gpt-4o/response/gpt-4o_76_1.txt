To evaluate the probabilities using Bayes' rule, we consider:

1. **Prior Probability (P(H))**: The initial assumption about the probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field.
2. **Likelihood (P(E|H))**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in a specific field.
3. **Marginal Likelihood (P(E|\neg H))**: The probability of observing the personality sketch when Adam is enrolled in any field other than the one under consideration.

### Computer Science

P(H): The prior probability of Adam being in Computer Science. Let's assume a moderate prior since Computer Science is a common field for graduate studies.
\[ P(\text{H}) = 0.2 \]

P(E|H): The likelihood that Adam, with his specific qualities, would be enrolled in Computer Science. Computer Science requires high intelligence and abstract thinking, which Adam possesses, but it’s less directly tied to his empathy and love for animals.
\[ P(\text{E|H}) = 0.4 \]

P(E|\neg H): The likelihood of observing Adam’s personality sketch in any other field that is not Computer Science. Given Adam's qualities, it’s likely he could fit well in other fields too.
\[ P(\text{E|\neg H}) = 0.6 \]

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.4 \times 0.2) + (0.6 \times 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.48 = 0.56 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.2}{0.56} = \frac{0.08}{0.56} \approx 0.143 \]

### Business Administration

P(H): The prior probability of Adam being in Business Administration. This is another common field but might seem less likely given Adam’s personality traits.
\[ P(\text{H}) = 0.1 \]

P(E|H): The likelihood that Adam, with his specific qualities, would be enrolled in Business Administration. While traits like strong empathy can be useful, most of Adam’s other qualities, like love for animals and nature, fit less with this field’s requirements.
\[ P(\text{E|H}) = 0.2 \]

P(E|\neg H): The likelihood of observing Adam’s personality sketch in any other field that is not Business Administration.
\[ P(\text{E|\neg H}) = 0.7 \]

Using Bayes' Rule again:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \times 0.1) + (0.7 \times 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.63 = 0.65 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{0.65} = \frac{0.02}{0.65} \approx 0.031 \]

Using this approach, here's the result:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.143,
  "business administration": 0.031
}
