First, let's evaluate the provided probabilities.

### Probability Estimations

**Computer Science:**
1. **P(H_computer_science)**: This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Since computer science is a common field, we'll set this around 0.2.
2. **P(E|H_computer_science)**: Given Adam's personality traits, such as high intelligence, appreciation for abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving skills, this seems a good match. So, we'll estimate this at 0.7.
3. **P(E|\neg H_computer_science)**: This is the probability that Adam would have the same set of characteristics regardless of his enrollment in computer science. His traits could also fit well with other fields, so we'll roughly set this at 0.5.

### Bayes Rule Calculation for Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]
We'll leave \(P(E)\) out of the calculations, as it will be the same for both hypotheses and will cancel out in relative comparisons:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.7 \cdot 0.2 = 0.14 \]

**Business Administration:**
1. **P(H_business_administration)**: This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Since business administration is also a common field, we'll set this around 0.15.
2. **P(E|H_business_administration)**: While business administration students might have empathy, the other traits seem less aligned (nature curiosity, animals, etc.). Estimate this around 0.3.
3. **P(E|\neg H_business_administration)**: Same as before, roughly 0.5 since his profile might fit other fields.
 
### Bayes Rule Calculation for Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \]
Again, we'll leave \(P(E)\) out of the calculations:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.3 \cdot 0.15 = 0.045 \]

### Relative Comparison:
Now, to compare, we normalize these values:
Total proportional factor for normalization:
\[ 0.14 + 0.045 = 0.185 \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E)_{cs} = \frac{0.14}{0.185} \approx 0.757 \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E)_{ba} = \frac{0.045}{0.185} \approx 0.243 \]

### Conclusion:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.757,
  "business administration": 0.243
}
