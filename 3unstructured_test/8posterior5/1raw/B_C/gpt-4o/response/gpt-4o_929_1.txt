To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch of Adam (E), we can use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we need to make reasonable assumptions about the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihoods of the evidence under the negation \( P(E|\neg H) \).

First, let's make educated guesses for each term:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field. Since we donâ€™t have exact data, let's assume:
   - \( P(\text{computer science}) \approx 0.15 \)
   - \( P(\text{business administration}) \approx 0.15 \)

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the evidence given Adam is enrolled in that field:
   - For **computer science**: Given Adam's traits (high intelligence, interest in solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts), \( P(E| \text{computer science}) \) could be quite high: 0.7
   - For **business administration**: Adam's personality (empathy, appreciation for hard work, and warm heart) could somewhat align, but business administration does not directly align with his curiosity about nature, plants, or animals: \( P(E| \text{business administration}) \approx 0.3 \)

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of the evidence given Adam is not enrolled in the field. This term is a bit trickier but we assume a rough estimate based on his general traits:
   - Since many fields may not be perfectly aligned with his interests, we assume \( P(E|\neg \text{computer science})\) and \( P(E|\neg \text{business administration})\) are reasonable for many fields. We can estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \) for both due to the general nature of his traits fitting many fields in some degree.

Now, we use Bayes' Rule to compute \( P(H|E) \):

### For Computer Science
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} \]

Let's first compute \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) + P(E|\neg \text{computer science}) \cdot P(\neg \text{computer science}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.7 \cdot 0.15 + 0.4 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.105 + 0.34 = 0.445 \]

\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.15}{0.445} \approx 0.236 \]

### For Business Administration
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} \]

Similarly, \( P(E) \) is the same, so:
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.15}{0.445} \approx 0.101 \]

So, the approximate posterior probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": "0.236",
  "business administration": "0.101"
}
