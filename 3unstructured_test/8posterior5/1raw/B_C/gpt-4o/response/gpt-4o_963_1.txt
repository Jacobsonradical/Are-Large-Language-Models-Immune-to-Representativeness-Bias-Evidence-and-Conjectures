To answer this, we will approach it by evaluating the probabilities based on the given personality sketch of Adam.

1. **Business Administration**

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a business administration graduate program is relatively moderate when considering the general graduate student population.
  
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing E given that Adam is in a business administration program might be lower compared to other fields, because the personality sketch focuses heavily on traits better suited to fields other than business administration (like empathy, love for animals, curiosity about nature).
  
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing E given that Adam is not in a business administration program should be higher because there are many fields (like environmental sciences, biology, etc.) that align more with his personality sketch.

2. **Computer Science**

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a computer science graduate program might be moderate to high. Computer science is a popular field for many graduate students.
  
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing E given that Adam is in a computer science program could be lower compared to some other fields, but it might still be plausible due to his high intelligence and problem-solving skills.
  
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing E given that Adam is not in a computer science program is fairly high, especially considering fields like environmental science, biology, or psychology, which align more with his personality.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We assume \( P(E) \) is constant for comparison purposes between the two fields.

Given the data, we'll assign some reasonable values reflecting these contextual judgments:

1. **Business Administration**

- \( P(H) \): 0.2
- \( P(E|H) \): 0.1
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): 0.8
- \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.8 (average of non-Business fields) \)

Using these we get:

\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.02}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a constant for relative comparison:

\[ P(H|E)_{BA} \approx 0.02 \]

2. **Computer Science**

- \( P(H) \): 0.3
- \( P(E|H) \): 0.3
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): 0.7
- \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.6 (average of non-CS fields) \)

Using these we get:

\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.3 \times 0.3}{P(E)} = \frac{0.09}{P(E)} \]

So, relatively:

\[ P(H|E)_{CS} \approx 0.09 \]

Therefore, our final probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.09
}
```
