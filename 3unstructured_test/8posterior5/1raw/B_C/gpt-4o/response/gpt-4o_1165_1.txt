To determine the probability of Adam being enrolled in either computer science or business administration based on his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's evaluate the necessary probabilities for each field:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - This is the initial probability that Adam is enrolled in a certain field without any additional information.
   - For simplicity, let's assume that the prior probabilities for each field are equal since we don’t have explicit data favoring one field over the other.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)** and \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - This is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is in that field \( H \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not in that field.

### Computer Science:
- **Prior \( P(H_{CS}) \)**: Let’s assume \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.1 \) (Assuming equal prior for multiple fields).
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{CS}) \)**: Adam's traits like solving puzzles, high intelligence, abstract concepts fit reasonably for computer science students. Let’s assume \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.5 \).
- **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \)**: Assuming that in other fields, the traits are less fitting but still possible. Let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.2 \).

Using Bayes’ theorem:
\( P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \)

Since \( P(E) \) is the same across all hypotheses and is factored for normalization, let’s evaluate \( P(H_{CS}|E) \) in relative terms:
\( P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \)

### Business Administration:
- **Prior \( P(H_{BA}) \)**: Let’s assume \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.1 \).
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{BA}) \)**: Traits like empathy, warm heart, and appreciation for hard work fit reasonably for business administration students. Let’s assume \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.3 \).
- **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \)**: Assuming that in other fields, the traits are less fitting but still possible. In this case, let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.2 \).

Using Bayes’ theorem:
\( P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \)

Let’s evaluate \( P(H_{BA}|E) \) in relative terms:
\( P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \)


Given that \( P(E) \) is a common normalization factor, we can compare the relative probabilities:

{
  "computer science": \( \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = 0.05 \),
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = 0.03 \)
}

To summarize:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.05,
  "business administration": 0.03
}
```

These values are relative probabilities and need to be normalized if compared directly; however, they give an immediate sense of relative likelihood based on the given personality sketch.
