To determine \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we will use Bayes' theorem, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant and the same for all fields, we only need to compare the numerators \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

Here are the necessary steps for each field:

1. **Estimate \( P(H) \) (the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in that field):**
   - Business Administration (BA): Moderately common field for graduate students, but less likely with Adam’s personality traits.
     - Let's assume \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1 \)
   - Computer Science (CS): A field where solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts are highly relevant.
     - Let's assume \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.15 \)

2. **Estimate \( P(E|H) \) (the likelihood of observing the personality traits given that Adam is enrolled in that field):**
   - BA: Adam’s curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals are not strongly aligned with typical traits associated with business administration.
     - Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.02 \)
   - CS: Enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and strong understanding of abstract concepts align well with computer science.
     - Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.3 \)

3. **Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) (the likelihood of observing the personality traits given that Adam is not enrolled in that field):**
   - Assuming \(\neg H\) refers to being enrolled in any other field not specified here. Given Adam's traits:
     - For BA: \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \) could be relatively higher because other fields (like psychology, biology, etc.) might explain his traits better.
       - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1 \)
     - For CS: \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \) would be lower because CS aligns highly with his traits.
       - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.05 \)

Now we compute \( P(H|E) \):

Using Bayes’ theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.02 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.3 \times 0.15}{P(E)} \]

Let's normalize:

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.002}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.045}{P(E)} \]

To compare the probabilities, we normalize them to sum up to 1 for the fields we're interested in:

\[ P(H_{\text{total}}|E) = P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) + P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx 0.002 + 0.045 = 0.047 \]

So,

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.002}{0.047} \approx 0.043 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.047} \approx 0.957 \]

Therefore, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.043,
  "computer science": 0.957
}
```
