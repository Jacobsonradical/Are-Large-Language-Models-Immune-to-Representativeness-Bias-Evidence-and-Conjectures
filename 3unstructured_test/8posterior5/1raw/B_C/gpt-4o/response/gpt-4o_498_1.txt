To solve this using Bayes' rule, we'll need to estimate \(P(H)\), \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E|\neg H)\) for each field (Business Administration and Computer Science), and then compute \(P(H|E)\).

**Definitions:**
- \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the described field.
- \(P(E|H)\): The probability of the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam was not enrolled in the field.
- \(P(H|E)\): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field given the personality sketch.

**Assumptions:**
1. We assume generic prior probabilities \(P(H)\) based on common understanding of graduate field enrollments.
2. We must estimate the likelihood of \(P(E|H)\) and \(P(E|\neg H)\) based on the match between the personality sketch and typical traits associated with the field.

**Estimations:**

**Business Administration:**
- \(P(H)\): Assuming business administration is a common graduate field but perhaps less aligned with Adam's personality, we might assign a somewhat lower prior.
  \[
  P(H_{BA}) = 0.1
  \]
- \(P(E|H)\): The traits described (curiosity about nature, love for animals, solving puzzles) may not align strongly with typical business administration candidates.
  \[
  P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.1
  \]
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of the personality traits if not in business administration might be reasonably high as these traits may align better with other fields.
  \[
  P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.3
  \]

**Computer Science:**
- \(P(H)\): Computer science is quite a common and popular graduate field, especially for analytical and intelligent individuals.
  \[
  P(H_{CS}) = 0.2
  \]
- \(P(E|H)\): The traits described (solving puzzles, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts) strongly match computer science students.
  \[
  P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.8
  \]
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The likelihood of the personality traits if not in computer science might be lower compared to other fields.
  \[
  P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.2
  \]

**Applying Bayes' Rule:**

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
Where \(P(E)\) is the normalizing constant, computed as:
\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

**Business Administration:**
\[
P(E_{BA}) = 0.1 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9 = 0.01 + 0.27 = 0.28
\]
\[
P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.28} = \frac{0.01}{0.28} \approx 0.036
\]

**Computer Science:**
\[
P(E_{CS}) = 0.8 \cdot 0.2 + 0.2 \cdot 0.8 = 0.16 + 0.16 = 0.32
\]
\[
P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{0.32} = \frac{0.16}{0.32} = 0.5
\]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": 0.036,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
