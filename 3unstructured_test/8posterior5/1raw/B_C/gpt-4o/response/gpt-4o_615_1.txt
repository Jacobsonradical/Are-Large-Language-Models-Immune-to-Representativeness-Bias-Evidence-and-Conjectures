To determine the probabilities, let's break down the steps as suggested.

### Computer Science:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science. Given it's a common field, we might estimate this at 0.2.

2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in Computer Science. 
   - Adam's strong intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment in solving puzzles align well with Computer Science. 
   - However, this field may not align closely with his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and a warm heart unless he is, for instance, in a specific subfield like bioinformatics. Let's estimate this at 0.5.

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not in Computer Science. 
   - Given the broad range of other fields, this too would be influenced by how well the other fields might align with Adam's traits. Let's estimate this at 0.3.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assuming for simplification: 
\[ P(E) \approx 0.5 \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.5 \times 0.2}{0.5} = 0.2 \]

### Business Administration:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration. Let's estimate this at 0.1 due to its popularity, though less so among people fitting Adam’s profile.
   
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in Business Administration.
   - This field may align with his understanding of hard work and dedication, but not as much with his curiosity about nature, love for animals or solving puzzles. Estimate this as 0.2.

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not in Business Administration.
   - Given the broad range of other fields, let's estimate this at 0.3.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{0.5} = 0.04 \]

### Results

From the computed conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.04
}
```

These values reflect the relative probabilities of Adam being in each field based on his personality sketch and prior knowledge about each field's alignment with his traits. The total does not add up to 1 because many other potential fields are not considered in this simplified example.
