Let's break down the steps to determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or business administration using Bayes' theorem.

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field without any other information.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of the given personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in the specific field.

### For Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) \)**: 
   - Let's assume graduate students are evenly distributed among many fields. 
   - Suppose computer science students make up 10% of the graduate population.
   - Hence, \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.10 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \)**: 
   - Traits like high intelligence, abstract thinking, a love of problem-solving, and possibly a quiet demeanor fit well.
   - Let's give this a likelihood of 0.40.

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}}) \)**: 
   - This is harder to judge but could realistically be distributed among various other fields.
   - Suppose the personality sketch fits with about 5% of non-CS graduate students.
   - Hence, \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.05 \).

### For Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H_{\text{ba}}) \)**: 
   - Suppose business administration students make up around 15% of the general graduate population.
   - Hence, \( P(H_{\text{ba}}) = 0.15 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) \)**:
   - Traits like a warm heart, empathy, and understanding hard work might fit, but the generally quiet and nature-oriented aspects might not.
   - Let's assign a lower likelihood, say 0.10.

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{ba}}) \)**:
   - Given the same logic as above, let's assume this personality sketch matches about 5% of students not in business administration.
   - Hence, \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{ba}}) = 0.05 \).

### Application of Bayes' Theorem

Bayes' theorem \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \).

For simplification, we'll calculate \( P(E) \) assuming these are the only two fields considered:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{cs}})P(H_{\text{cs}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}})P(\neg H_{\text{cs}}) \]

For Computer Science:

\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{cs}})P(H_{\text{cs}})}{P(E)} \]

Assuming \( P(E) \approx (0.40 \times 0.10) + (0.05 \times 0.90) = 0.04 + 0.045 = 0.085 \):

\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{0.40 \times 0.10}{0.085} \approx \frac{0.04}{0.085} \approx 0.47 \]

For Business Administration:

\[ P(H_{\text{ba}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{ba}})P(H_{\text{ba}})}{P(E)} \]

Assuming \( P(E) \approx (0.10 \times 0.15) + (0.05 \times 0.85) = 0.015 + 0.0425 = 0.0575 \):

\[ P(H_{\text{ba}}|E) = \frac{0.10 \times 0.15}{0.0575} \approx \frac{0.015}{0.0575} \approx 0.26 \]

Thus, given the calculations:

{
  "computer science": 0.47,
  "business administration": 0.26
}
