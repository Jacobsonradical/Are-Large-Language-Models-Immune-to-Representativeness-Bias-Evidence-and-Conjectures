To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' Rule, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since \(P(E)\) is constant for all hypotheses and we are comparing relative probabilities, we can simplify the comparison by focusing on the numerator, i.e., \(P(E|H) \cdot P(H)\).

Let's break down the task for each field given.

### Business Administration:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration. Since there are many graduate fields, let's assign a typical prior probability. Assume it is 0.1 (10%).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the sketch E given Adam is in Business Administration. Business Administration does not typically focus on nature, animals, or strong empathy, more likely it involves interpersonal, managerial, and economic skills. Given Adam's personality sketch, this seems less likely. Let's assign a conditional probability of 0.1 (10%).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the sketch E given Adam is not in Business Administration. This probability has to account for all the other possible fields. As other fields like ecology, biology, or environmental science are more aligned with Adam's interests, we assign a typical value. Assume it is 0.9 (90%).

Now, apply Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.1 = 0.01 \]

### Computer Science:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Computer Science. Again, assume the broader prior probability is 0.1 (10%).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the sketch E given Adam is in Computer Science. Computer Science attracts people with high intelligence and who are good at solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts. This is more in line with Adam’s attributes. We'll assign a conditional probability of 0.5 (50%).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Same as above, 0.9 (90%), divided among other non-CS fields.

Now, apply Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} \propto 0.5 \cdot 0.1 = 0.05 \]

### Results:

After normalizing for comparison (though it is unnecessary strictly for comparison purposes since relative scales are enough):

\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = 0.01 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = 0.05 \]

Since these probabilities are for comparison, normalization to sum to a specific value isn't necessary, but the relative likelihood shows that Computer Science is more aligned with Adam's personality sketch.

Thus, the relative probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": 0.01,
  "computer science": 0.05
}

However, normalizing for easier comparison:

\( 0.01 + 0.05 = 0.06\)

Then,

{
  "business administration": 0.01 / 0.06 ≈ 0.167,
  "computer science": 0.05 / 0.06 ≈ 0.833
}

So final answer is:

{
  "business administration": 0.167,
  "computer science": 0.833
}
