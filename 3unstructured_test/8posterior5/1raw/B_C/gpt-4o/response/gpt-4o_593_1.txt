Below is the analysis and computation for the probabilities for the fields of computer science and business administration given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam. 

### Computer Science
1. **Prior Probability P(H)**
   - There is a significant number of graduate students in the field of computer science, so P(H) might be relatively moderate to high but not extremely high.

2. **Likelihood P(E|H)**
   - Adam's interest in solving puzzles and his high intelligence fit well with the computer science field.
   - However, his strong empathy, deep love for animals, and curiosity about nature may not align directly with the stereotypical qualities associated with computer science students.
   - Let's assume this to be moderate.

3. **Likelihood P(E|\neg H)**
   - Given Adam's qualities, many other fields related to nature, animals, or empathetic professions might match well.
   - Therefore, P(E|\neg H) might be somewhat high.

### Business Administration
1. **Prior Probability P(H)**
   - Business Administration is another popular field, but perhaps slightly less so than computer science among graduate students who possess Adam's characteristics.

2. **Likelihood P(E|H)**
   - Business Administration students might not predominantly exhibit strong empathy, a deep love for animals, and curiosity about nature, which suggests a lower fit.
   - Hence, P(E|H) could be considered low to moderate.

3. **Likelihood P(E|\neg H)**
   - Fields outside business administration that match well with Adam’s characteristics could be more likely.
   - Thus, P(E|\neg H) could be considered high.

### Calculation using Bayes' Rule

Bayes' Rule, \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \), simplifies to a qualitative understanding since \( P(E) \) is constant for both computations.

#### Computer Science
- \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \) (moderate prior probability)
- \( P(E|H) \approx 0.5 \) (moderate likelihood)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \) (highish likelihood given broad applicability)

#### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \approx 0.15 \) (slightly lower prior probability)
- \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \) (moderate to low likelihood)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.6 \) (high likelihood given broad applicability)

Given these qualitative assessments, we compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \):

For computer science:
\( P(H|E) \propto P(E|H)P(H) = 0.5 \times 0.2 = 0.1 \)

For business administration:
\( P(H|E) \propto P(E|H)P(H) = 0.3 \times 0.15 = 0.045 \)

Thus, normalizing these values to compare relative posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.10 / (0.10 + 0.045) ≈ 0.69,
  "business administration": 0.045 / (0.10 + 0.045) ≈ 0.31
}
```

**Final Answer:**
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.69,
  "business administration": 0.31
}
```
