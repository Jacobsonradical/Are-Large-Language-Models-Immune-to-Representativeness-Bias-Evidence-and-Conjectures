To use Bayes' rule for this calculation, we need the following pieces of information:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) (the personality sketch) if Adam was enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) if Adam was not enrolled in that field.
4. \( P(E) \): The total probability of observing the evidence \( E \), which is calculated as \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Once we have these probabilities, we can compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since the exact prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \) are not given, we'll use reasonable estimates based on typical assumptions.

For simplification:
- Let's assume the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for both fields are the same \( 0.5 \) (since no prior information favors one over the other).
- For \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \), we'll estimate based on the fit of Adam's personality sketch to each field.

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H_{\text{business}}) \)**:
   - Assume \( P(H_{\text{business}}) = 0.5 \).
   
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \)**:
   - Business administration students might have curiosity and empathy, but the focus is not typically on nature, puzzles, and animals. Hence, \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \) might be relatively low.
   - Estimate \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \approx 0.2 \).

3. **Evidence of Not Business Administration \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}}) \)**:
   - If Adam is not in business administration, the evidence \( E \) aligning with this personality is likely to be higher.
   - Estimate \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}}) \approx 0.8 \).

### Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \)**:
   - Assume \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.5 \).
   
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \)**:
   - Computer science students often enjoy solving puzzles, understanding abstract concepts, and may have high intelligence. This might align more with Adam's personality.
   - Estimate \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.7 \).

3. **Evidence of Not Computer Science \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \)**:
   - If Adam is not in computer science, the evidence \( E \) aligning with his personality is likely to be lower.
   - Estimate \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.3 \).

### Calculating \( P(H|E) \)

#### Business Administration

\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}})}{P(E)} \]

Where

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{business}}) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.5 + 0.8 \cdot 0.5 \]

\[ P(E) = 0.1 + 0.4 = 0.5 \]

Thus,

\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} \]

\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = 0.2 \]

#### Computer Science

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \]

Where

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.7 \cdot 0.5 + 0.3 \cdot 0.5 \]

\[ P(E) = 0.35 + 0.15 = 0.5 \]

Thus,

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} \]

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = 0.7 \]
