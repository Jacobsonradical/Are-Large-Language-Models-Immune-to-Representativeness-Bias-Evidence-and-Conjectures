To compute the conditional probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for Adam being enrolled in computer science (CS) or business administration (BA), we first need to estimate the necessary probabilities:

1. \(P(H)\) - The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the given field.
2. \(P(E|H)\) - The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch (E) given that he is enrolled in the given field (H).
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\) - The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch (E) given that he is not enrolled in the given field (\(\neg H\)).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given we need to use estimates, let's proceed with the calculations.

### For Computer Science:

1. **P(H) for computer science**:
   - Let's assume a moderate prior probability that any given graduate student might be in computer science. For simplicity, let's state it is 0.1 (10%).

2. **P(E|H) for computer science**:
   - Adam's interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with typical traits of computer science students.
   - As such, let's assign a reasonably high probability of 0.6 (60%).

3. **P(E|\neg H) for computer science**:
   - This is the probability of Adam's profile fitting students in fields other than computer science. Given traits like empathy and love for animals may not be predominant in computer science, we'll give this a value of 0.3 (30%).

\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

### For Business Administration:

1. **P(H) for business administration**:
   - Let's assume a lower prior probability, given Adam's interest in nature and science. Set it at 0.05 (5%).

2. **P(E|H) for business administration**:
   - While empathy and understanding abstract concepts can be relevant, the nature-oriented traits fit less. Hence, a lower probability of 0.2 (20%).

3. **P(E|\neg H) for business administration**:
   - This would be high since fields like biology could fit better. Let's set it at 0.4 (40%).

\[ P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} \]

Now, while we don't have the exact value for \(P(E)\) (the marginal likelihood of Adam's personality profile across all fields), we can simplify comparisons:

\[ 
P(\text{CS}|E) \propto 0.6 \cdot 0.1 = 0.06 
\]
\[ 
P(\text{BA}|E) \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.05 = 0.01 
\]

Normalization (dividing each by their sum):

\[ P(\text{CS}|E) \approx \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.01} = \frac{0.06}{0.07} \approx 0.857 \]
\[ P(\text{BA}|E) \approx \frac{0.01}{0.06 + 0.01} = \frac{0.01}{0.07} \approx 0.143 \] 

Thus, our final results, while approximations, would be:

{
  "computer science": 0.857,
  "business administration": 0.143
}
