To solve this problem using Bayes' rule, we need to assess the probabilities as follows:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch E given he is enrolled in a specific field H.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch E given he is not enrolled in a specific field H.

Using these, we can compute **P(H|E)**, the probability that Adam is enrolled in field H given his personality sketch E, using the formula for Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since exact numerical values for these probabilities are not provided, we'll make educated guesses based on the personality sketch to establish relative likelihoods.

### Computer Science
- **P(H)**: As computer science is a common field of study for graduate students, we might assign a baseline prior probability (e.g., 0.2, assuming there are 5 major fields).
- **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's high intelligence, problem-solving skills, and appreciation for abstract concepts, which are common in computer science, this might be relatively high (e.g., 0.7).
- **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing this personality sketch in non-computer science fields might be lower but not negligible due to the cross-disciplinary nature of intelligence and problem-solving (e.g., 0.1).

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: Business Administration is also a common graduate field, we might assign a similar prior probability (e.g., 0.2).
- **P(E|H)**: Adam’s traits such as empathy, understanding of dedication, and warm-heartedness are good for business administration, but his curiosity about nature and animals might be less directly relevant, suggesting a moderate probability (e.g., 0.4).
- **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing this sketch in non-business fields might be slightly higher due to the variety of fields empathizing problem-solving and curiosity (e.g., 0.2).

Using these hypotheses, let's compute the posterior probabilities using an assumed form of normalization (since exact values aren’t necessary for ratio comparisons but provide estimation):

#### For Computer Science:
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

#### For Business Administration:
\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{Business Administration}) \cdot P(\text{Business Administration})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

The values \(P(E)\) cancel out as we are only interested in the relative comparison:

\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) \approx \frac{0.14}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) \approx \frac{0.08}{P(E)} \]

Now we convert these into more interpretable values between 0 and 1 for comparative purposes.

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

These values clearly indicate that given Adam's personality sketch, he is relatively more likely to be enrolled in computer science than business administration. This does not sum to 1 as counting other potential fields of specialization is not accounted for.
