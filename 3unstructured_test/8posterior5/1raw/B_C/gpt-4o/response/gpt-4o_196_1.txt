To evaluate the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in either computer science or business administration, we need to apply Bayes' Rule which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To compute \( P(H|E) \), we need reasonable assumptions regarding \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

**Computer Science:**

1. **P(H):** Probability that Adam is enrolled in Computer Science.
   Let's assume that the probability of being enrolled in Computer Science (\( P(\text{CS}) \)) out of all possible fields is approximately 20%, or \( 0.2 \).

2. **P(E|H):** Probability of the evidence given that Adam is a Computer Science student.
   Given Adam's high intelligence and aptitude for solving puzzles, it is reasonable to have a high probability here. Let's assume \( P(E|\text{CS}) \) is 0.7.

3. **P(E|\neg H):** Probability of the evidence given that Adam is not a Computer Science student.
   Since other fields could also fit Adam's personality traits, this probability could be moderately high. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg \text{CS}) \) is 0.3.

\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.14}{P(E)} \]

Now we need to find \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(E|\neg \text{CS}) \cdot P(\neg \text{CS}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.7 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8 = 0.14 + 0.24 = 0.38 \]

So,

\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.14}{0.38} \approx 0.37 \]

**Business Administration:**

1. **P(H):** Probability that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration.
   Let's assume that the probability of being enrolled in Business Administration (\( P(\text{BA}) \)) out of all possible fields is approximately 10%, or \( 0.1 \).

2. **P(E|H):** Probability of the evidence given that Adam is a Business Administration student.
   Given that empathy and appreciation for dedication might fit Business Administration slightly but not strongly, let's assume \( P(E|\text{BA}) \) is 0.3.

3. **P(E|\neg H):** Probability of the evidence given that Adam is not a Business Administration student.
   This remains the same as before, \( P(E|\neg \text{BA}) \), assumed to be 0.35.

\[ P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{BA}) \cdot P(\text{BA})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.03}{P(E)} \]

Now we need to find \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|\text{BA}) \cdot P(\text{BA}) + P(E|\neg \text{BA}) \cdot P(\neg \text{BA}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.3 \cdot 0.1 + 0.35 \cdot 0.9 = 0.03 + 0.315 = 0.345 \]

So,

\[ P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.345} \approx 0.087 \]

Finally, presenting the calculated probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.37,
  "business administration": 0.087
}
