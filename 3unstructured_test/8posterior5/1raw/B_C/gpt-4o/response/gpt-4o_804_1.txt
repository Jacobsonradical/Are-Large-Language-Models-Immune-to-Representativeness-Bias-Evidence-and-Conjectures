To apply Bayes' rule, we need to estimate certain probabilities. Here's a structured approach:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field (computer science or business administration).
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is enrolled in the specific field.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is not enrolled in the specific field.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we only need to compare the probabilities for the provided fields, we don't need the exact value of \( P(E) \), as it will be common to both.

### For Computer Science:

1. **P(H) (Prior Probability)**: Computer science is a popular graduate field, let's assume a moderate prior probability: \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.2 \).

2. **P(E|H) (Likelihood)**: Given E's characteristics (genuine curiosity about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, high intelligence, appreciation for hard work), a Computer Science student could fit some of these attributes, especially the high intelligence and puzzle-solving part. Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.4 \).

3. **P(E|¬H) (Likelihood for Not Computer Science)**: This is trickier, but we can assume the likelihood of the personality sketch fitting another unspecified field is moderate: \( P(E|¬H_{CS}) = 0.3 \).

### For Business Administration:

1. **P(H) (Prior Probability)**: Business administration is also a common graduate field, so we'll also assume a moderate prior probability: \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.2 \).

2. **P(E|H) (Likelihood)**: The personality traits (warm heart, strong empathy) might fit partially to someone in business administration, but others (like solving puzzles) fit less well. Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.2 \).

3. **P(E|¬H) (Likelihood for Not Business Administration)**: Similarly, the likelihood of the personality sketch fitting another unspecified field is moderate: \( P(E|¬H_{BA}) = 0.3 \).

Now, we apply Bayes’ rule:

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.08}{P(E)} \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.04}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both, we can compare the results directly:

Therefore:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.08,
  "business administration": 0.04
}
```
