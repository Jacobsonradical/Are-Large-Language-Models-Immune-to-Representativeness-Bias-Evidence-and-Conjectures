Let's break down the probabilities for both computer science and business administration:

1. **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field without any additional information. This probability should take into account general popularity and the number of graduate students in each of these fields. Since we don't have exact statistics, let's assume the following rough prior probabilities:
   - P(computer science): ~0.2 (Computer Science is a very popular field with many graduate students.)
   - P(business administration): ~0.1 (Business Administration is also a common field but less so than Computer Science among those with Adam's profile.)

2. **P(E|H):** The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is in a particular field. Based on his interests and traits:
   - Computer science students often have a strong understanding of abstract concepts and enjoy solving puzzles, but they are less commonly noted for strong empathy and a love for nature. P(E|computer science): ~0.5
   - Business administration students often have appreciation for hard work and dedication, but they typically don't align strongly with interests in nature and puzzles. P(E|business administration): ~0.3

3. **P(E|¬H):** The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in the particular fields. This should cover all other fields he could be in:
   - Assuming the behavioral traits better fit humanities, social sciences, and perhaps some aspects of biological sciences more than computer science or business administration:
     - P(E|¬computer science): ~0.6
     - P(E|¬business administration): ~0.7

4. **P(H|E):** The posterior probability using Bayes’ rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have P(E) directly, we can normalize over the given fields for simplicity since we do not exhaust all possibilities:
\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's compute them now:

- For Computer Science:
  \[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.5 \cdot 0.2 + 0.6 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.1}{0.1 + 0.48} = \frac{0.1}{0.58} \approx 0.172 \]
  
- For Business Administration:
  \[  P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.3 \cdot 0.1 + 0.7 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.63} = \frac{0.03}{0.66} \approx 0.045 \]


Now, expressing this information in the requested format:
