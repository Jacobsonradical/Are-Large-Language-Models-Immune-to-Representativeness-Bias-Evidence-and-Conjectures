To answer this question, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Assess Prior Probabilities (P(H))**: Estimate the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in each field before considering the personality sketch.
2. **Assess the Likelihood (P(E|H))**: Estimate how consistent the personality sketch is with someone enrolled in each field.
3. **Assess the Likelihood of the Complement (P(E|¬H))**: Estimate how consistent the personality sketch is with someone not enrolled in each field.
4. **Apply Bayes' Rule** to compute the posterior probability (P(H|E)).

### Assess Prior Probabilities (P(H))
Let's assume the prior distribution of students over these two fields to be equal, as we don't have any other prior information:
- P(computer science) = 0.5
- P(business administration) = 0.5

### Assess the Likelihood (P(E|H))

**Computer Science:**
- Quiet, likes solving puzzles—common traits among computer science students.
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts—common and beneficial in the field.
- Empathy and love for animals don’t directly align with computer science but don’t exclude it either.

Given these factors, let's estimate:
- P(E|computer science) = 0.7 (reflecting a reasonable match, though not perfect).

**Business Administration:**
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication—relevant for business administration.
- Empathy and warm-hearted nature—traits valuable for leadership and management roles.
- Quiet and puzzle-solving nature—less directly connected to the field.
- Love for animals—neutral with respect to business administration.

Given these factors, let's estimate:
- P(E|business administration) = 0.3 (reflecting a less direct match).

### Assess the Likelihood of the Complement (P(E|¬H))

To estimate P(E|¬H) for each field, consider the likelihood of the personality traits among students not in the field.

**Computer Science:**
- Assume students not in computer science would have a mix of traits.
- Given the specificity of the traits (puzzles, high intelligence, abstract thinking), the personality sketch might be less likely in non-CS fields.

Let's estimate:
- P(E|¬computer science) = 0.4

**Business Administration:**
- With diverse student backgrounds, the personality sketch might still appear in non-business fields.
- Traits like empathy, appreciation of dedication, and love for animals can be found broadly.

Let's estimate:
- P(E|¬business administration) = 0.6

### Apply Bayes' Rule
For **computer science**:
\[ P(computer science|E) = \frac{P(E|computer science) \cdot P(computer science)}{P(E)} \]
We need to find P(E). Combining both scenarios, P(E) is a mixture based on priors:
\[ P(E) = P(E|computer science) \cdot P(computer science) + P(E|¬computer science) \cdot P(¬computer science) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \times 0.5) + (0.4 \times 0.5) = 0.35 + 0.2 = 0.55 \]

Applying Bayes' rule:
\[ P(computer science|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.5}{0.55} \approx 0.636 \]

For **business administration**:
\[ P(business administration|E) = \frac{P(E|business administration) \cdot P(business administration)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|business administration) \cdot P(business administration) + P(E|¬business administration) \cdot P(¬business administration) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.3 \times 0.5) + (0.6 \times 0.5) = 0.15 + 0.3 = 0.45 \]

Applying Bayes' rule:
\[ P(business administration|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.5}{0.45} \approx 0.333 \]
