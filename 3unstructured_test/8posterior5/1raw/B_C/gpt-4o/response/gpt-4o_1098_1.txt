First, let's break down the components required for Bayes' rule:

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For each field, we'll calculate \( P(H|E) \) based on our estimates of \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). I'll provide the calculations for both business administration and computer science.

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: Let's assume a rough estimate that the probability of randomly selecting a graduate student in business administration is moderate, about 0.15 (15%).
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in business administration might be low, as the sketch emphasizes curiosity about nature, love for animals, and understanding of abstract concepts, which are not strongly associated with business administration. Let's set this at 0.05.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch among all other fields might be higher due to the reasons listed above. Let's set this to 0.25.
4. **P(E)**: This can be approximated using the law of total probability, but since we donâ€™t need an exact value, we'll use the ratio instead. 

### Computer Science

1. **P(H)**: Let's assume a moderate probability of randomly selecting a graduate student in computer science, about 0.20 (20%).
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is in computer science is likely higher than business administration because the sketch aligns well with attributes (solving puzzles, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts) common in this field. Let's set this at 0.3.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Similar to the above, set this at 0.25.
4. **P(E)**: Again, this will be approximated using the law of total probability, primarily concerned with the ratios.

### Calculations for Bayes' Rule
- For Business Administration:
  \[
  P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
  \approx \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.15}{0.25} = 0.03
  \]

- For Computer Science:
  \[
  P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
  \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.25} = 0.24
  \]

Based on these calculations, the posterior probabilities are:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.03,
  "computer science": 0.24
}
