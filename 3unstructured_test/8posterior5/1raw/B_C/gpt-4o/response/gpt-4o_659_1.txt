To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study given Adam's personality sketch using Bayes' rule, we need to assess the prior probability \( P(H) \), and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Given the information, here are some reasonable estimates based on the personality sketch:

1. **Business Administration (H = business administration)**
   - **Prior Probability (\( P(H) \))**: Business administration is a fairly common graduate field, so let's assign a moderate prior probability.
     \[ P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.2 \]
   - **Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \))**: Based on Adam's personality sketch, the probability that a student in business administration matches the description is relatively low (it’s not typically associated with strong empathy, curiosity about nature, and love for animals).
     \[ P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1 \]
   - **Likelihood (\( P(E|\neg H) \))**: The probability that Adam’s characteristics match the description of students in other fields (not including business administration) is higher, given that fields like biology, environmental science, and psychology may attract people with his personality traits.
     \[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.5 \]

   Using Bayes' rule:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{BA}})}
   \]
   \[
   P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.4} = \frac{0.02}{0.42} \approx 0.048
   \]

2. **Computer Science (H = computer science)**
   - **Prior Probability (\( P(H) \))**: Computer science is also a popular graduate field, so let’s assign a similar moderate prior probability.
     \[ P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.2 \]
   - **Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \))**: Based on Adam’s personality, the probability that a computer science student matches the description is higher than business administration, but not extremely high (Adam enjoys solving puzzles and abstract concepts, which is common in computer science, but his love for nature and animals may be less common).
     \[ P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.3 \]
   - **Likelihood (\( P(E|\neg H) \))**: The probability that Adam’s characteristics match the description of students in other fields, which might be more aligned with his nature-loving and empathetic traits.
     \[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.5 \]

   Using Bayes' rule:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{CS}})}
   \]
   \[
   P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.4} = \frac{0.06}{0.46} \approx 0.130
   \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities, \( P(H|E) \), are approximately:

{
  "business administration": 0.048,
  "computer science": 0.130
}
