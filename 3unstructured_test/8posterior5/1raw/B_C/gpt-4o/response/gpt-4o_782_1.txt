To compute \( P(H|E) \) for both "business administration" and "computer science" fields using Bayes' Rule, we need to estimate the following probabilities for each field:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch fits if he were enrolled in the field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch fits if he were not enrolled in the field.

Let's break this down for the two fields: 

1. **Business Administration**
   - \( P(H) \): Business Administration is a common field for graduate studies, but Adam's personality traits do not strongly align with typical characteristics associated with business administration students (e.g., leadership, extroversion, emphasis on business strategy). Let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam’s personality traits suggest a lower probability that he would be in this field because his traits align more with introspective, research-oriented fields. Let’s assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): If Adam were not in business administration, he might more likely be in a field that matches his personality traits better. Assuming an average distribution among other fields, we might set \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.7 \).

2. **Computer Science**
   - \( P(H) \): Computer Science is a popular graduate field that requires high intelligence and abstract thinking, which fits Adam's profile well. Let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.15 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's traits strongly align with those typical of computer science students (e.g., interest in solving puzzles, high intelligence, introversion). Let’s assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): If Adam were not in computer science, he might still be in another field that fits his personality. Thus, \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

For **business administration**:
\[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.7 \cdot 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.63 = 0.65 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.65} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.031 \]

For **computer science**:
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.5 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.425 = 0.545 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.545} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.22 \]

So, the resulting probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.031,
  "computer science": 0.22
}
```
