To solve this, let's break down the problem as requested. We'll first judge the probabilities:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam enrolling in a particular field, without knowing anything about his personality sketch. Because graduate students can be in many fields, we'll assume P(H) is relatively low but not zero.

2. **P(E \| H)**: The probability of observing Adam's characteristics given that he is in that field. 

3. **P(E \| \neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's characteristics given that he is not in that field.

Then, we use Bayes' rule to determine P(H \| E), the updated probability of Adam being in that field given his personality sketch.

Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Let's assume some reasonable values for these probabilities given the traits mentioned in Adam's personality sketch.

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)**: Let’s assume 0.1 for business administration (as there are many fields he could be in).
2. **P(E \| H)**: Given his characteristics, the probability of a business administration student being curious about nature and plants, solving puzzles, warm-hearted, empathetic, loving animals, etc., might be low. Let's say 0.1.
3. **P(E \| \neg H)**: The probability of seeing these traits in any field other than business administration could be higher. Let's assume 0.5 for a general mix of other fields.

\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.1 * 0.1}{(0.1 * 0.1) + (0.5 * 0.9)} = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.45} = \frac{0.01}{0.46} \approx 0.0217 \]

### Computer Science
1. **P(H)**: Assume 0.15 for computer science, slightly higher given the analytical and abstract understanding (but still low due to many fields).
2. **P(E \| H)**: A computer science student might display his traits more commonly, considering his intelligence, problem-solving, and abstract thinking. Let’s say 0.6.
3. **P(E \| \neg H)**: For fields other than computer science, assuming similar reasons as above, we could say 0.5.

\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.6 * 0.15}{(0.6 * 0.15) + (0.5 * 0.85)} = \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.425} = \frac{0.09}{0.515} \approx 0.1748 \]

So, the computed probabilities using Bayes' rule are the following:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0217,
  "computer science": 0.1748
}
```

These values indicate that, based on Adam's personality sketch, it's more likely that he was enrolled in computer science rather than business administration.
