Sure, let's break down how to apply Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis, given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam.

### Bayes' Rule
The formula for Bayes' rule is:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

### Assumptions
We'll need to make some assumptions to evaluate these probabilities.

1. **Prior probabilities \( P(H) \):**
   Without specific data, let's assume that Adam, as a graduate student in 2021, is equally likely to be in each field out of a broad range of common graduate fields. To keep it simple, suppose there are 10 common fields of study.
   \[ P(H = \text{business administration}) = \frac{1}{10} = 0.1 \]
   \[ P(H = \text{computer science}) = \frac{1}{10} = 0.1 \]
   
2. **Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \):**
   - For **business administration**, the traits such as curiosity about nature, enjoyment of puzzles, strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work are less directly relevant. Let's assign a lower value.
     \[ P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.2 \]
   
   - For **computer science**, the enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence are highly relevant. Thus, this discipline aligns better with Adam's described personality.
     \[ P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.8 \]
   
3. **Complementary evidence \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   Here, we consider the probability of Adam's personality given he is not in the specified field. This would be an average likelihood if he were in any other field.
   
   To simplify, if \( P(E|\neg H) \) for all other fields averages out, and taking into account fields like biology, environmental science, psychology which might also fit his personality sketch:
   \[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.5 \]
   \[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.5 \]
   
### Calculation
Calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For **business administration**:
\[ P(E) = 0.2 \times 0.1 + 0.5 \times 0.9 = 0.02 + 0.45 = 0.47 \]

For **computer science**:
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \times 0.1 + 0.5 \times 0.9 = 0.08 + 0.45 = 0.53 \]

Finally, compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule:

For **business administration**:
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{0.47} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.47} \approx 0.0426 \]

For **computer science**:
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.53} \approx \frac{0.08}{0.53} \approx 0.1509 \]

### Answer in Required Format

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0426,
  "computer science": 0.1509
}
```
These values denote the probabilities of Adam being enrolled in either business administration or computer science, given his personality sketch.
