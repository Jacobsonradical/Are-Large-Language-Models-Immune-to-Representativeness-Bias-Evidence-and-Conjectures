To evaluate the probability that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or business administration given his personality sketch \( E \), we'll use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the limited information, we'll assume certain probabilities, but please note these are estimates based on typical traits and not specific data.

### Computer Science:
1. **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
   - Given that many graduate students in the U.S. choose computer science, let's assume \( P(\text{H}_{CS}) = 0.2 \).

2. **P(E|H):** The probability of observing Adam's personality given he is in computer science.
   - High intelligence, interest in puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts are common in computer science.
   - Empathy, love for nature and animals are less common indicators for computer science but not extreme exclusions.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|\text{H}_{CS}) = 0.6 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of observing Adam's personality if he is not in computer science.
   - These traits could apply to various other fields quite broadly. Assume \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.4 \).

### Business Administration:
1. **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
   - Business administration is also a popular graduate field, so let's assume \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.15 \).

2. **P(E|H):** The probability of observing Adam's personality given he is in business administration.
   - Empathy, appreciation for hard work, and high intelligence are relevant, less so curiosity about nature or solving puzzles, but not exclusive.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.4 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of observing Adam's personality if he is not in business administration.
   - These traits are relatively common across many fields, assume \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.4 \).

### Calculations using Bayes' Rule:

For **computer science**:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \]

Assume \( P(E) \) is similar for all fields given lack of specific data. We normalize values later:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx 0.12/P(E) \]

For **business administration**:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \approx \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \approx 0.06/P(E) \]

Removing \( P(E) \) for direct comparison and normalization:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx 0.12 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \approx 0.06 \]

### Normalization (total must add to 1 for these specific fields):
Sum = 0.12 + 0.06 = 0.18

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.18} \approx 0.67 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.18} \approx 0.33 \]

Therefore, the probabilities in the required format are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.67,
  "business administration": 0.33
}
```
