In order to compute \(P(H|E)\) for both fields, we need to use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's denote:
- \(P(H_{cs})\) as the prior probability that Adam was in computer science.
- \(P(H_{ba})\) as the prior probability that Adam was in business administration.
- \(P(E|H_{cs})\) as the likelihood of observing Adam's personality if he was in computer science.
- \(P(E|H_{ba})\) as the likelihood of observing Adam's personality if he was in business administration.
- \(P(E|\neg H_{cs})\) as the likelihood of observing Adam's personality if he was not in computer science.
- \(P(E|\neg H_{ba})\) as the likelihood of observing Adam's personality if he was not in business administration.

### Given Information
- Adam is curious about nature and has a deep love for animals, which may not be directly related to computer science or business administration.
- Adam has high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts, suggesting he could be suited for fields requiring strong analytical skills (e.g., computer science).
- Adam has strong empathy and a warm heart, which might be valued in people-oriented fields (e.g., business administration).

### Step 1: Estimate the values for P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|\neg H)

While we do not have exact numbers, we can provide qualitative reasoning:

**Computer Science (H_{cs}):**
- \(P(H_{cs}) =\) Moderate (since it's a common graduate field, but not specifically related to nature or animals)
- \(P(E|H_{cs}) =\) Moderate to High (intelligence and abstract thinking fit well with computer science)
- \(P(E|\neg H_{cs}) =\) Moderate (since many other fields also require intelligence and analytical skills)

**Business Administration (H_{ba}):**
- \(P(H_{ba}) =\) Moderate (again, it's a common field, but may not align directly with his personality sketch related to nature)
- \(P(E|H_{ba}) =\) Moderate (empathy and understanding hard work and dedication aligns with business administration)
- \(P(E|\neg H_{ba}) =\) Moderate (other fields also value empathy and dedication)

### Step 2: Compute P(H|E) using Bayes' Rule

Letâ€™s make educated guesses for the priors and likelihoods:

**Computer Science:**
- \(P(H_{cs}) = 0.2\)
- \(P(E|H_{cs}) = 0.6\)
- \(P(E|\neg H_{cs}) = 0.4\)

\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{cs})P(H_{cs})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H_{cs})P(H_{cs}) + P(E|\neg H_{cs})(1 - P(H_{cs})) \):

\[ P(E) = 0.6 \times 0.2 + 0.4 \times 0.8 = 0.12 + 0.32 = 0.44 \]

So:

\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.44} \approx 0.27 \]

**Business Administration:**
- \(P(H_{ba}) = 0.2\)
- \(P(E|H_{ba}) = 0.5\)
- \(P(E|\neg H_{ba}) = 0.4\)

\[ P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{ba})P(H_{ba})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{0.5 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H_{ba})P(H_{ba}) + P(E|\neg H_{ba})(1 - P(H_{ba})) \):

\[ P(E) = 0.5 \times 0.2 + 0.4 \times 0.8 = 0.1 + 0.32 = 0.42 \]

So:

\[ P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.42} \approx 0.24 \]

### Final Computation

The probabilities, while approximations, suggest:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.27,
  "business administration": 0.24
}
```
Please note that these values are rough estimates based on qualitative assessment, and the actual probabilities can vary based on more specific and empirical data.
