To use Bayes' theorem to compute \( P(H|E) \), we'll follow these steps:

1. Estimate \( P(H) \), the prior probability that Adam is in a given field.
2. Estimate \( P(E|H) \), the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is in that field.
3. Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \), the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in that field.
4. Calculate \( P(E) \), the total probability of Adam's personality sketch.

For simplicity, let's assume we don't have detailed prior information about the distribution of graduate students across fields, so we assume \( P(H) \) to be equal for simplicity. This isn't realistic but helps illustrate the methodology. Note that the actual priors would depend on many factors including specific institutional data.

### Computer Science
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
   - Let's assume \( P(\text{CS}) = 0.2 \) since it's a highly popular field.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   - Adam is described as having a high intelligence and good at solving puzzles, which align well with attributes beneficial for computer science.
   - Given his nature curiosity and interest in abstract concepts, we could say \( P(E|\text{CS}) = 0.7 \).

3. **P(E|¬H):**
   - This is more challenging and should represent the personality sketch across all other fields. Assuming diverse fields, we might estimate it as \( P(E|\neg \text{CS}) = 0.2 \).

Let's apply Bayes' rule for computer science:

\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(E) = P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(E|\neg \text{CS}) \cdot P(\neg \text{CS}) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.7 \cdot 0.2 + 0.2 \cdot 0.8 \]

\[ P(E) = 0.14 + 0.16 = 0.3 \]

\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.3} = 0.4667 \]

### Business Administration
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
   - Let's assume \( P(\text{BA}) = 0.15 \) since business administration is also a popular field but not as much as CS in some contexts.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   - Business administration typically requires understanding of hard work and dedication, but not necessarily the strong empathy and love for animals described.
   - Let's estimate \( P(E|\text{BA}) = 0.3 \).

3. **P(E|¬H):**
   - Assuming the distribution here to be somehow complementary of the above but capturing the sketch,
   - Let’s assume \( P(E|\neg \text{BA}) = 0.25 \).

Now apply Bayes' rule for business administration:

\[ P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{BA}) \cdot P(\text{BA})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(E) = P(E|\text{BA}) \cdot P(\text{BA}) + P(E|\neg \text{BA}) \cdot P(\neg \text{BA}) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.3 \cdot 0.15 + 0.25 \cdot 0.85 \]

\[ P(E) = 0.045 + 0.2125 = 0.2575 \]

\[ P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.15}{0.2575} = 0.1746 \]

Combining these results, the probabilities can be expressed as:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4667,
  "business administration": 0.1746
}
```

Note that these are estimated values and subject to change based on more accurate priors and likelihoods derived from real-world data.
