To provide a thorough analysis, I will break down the probabilities for each field and then use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \) for both computer science and business administration fields.

Let's denote:
- \( P(H_{cs}) \) as the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(H_{ba}) \) as the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|H_{cs}) \) as the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given that he was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H_{ba}) \) as the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given that he was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{cs}) \) as the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given that he was not enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{ba}) \) as the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given that he was not enrolled in business administration.

### Estimating the Probabilities

1. **P(H_{cs})**: 
   Graduate students in computer science fields are quite common, so we might assign a moderate prior probability. Assume \( P(H_{cs}) = 0.2 \).
   
2. **P(H_{ba})**:
   Graduate students in business administration are also common, so we might assign a similar prior probability as computer science. Assume \( P(H_{ba}) = 0.2 \).

3. **P(E|H_{cs})**:
   Given Adam's personality traits, such as high intelligence, love for solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts, he fits the profile of a computer science student quite well. So we might assign a high value. Assume \( P(E|H_{cs}) = 0.7 \).

4. **P(E|H_{ba})**:
   While empathy and understanding hard work and dedication can be valuable traits in business administration, the fit is not as strong as with computer science. Assume \( P(E|H_{ba}) = 0.4 \).

5. **P(E|\neg H_{cs})**:
   This is the probability of observing Adam's personality if he is not a computer science student. Given many fields can have intelligent and empathetic students, we'll assign a moderate value. Assume \( P(E|\neg H_{cs}) = 0.5 \).

6. **P(E|\neg H_{ba})**:
   Similarly, many fields can fit Adam's personality, so weâ€™ll assign a moderate value. Assume \( P(E|\neg H_{ba}) = 0.5 \).

Now, using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

### Calculations

1. **For Computer Science:**

\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs})}{P(E)} \]

First, calculate \( P(E) \) for computer science:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs}) + P(E|\neg H_{cs}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{cs})) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.7 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.14 + 0.4 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.54 \]

Now compute \( P(H_{cs}|E) \):
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.54} \]
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{0.14}{0.54} \]
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) \approx 0.259 \]

2. **For Business Administration:**

\[ P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{ba}) \cdot P(H_{ba})}{P(E)} \]

First, calculate \( P(E) \) for business administration:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{ba}) \cdot P(H_{ba}) + P(E|\neg H_{ba}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{ba})) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.4 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.48 \]

Now compute \( P(H_{ba}|E) \):
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.48} \]
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.48} \]
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) \approx 0.167 \]
