To evaluate the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in that particular field.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields, it serves as a normalization factor and can be omitted when comparing probabilities between the fields. We'll focus on the relative likelihoods instead.

### Assumptions
To estimate these probabilities with a degree of uncertainty:

- \( P(H) \): We'll assume these are the general probabilities of students enrolling in either Computer Science or Business Administration at the graduate level in the U.S.
- \( P(E|H) \): We need to judge how well Adam's personality sketch fits each field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given we are primarily interested in a relative comparison, each likelihood is inversely proportional to the fit with the field.

### Probability Evaluation

1. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) \) for Computer Science: Let's assume a moderate prior probability, given the popularity of the field (e.g., 0.15).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with Computer Science, plus the quiet and puzzle-solving nature fits. He might have less direct inclination towards nature and animals, but some computer scientists are interdisciplinary (maybe 0.60).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam's personality if he wasn't in Computer Science might be lower, given other fields could fit better with his empathy and love of nature (e.g., 0.50).

2. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \) for Business Administration: A slightly lower prior probability, considering the general interest distribution (e.g., 0.10).
   - \( P(E|H) \): His empathy and understanding of hard work fit well with business administration. However, curiosity about nature, animals, and abstract concepts might not align as closely (maybe 0.30).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Higher, as there could be many other fields fitting his empathy and intelligence better (e.g., 0.70).

### Bayes' Rule Calculation
For each field:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

1. **Computer Science**:
   \[
   P(H|E) \propto 0.60 \cdot 0.15 = 0.09
   \]

2. **Business Administration**:
   \[
   P(H|E) \propto 0.30 \cdot 0.10 = 0.03
   \]

### Normalizing:
Although not necessary to sum to 1 (as there are other fields), let's give relative values:

\[
\text{{Normalization factor}} = 0.09 + 0.03 = 0.12
\]

Thus, we compute:
\[
P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.12} \approx 0.75
\]
\[
P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.12} \approx 0.25
\]

### Final Answer:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.25
}
