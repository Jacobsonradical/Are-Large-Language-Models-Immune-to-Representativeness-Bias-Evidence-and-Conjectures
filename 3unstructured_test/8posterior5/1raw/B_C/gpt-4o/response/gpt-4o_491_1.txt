To determine the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch \( E \), we can use Bayes' theorem, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis \( \neg H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence \( E \).

Since \( P(E) \) remains the same for all fields, we can ignore it for relative comparisons.

Let's consider the fields "business administration" and "computer science" for Adam based on his personality sketch.

### Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \):

- Business administration and computer science are common graduate fields, but let's assume they have different prior probabilities:

  - \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \): Likely less common among students with Adam's characteristics, assume \( 0.2 \).
  - \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) \): More common among students with high intelligence and appreciation for abstract concepts, assume \( 0.3 \) .

### Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \):

- For "business administration":
  - \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \): Lower likelihood as the characteristics of nature curiosity, love for animals, and enjoyment of puzzles don't align strongly. Assume \( 0.2 \).
- For "computer science":
  - \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \): Higher likelihood given Adam's intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles. Assume \( 0.7 \).

### Complement Likelihoods \( P(E|\neg H) \):

- Generally, \( P(E|\neg H) \) would reflect the typical profile not matching:
  - For business administration: Assume \( 0.3 \) as Adam's profile less matches typical profiles.
  - For computer science: Assume \( 0.5 \) as Adam's profile aligns closer, but not exclusively.

### Posterior Probabilities with Bayes' Rule:

- "business administration":
  - \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}})}{P(E)} \)
  - Since \( P(E) \) equals for comparisons, tangible form is enough.
  - \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = 0.2 \times 0.2/constant \)

- "computer science":
  - \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}})}{P(E)} \)
  - Tangible form: \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = 0.7 \times 0.3/constant \)

Post normalization:

\[
\text{Sum} = (0.2 \times 0.2) + (0.7 \times 0.3) = 0.04 + 0.21 = 0.25
\]
- Normalized values provide ratio:

\[
P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.25} = 0.16
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{0.21}{0.25} = 0.84
\]

## Final Output:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.16,
  "computer science": 0.84
}
```

These represent high probability terms Adam's personality most likely fitting into computer science over business administration.
