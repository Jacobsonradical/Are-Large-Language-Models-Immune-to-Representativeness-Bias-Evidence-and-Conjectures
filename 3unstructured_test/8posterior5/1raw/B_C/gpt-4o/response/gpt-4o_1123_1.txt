To compute the values for \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we will use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since \( P(E) \) is a common denominator for both computations and we only need the relative probabilities, we can compare the numerators directly:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

We need to initialize values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Here's how we proceed with each step:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The prior belief that Adam might be in a certain field.
2. **Likelihood Probability \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability that Adam's personality sketch fits a student in that field.
3. **Complement Probability \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability that someone not in the field fits Adam's personality sketch.

### Business Administration

- **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Business administration is a common field but given Adam's profile, we'll set this to a lower value.
  \[ P(\text{Business Administration}) = 0.1 \]
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The profile suggests strong empathy, appreciation for hard work, and intelligence which could fit a business student, but his deep love for nature and animals doesn't match typical business traits.
  \[ P(E|\text{Business Administration}) = 0.2 \]
- **Complement \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Assume this is the average case for everyone else excluding business, we guess a value.
  \[ P(E|\neg \text{Business Administration}) = 0.5 \]

### Computer Science

- **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Computer science is quite common for a high intelligence student who likes solving puzzles.
  \[ P(\text{Computer Science}) = 0.3 \]
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The profile (solving puzzles, intelligence, understanding abstract concepts) is a good match.
  \[ P(E|\text{Computer Science}) = 0.8 \]
- **Complement \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Assume this is lower for those not fitting the profile of computer science.
  \[ P(E|\neg \text{Computer Science}) = 0.4 \]

### Calculation

For Business Administration:
\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) \propto P(E|\text{Business Administration}) \cdot P(\text{Business Administration}) \]
\[ \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.1 = 0.02 \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) \propto P(E|\text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science}) \]
\[ \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \]

We normalize these (optional, but often helpful for comparison):

\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.24} = \frac{0.02}{0.26} \approx 0.077 \]
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.24}{0.02 + 0.24} = \frac{0.24}{0.26} \approx 0.923 \]

Thus, the results are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.077,
  "computer science": 0.923
}
