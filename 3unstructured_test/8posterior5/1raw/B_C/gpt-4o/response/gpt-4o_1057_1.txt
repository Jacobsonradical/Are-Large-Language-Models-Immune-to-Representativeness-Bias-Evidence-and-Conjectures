To apply Bayes' rule, we need to determine the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood under the null hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H) \). Then, we can calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Since we are given two hypotheses \( H \) (business administration and computer science), we will evaluate each one independently.

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**
   - Let's assume that the likelihood of a graduate student being in business administration is 20%. So, \( P(H_{\text{business}}) = 0.2 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**
   - Based on the description of Adam, he seems less likely to be a business administration student, as his interests are more aligned with nature, puzzles, and animals.
   - Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \) as 0.1.

3. **Likelihood under the null hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H) \)**
   - The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in business administration. If we assume there are many other fields, we can estimate it to be moderately higher.
   - We estimate \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}}) \) as 0.5.

### Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**
   - Let's assume that the likelihood of a graduate student being in computer science is 30%. So, \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.3 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which aligns well with a computer science background.
   - Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \) as 0.7.

3. **Likelihood under the null hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H) \)**
   - The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in computer science. We can estimate it to be moderately lower because other fields might not fit as well as computer science does.
   - We estimate \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}}) \) as 0.3.

### Calculation

Now, we apply Bayes' rule.

1. **Business Administration**:
   \[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{business}}) \]
   \[ P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.8 = 0.02 + 0.4 = 0.42 \]
   \[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}})}{P(E)} \]
   \[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.42} \approx 0.048 \]

2. **Computer Science**:
   \[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{cs}}) \]
   \[ P(E) = 0.7 \cdot 0.3 + 0.3 \cdot 0.7 = 0.21 + 0.21 = 0.42 \]
   \[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}})}{P(E)} \]
   \[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.3}{0.42} \approx 0.5 \]

### Final probabilities

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.048,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```
The probabilities indicate that given Adam's personality sketch, it is substantially more likely that he was enrolled in computer science rather than business administration.
