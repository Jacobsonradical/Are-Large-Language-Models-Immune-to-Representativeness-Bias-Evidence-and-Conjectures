To begin, let's use Bayes' Theorem to compute the posterior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in either business administration or computer science, given his personality sketch (E).

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(H|E)\) is the probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the probability of Adam having the personality sketch if he's enrolled in that field.
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field without any additional information.
- \(P(E)\) is the overall probability of Adam having the personality sketch.

For both fields, let's first set our prior probabilities \(P(H)\). Given that there are many fields Adam could be in, we'll use some reasonable assumptions without needing an exhaustive list.

Assume:
\[ P(\text{business administration}) = 0.1 \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}) = 0.1 \]

Next, let's assess \(P(E|H)\) â€“ the likelihood of Adam having the personality sketch given enrollment in each field.

Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and interest in abstract concepts:
- For business administration, this seems less aligned, but not impossible. So, we'll assume: 
\[ P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.2 \]
- For computer science, his interest in puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns better. So:
\[ P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.3 \]

Additionally, we need \( P(E|\neg H) \), the probability of the personality sketch given he is not in that specific field.
We'd generally expect it to be spread over many other fields, often similar to the given field probabilities.

For an approximation:
\[ P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) = 0.3 \]
\[ P(E|\neg \text{computer science}) = 0.25 \]

Lastly, calculate \(P(H|E)\):
\[
\begin{aligned}
P(\text{business administration}|E) &= \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} \\
&= \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{P(E)} 
\end{aligned}
\]
\[
\begin{aligned}
P(\text{computer science}|E) &= \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} \\
&= \frac{0.3 \times 0.1}{P(E)} 
\end{aligned}
\]

As we do not have \(P(E)\) outright, we can use a relative approach where we normalize later for comparative evaluation:

\[
\begin{aligned}
P(\text{business administration}|E) &= \frac{0.02}{P(E')} \\
P(\text{computer science}|E) &= \frac{0.03}{P(E')}
\end{aligned}
\]

Normalization is key:
\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.03 + ...} &= \frac{0.02}{relative\_normalizer} \\
\frac{0.03}{0.02 + 0.03 + ...} &= \frac{0.03}{relative\_normalizer}
\end{aligned}
\]

Thus we have:

{
  "business administration": "0.4 (normalized)",
  "computer science": "0.6 (normalized)"
}

This indicates Adam's personality is more aligned with computer science than business administration, though both are considered.
