To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or computer science given the personality sketch \(E\), we can apply Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch \(E\).

Assumptions: 

1. Without more data, let's assume that the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for business administration and computer science are equally likely among the set of fields we're considering.
   
2. We'll make subjective estimates of \( P(E|H) \) based on the given personality sketch and compare how well each field matches Adam's characteristics.

Let's break it down:

### Business Administration

- **\(P(H)\)**: Let's assume there are many fields Adam could be in. Assign a prior of \( 0.1 \) for business administration.
- **\(P(E|H)\)**: Adam's interests and personality (love for nature, empathy, puzzles, etc.) do not strongly align with the typical profile of a business administration student. Let's estimate \(0.05\).
- **\(P(E|\neg H)\)**: Suppose there are many fields better matched to Adam's characteristics than business administration. Let this probability be estimated at \(0.1\).

### Computer Science

- **\(P(H)\)**: Assign a prior of \( 0.1 \) for computer science.
- **\(P(E|H)\)**: Adamâ€™s high intelligence, interest in puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts fit well with computer science. Let's estimate \(0.5\).
- **\(P(E|\neg H)\)**: Suppose fields other than computer science must account for Adam's characteristics. Let this probability be estimated at \(0.15\).

Applying Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E)_{Business} = \frac{P(E|H)_{Business} \cdot P(H)_{Business}}{P(E)} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)}
\]

\[
P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{P(E|H)_{CS} \cdot P(H)_{CS}}{P(E)} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)}
\]

Since we need \( P(E) \) to normalize, we pay attention only to relative probabilities:

\[
P(H|E)_{Business} \propto 0.05 \cdot 0.1 = 0.005
\]

\[
P(H|E)_{CS} \propto 0.5 \cdot 0.1 = 0.05
\]

Given these relative values, the actual normalized probabilities would still favor computer science significantly more than business administration, but exact values require normalization which is not the final step here.

Thus, our preliminary guess without full normalization:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.005,
  "computer science": 0.05
}
```

These values are consistent with the assumptions and the rough likelihoods given the nature of Adam's interests and aptitudes reflected in his personality sketch.
