Certainly! Let's evaluate the probabilities step by step for each field.

### Computer Science

1. **P(H for Computer Science)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Computer Science.
   - Given the popularity and versatility of Computer Science, let's assume \(P(H)\) is moderately high but not too high. Say \(P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.2\).

2. **P(E|H for Computer Science)**: The probability of Adam having his personality traits given that he is in Computer Science.
   - Since Adam has high intelligence and can understand abstract concepts, this fits well with Computer Science. However, his love for nature and animals may not be strongly related. Thus, let's set \(P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.5\).

3. **P(E|\neg H for Computer Science)**: The probability of Adam having his personality traits given that he is not in Computer Science.
   - Given that there are many fields of study (biological sciences, environmental science, etc.) that fit his personality better, we set this probability higher. \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.7\).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \]

Since \(P(E)\) is the same for all fields and only the relative scale matters for our purposes:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 \]

### Business Administration

1. **P(H for Business Administration)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration.
   - Given the broad appeal but less direct alignment with his specific traits, let's assume \(P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.15\).

2. **P(E|H for Business Administration)**: The probability of Adam having his personality traits given that he is in Business Administration.
   - Business Administration typically does not align strongly with someone who has a deep empathy for animals or enjoys nature. As such, this is likely lower. \(P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.2\).

3. **P(E|\neg H for Business Administration)**: The probability of Adam having his personality traits given that he is not in Business Administration.
   - Many other fields could better fit his traits. Let's set this to the same baseline \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.7\).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \propto 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03 \]

Putting it all together:

{
  "computer science": 0.1,
  "business administration": 0.03
}
