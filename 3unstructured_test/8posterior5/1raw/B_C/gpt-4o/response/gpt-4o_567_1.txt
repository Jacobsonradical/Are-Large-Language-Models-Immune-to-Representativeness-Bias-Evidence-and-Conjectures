To apply Bayes’ theorem in this context, we need to estimate the probabilities as requested:

**P(H): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.**

Since we don't have exact statistics, we have to make some reasonable assumptions. Let's assume probabilities based on the relative popularity of these graduate fields:

- \[P(H_{\text{CS}})\] (Probability that Adam is in computer science) = 0.2
- \[P(H_{\text{BA}})\] (Probability that Adam is in business administration) = 0.15

These are arbitrary but reasonable estimates given the popularity of these fields.

**P(E|H): The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is in that specific field.**

- \[P(E|H_{\text{CS}})\] = 0.4. Adam’s profile partially fits a computer science graduate (solving puzzles, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts).
- \[P(E|H_{\text{BA}})\] = 0.1. Adam’s profile does not fit as well with business administration, given his deep love for nature and animals, which is less common.

**P(E|\neg H): The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in that specific field.**

We will assume the average likelihoods for all fields of study, noting that many of Adam's characteristics are fairly common across different fields of study.

- \[P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}})\] = 0.2
- \[P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}})\] = 0.2

**Bayes' Rule:**

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(H) \cdot P(E|H)}{P(E)} = \frac{P(H) \cdot P(E|H)}{ P(H) \cdot P(E|H) + P(\neg H) \cdot P(E|\neg H)} \]

We will now compute \(P(H|E)\) for each field:

**Computer Science:**

\[ 
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(E|H_{\text{CS}})}{P(H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) + P(\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}})} 
\]

\[ 
= \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.4}{0.2 \cdot 0.4 + 0.8 \cdot 0.2} 
\]

\[ 
= \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.16} 
\]

\[ 
= \frac{0.08}{0.24} 
\]

\[ 
= \frac{1}{3} 
\]

\[ 
\approx 0.33 
\]

**Business Administration:**

\[ 
P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(E|H_{\text{BA}})}{P(H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) + P(\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}})} 
\]

\[ 
= \frac{0.15 \cdot 0.1}{0.15 \cdot 0.1 + 0.85 \cdot 0.2} 
\]

\[ 
= \frac{0.015}{0.015 + 0.17} 
\]

\[ 
= \frac{0.015}{0.185} 
\]

\[ 
\approx 0.081 
\]

Thus, we can express the conditional probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for each field as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.33,
  "business administration": 0.081
}
```
