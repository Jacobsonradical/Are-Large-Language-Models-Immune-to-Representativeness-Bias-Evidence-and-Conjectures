To solve this problem, you need to determine the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field (computer science and business administration) based on the provided personality sketch (E) using Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule is expressed as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of H.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing E given H.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing E given not H.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall likelihood of E and can be computed as \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H)) \).

Since we are comparing probabilities between these two fields only (and assuming equal priors):

1. **P(H) for both fields (computer science and business administration)**:
   Assume equal priors since no specific information is given regarding prevalence:
   \[
   P(H_{CS}) = P(H_{BA}) = 0.5
   \]

2. **P(E|H) for each field**:
   - Computer science (CS):
     - Curiosity about nature and plants: could apply, but not specifically related.
     - Quiet: could apply.
     - Loves solving puzzles: strongly applies.
     - Warm heart and empathy: less directly related but possible.
     - Love for animals: less directly related.
     - High intelligence: strongly applies.
     - Abstract concepts: strongly applies.
     - Hard work and dedication: strongly applies.
     Given these details, let's estimate \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.7 \).

   - Business administration (BA):
     - Curiosity about nature and plants: less directly related.
     - Quiet: can apply.
     - Loves solving puzzles: less directly related.
     - Warm heart and empathy: could apply.
     - Love for animals: less directly related.
     - High intelligence: can apply.
     - Abstract concepts: can apply.
     - Hard work and dedication: strongly applies.
     Given these details, let's estimate \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.4 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H) for each field**:
   To avoid overcomplication, I will assume a baseline likelihood for these fields not fitting the description well compared to other potential fields:
   - For computer science:
     \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.3 \).
   - For business administration:
     \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.3 \).

Now compute \( P(H|E) \):

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{CS}))} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.5}{0.7 \cdot 0.5 + 0.3 \cdot 0.5} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.35}{0.35 + 0.15} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.35}{0.5} = 0.7 \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{BA}))} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.5}{0.4 \cdot 0.5 + 0.3 \cdot 0.5} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.2}{0.2 + 0.15} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \approx 0.57 \]

Thus, the probabilities would be:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.57
}
```

Note: These values are estimates based on the provided sketch and my interpretations of the applicability to the fields.
