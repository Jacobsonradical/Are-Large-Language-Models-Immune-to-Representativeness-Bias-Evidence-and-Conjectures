To compute the probability \(P(H|E)\) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate:

1. Prior probability \(P(H)\): The likelihood that a graduate student chooses a particular field before considering the personality sketch.
2. Likelihood \(P(E|H)\): The probability of the personality sketch of Adam given that he is in that field.
3. Complementary likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of the personality sketch of Adam given that he is in some other field.

Given that I don't have exact statistical data, I'll use reasonable estimates based on the personality sketch of Adam and typical traits of students in each field.

### Priors \(P(H)\):

Assuming equal priors for simplicity because Adam could choose from a wide range of fields:
- \(P(\text{business administration}) = 0.1\)
- \(P(\text{computer science}) = 0.1\)

### Likelihoods \(P(E|H)\):

Based on the personality sketch:
- **Business Administration**:
  - Business students often have strong interpersonal skills but might not typically have a strong affinity for nature, puzzles, and abstract concepts.
  - \(P(E|\text{business administration}) \approx 0.2\)

- **Computer Science**:
  - Computer science students often enjoy solving puzzles and are good with abstract concepts. They may or may not have a strong interest in nature and animals, but empathy and understanding of hard work can fit well in this field.
  - \(P(E|\text{computer science}) \approx 0.6\)

### Complementary Likelihoods \(P(E|\neg H)\):

These are the probabilities of the personality sketch given any other field, which we can assume would be an average of various other fields Adam might be in:
- Assuming there are approximately 10 plausible graduate fields, the mass \(P(E|\neg H)\) could be attributed more evenly but we'll give a slight bias to favoring similar fields:
  - \(P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) \approx (0.6 + ...)/9 \approx 0.4\)
  - \(P(E|\neg \text{computer science}) \approx (0.2 + ...)/9 \approx 0.2\)

### Bayes' Rule:

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

#### For Business Administration:
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{0.2 \times 0.1 + 0.4 \times 0.9} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.36} = \frac{0.02}{0.38} \approx 0.053 \]

#### For Computer Science:
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.1}{0.6 \times 0.1 + 0.2 \times 0.9} = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.18} = \frac{0.06}{0.24} = 0.25 \]

### Final Answer:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.053,
  "computer science": 0.25
}
```
