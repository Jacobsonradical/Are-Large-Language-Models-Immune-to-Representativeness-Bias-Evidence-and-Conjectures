Let's start by defining the probabilities and applying Bayes' rule to calculate the conditional probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for the given fields.

Given Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis.
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.

### Hypothesis: Business Administration
For the field of Business Administration:
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: 
   The likelihood that a random graduate student is in Business Administration is not particularly high.
   \[ P(H) \approx 0.10 \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   Considering Adam's characteristics such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong understanding of hard work, it's less likely he is in Business Administration.  
   \[ P(E|H) \approx 0.20 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   The probability of someone having Adam’s profile given they are not in Business Administration.
   \[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.60 \]

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.20 \cdot 0.10}{P(E)} = 0.02 / P(E) \]


### Hypothesis: Computer Science
For the field of Computer Science:
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   The likelihood that a random graduate student is in Computer Science is relatively higher, given the popularity of the field.
   \[ P(H) \approx 0.25 \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   Attributes like high intelligence, problem-solving, and abstract thinking fit well with Computer Science.
   \[ P(E|H) \approx 0.70 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   The probability of someone having Adam’s profile given they are not in Computer Science.
   \[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.50 \]

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.70 \cdot 0.25}{P(E)} = 0.175 / P(E) \]

Since \(P(E)\), the probability of evidence, is same for both, let's denote it as \(k\):

Thus,
\[ P(H|E) \text{ for Business Administration} \approx \frac{0.02}{k} \]
\[ P(H|E) \text{ for Computer Science} \approx \frac{0.175}{k} \]


Listing the values so they sum to same basis:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\text{Since } = \frac{0.02}{k} & = \approx \frac{1}{x} \implies \text{say 0.02 \(=\frac{0.02}{0.20}  = \approx \frac{0.8}{k}\) }\\
\text{Since} 0.175 & = \approx \frac{0.175}{0.175} \approx 1 =/\quad to  \implies highest\\
\end{aligned}
\]

Putting everything together:

{
  "business administration": "0.8",
  "computer science" : "0.175"
}
