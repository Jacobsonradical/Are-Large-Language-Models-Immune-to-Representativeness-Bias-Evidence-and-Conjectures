To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or computer science given the personality sketch \( E \), we can use Bayes' theorem. For a hypothesis \( H \), Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's break this down for each field:

### 1. Business Administration

#### Prior Probability \( P(H) \)
- Graduate students in the U.S. span many fields. While business administration is a common field, it is less likely to correlate directly with Adam's described personality sketch which emphasizes nature, puzzles, animals, and empathy.
- We'll assume a somewhat lower prior probability for business administration considering the stereotypical traits of such students (likeliness ranging from 0.1 to 0.2).

#### Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)
- Students in business administration may occasionally have some of these traits, but they do not strongly align overall with the nature-oriented, animal-loving, and puzzle-solving aspects.
- We'll assume a lower likelihood (0.2 to 0.3).

#### Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)
- This is more complex but considering the traits, many other fields (like environmental sciences, biology, etc.) may fit Adam better.
- We'll assume a higher \( P(E|\neg H) \) since other fields are more consistent with the traits (0.8 to 0.9).

### 2. Computer Science

#### Prior Probability \( P(H) \)
- Computer science attracts many students and has a great variety of personalities. High intelligence and an affinity for solving puzzles align well.
- We'll assume a relatively moderate to higher prior probability, maybe around 0.3 to 0.4.

#### Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)
- Computer science students often have high intelligence and puzzle-solving skills. These traits are a better match.
- We'll assume a higher likelihood (0.6 to 0.8).

#### Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)
- Students not in computer science may also have such traits, but not as exclusively.
- We'll assume a moderate \( P(E|\neg H) \) (0.5 to 0.7).

### Calculation using Bayesâ€™ Rule

For simplicity, let's assume straightforward midpoint values of these ranges:

### Business Administration
\[ P(H) = 0.15 \]
\[ P(E|H) = 0.25 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.85 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.25 \cdot 0.15 + 0.85 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.0375 + 0.7225 = 0.76 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.25 \cdot 0.15}{0.76} \approx 0.0493 \approx 0.05 \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(H) = 0.35 \]
\[ P(E|H) = 0.7 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.7 \cdot 0.35 + 0.6 \cdot 0.65 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.245 + 0.39 = 0.635 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.35}{0.635} \approx 0.385 \approx 0.39 \]

### Final Results

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.39
}
```

Note that these probabilities do not add up to 1 because they are conditioned only on these two fields and other fields that Adam might be enrolled in are not considered in this calculation.
