To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) (the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch), we'll use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.

Let's consider each field:

### Business Administration

**Prior Probability \( P(H_{\text{business}}) \):**
- Business administration students typically have various types of personalities, but fields like business administration may not attract as many people with a strong appreciation for nature and solving puzzles. Let's assume a prior probability of 0.2.

**Probability \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \):**
- Considering Adam's personality traits, they might be less common among business administration students, as the field often focuses on more practical and managerial skills rather than abstract concepts and empathy. Let's assign this a probability of 0.1.

**Probability \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}}) \):**
- The probability of observing Adam's traits in the general population, excluding business administration students, might be somewhat higher. Let's assume this to be 0.3.

Using Bayes' Theorem, we have:

\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.3} \approx 0.0667 \]

### Computer Science

**Prior Probability \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) \):**
- Computer science tends to attract individuals who are good at understanding abstract concepts and enjoy solving puzzles. Let's assume a prior probability of 0.3.

**Probability \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \):**
- Adam's traits align more closely with the common characteristics of computer science students, especially the interest in abstract concepts and puzzle-solving. Let's assign this a probability of 0.7.

**Probability \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}}) \):**
- The probability of observing Adam's traits in the general population, excluding computer science students, might still be significant but likely less than within the field of computer science. Let's assume this to be 0.4.

Using Bayes' Theorem, we have:

\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.3}{0.4} \approx 0.525 \]

Putting it all together, we get:

{
  "business administration": 0.0667,
  "computer science": 0.525
}
