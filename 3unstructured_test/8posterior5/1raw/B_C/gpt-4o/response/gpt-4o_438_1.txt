To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' rule which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the normalizer or marginal likelihood, which ensures that the total probability sums to 1.

For simplicity, we'll compute \( P(H|E) \) for both fields in relative terms, ignoring the exact value of \( P(E) \) which is the same for both calculations.

**Estimates:**

1. **Business Administration**
   - **P(H)**: The prior probability of a student enrolling in business administration. Suppose this is moderately common: say 0.2.
   - **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch, given he is in business administration. Business administration might relate somewhat to empathy and dedication but less so to nature and puzzles. Let's estimate this as 0.1.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality being observed given he is not in business administration. Given there are many other fields, this could be high: let's estimate 0.9.

2. **Computer Science**
   - **P(H)**: The prior probability of a student enrolling in computer science. Let's also estimate this as moderately common: say 0.2.
   - **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch, given he is in computer science. This might be higher, as abstract thinking and puzzles fit well. Let's estimate this as 0.4.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality being observed given he is not in computer science. This might be lower, 0.6, since other fields might not fit as well.

Using Bayes' rule proportionally:
   
For **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

For **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.4 \cdot 0.2 = 0.08 \]

By normalizing these values relative to each other:

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.08} = \frac{0.02}{0.10} = 0.2 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{computer science}} = \frac{0.08}{0.02 + 0.08} = \frac{0.08}{0.10} = 0.8 \]

So the results are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.8
}
```
