To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following components:

1. **Prior probability \( P(H) \)**: This represents the initial probability of Adam being enrolled in each field before considering any personality information.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch \( E \) given that he is enrolled in a particular field.
3. **Complementary likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is the probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch \( E \) given that he is not enrolled in a particular field.

Let's denote the fields "business administration" as \( H_{BA} \) and "computer science" as \( H_{CS} \).

Bayes' rule is defined as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is constant for all fields, we can work with the proportional relationship:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

### Estimations:
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Let's approximate that the prior probability is evenly distributed over various fields of graduate study. For simplicity, let's assume there are about 10 distinct fields where Adam might be enrolled, so \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \) for each field. (This is a rough estimation.)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - For "business administration": Adam's personality sketch suggests a strong interest in nature, puzzles, and animals which are less typical traits associated with business administration students. Thus, \( P(E|H_{BA}) \) may be relatively low. Let's estimate it to be around 0.1.
   - For "computer science": Adam's intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with typical traits of computer science students. Thus, \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) is relatively high. Let's estimate it to be around 0.6.

3. **Complementary Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - This represents the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in the specific field. For simplicity, let's denote this as \( P(\neg H) \approx 1 - P(H) = 0.9 \).
   - Given that most fields do not strongly align with Adam's personality sketch, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \).

### Calculations:
Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) = 0.1 \cdot 0.1 = 0.01 \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) = 0.6 \cdot 0.1 = 0.06 \]

Now, we can normalize these probabilities by dividing by the sum of all our computed values (which would yield the actual marginal likelihood \( P(E) \), but we omit since we only need the relative likelihood):

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.06} = \frac{0.01}{0.07} \approx 0.143 \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \approx \frac{0.06}{0.01 + 0.06} = \frac{0.06}{0.07} \approx 0.857 \]

Let's present the results in the requested format:

```
{
  "business administration": 0.143,
  "computer science": 0.857
}
```

This computation suggests that given Adam's personality sketch, it is more probable that he is enrolled in computer science compared to business administration.
