Sure, I'll help you estimate \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given he is in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given he is not in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam’s personality traits.

First, let's establish some estimates:

### Business Administration
- **P(H):** The proportion of graduate students in business administration fields is relatively high, but it may not be the most common field for someone with Adam's profile. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
- **P(E|H):** Business administration typically requires good problem-solving skills and understanding of abstract concepts, which Adam has. However, it may not attract those with a strong love for nature and animals as much. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).
- **P(E|\neg H):** Since \( \neg H \) represents all fields other than business administration, which includes many other fields like sciences and arts, Adam's personality traits might still be quite likely outside business administration. Let's say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

### Computer Science
- **P(H):** Computer science is a very popular field and attracts many graduate students, especially those interested in problem-solving and abstract concepts. Let's estimate \( P(H) = 0.25 \).
- **P(E|H):** Computer science students often display traits of high intelligence and problem-solving skills. Even though it’s not directly related to nature and animals, these traits can still correlate. Let’s estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).
- **P(E|\neg H):** Given the wide variety of other fields, Adam's traits might still be common elsewhere. Let's use \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

Now let's plug in these values into Bayes' rule to get \( P(H|E) \).

### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{0.4} = \frac{0.03}{0.4} = 0.075 \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.25}{0.5} = \frac{0.075}{0.5} = 0.15 \]

So the estimates would be:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.075,
  "computer science": 0.15
}
```
