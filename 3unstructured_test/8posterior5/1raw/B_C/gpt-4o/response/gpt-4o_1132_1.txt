To determine the likelihood that Adam was enrolled in a given field (Business Administration or Computer Science), we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

Where:
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of Adam being in the field.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the probability of the evidence, given that Adam is in the field.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\) is the probability of the evidence, given that Adam is not in the field.
- \(P(E)\) is the total probability of the evidence.

Given the personality sketch of Adam (E) and considering that multiple fields of study exist, let us make some reasonable estimates.

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of any graduate student potentially studying Business Administration; let’s estimate this at about 0.15 (15%).
2. **P(E|H)**: The profile fits less obviously with Business Administration compared to other fields. However, problem-solving skills and understanding abstract concepts are relevant to the field. Let's estimate this at 0.2 (20%).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam having these characteristics if he is not studying Business Administration could be higher because his characteristics fit many fields better than Business Administration; let's estimate this at 0.4 (40%).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)}\]

### Computer Science
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of a graduate student potentially studying Computer Science; let’s estimate this at 0.2 (20%).
2. **P(E|H)**: Given the traits like high intelligence, problem-solving skills, and interest in abstract concepts, Adam’s profile fits well with Computer Science. Let's estimate this at 0.7 (70%).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam having these characteristics if he is not studying Computer Science; let’s estimate this at 0.3 (30%).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)}\]

Now, let's solve for \(P(H|E)\):

### For Business Administration:
\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} = \frac{0.03}{P(E)}\]

### For Computer Science:
\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.14}{P(E)}\]

Since we are comparing these probabilities and \(P(E)\) is a constant across the calculations:

- For Business Administration: \(\frac{0.03}{P(E)}\)
- For Computer Science: \(\frac{0.14}{P(E)}\)

We can see that Computer Science is much more likely given the evidence than Business Administration.

Therefore:

  "business administration": 0.15,
  "computer science": 0.70
