To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis (field of study), we need to use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is constant for all hypotheses, we can compare the relative probabilities without calculating \( P(E) \). We need to estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Let's break it down for each field:

### Computer Science

1. **P(H):** The overall probability that a graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in computer science. Given the popularity of computer science, let's assume:
   \[ P(H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.15 \]

2. **P(E|H):** The likelihood that a student in computer science has a personality sketch like Adam's. Adam's empathy, interest in nature, and love for animals are not typical, but not impossible for computer science students:
   \[ P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.05 \]

3. **P(E|\neg H):** The probability that a student not in computer science has a similar personality sketch. Since many fields emphasize empathy and nature-oriented characteristics more, letâ€™s estimate:
   \[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.2 \]

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}} | E) = \frac{P(E | H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}})}{P(E)} \propto P(E | H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.05 \times 0.15 = 0.0075 \]

### Business Administration

1. **P(H):** The probability that a graduate student is enrolled in business administration. Business administration is another popular field, let's assume:
   \[ P(H_{\text{ba}}) = 0.10 \]

2. **P(E|H):** The likelihood that a student in business administration has a personality sketch like Adam's. Given the abstract thinking and hard work, but not necessarily aligned with strong empathy and love for nature:
   \[ P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) = 0.02 \]

3. **P(E|\neg H):** The probability that a student not in business administration has this personality sketch:
   \[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{ba}}) = 0.2 \]

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_{\text{ba}} | E) = \frac{P(E | H_{\text{ba}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ba}})}{P(E)} \propto P(E | H_{\text{ba}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ba}}) = 0.02 \times 0.10 = 0.002 \]

**Combining These Results:**

1. For **Computer Science**:
   \[ P(H_{\text{cs}} | E) \propto 0.0075 \]

2. For **Business Administration**:
   \[ P(H_{\text{ba}} | E) \propto 0.002 \]

In terms of a relative comparison:
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}} | E) \approx 0.0075 / (0.0075 + 0.002) \approx 0.79 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{ba}} | E) \approx 0.002 / (0.0075 + 0.002) \approx 0.21 \]

Given the proportional results, we have:

{
  "computer science": 0.79,
  "business administration": 0.21
}
