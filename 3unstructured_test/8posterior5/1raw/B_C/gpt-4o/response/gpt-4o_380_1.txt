To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we first need to identify and estimate the necessary probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality characteristics given that he was enrolled in the given field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality characteristics given that he was not enrolled in the given field.

Let's consider each field:

### 1. Business Administration

- **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration as a graduate student in the U.S. is not provided in detail, but let's estimate it to be more general. However, without precise data, we can assume a low probability as Adam’s characteristics are less congruent with typical business administration traits.

- **\( P(E|H) \)**: The probability that Adam, with his described personality, is in business administration might be relatively low given his predisposition towards nature, animals, puzzles, and abstract concepts.

- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Given that Adam's traits are more aligned with a field like environmental science, biology, or even computer science, the probability of observing these traits generally (but not specifically in business administration) could be moderately high.

### 2. Computer Science

- **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science can be estimated a bit higher as computer science is a common field for intelligent individuals with a propensity for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts.

- **\( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality characteristics given that he is in computer science fits well, as the traits of high intelligence and an affinity for puzzles and abstract thought are typical in this field.

- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This can be similarly moderate, considering Adam’s traits could match those in several specific non-business and non-CS fields.

Now, using these qualitative estimates, we can apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Here, \(P(\neg H)\) can be estimated as \(1 - P(H)\) assuming the context of considering general options, but for these illustrative examples, we'll simplify and use direct qualitative reasoning.

### Calculation Results:

#### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \)
- \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.1 \cdot 0.1 + 0.5 \cdot 0.9} \approx \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.45} \approx \frac{0.01}{0.46} \approx 0.022 \)

#### Computer Science
- \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|H) \approx 0.7 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \)
- \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.7 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.8} \approx \frac{0.14}{0.14 + 0.4} \approx \frac{0.14}{0.54} \approx 0.259 \)

Given these qualitative estimates, the posterior probabilities are approximately:
