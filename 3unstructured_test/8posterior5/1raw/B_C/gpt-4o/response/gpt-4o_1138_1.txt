Let's utilize Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probabilities P(H | E) for the fields of computer science and business administration.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is not in that field.

Let's judge the values for computer science and business administration:

### Computer Science

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science. Given many graduate fields, let's assume a moderate prior probability — say 0.1.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam's characteristics given he is in computer science. High intelligence, good at abstract concepts, curiosity in puzzles, and solving problems fit well with this field. Let's assign a high probability — say 0.8.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam's characteristics given he is not in computer science. Since these traits can fit other fields too — let’s assume 0.2.

### Business Administration

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration. Again, assume a moderate prior probability — say 0.1.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam's characteristics given he is in business administration. Some traits like empathy and understanding abstract concepts could fit, but others (nature, puzzles) are less aligned. Let's assign a moderate probability — say 0.3.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam's characteristics given he is not in business administration, let’s assume 0.2.

Now, we need to compute the overall probability of observing E, denoted P(E), but we only need its proportional effect for comparison within the given fields. So, we can omit calculation of P(E) as it will be normalized by comparing P(H|E) across hypotheses.

Using Bayes' Theorem, we compute as follows:

\[ P(H|E)_{cs} = \frac{P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{ba} = \frac{P(E|H_{ba}) \cdot P(H_{ba})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \]

Ignoring \( P(E) \) for comparison:

\[ P(H|E)_{cs} \propto 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{ba} \propto 0.3 \times 0.1 = 0.03 \]

Normalizing these values:

Sum \( = 0.08 + 0.03 = 0.11 \)

\[ P(H|E)_{cs} = \frac{0.08}{0.11} \approx 0.727 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{ba} = \frac{0.03}{0.11} \approx 0.273 \]

So the probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": 0.727,
  "business administration": 0.273
}
