To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \), we need to use Bayes' Rule, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to estimate the following:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in the given field.

For simplicity, we assume \( P(E) \) is constant across fields, so it will cancel out. We will qualitatively evaluate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field and then compute \( P(H|E) \).

**1. Computer Science:**

- \( P(H) \): Prior probability of being a computer science student. (Assume moderate as computer science is a common major for high-intelligence students, let's say 0.2)
- \( P(E|H) \): Computer science students might enjoy solving puzzles and have high intelligence, but empathy, strong appreciation for hard work, and love for animals might not be closely related. Let's say 0.3.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): This would be the probability of his personality sketch given that he is not in computer science. Since the sketch fits other fields broadly, let's say 0.8.

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H)P(H) = 0.3 \times 0.2 = 0.06 \]

**2. Business Administration:**

- \( P(H) \): Prior probability of being a business administration student. (Assume low, as business administration is less common for someone with interest in nature, animals, and solving puzzles, let's say 0.05)
- \( P(E|H) \): Business administration students might have an appreciation for hard work but empathy, love for animals, and puzzles are less related. Let's say 0.1.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): This is the same as above, so 0.8.

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H)P(H) = 0.1 \times 0.05 = 0.005 \]

Now we normalize them:

\[ \text{Total} = 0.06 + 0.005 = 0.065 \]

\[ P(H|E) \, \text{(Computer Science)} = \frac{0.06}{0.065} \approx 0.923 \]
\[ P(H|E) \, \text{(Business Administration)} = \frac{0.005}{0.065} \approx 0.077 \]

Thus, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.923,
  "business administration": 0.077
}
