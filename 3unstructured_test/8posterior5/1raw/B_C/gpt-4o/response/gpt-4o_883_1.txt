Sure, let's go through this step-by-step.

1. **Business Administration (H1)**
   - P(H1): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration. Since there are numerous fields, we might assume it is somewhat low but still reasonable; let's estimate it as 0.1.
   - P(E|H1): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was enrolled in business administration. Considering his interests in nature, animals, and puzzles, these traits are less typical for business administration, so we might give it a lower value, say 0.2.
   - P(E|¬H1): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was not enrolled in business administration. Considering his interests align more with scientific fields, this might be higher; let's estimate it as 0.7.
   
   Now, apply Bayes' Rule for business administration:
   \[
   P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1)}{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1) + P(E|\neg H1) \cdot P(\neg H1)}
   \]
   Given \( P(H1) = 0.1, P(E|H1) = 0.2, P(E|\neg H1) = 0.7 \), and \( P(\neg H1) = 1 - P(H1) = 0.9 \),
   \[
   P(H1|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.7 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.63} = \frac{0.02}{0.65} \approx 0.03
   \]

2. **Computer Science (H2)**
   - P(H2): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science. Computer science is a popular field among graduate students; let's estimate it around 0.2.
   - P(E|H2): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was enrolled in computer science. With his affinity for puzzles and abstract concepts, this is quite likely; let’s estimate it as 0.8.
   - P(E|¬H2): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was not enrolled in computer science. This is moderate, as other fields also value intelligence and abstract thinking; let's estimate it as 0.5.
   
   Now, apply Bayes' Rule for computer science:
   \[
   P(H2|E) = \frac{P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2)}{P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2) + P(E|\neg H2) \cdot P(\neg H2)}
   \]
   Given \( P(H2) = 0.2, P(E|H2) = 0.8, P(E|\neg H2) = 0.5 \), and \( P(\neg H2) = 1 - P(H2) = 0.8 \),
   \[
   P(H2|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{0.8 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.16}{0.16 + 0.4} = \frac{0.16}{0.56} \approx 0.29
   \]

Therefore:

  "business administration": 0.03,
  "computer science": 0.29
