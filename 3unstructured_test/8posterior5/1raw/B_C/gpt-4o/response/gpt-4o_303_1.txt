To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam considering the given fields, we'll use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the personality sketch \( E \) and applying it to the specific fields of study \( H \), let's make reasonable judgments on the probabilities.

### Business Administration

- **P(H)**: This is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration. While not highly likely, students from various backgrounds do opt for this field. Let's estimate it as \( P(H_{\text{business}}) \approx 0.1 \).

- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam having the described personality traits if he is a business administration student. Business students can have a range of personalities, but the strong empathy, warm heart, and deep love for animals don't strongly correlate with business administration. Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \approx 0.2 \).

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of Adam having these traits if he is not in business administration. Since these traits might be found in fields like biology or environmental studies, we can estimate a reasonably higher likelihood here, say \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}}) \approx 0.4 \).

### Computer Science

- **P(H)**: This is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science. Given the growing popularity of this field, let's estimate it as \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.15 \).

- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam having the described traits if he is a computer science student. A strong understanding of abstract concepts and puzzle-solving fits well with computer science. Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.5 \).

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of Adam having these traits if he is not in computer science. Given that these traits could also be found in other fields requiring high intelligence and analytical skills, we can estimate \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.3 \).

### Computation

Let's use these judgments to compute the posterior probabilities.

1. **Business Administration:**

\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}})}{P(E)} \]

Given that \( P(E) \) cancels out in the comparative evaluation, we focus on:

\[ \text{Numerator} = P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}}) = 0.2 \times 0.1 = 0.02 \]

2. **Computer Science:**

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \]

\[ \text{Numerator} = P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.5 \times 0.15 = 0.075 \]

Now, convert these into comparative probabilities:

\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) \propto 0.02 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto 0.075 \]

Given \( P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \) is higher than \( P(H_{\text{business}}|E) \), these can be expressed as proportional probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.075
}
```

These values are indicative of the relative likelihoods, assuming reasonable prior probabilities and considering the described personality traits.
