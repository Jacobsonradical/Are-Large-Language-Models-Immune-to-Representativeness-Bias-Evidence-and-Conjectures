Let's go through the analysis step by step to judge the probabilities and compute the posterior probabilities using Bayes' Rule.

### Business Administration
1. **Prior Probability, P(H_business)**: Let's assume the prior probability that any given student is enrolled in business administration (a rough estimate might be) 0.1.
2. **Likelihood, P(E|H_business)**: Given Adam's personality sketch, business administration doesn't seem like a perfect fit because Adam's interest in nature, animals, and abstract concepts is not strongly aligned with a typical business administration student. This might be around 0.05.
3. **Likelihood of not H, P(E|\neg H_business)**: If Adam is not a business administration student, the likelihood of having his personality sketch might be higher, perhaps around 0.2.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H_business|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{0.05 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9} \]

\[ P(H_business|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.18} \]

\[ P(H_business|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.185} \approx 0.027 \]

### Computer Science
1. **Prior Probability, P(H_CS)**: Let’s assume the prior probability for computer science is 0.15.
2. **Likelihood, P(E|H_CS)**: Given Adam’s interests in solving puzzles, intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts, computer science fits him quite well. This might be around 0.25.
3. **Likelihood of not H, P(E|\neg H_CS)**: If Adam is not a computer science student, the likelihood of having his personality sketch might be lower than the above case for business, let’s assume around 0.15.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H_CS|E) = \frac{0.25 \cdot 0.15}{0.25 \cdot 0.15 + 0.15 \cdot 0.85} \]

\[ P(H_CS|E) = \frac{0.0375}{0.0375 + 0.1275} \]

\[ P(H_CS|E) = \frac{0.0375}{0.165} \approx 0.227 \]

Therefore, the posterior probabilities based on the given personality sketch are:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.027,
  "computer science": 0.227
}
```
