To solve this problem and compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood under the complement hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H) \). However, since we don't have concrete data, we'll make some educated guesses based on typical characteristics of students and fields of study.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

**For Computer Science (CS):**
- **P(H):** Hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in CS. Given that CS is a common field, let's assume moderate prior probability.
- **P(E|H):** Likelihood of E given H. Students in CS may exhibit some of the personality traits mentioned (high intelligence, abstract thinking), but curiosity about nature and empathy are less emphasized.
- **P(E|\neg H):** Given not CS, likelihood of E. Other fields might equally or better match Adam's profile.

**For Business Administration (BA):**
- **P(H):** Hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in BA. Given the prevalence of BA programs, let's also assume a moderate prior probability.
- **P(E|H):** Likelihood of E given H. Though business students can be intelligent and empathetic, strong empathy and a deep love for animals are less typically associated with MBA profiles.
- **P(E|\neg H):** Given not BA, likelihood of E. Other fields might fit better.

### Values Estimation:
#### Computer Science
- **P(H):** Let's assign 0.2 (moderate prior, CS is popular).
- **P(E|H):** Given Adam's profile, the fit isn't perfect, so let's say 0.2.
- **P(E|\neg H):** Other fields might have a better fit; therefore, let's assign 0.3.

Using Bayes’ theorem for CS:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \)

Assuming \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) \), for simplicity and normalization:
\[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8 = 0.04 + 0.24 = 0.28 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.28} = \frac{0.04}{0.28} \approx 0.143 \]

#### Business Administration
- **P(H):** Let's assign 0.2 (similarly moderate).
- **P(E|H):** Adam's profile aligns less with BA, so let's say 0.1.
- **P(E|\neg H):** Many other fields would better fit Adam, so let’s assign 0.3.

Using Bayes’ theorem for BA:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Assuming \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) \), for normalization purposes:
\[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8 = 0.02 + 0.24 = 0.26 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.26} = \frac{0.02}{0.26} \approx 0.077 \]

### Final Values:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.143,
  "business administration": 0.077
}
```

These values provide an estimation of the likelihoods based on the given information and assumptions.
