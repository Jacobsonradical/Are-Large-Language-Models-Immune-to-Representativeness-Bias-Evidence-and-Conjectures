To apply Bayes' rule for each of the fields (i.e., business administration and computer science) and determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in each, we'll need to evaluate and estimate the following:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that specific field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood that Adam exhibits the given personality sketch given that he is enrolled in that specific field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood that Adam exhibits the given personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in that specific field.

Given Adam’s interests and traits, let's make educated assumptions:

- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals, which suggests a potential inclination towards fields that might involve natural sciences or humanities over business administration.
- Adam is highly intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, which could potentially fit computer science but also aligns with other intellectual fields.
- Adam enjoys solving puzzles, which is a strong indicator for fields like computer science that require analytical and problem-solving skills.
- Given his quiet nature and dedication, business administration, which often involves extensive social interaction and leadership roles, might not be as strongly indicated by the personality sketch.

Let's assign rough probabilities:

### Business Administration
#### P(H) - Prior:
The probability that any given graduate student is in business administration.
- Let's assume that about 10% of graduate students are in business administration.
- \( P(H) = 0.10 \)

#### P(E|H) - Likelihood:
The likelihood of Adam’s personality given he is in business administration.
- This is likely lower given the mismatch in personality traits.
- \( P(E|H) = 0.05 \)

#### P(E|\neg H) - Likelihood under Not-H:
The likelihood of Adam’s personality given he is not in business administration.
- Given that his personality seems to align better with fields outside business administration.
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.20 \)

Applying Bayes’ rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.05 \times 0.10}{0.05 \times 0.10 + 0.20 \times 0.90} \approx \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.18} \approx \frac{0.005}{0.185} \approx 0.027 \]

### Computer Science
#### P(H) - Prior:
The probability that any given graduate student is in computer science.
- Let’s assume that about 20% of graduate students are in computer science.
- \( P(H) = 0.20 \)

#### P(E|H) - Likelihood:
The likelihood of Adam’s personality given he is in computer science.
- This is higher as there are several matching traits like problem solving, intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts.
- \( P(E|H) = 0.30 \)

#### P(E|\neg H) - Likelihood under Not-H:
The likelihood of Adam’s personality given he is not in computer science.
- Given the broad spectrum of graduate fields, there might be higher likelihood as many fields could match his traits.
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.10 \)

Applying Bayes’ rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.30 \times 0.20}{0.30 \times 0.20 + 0.10 \times 0.80} \approx \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.08} \approx \frac{0.06}{0.14} \approx 0.429 \]

Thus, based on these rough calculations and assumptions, we have:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.027,
  "computer science": 0.429
}
```
