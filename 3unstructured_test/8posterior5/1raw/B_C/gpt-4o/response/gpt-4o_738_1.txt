Sure, let's evaluate the probabilities for each field based on the provided personality sketch of Adam.

To use Bayes' Theorem, we need the following probabilities:
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he was enrolled in that field.
- **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he was not enrolled in that field.

Given the provided sketch and the request, let's make reasonable assumptions about these probabilities:

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: Let's assume the prior probability for any specific graduate field is relatively low, say 0.1.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam's traits match someone in business administration. This seems relatively low given his strong curiosity about nature and love for animals. Let's assign a value of 0.1.
- **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of Adam having these traits if he is not in business administration. Given the general nature of the traits, let's assign it a higher value, say 0.6.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{ P(E|H) \cdot P(H) }{ P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) } = \frac{ 0.1 \cdot 0.1 }{ 0.1 \cdot 0.1 + 0.6 \cdot 0.9 } \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{ 0.01 }{ 0.01 + 0.54 } = \frac{ 0.01 }{ 0.55 } \approx 0.018 \]

### Computer Science
- **P(H)**: Similarly, assume the prior probability for computer science is 0.1.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam's traits match someone in computer science. He enjoys solving puzzles and understands abstract concepts well, which fits with computer science. Let's assign this a value of 0.6.
- **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of having these traits if not in computer science. Arguably, these are also common traits in fields like mathematics or engineering but less common overall. Assign a value of 0.4.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{ P(E|H) \cdot P(H) }{ P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) } = \frac{ 0.6 \cdot 0.1 }{ 0.6 \cdot 0.1 + 0.4 \cdot 0.9 } \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{ 0.06 }{ 0.06 + 0.36 } = \frac{ 0.06 }{ 0.42 } \approx 0.143 \]

Putting it all together, we get:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.018,
  "computer science": 0.143
}
