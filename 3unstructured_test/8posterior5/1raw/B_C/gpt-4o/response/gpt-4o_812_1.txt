To determine the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) (the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch), I will first outline the other probabilities:

- \( P(H) \): the probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field (prior probability without any information about Adam).
- \( P(E|H) \): the probability of observing Adam’s personality traits given that he was enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): the probability of observing Adam’s personality traits given that he was not enrolled in that specific field.

Since we don't have precise numerical values, I will use qualitative reasoning to estimate these probabilities. For simplicity, we will also assume \( P(H) \) to be equal for different fields if there's no additional information suggesting otherwise.

### Estimations:

#### Computer Science:
- \( P(H) \): Assume a reasonable prior probability, e.g., \( P(H) = 0.2 \) (since he could be enrolled in any of several fields).
- \( P(E|H) \): Adam’s traits indicate high intelligence, interest in solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts, which are highly compatible with computer science. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Assuming other fields collectively make up similar distributions but perhaps less perfectly matching his traits, let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

#### Business Administration:
- \( P(H) \): Again, let's assume a prior probability, \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): While business administration might not typically emphasize understanding abstract concepts to the same extent as computer science, traits like empathy and strong appreciation for hard work can be valuable. Estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Assuming other fields collectively make up similar distributions, estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

### Bayes Rule Application:

Bayes rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) (the total probability of observing the evidence) can be found using the Law of Total Probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Considering each field independently, we can approximate \( P(E) \) separately, but we will assume it remains reasonably consistent across multiple assessments.

#### Computer Science:
\[ P(E) = 0.7 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot (1 - 0.2) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.14 + 0.24 = 0.38 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.38} = \frac{0.14}{0.38} \approx 0.368 \]

#### Business Administration:
\[ P(E) = 0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot (1 - 0.2) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.24 = 0.32 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.32} = \frac{0.08}{0.32} = 0.25 \]

Now, compiling the final results:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.368,
  "business administration": 0.25
}
