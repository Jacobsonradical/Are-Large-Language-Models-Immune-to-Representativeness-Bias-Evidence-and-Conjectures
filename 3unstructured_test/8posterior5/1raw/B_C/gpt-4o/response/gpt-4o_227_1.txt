To calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule for each field of study (business administration and computer science), we need to evaluate the following probabilities:
1. \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the particular field.
2. \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in that field.

Additionally, we need to compute \( P(E) \), the total probability of Adam having this personality sketch, which can be combines using:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

Finally, Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we do not have exact numerical values for the priors or likelihoods, these will be roughly estimated based on the information provided.

For simplicity, we will set \( P(H) \) at around typical enrollment proportions and then adjust based on the relevancy of Adam's personality traits to each field:

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)** (Prior for business administration): Let's assume graduate students in business administration make up about 10% of the population: \( P(H) \approx 0.10 \).
2. **P(E|H)**: The personality traits listed (love for nature, empathy, love for animals) are not strongly aligned with typical traits for business administration students, though empathy and understanding hard work could be relevant, so let's assume low likelihood: \( P(E|H) \approx 0.05 \).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The traits seem less likely in a general non-business administration population because this covers all other fields, many of which align more closely with these traits: \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.03 \).

### Computer Science
1. **P(H)** (Prior for computer science): CS students might constitute around 15% of the population: \( P(H) \approx 0.15 \).
2. **P(E|H)**: Adam's interest in puzzles and high intelligence aligns well with computer science, though his love for nature and animals is less typical: \( P(E|H) \approx 0.30 \).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Traits like empathy and love for animals might not be as common outside this field either but given the diverse range of other fields, which might share some traits: \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.07 \).

We can use these rough estimates for the Bayesian update. But we'll simplify here by assuming the denominator \( P(E) \) is balanced out for these estimates.

Use Bayes' rule:

For business administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.05 \times 0.10}{\text{normalizing factor}} \]

For computer science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.30 \times 0.15}{\text{normalizing factor}} \]

Since we are looking for relative values:
\[ \frac{\frac{0.05 \times 0.10}{P(E)}}{\frac{0.05 \times 0.10}{P(E)} + \frac{0.30 \times 0.15}{P(E)}} \text{ and } \frac{\frac{0.30 \times 0.15}{P(E)}}{\frac{0.05 \times 0.10}{P(E)} + \frac{0.30 \times 0.15}{P(E)}} \]

Approximating in simplistic terms: 

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.9
}

These ratios will not sum to 1 with additional fields but should give a relative understanding of Adam's likelihood to be in each specific field given his personality traits and rough estimations.
