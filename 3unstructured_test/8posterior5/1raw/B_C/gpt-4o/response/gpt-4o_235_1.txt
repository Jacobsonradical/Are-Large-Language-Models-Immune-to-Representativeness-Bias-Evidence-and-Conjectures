To apply Bayes' Theorem for this problem, we need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the normalizing factor \( P(E) \). Below are some estimations for these probabilities, followed by the calculations for the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \).

Let's denote the following:
- \( H_1 \): Adam is enrolled in business administration
- \( H_2 \): Adam is enrolled in computer science

### Prior Probabilities (P(H))

Given Adam's qualities and interests, we can estimate that:

- \( P(H_1) \) (probability Adam is studying business administration) = 0.1 (business administration is less aligned with his interests)
- \( P(H_2) \) (probability Adam is studying computer science) = 0.3 (computer science is more aligned with puzzles and abstract concepts, but not exactly aligned with nature and animals)

### Likelihoods (P(E|H))

We posit the following likelihoods based on the given personality sketch:

- \( P(E|H_1) \):
  - Interest in nature and plants: low for business administration
  - Quiet and empathetic: neutral to somewhat low match for business administration
  - Love for animals: low for business administration
  - High intelligence and abstract concepts: neutral, as business can involve strategic thinking
  
  Overall, assume 
  \( P(E|H_1) = 0.1 \)

- \( P(E|H_2) \):
  - Interest in nature and plants: low for computer science
  - Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles: high
  - Empathetic and loves animals: neutral to somewhat low match
  - High intelligence and abstract concepts: high
  
  Overall, assume 
  \( P(E|H_2) = 0.4 \)

### Probability of Evidence \(P(E)\)

Though exact values are difficult to predict, we estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) considering the diversity of graduate fields:

- \( P(E|\neg H_1) \): Assume Adam's personality features are unusual for business administration.
  \( P(E|\neg H_1) \approx 0.2 \)

- \( P(E|\neg H_2) \): Assume Adam's personality features are more aligned with other fields beyond computer science.
  \( P(E|\neg H_2) = 0.3 \)

### Bayes' Rule Calculation

Bayes' rule is:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) + \text{other fields combined probability} \)

Assuming:

- Other fields combined probability estimation â‰ˆ (roughly accounting for sum to 1) = 0.25 (since H1 and H2 aren't the only possibilities)

### Calculation for Each Hypothesis:

#### Business Administration:
\( P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.25} = \frac{0.01}{0.25} = 0.04 \)

#### Computer Science:
\( P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{0.25} = \frac{0.12}{0.25} = 0.48 \)

Thus, the posterior probabilities are as follows:

{
  "business administration": 0.04,
  "computer science": 0.48
}

(Note: These results are subjective estimates based on the description, and actual probabilities could vary. Accurate calculation would ideally require actual data.)
