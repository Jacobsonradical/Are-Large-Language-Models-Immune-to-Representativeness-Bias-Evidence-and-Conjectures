To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) for the various fields, we'll be using Bayes' Rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll break this into steps for each field.

### Business Administration:
1. **Hypothesis \( H \)**: Adam was enrolled in Business Administration.
2. **P(H)**: The prior probability that a given student is enrolled in Business Administration. Given the myriad of graduate fields, let's assume a relatively average figure: \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
3. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of E given H. Business administration might not heavily emphasize empathy, nature, animals, or puzzles. Therefore, let’s assume: \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
4. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of E given any field other than Business Administration. This would be more common given Adam's interests align more with other fields, so let’s assume: \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.02 \).

Putting these together:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

### Computer Science:
1. **Hypothesis \( H \)**: Adam was enrolled in Computer Science.
2. **P(H)**: The prior probability that a given student is enrolled in a Computer Science program. Given the large number of students in this field, let’s assume: \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
3. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of E given H. Computer science might value intelligence and puzzle-solving, though less directly nature or animals. Let’s assume: \( P(E|H) = 0.5 \).
4. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of E given any field other than Computer Science. This would be less compared to computer science given Adam’s traits, so let’s assume: \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.02 \).

Putting these together:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) would be common for both hypotheses and is assumed from the above values:

If we assume:
\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H) \]

and normalize the probabilities, the actual \( P(E) \) value would cancel out in the context of comparing the relative probabilities of each field.

### Estimates for \( P(H|E) \):

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.1} = 0.01 \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.5}{0.2} = 0.5 \]

So the results would be:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.01,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```
