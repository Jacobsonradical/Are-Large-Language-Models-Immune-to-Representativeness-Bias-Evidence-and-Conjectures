To apply Bayes' rule for this problem, one needs to estimate the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the complement likelihoods \( P(E|\neg H) \). Then, Bayes' rule is used to compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \).

Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

I will provide reasonable estimates for each of these values based on the personality sketch provided.

### Business Administration

#### Prior, \( P(H) \):
The likelihood that a graduate student in the U.S. is studying Business Administration:
\[ P(H) = 0.10 \] (approximately 10%)

#### Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \):
Given Adam's personality sketch, business administration typically does not require a strong appreciation of nature, empathy, or love for animals. It is more oriented towards people with management and strategic skills.
\[ P(E|H) = 0.02 \]

#### Complement Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \):
The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is *not* in business administration:
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.10 \] (assuming similar distribution among other fields)

Using Bayesâ€™ Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.02 \times 0.10}{0.02 \times 0.10 + 0.10 \times 0.90} \]
\[ = \frac{0.002}{0.002 + 0.09} \]
\[ = \frac{0.002}{0.092} \]
\[ = 0.0217 \]

### Computer Science

#### Prior, \( P(H) \):
The likelihood that a graduate student in the U.S. is studying Computer Science:
\[ P(H) = 0.15 \] (approximately 15%)

#### Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \):
Given Adam's personality sketch, computer science aligns well with his interest in puzzles, abstract thinking, and intelligence.
\[ P(E|H) = 0.50 \]

#### Complement Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \):
The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is *not* in computer science:
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.10 \] (assuming similar distribution among other fields)

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.50 \times 0.15}{0.50 \times 0.15 + 0.10 \times 0.85} \]
\[ = \frac{0.075}{0.075 + 0.085} \]
\[ = \frac{0.075}{0.16} \]
\[ = 0.4688 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0217,
  "computer science": 0.4688
}
```
