Sure, let's evaluate the probabilities for the hypotheses:

### Step 1: Estimate the Prior Probability (P(H))
1. **P(Business Administration)**: Business Administration is a common graduate field, so let's assume P(H) = 0.2.
2. **P(Computer Science)**: Computer Science is also a common graduate field, so let's assume P(H) = 0.2.

### Step 2: Evaluate P(E|H) and P(E|\neg H)
1. **P(E|Business Administration)**:
   - Curiosity about nature and plants: Not particularly relevant.
   - Quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles: Somewhat neutral, neither particularly common nor rare.
   - Warm heart, strong empathy, love for animals: Personal traits can vary, but not typically associated.
   - High intelligence, understanding abstract concepts: Somewhat relevant, as business strategy requires abstract thinking.
   - Appreciation for hard work/dedication: Relevant, as business studies can demand these traits.

   Overall estimated P(E|H) = 0.3.

2. **P(E|\neg Business Administration)**:
   - This would include all fields not related to Business Administration, such as science, engineering, etc. Given the details in E, fields like environmental science or biology might fit better.
   
   Overall estimated P(E|\neg H) = 0.6.

3. **P(E|Computer Science)**:
   - Curiosity about nature and plants: Not particularly relevant.
   - Quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles: Highly relevant, as it aligns well with typical interests.
   - Warm heart, strong empathy, love for animals: Unrelated but not conflicting.
   - High intelligence, understanding abstract concepts: Very relevant.
   - Appreciation for hard work/dedication: Very relevant.

   Overall estimated P(E|H) = 0.7.

4. **P(E|\neg Computer Science)**:
   - This would include all fields not related to Computer Science.
   
   Overall estimated P(E|\neg H) = 0.5.

### Step 3: Use Bayes' Rule to Compute P(H|E)
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For **Business Administration**:
\[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.2) + (0.6 \cdot 0.8) = 0.06 + 0.48 = 0.54 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.54} \approx 0.111 \]

For **Computer Science**:
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.2) + (0.5 \cdot 0.8) = 0.14 + 0.4 = 0.54 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.54} \approx 0.259 \]

Here are the answers in the desired format:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.111,
  "computer science": 0.259
}
