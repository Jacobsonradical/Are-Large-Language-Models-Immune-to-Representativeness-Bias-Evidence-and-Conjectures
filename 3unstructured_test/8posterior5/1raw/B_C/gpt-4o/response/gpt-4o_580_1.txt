To estimate the probabilities requested, we'll first specify reasonable assumptions for the given problem. Let:

- P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field before considering his personality sketch.
- P(E|H): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was in that particular field.
- P(E|¬H): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not in that particular field.
- P(H|E): The posterior probability that Adam was in that particular field given his personality sketch.

### Computer Science
1. **P(H) for computer science**: Let's assume the prior probability is moderate, given the popularity of the field - say 0.2 (20%).
2. **P(E|H) for computer science**: Adam's intelligence and appreciation for solving puzzles fit well with a computer science profile. He also has an understanding of hard work, which suits computer science.
   - Let's estimate this as 0.6 (60%).
3. **P(E|¬H) for computer science**: Given the traits are somewhat general, but not uniquely indicative of computer science, let's estimate this as lower - say 0.3 (30%).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) P(H) + P(E|\neg H) P(\neg H) \]

Let's assume:
\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.8 \]

\[ P(E) = (0.6 \times 0.2) + (0.3 \times 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.24 = 0.36 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.2}{0.36} \approx 0.33 \]

### Business Administration
1. **P(H) for business administration**: Let's assume a prior probability for business administration as lower, since his personality does not strongly align with typical business administration traits - say 0.1 (10%).
2. **P(E|H) for business administration**: Adam's empathy and understanding can be beneficial in business, but the strong alignment with nature and animals is less typical for business administration.
   - Let's estimate this as 0.3 (30%).
3. **P(E|¬H) for business administration**: Given the traits are somewhat general but do lean towards other fields, let's estimate somewhat higher, say 0.4 (40%).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assuming:
\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.9 \]

\[ P(E) = (0.3 \times 0.1) + (0.4 \times 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.03 + 0.36 = 0.39 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.1}{0.39} \approx 0.077 \]

Based on these calculations:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.33,
  "business administration": 0.077
}
```

These values represent the estimated probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each respective field given his personality sketch.
