First, let's break down the process step by step for each field.

### For Business Administration:

1. **P(H) — Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration:** 
   Without any specific details pointing towards the popularity of Business Administration among graduate students, let’s assume a generic estimate:
   \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.2 \)

2. **P(E|H) — Probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration:**
   Business Administration students might have strong empathy and appreciation for hard work, but they are less likely to focus on nature, plants, and animals:
   \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1 \)

3. **P(E|\neg H) — Probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in Business Administration:**
   Considering the various fields where Adam’s interests could be more relevant (such as biology, environmental science, etc.):
   \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.3 \)

4. **P(H|E) — Posterior probability using Bayes' Rule:**
   \[
   P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)}
   \]
   \[
   P(E) \approx P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{BA}})
   \]
   \[
   P(E) \approx 0.1 \times 0.2 + 0.3 \times 0.8 = 0.02 + 0.24 = 0.26
   \]
   \[
   P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.26} \approx 0.077
   \]

### For Computer Science:

1. **P(H) — Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science:**
   Let's assume this field is quite popular among graduate students as a ballpark estimate:
   \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.3 \)

2. **P(E|H) — Probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in Computer Science:**
   Computer Science students often enjoy solving puzzles and abstract thinking, but might be less likely to focus on nature and animals unless in a niche area:
   \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.2 \)

3. **P(E|\neg H) — Probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in Computer Science:**
   Considering how varied other fields are:
   \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.3 \) 

4. **P(H|E) — Posterior probability using Bayes' Rule:**
   \[
   P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)}
   \]
   \[
   P(E) \approx P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{CS}})
   \]
   \[
   P(E) \approx 0.2 \ × 0.3 + 0.3 \ × 0.7 = 0.06 + 0.21 = 0.27
   \]
   \[
   P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.3}{0.27} \approx 0.222
   \]

Thus, the final results can be presented as:

{
  "business administration": "0.077",
  "computer science": "0.222"
}
