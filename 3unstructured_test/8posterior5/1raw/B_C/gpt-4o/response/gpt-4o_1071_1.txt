Let's break down the process of evaluating the probabilities using Bayes' rule for each field of study.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field, without any additional information.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Probability of observing the personality traits given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
3. **Marginal Likelihood \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \)**: Probability of observing the personality traits across all fields.
4. **Posterior Probability \( P(H|E) \)**: Probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field given the observed personality traits, computed using Bayes' rule.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Considering we have no prior information to strongly suggest any particular field, we'll assume a non-informative prior \( P(H) \) for simplicity, though it would typically be context-dependent. Let's assume equal priors of \( 0.1 \) for both fields mentioned (business administration and computer science).

Additionally, for simplicity:
- \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \) will be qualitatively assessed based on how the personality traits fit typical student profiles in each field.

### Calculations:

#### Business Administration:

- **P(H)**: Prior probability assumed to be 0.1.
- **P(E|H)**: Business administration students may have some of Adam's traits, but the deep love for nature, warmth, empathy, and puzzle-solving are less typical. Let's estimate this as 0.05.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Given Adam's traits, we might find a similar profile in other fields to some extent. Let's estimate this as 0.05.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E_{business}) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.05 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \]
Since \( P(E) \) would be balanced by the sum of likelihoods over all fields, it will be handled in the comparison stage.

#### Computer Science:

- **P(H)**: Prior probability assumed to be 0.1.
- **P(E|H)**: Computer science students often have a genuine curiosity, intelligence, and interest in puzzles aligning well with Adam. Given these alignments, let's estimate this as 0.3.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Given Adam's traits, it's less likely in non-computer science fields than in computer science. Let's estimate this as 0.02.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E_{cs}) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \]
Again, \( P(E) \) is normalized across all possible fields but doesn't need explicit calculation to compare relative probabilities.

### Final Comparison:

For simplicity, given P(E) cancellation effects, the normalized comparison yields:

#### Relative P(H|E):
- Business Administration: \( 0.05 \times 0.1 = 0.005 \)
- Computer Science: \( 0.3 \times 0.1 = 0.03 \)

### Results:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.005,
  "computer science": 0.03
}
```

The above simplified values represent the relative likelihoods based on Adam's personality traits aligning more closely with what is typically seen in computer science fields than in business administration.
