Let's analyze the scenario by estimating probabilities to derive our final values using Bayes' theorem.

Firstly, let's denote the general distribution of graduate students among the different fields (P(H)) as the initial belief about the probability of Adam being in each field. Given the limited details, we can assume:
- P(computer science) = 0.3 (as it is a widely chosen field)
- P(business administration) = 0.2 (also a popular field but perhaps less aligned with Adam's described interests)

Next, let's consider the likelihood of the personality sketch E given the field H (P(E|H)):
- P(E|computer science): While computer science does attract intelligent individuals good at abstract concepts and problem-solving (aligned with Adam's traits), it is less focused on nature, empathy, and animals. Let's estimate this as 0.2.
- P(E|business administration): This field generally appeals to individuals interested in industry, entrepreneurship, and organization. Adam’s strong empathy may align, but his deep love for animals and nature makes this less probable. Let's estimate this as 0.1.

Finally, let's estimate the likelihood of the personality sketch E given that Adam is NOT in the field H (P(E|¬H)). Given the diversity in other fields, we can assume broad and moderate probabilities:
- P(E|¬computer science): This could be higher as many other fields (biology, environmental science, psychology, etc.) align with Adam’s interests. Let's assume 0.6.
- P(E|¬business administration): Similarly, numerous other fields could fit better than business administration. Let's assume 0.5.

Using Bayes' theorem, P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)
Since P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|¬H) * P(¬H), 
this becomes:

For computer science:
- P(E) = 0.2 * 0.3 + 0.6 * 0.7 = 0.06 + 0.42 = 0.48
- P(computer science|E) = (0.2 * 0.3) / 0.48 ≈ 0.125

For business administration:
- P(E) = 0.1 * 0.2 + 0.5 * 0.8 = 0.02 + 0.4 = 0.42
- P(business administration|E) = (0.1 * 0.2) / 0.42 ≈ 0.048

Thus, the computed probabilities of Adam being in either field are:

{
  "computer science": 0.125,
  "business administration": 0.048
}
