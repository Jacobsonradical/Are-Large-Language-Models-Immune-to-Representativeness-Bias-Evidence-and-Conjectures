To evaluate the probability \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in computer science or business administration, we need to consider Bayes' rule, which states:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

First, let's define and estimate the necessary probabilities:

### Hypothesis 1: Computer Science (\(H = H_{CS}\))
- \( P(H_{CS}) \): Given that computer science is a popular field among graduate students, let's estimate a prior probability of 0.15.
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Computer science students are often intelligent, enjoy solving puzzles, and understand abstract concepts. However, a fascination with nature and plants, and a deep love for animals is less typical. Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \): \( \neg H_{CS} \) includes all other fields. The traits mentioned in Adam's personality sketch are more aligned with fields such as biology or environmental science. Hence, \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \) may be around 0.1.
  
### Hypothesis 2: Business Administration (\(H = H_{BA}\))
- \( P(H_{BA}) \): Business administration is also a fairly common field, let's estimate a prior probability of 0.1.
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): Business administration students may possess intelligence and understanding of hard work and dedication but are less likely to have a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals. Let’s estimate \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.05 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \): Similar to the previous case, many other fields would likely match Adam’s profile better. Let's keep \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \) at 0.1.

Since these priors do not depend on each other, \( P(E) \) does not need to be specifically calculated here for relative comparison.

Using Bayes’ rule for comparison, we have:

\[
P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)}
\]

\[
P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)}
\]

Calculating each:

\[
P(H_{CS}|E) \approx \frac{0.2 \times 0.15}{P(E)} = \frac{0.03}{P(E)}
\]

\[
P(H_{BA}|E) \approx \frac{0.05 \times 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.005}{P(E)}
\]

Because \( P(E) \) is a common factor and not required for relative comparison, the values can be directly compared as is.

### Results Summary

\[
P(H_{CS}|E) \text{ relative value: } 0.03
\]

\[
P(H_{BA}|E) \text{ relative value: } 0.005
\]

Based on these values, here is the relative comparison for Adam's likelihood of being enrolled in computer science or business administration:

  "computer science": 0.03,
