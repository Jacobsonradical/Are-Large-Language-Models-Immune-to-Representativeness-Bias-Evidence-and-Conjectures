To compute \( P(H|E) \) (the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch), we use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To make this judgment, we need to consider the following:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given he is in a particular field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given he is not in a particular field.
- \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing Adam's personality traits.

Since we are comparing two fields, \( P(E) \) will be common and can be treated as a normalizing constant that ensures the probabilities sum up correctly across different fields.

Let’s make reasonable estimates for each field given Adam’s characteristics.

### Business Administration

**P(H):**
Let's assume a general likelihood that a graduate student could be enrolled in Business Administration in the U.S.:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.15 \]

**P(E|H):**
Adam's traits like curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals are less typical for Business Administration but not impossible. However, high intelligence and appreciation for hard work are relevant:
\[ P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.2 \]

**P(E|\neg H):**
For graduate fields other than Business Administration:
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.3 \]

Plugging into Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.2 \cdot 0.15 \]

### Computer Science

**P(H):**
Let's assume a general likelihood that a graduate student could be enrolled in Computer Science in the U.S.:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.20 \]

**P(E|H):**
Adam’s traits like high intelligence and interest in puzzles are very relevant for Computer Science:
\[ P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.7 \]

**P(E|\neg H):**
For graduate fields other than Computer Science:
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.3 \]

Plugging into Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.7 \cdot 0.20 \]

### Normalizing

We normalize the probabilities to provide a final answer in terms of a comparable ratio rather than absolute probabilities:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.15 = 0.03 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto 0.7 \cdot 0.20 = 0.14 \]

Then we normalize these values:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.14} = \frac{0.03}{0.17} \approx 0.18 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.14}{0.03 + 0.14} = \frac{0.14}{0.17} \approx 0.82 \]

Thus, we have:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.18,
  "computer science": 0.82
}
