To determine the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule for each of the fields, we need to define the following components:

- \( P(H) \), the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field.
- \( P(E|H) \), the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \), the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.

Bayes' Rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

### Computer Science

#### Prior Probability \( P(H) \)
- Assume prior knowledge suggests that the probability of a graduate student being in computer science is moderately high. Let's say \( P(H) = 0.25 \).

#### Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)
- Personality traits like high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, problem-solving skills, and a quiet demeanor fit well with the field of computer science. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).

#### Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)
- Personality traits that fit computer science may also apply to other fields but to a lesser extent. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

### Business Administration

#### Prior Probability \( P(H) \)
- Assume prior knowledge suggests that the probability of a graduate student being in business administration is also considerable but less than computer science. Let's say \( P(H) = 0.15 \).

#### Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)
- Personality traits like a warm heart, strong empathy, and understanding of hard work apply but not as strongly. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).

#### Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)
- The likelihood of these traits in other fields might be comparable but not specifically indicating business administration. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

We now use Bayes' Rule to calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \):

### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.25}{P(E)} \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \]

Note that \( P(E) \) is the same in both cases and should normalize the probabilities, but since we are only comparing these two probabilities, we can focus on the numerator.

### Normalized Approximations

We need to compute and normalize both, but without knowing \( P(E) \), I'll provide the numerator directly:

For Computer Science:
\[ 0.7 \cdot 0.25 = 0.175 \]

For Business Administration:
\[ 0.3 \cdot 0.15 = 0.045 \]

To normalize, let's sum these:

\[ 0.175 + 0.045 = 0.22 \]

Normalized Values:

For Computer Science:
\[ \frac{0.175}{0.22} \approx 0.795 \]

For Business Administration:
\[ \frac{0.045}{0.22} \approx 0.205 \]

Thus, the final answers are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.795,
  "business administration": 0.205
}
