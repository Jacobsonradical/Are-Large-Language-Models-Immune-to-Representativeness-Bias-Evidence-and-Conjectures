To analyze the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field of study given the personality sketch \( E \), we'll be applying Bayes' rule. In Bayesian analysis, we need to estimate the following for each field \( H \):

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
2. \( P(E | H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) if Adam was enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E | \neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) if Adam was not enrolled in that field.
4. Compute the posterior probability \( P(H | E) \): The probability that Adam was enrolled in that field given the personality sketch \( E \).

Let's assume the priors \( P(H) \) are equally distributed among all graduate fields since we are not given specific information to favor one over another for a typical graduate student.

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): Assuming all fields are equally likely initially, let's set \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.05 \) as a placeholder.
- \( P(E | H) \): The likelihood that Adam, given his high empathy and warmth, would be in Business Administration where interpersonal skills are highly valued. So, let's set \( P(E | H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.3 \).
- \( P(E | \neg H) \): The likelihood of observing \( E \) if Adam was in any other field, which has a broad range. We can use a baseline of fields not necessarily fitting the profile, say, \( P(E | \neg H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.2 \).

### Computer Science
- \( P(H) \): Same as above, assume \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.05 \).
- \( P(E | H) \): Given Adam's high intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles, we can reasonably assume a higher fit for Computer Science, so \( P(E | H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.5 \).
- \( P(E | \neg H) \): Similar to before for general population, assume \( P(E | \neg H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.2 \).

### Applying Bayes' Rule
For our calculations of \( P(H | E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to estimate \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}}) + P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}}) + \text{other fields}\]

Given the assumptions:

\[ P(E) \approx 0.3 \cdot 0.05 + 0.5 \cdot 0.05 + \text{other fields} \]

Since we don't have values for other fields, omit for this simplicity.

\[ P(E) \approx 0.015 + 0.025 \approx 0.04 \]

Now calculating for each field:

#### Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.05}{0.04} = \frac{0.015}{0.04} \approx 0.375\]

#### Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.05}{0.04} = \frac{0.025}{0.04} \approx 0.625\]

So the results are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.375,
  "computer science": 0.625
}
```
