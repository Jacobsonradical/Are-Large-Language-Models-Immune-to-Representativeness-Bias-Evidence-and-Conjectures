To calculate the probability that Adam was enrolled in either Computer Science or Business Administration given his personality sketch, we can employ Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (before considering the evidence).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis is not true.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

Let's break this down for each field:

### Computer Science:
1. **P(H) (Prior Probability)**: The prior probability that Adam was studying Computer Science:
   - Generally, given the broad range of graduate fields, let's assign a conservative prior, say 5% (0.05).

2. **P(E|H) (Likelihood)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is in Computer Science:
   - Given Adam's high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts, it is quite consistent with someone studying Computer Science.
   - However, his love for nature and animals, while not contradicting, is less directly related to Computer Science.
   - Let's assign a value of 30% (0.30).

3. **P(E|\neg H) (Likelihood of Evidence Given Not H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in Computer Science:
   - These traits could fit a wide variety of fields (like natural sciences, psychology, etc.).
   - Therefore, it is quite likely he possesses these traits irrespective of being in Computer Science.
   - Let’s approximate it to 70% (0.70).

### Business Administration:
1. **P(H) (Prior Probability)**: The prior probability that Adam was studying Business Administration:
   - Again, let's assign a conservative prior, say 5% (0.05).

2. **P(E|H) (Likelihood)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is in Business Administration:
   - Business Administration may often involve people with strong verbal and social skills, but it can also include analytical skills.
   - His empathy and appreciation for hard work could fit, but his deep love for animals and nature is less directly related.
   - Let's assign a value of 10% (0.10).

3. **P(E|\neg H) (Likelihood of Evidence Given Not H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in Business Administration:
   - These traits could fit a wide variety of fields (like natural sciences, psychology, etc.).
   - Therefore, it is quite likely he possesses these traits irrespective of being in Business Administration.
   - Let’s approximate it to 70% (0.70).

The overall probability of the evidence \( P(E) \) does not need to be calculated directly as it normalizes the probabilities, but it involves both \( H \) and \(\neg H) terms.

Now, applying Bayes’ rule for each field:

### Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is common for both fields and for simplicity:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} \propto P(E|H)_{\text{CS}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{CS}}\]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} \propto 0.30 \cdot 0.05 = 0.015 \]

### Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} \propto P(E|H)_{\text{BA}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{BA}}\]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} \propto 0.10 \cdot 0.05 = 0.005 \]

Normalizing these for relative comparison:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} = \frac{0.015}{0.015 + 0.005} = \frac{0.015}{0.02} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} = \frac{0.005}{0.015 + 0.005} = \frac{0.005}{0.02} = 0.25 \]

The answers are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.25
}
```
These probabilities suggest Adam is more likely to have been enrolled in Computer Science compared to Business Administration based on his personality sketch.
