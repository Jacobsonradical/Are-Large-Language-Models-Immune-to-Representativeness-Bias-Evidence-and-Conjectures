To apply Bayes' Rule, we need to calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).

Bayes' Rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

Given:
- \( E \) = Personality sketch of Adam.
- \( H \) = Hypothesis about Adam's field of study.
- \( \neg H \) = All other fields except the one being hypothesized.

### Business Administration

#### Step 1: Assess Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)
We need an estimate of how likely it is, in general, for a graduate student to be enrolled in Business Administration. For simplicity, let's assume the distribution:
- \( P(\text{Business Administration}) = 0.20 \)

#### Step 2: Assess Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)
Given Adam's personality sketch, it is less likely but not impossible for him to be in Business Administration, as his interests in nature, animals, and solving puzzles don't directly relate:
- \( P(E|\text{Business Administration}) = 0.10 \)

#### Step 3: Assess the Complement Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \)
For all other fields (assuming many diverse fields):
- \( P(E|\neg \text{Business Administration}) = 0.90 \)

### Computer Science

#### Step 1: Assess Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)
For Computer Science:
- \( P(\text{Computer Science}) = 0.25 \)

#### Step 2: Assess Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)
Given Adam's high intelligence, curiosity, and love for solving puzzles, this field fits well:
- \( P(E|\text{Computer Science}) = 0.70 \)

#### Step 3: Assess the Complement Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \)
For fields that are not Computer Science:
- \( P(E|\neg \text{Computer Science}) = 0.30 \)

### Calculation using Bayesâ€™ Rule

#### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
As \( P(E) \) is the same across both hypotheses and can be seen as a normalizing constant, we can focus on the numerator:

\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) \propto P(E|\text{Business Administration}) \cdot P(\text{Business Administration}) \]
\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) \propto 0.10 \cdot 0.20 = 0.02 \]

#### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) \propto P(E|\text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science}) \]
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) \propto 0.70 \cdot 0.25 = 0.175 \]

### Normalizing Constant
To get the final probabilities, we need to normalize these values:
\[ P(E) \propto 0.02 + 0.175 = 0.195 \]

### Normalized Probabilities
\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.195} \approx 0.103 \]
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.175}{0.195} \approx 0.897 \]

Thus, the answers are:

{
  "business administration": 0.103,
  "computer science": 0.897
}
