To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being in a particular field given the personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is in the particular field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in the particular field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the personality sketch.

Let’s break down and hypothesize the values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field:


### Field: Business Administration
- **P(H)** (prior probability of Adam being in Business Administration): This could be relatively low because Business Administration doesn't typically align directly with traits like curiosity about nature and a love for animals. Let’s assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

- **P(E|H)** (likelihood of Adam having this personality sketch if he is in Business Administration): His personality traits do not heavily align with fields typically associated with Business Administration. Let’s assume \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).

- **P(E|\neg H)** (likelihood of Adam having this personality sketch if he is not in Business Administration): The majority chance that a person with Adam’s traits would not be in Business Administration. Let’s assume this to be higher than \( P(E|H) \): \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.7 \).

### Field: Computer Science
- **P(H)** (prior probability of Adam being in Computer Science): This could be higher than Business Administration because Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has a high intelligence, which aligns with characteristics of many Computer Science students. Let’s assume \( P(H) = 0.3 \).

- **P(E|H)** (likelihood of Adam having this personality sketch if he is in Computer Science): Given his traits, a love for problem-solving and abstract concepts significantly align with a Computer Science field. Let’s assume \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).

- **P(E|\neg H)** (likelihood of Adam having this personality sketch if he is not in Computer Science): Adam’s strong fit to the more science-oriented fields makes this value smaller. Let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

### Calculation Using Bayes' Rule

Compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \).

### For Business Administration:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.7 \cdot 0.9 \]

\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.63 \]

\[ P(E) = 0.65 \]

So,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.65} = \frac{0.02}{0.65} \approx 0.031 \]

### For Computer Science

\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.7 \cdot 0.3 + 0.4 \cdot 0.7 \]

\[ P(E) = 0.21 + 0.28 \]

\[ P(E) = 0.49 \]

So,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.3}{0.49} = \frac{0.21}{0.49} \approx 0.429 \]

### Final Result

Based on the above analyses and computations, we get:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.031,
  "computer science": 0.429
}
```
