To apply Bayes' rule for this scenario, we need to estimate the following probabilities first:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in the given field.

The fields under consideration are:
1. Computer Science
2. Business Administration

1. **Computer Science**
   - \( P(H_{CS}) \): The base-rate probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is in Computer Science.
     - Let's estimate this as 0.2 (20%), a reasonable estimate given the popularity of the field.
   - \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Given Adam's personality sketch, how likely is it that he is enrolled in Computer Science?
     - Adam's curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work may not align perfectly with the typical stereotypes associated with Computer Science students, but his high intelligence and abstract thinking align well. Let's estimate this as 0.4.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in Computer Science.
     - Given that most students outside Computer Science may not represent this mix of characteristics, but they are still common, we could estimate this as 0.6.

2. **Business Administration**
   - \( P(H_{BA}) \): The base-rate probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is in Business Administration.
     - Let's estimate this as 0.1 (10%), considering the graduate enrollment in business is competitive and less frequent.
   - \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): Given Adam's personality sketch, how likely is it that he is enrolled in Business Administration?
     - Adam's personality doesn't strongly align with typical Business Administration students who might focus more on socializing, networking, and business strategies. Let’s estimate this as 0.2.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \): The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given that he is not in Business Administration.
     - Considering most non-Business students might share his interests, let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \) as 0.65.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)} \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS})P(H_{CS})}{P(E|H_{CS})P(H_{CS}) + P(E|\neg H_{CS})P(\neg H_{CS})} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.2}{0.4 \times 0.2 + 0.6 \times 0.8} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.48} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.56} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = 0.1429 \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA})P(H_{BA})}{P(E|H_{BA})P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA})P(\neg H_{BA})} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{0.2 \times 0.1 + 0.65 \times 0.9} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.585} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.605} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = 0.0331 \]

Therefore, the posterior probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": 0.1429,
  "business administration": 0.0331
}
