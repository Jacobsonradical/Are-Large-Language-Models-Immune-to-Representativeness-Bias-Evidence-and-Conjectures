To address this problem, we need to apply Bayes' theorem to find the conditional probability \( P(H|E) \), which is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality traits and background.

Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in the specific field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in the specific field.
- \( P(E) \): Total probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.

For simplicity, we can assume that \( P(E) \) normalizes the probabilities over different fields. To proceed with the computations, we need to make reasonable assumptions for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) based on the given personality sketch and typical field characteristics. Let's assume plausible values for these probabilities.

### Assumptions:
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in each field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Probability of the personality sketch given the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of the personality sketch given other fields.

Given the personality sketch, it seems more likely that Adam would be studying a field more aligned with natural curiosity, abstract thinking, and sensitivity, rather than business.

1. **Computer Science (CS)**:
   - \( P(H) \): Computer Science is a common graduate field, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given the traits of curiosity, puzzle-solving, intelligence, and abstract thinking, these align well with CS, so assume \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Assuming these traits are somewhat common in other fields as well, let's set \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

2. **Business Administration (BA)**:
   - \( P(H) \): Business Administration is also a common graduate field, so let's use \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The personality traits given do not strongly align with the typical Business Administration profile (e.g., empathy and love for animals are less relevant), assume \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): As above, let's set \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Now, applying Bayes' theorem for each field:

### Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto 0.7 \cdot 0.2 = 0.14 \]

### Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.2 = 0.04 \]

Normalizing these values (ensuring they sum up correctly), we get:

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.14}{0.14 + 0.04} = \frac{0.14}{0.18} \approx 0.778 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.14 + 0.04} = \frac{0.04}{0.18} \approx 0.222 \]

Therefore, the results in the required format will be:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.778,
  "business administration": 0.222
}
```
