Let's approach this step by step using Bayes' Rule: 

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \) being true, i.e., the probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field without any information about his personality.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing personality sketch \( E \), computed as:
  
  \[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H)) \]

Now let's assign plausible values for each field based on the personality sketch provided.

### Business Administration

**Assumptions:**
- \( P(H_{BA}) \) (Prior Probability): Business Administration is a common field, but given Adam's interests in nature and animals, let's assume a relatively low prior, say \( 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \) (Likelihood): The personality traits of curiosity about nature, empathy, warm heart, and love for animals are not particularly aligned with typical Business Administration students. Let's assign it a relatively low value, say \( 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \) (Likelihood given not in BA): This should be higher because Adam's traits are more consistent with fields like Biology or Environmental Science. Let's use a value, say \( 0.7 \).

### Computer Science

**Assumptions:**
- \( P(H_{CS}) \) (Prior Probability): Computer Science is popular among graduate students, but it’s less likely given Adam's specific interests. Let’s assume a moderately low prior, say \( 0.3 \).
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) (Likelihood): Since Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, he could fit into Computer Science despite his love for nature. Assign a moderate value, say \( 0.4 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \) (Likelihood given not in CS): Higher given that his traits might be more consistent with fields that align with empathy and nature-focused studies. Let’s use a value, say \( 0.6 \).

### Calculations

#### For Business Administration:
1. **Calculate \( P(E) \):**
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{BA})) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.7 \cdot 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.56 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.58 \]

2. **Apply Bayes' Rule:**
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.58} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.58} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx 0.034 \]

#### For Computer Science:
1. **Calculate \( P(E) \):**
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{CS})) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.4 \cdot 0.3 + 0.6 \cdot 0.7 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.42 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.54 \]

2. **Apply Bayes' Rule:**
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{0.54} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.54} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \approx 0.222 \]
