To solve this problem using Bayes' rule, we need to determine the following probabilities for each field:
- Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field, \( P(H) \)
- Likelihood of the personality sketch given each field, \( P(E|H) \)
- Likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in each field, \( P(E|\neg H) \)

And then use Bayes' rule to compute:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we do not have specific data, we will have to make educated guesses about \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). We’ll then calculate \( P(H|E) \).

### Computer Science
- \( P(H_{cs}) \): Let’s assume the prior probability of Adam being in computer science is moderate. Let’s say it’s 0.3.
- \( P(E|H_{cs}) \): Given Adam’s traits (such as high intelligence and puzzle-solving ability), computer science is a plausible field. Let's estimate this at 0.5.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{cs}) \): The likelihood of Adam having these traits if he is NOT in computer science could be estimated lower. Let's say 0.2.

### Business Administration
- \( P(H_{ba}) \): Let’s assume the prior probability of Adam being in business administration is moderate. Let’s say it’s 0.2.
- \( P(E|H_{ba}) \): Given the traits like empathy and appreciation for hard work, business administration is somewhat plausible. Let's estimate this at 0.3.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{ba}) \): The likelihood of Adam having these traits if he is NOT in business administration could be estimated lower. Let's say 0.2.

We can then use Bayes' rule:

### For Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \]

### For Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{ba}) \cdot P(H_{ba})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

### Combined Probability \( P(E) \)
Since we have:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs}) + P(E|H_{ba}) \cdot P(H_{ba}) + P(E|\neg H_{cs}) \cdot P(\neg H_{cs}) \]

Assuming \( P(\neg H_{cs}) \approx 1 - P(H_{cs}) \) and \( P(\neg H_{ba}) \approx 1 - P(H_{ba}) \):
\[ P(E) \approx 0.5 \cdot 0.3 + 0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.2 \cdot (1 - 0.5 \cdot 0.3 - 0.3 \cdot 0.2) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.15 + 0.06 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.41 \]

Now inserting back into Bayes’ rule calculations:

### For Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.3}{0.41} \approx \frac{0.15}{0.41} \approx 0.366 \]

### For Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.41} \approx \frac{0.06}{0.41} \approx 0.146 \]

Thus the resulting estimates for \( P(H|E) \) are:

{
  "computer science": 0.366,
  "business administration": 0.146
}
