To solve this problem using Bayes' rule, we need to assess the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in each of the indicated fields, given the personality sketch (E) provided.

Bayes' rule is stated as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For each hypothesis \(H\) (the field of study), we need to estimate the following:
- \( P(H) \) - The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field
- \( P(E|H) \) - The probability of Adam having the personality sketch \(E\), given that he is enrolled in that field
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) - The probability of Adam having the personality sketch \(E\), given that he is not enrolled in that field

Given that Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, has empathy, love for animals, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work, we can reason about the fields as follows:

### Business Administration:
- \( P(H) \): Business Administration is a common field of study, but may not strongly align with the traits associated with Adam.
  - Let's arbitrarily assign \( P(H) = 0.1 \) (10%)
- \( P(E|H) \): The traits described do not strongly align with typical business administration students, who might need more interpersonal skills and interest in business processes.
  - Let's arbitrarily assign \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \) (10%)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the personality traits given fields other than Business Administration might be generally better aligned with Adam's profile.
  - Let's assign \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.9 \) (90%)

### Computer Science:
- \( P(H) \): Computer Science is a popular field of study and aligns well with an interest in solving puzzles and abstract thinking.
  - Let's assign \( P(H) = 0.2 \) (20%)
- \( P(E|H) \): The profile fits quite well with a computer science student, such as an interest in solving problems and understanding abstract concepts.
  - Let's assign \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \) (70%)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Considering fields other than Computer Science, the probability might be more evenly distributed but less aligned compared to Computer Science.
  - Let's assign \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \) (40%)

### Calculations:
Let's normalize the values such that \( P(E) \) can be comprehensively assessed:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For each field, use:
- \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) \)

#### For Business Administration:
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.1) + (0.9 \cdot 0.9) = 0.01 + 0.81 = 0.82 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.82} \approx 0.012 \]

#### For Computer Science:
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.2) + (0.4 \cdot 0.8) = 0.14 + 0.32 = 0.46 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.46} \approx 0.304 \]

Thus, the likelihood values can be interpreted as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.012,
  "computer science": 0.304
}
```
