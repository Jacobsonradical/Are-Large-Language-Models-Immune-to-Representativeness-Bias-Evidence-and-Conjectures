First, let's break down the reasoning behind the probabilities.

### Business Administration
- **P(H):** The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration. Since business administration is a fairly common graduate field and is not particularly rare, let's assume P(H) = 0.20.
- **P(E|H):** The probability of observing evidence E given that Adam is enrolled in business administration. The personality sketch of Adam does not particularly match what is typically expected from a business administration student (e.g., curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, empathy for animals). Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.05.
- **P(E|¬H):** The probability of observing evidence E given that Adam is not enrolled in business administration. Since the personality sketch is more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, or computer science, let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.30.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to calculate the overall probability of observing E (P(E)) considering all possible fields, which is complex without additional information. Instead, we will focus on comparing relative probabilities between the two hypotheses.

### Computer Science
- **P(H):** The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science. Given that computer science is a popular field and students often have attributes matching Adam's personality sketch (e.g., solving puzzles, high intelligence), let's assume P(H) = 0.25.
- **P(E|H):** The probability of observing evidence E given that Adam is enrolled in computer science. Adam’s interests in puzzles, abstract thinking, and intelligence alignment quite well with computer science. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.40.
- **P(E|¬H):** The probability of observing evidence E given that Adam is not enrolled in computer science. As above, we assume P(E|¬H) = 0.30.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

### Calculation

For **business administration**:
\[ P(\text{H}|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.20}{P(E)} \]

For **computer science**:
\[ P(\text{H}|E) = \frac{0.40 \cdot 0.25}{P(E)} \]

We do not have the exact value of P(E), but we can compare the numerators to judge relative probabilities.

### Relative Comparison
- Business Administration: \( 0.05 \times 0.20 = 0.01 \)
- Computer Science: \( 0.40 \times 0.25 = 0.10 \)

So, the relative probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science is substantially higher than that of business administration.

Therefore, the answers are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.01,
  "computer science": 0.10
}
