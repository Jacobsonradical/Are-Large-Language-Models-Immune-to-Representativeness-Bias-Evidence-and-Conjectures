Sure, I'll assess the probabilities based on the given personality sketch of Adam and use Bayes' Theorem to compute \( P(H|E) \).

1. **Business Administration**:
   - **P(H)**: Based on general knowledge, it is relatively common for people to pursue MBAs and similar degrees, so let's assign a moderate baseline P(H) (probability of being enrolled in business administration).
     \[
     P(H)_{\text{BA}} = 0.15
     \]

   - **P(E|H)**: Given Adamâ€™s described traits - curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and understanding abstract concepts - these traits are less associated with business administration, which often focuses on leadership, management, and financial skills.
     \[
     P(E|H)_{\text{BA}} = 0.05
     \]

   - **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of E given not business administration can be considered higher as such traits might be prevalent in other fields.
     \[
     P(E|\neg H) = 0.3
     \]

   Using Bayes' Theorem:
   \[
   P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)}
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} = \frac{0.05 \times 0.15}{0.05 \times 0.15 + 0.3 \times 0.85} = \frac{0.0075}{0.0075 + 0.255} = \frac{0.0075}{0.2625} \approx 0.0286
   \]

2. **Computer Science**:
   - **P(H)**: Computer Science is a common and rapidly growing field, let's assign a higher baseline probability \( P(H) \).
     \[
     P(H)_{\text{CS}} = 0.2
     \]

   - **P(E|H)**: The traits such as strong intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles align well with computer science.
     \[
     P(E|H)_{\text{CS}} = 0.6
     \]

   - **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of E given not computer science may be less comparatively as the traits described are quite suited to a field like CS.
     \[
     P(E|\neg H) = 0.2
     \]

   Using Bayes' Theorem:
   \[
   P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)}
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} = \frac{0.6 \times 0.2}{0.6 \times 0.2 + 0.2 \times 0.8} = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.16} = \frac{0.12}{0.28} \approx 0.4286
   \]

Thus, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0286,
  "computer science": 0.4286
}
```
