To solve for \( P(H|E) \) for each field (business administration and computer science), we can use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we are comparing two fields, \( P(E) \) will cancel out, and we can work with relative values for \( P(H|E) \) without needing to normalize them to sum to 1.

Let's break this down step by step for both fields based on the provided sketch of Adam's personality. We'll make reasonable estimates based on his traits.

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**:
   \[
   P(H)_{BA} \approx 0.25
   \]
   Business administration is a common field, but it may be less likely given the specifics of Adam's personality sketch.

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**:
   \[
   P(E|H)_{BA} \approx 0.1
   \]
   Business administration is typically more associated with managerial skills and less so with a deep love for nature and animals.

3. **Probability of Evidence Given Not \( H \), \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   \[
   P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.9
   \]
   Adam's personality seems less aligned with business administration, so the likelihood given not \( H \) would be high.

### Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**:
   \[
   P(H)_{CS} \approx 0.35
   \]
   Computer science is a very common and wide field for graduate studies.

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**:
   \[
   P(E|H)_{CS} \approx 0.6
   \]
   Adam's personality aligns well with the problem-solving and abstract thinking typical in computer science.

3. **Probability of Evidence Given Not \( H \), \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   \[
   P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4
   \]
   Since Adam's traits are relatively specific, they may be less likely to occur in a random field other than computer science.

Using these estimates, we can now compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \):

\[
P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{P(E|H)_{BA} P(H)_{BA}}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{P(E)}
\]

\[
P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{P(E|H)_{CS} P(H)_{CS}}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.6 \times 0.35}{P(E)}
\]

Since we don't need to compute \( P(E) \) explicitly for comparison, we can compare the numerators directly:

\[
P(Business Administration|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.25 = 0.025
\]

\[
P(Computer Science|E) \propto 0.6 \times 0.35 = 0.21
\]

### Normalized Probabilities (for comparison):
To normalize these values to make them comparable:

\[
P(Business Administration|E) = \frac{0.025}{0.025 + 0.21} \approx \frac{0.025}{0.235} \approx 0.106
\]

\[
P(Computer Science|E) = \frac{0.21}{0.025 + 0.21} \approx \frac{0.21}{0.235} \approx 0.894
\]

Converting these estimates to approximate values between 0 and 1:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.9
}
```

In conclusion, it is significantly more likely, given Adam's personality sketch, that he was enrolled in computer science rather than business administration in 2021.
