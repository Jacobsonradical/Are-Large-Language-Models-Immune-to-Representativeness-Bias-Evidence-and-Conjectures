To determine the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \), we will use Bayes' theorem, which states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that the total does not need to add up to 1, we can estimate the relative probabilities without normalizing them. Let's start by assigning plausible values for the different probabilities.

### Business Administration

**P(H):** The prior probability \( P(H) \) for business administration. Given that business administration is a common field among graduate students, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.15 \). 

**P(E|H):** The likelihood \( P(E|H) \), which is the probability of observing the evidence given the hypothesis. Business administration students typically focus more on management, finance, and strategy, which are not strongly linked to the natural curiosity, empathy for animals, or interest in abstract concepts noted in Adam's sketch. Given this, let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.05 \).

**P(E|\neg H):** The probability of observing the evidence if Adam is not in the business administration field. Given there are many fields that might be a better fit for Adam, let's assume this value to be higher, say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.30 \).

Using these values, we don't need to compute the exact \( P(E) \) because we're comparing relative probabilities. So, Bayes' theorem simplifies to comparing \( P(H|E) \) values directly:

### Computer Science

**P(H):** The prior probability \( P(H) \) for computer science. Given that computer science is also a common graduate field, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.20 \). 

**P(E|H):** The likelihood \( P(E|H) \), which is the probability of observing the evidence given the hypothesis. Computer science students often have strong abstract thinking skills and an affinity for puzzles, which fits Adam's description quite well. Therefore, let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.75 \).

**P(E|\neg H):** The probability of observing the evidence if Adam is not in the computer science field. Given the specific nature of the personality sketch, if Adam is not in computer science, another field might still fit well but less so. Letâ€™s assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.35 \).

Again, we are comparing relative probabilities, so Bayes' theorem simplifies to comparing \( P(H|E) \) values directly:

### Relative Probabilities

To find the relative probabilities:
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) \propto P(E|\text{business administration}) P(\text{business administration}) \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) \propto P(E|\text{computer science}) P(\text{computer science}) \]

### Computation
For business administration:
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) \propto 0.05 \times 0.15 = 0.0075 \]

For computer science:
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) \propto 0.75 \times 0.20 = 0.15 \]

### Final Relative Probabilities
Normalizing them for the sake of comparison:
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.0075}{0.0075 + 0.15} \approx 0.047 \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.15}{0.0075 + 0.15} \approx 0.953 \]

Putting them into the required format:

"business administration": 0.047,
