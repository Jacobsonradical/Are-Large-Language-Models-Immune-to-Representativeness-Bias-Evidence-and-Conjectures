Sure, I can walk through the calculations for you using Bayes' Rule for both fields, computer science and business administration.

### Computer Science
1. **P(H_computer_science)**: This is the prior probability of Adam being in computer science. Let's assume this is relatively high as computer science is a popular field.
   - Estimate: 0.2 (20%)

2. **P(E|H_computer_science)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in computer science. Adam shows traits like high intelligence and an interest in solving puzzles, which could be common in this field.
   - Estimate: 0.6

3. **P(E|\neg H_computer_science)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in computer science. His traits could fit other fields as well.
   - Estimate: 0.3

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Since we don't know P(E), we'll assess the relative probability:
\[ P(H_computer_science|E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.12}{P(E)} \]

### Business Administration
1. **P(H_business_administration)**: This is the prior probability of Adam being in business administration, a popular graduate field but less aligned with Adam's traits.
   - Estimate: 0.1 (10%)

2. **P(E|H_business_administration)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in business administration. Traits like a love for animals and nature seem less aligned with this field.
   - Estimate: 0.2

3. **P(E|\neg H_business_administration)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in business administration. His traits fit other fields much better.
   - Estimate: 0.4

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Since we don't know P(E), we'll assess the relative probability:
\[ P(H_business_administration|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.02}{P(E)} \]

Now we compare the relative probabilities:

{
  "computer science": \(\frac{0.12}{P(E)}\) which simplifies to approximately **0.6** if P(E) normalizes the probabilities greater.
  "business administration": \(\frac{0.02}{P(E)}\) which simplifies to approximately **0.1**.
}

Thus, relativity shows a stronger likelihood for Adam being in computer science based on his personality sketch.

{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
