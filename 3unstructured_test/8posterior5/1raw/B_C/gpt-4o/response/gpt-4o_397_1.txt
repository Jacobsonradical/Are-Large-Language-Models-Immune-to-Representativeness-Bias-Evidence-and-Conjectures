To evaluate the likelihood that Adam was enrolled in either Business Administration or Computer Science given his personality sketch (E), we need to make some reasonable assumptions based on the typical traits and skills associated with each field. We will use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of H given E.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing E given H.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of H.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of E.

We do not have actual values for these probabilities, so we can make reasonable estimates.

### Business Administration:
- \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): Assume a moderate prior probability, as business administration is a common graduate field. Let's say 0.15 (15%).
- \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): Consider the personality sketch. While curiosity, empathy, and intelligence could be useful in business administration, not all traits align perfectly (e.g., love for animals, interest in nature, and puzzles). Let's estimate 0.20 (20%).
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \): Given the wide range of other fields Adam could be in, let's assume the likelihood of E given not Business Administration is 0.10 (10%).

### Computer Science:
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): Assume a moderate prior probability as well, given the popularity of the field. Let's say 0.20 (20%).
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): Adam's curiosity about nature, love for puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts fit quite well with computer science. Let's estimate 0.50 (50%).
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \): Again, considering the wide range of other fields and the specific personality sketch, let's assume the likelihood of E given not Computer Science is 0.10 (10%).

Let's compute the posterior probabilities using Bayes' rule:

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}} | E) = \frac{P(E | H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}} | E) = \frac{0.20 \cdot 0.15}{0.20 \cdot 0.15 + 0.50 \cdot 0.20 + ...} \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}} | E) = \frac{P(E | H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}} | E) = \frac{0.50 \cdot 0.20}{0.20 \cdot 0.15 + 0.50 \cdot 0.20 + ...} \]

To compare the probabilities without the exact normalization, consider the relative strengths:

{
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.20 \cdot 0.15}{0.20 \cdot 0.15 + 0.50 \cdot 0.20 + ...} = \text{an estimated relative value within the range 0.08 to 0.12}\),
  "computer science": \( \frac{0.50 \cdot 0.20}{0.20 \cdot 0.15 + 0.50 \cdot 0.20 + ...} = \text{an estimated relative value within the range 0.35 to 0.45}\)
}

Thus, the approximate posterior probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": "0.10",
  "computer science": "0.40"
}
