Sure, let's break it down following the steps outlined:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in each field. Since the information provided does not specify the exact likelihoods, we'll make estimates based on general trends.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the evidence given the hypothesis. This means the probability that Adam's personality traits fit someone enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the evidence given not the hypothesis. This means the probability that Adam's personality traits fit someone not enrolled in that field.

For simplicity, let's make educated guesses:

**Computer Science:**
- \( P(H) \): Let's assume the chance Adam is enrolled in Computer Science is moderate. We'll estimate it as 0.3.
- \( P(E|H) \): Adam's intellect, puzzle-solving skills, and interest in abstract concepts fit well with Computer Science. We'll estimate a high probability of 0.7.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Consider the likelihood that a graduate student with his traits might be in another field rather than Computer Science. We'll estimate 0.4.

**Business Administration:**
- \( P(H) \): We'll assume a lower baseline chance for Business Administration based on Adam's profile. We'll estimate it as 0.1.
- \( P(E|H) \): His traits (empathy, love for nature and animals) might be less typical for Business Administration compared to other fields, so we'll estimate a lower probability of 0.2.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that a graduate student with his traits might be in another field rather than Business Administration. We'll estimate 0.5.

Next, using Bayes' Rule:

\( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)} \)

For Computer Science:
- Numerator: \( P(E|H) * P(H) = 0.7 * 0.3 = 0.21 \)
- Denominator: \( P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|\neg H) * P(\neg H) = 0.21 + (0.4 * 0.7) = 0.21 + 0.28 = 0.49 \)
- \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.21}{0.49} \approx 0.428 \)

For Business Administration:
- Numerator: \( P(E|H) * P(H) = 0.2 * 0.1 = 0.02 \)
- Denominator: \( P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|\neg H) * P(\neg H) = 0.02 + (0.5 * 0.9) = 0.02 + 0.45 = 0.47 \)
- \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.47} \approx 0.043 \)

So the results are as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.428,
  "business administration": 0.043
}
