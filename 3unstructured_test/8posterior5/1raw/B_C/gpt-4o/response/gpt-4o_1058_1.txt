To apply Bayes' Rule and calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \), we use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to estimate the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the evidence E given hypothesis H.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the evidence E given the negation of H.
4. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of evidence E occurring, calculated as a weighted sum of \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

### Estimations

#### Business Administration:
- **P(H)**: Business administration is a common graduate field, but it might not be the most likely for someone with Adam's personality and interests.
  \[ P(H) \approx 0.2 \]
- **P(E|H)**: The personality traits such as strong empathy and appreciation for hard work could match business administration, but the traits related to curiosity about nature, love for animals, and solving puzzles are less correlated.
  \[ P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \]
- **P(E|\neg H)**: For other fields, especially ones more aligned with Adam's interests, such as environmental science or biology, the traits would be more common.
  \[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \]

#### Computer Science:
- **P(H)**: Computer science is a popular field, especially for highly intelligent individuals who enjoy solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts.
  \[ P(H) \approx 0.3 \]
- **P(E|H)**: An interest in puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts align well with computer science, although traits related to nature and animals are less aligned.
  \[ P(E|H) \approx 0.4 \]
- **P(E|\neg H)**: For fields that aren't computer science, especially those related to nature or business, these traits might not be as pronounced.
  \[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \]

### Calculations

#### Business Administration:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.4 = 0.44 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.44} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0909 \]

#### Computer Science:
\[ P(E) = 0.4 \cdot 0.3 + 0.3 \cdot 0.7 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.21 = 0.33 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{0.33} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.3636 \]
