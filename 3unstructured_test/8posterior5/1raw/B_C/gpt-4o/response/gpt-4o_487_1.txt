To determine \( P(H|E) \) (the probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field given his personality sketch), we need to consider three components for each field: \( P(H) \) (the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field), \( P(E|H) \) (the probability of observing the personality sketch if Adam was enrolled in the field), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) (the probability of observing the personality sketch if Adam was not enrolled in the field). 

We then use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have specific numerical values, we will make reasoned estimates based on the information provided.

### 1. Computer Science

#### Prior probability (\( P(H) \)):
Let's assume there is a moderate chance that a graduate student might be enrolled in Computer Science (since it is a popular field):  
\[ P(H_{CS}) \approx 0.2 \]

#### Likelihood (\( P(E|H_{CS}) \)):
Adam's traits like high intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts fit well with the typical skill set needed for Computer Science. 
\[ P(E|H_{CS}) \approx 0.6 \]

#### Complement (\( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \)):
Given there are many other fields that his personality could align with, the probability of his traits existing in other fields might be moderate:
\[ P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \approx 0.4 \]

### 2. Business Administration

#### Prior probability (\( P(H) \)):
Business Administration is another common field for graduate students:  
\[ P(H_{BA}) \approx 0.15 \]

#### Likelihood (\( P(E|H_{BA}) \)):
The traits like empathy, appreciation of hard work, and dedication align moderately well with Business Administration, though it might not usually emphasize curiosity about nature or solving puzzles as prominently as Computer Science does:
\[ P(E|H_{BA}) \approx 0.4 \]

#### Complement (\( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \)):
Again, considering many other graduate fields may fit his traits, gives moderate probability:
\[ P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \approx 0.5 \]

### Calculations

Using these estimates, apply Bayes' rule:

For Computer Science (CS):
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]

For Business Administration (BA):
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both and it will cancel out in normalization, we can compare the numerators directly:

Thus:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto 0.6 \times 0.2 = 0.12 \]

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto 0.4 \times 0.15 = 0.06 \]

Normalizing these:

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.06} = 0.667 \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.12 + 0.06} = 0.333 \]

So the resulting probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.667,
  "business administration": 0.333
}
