To assess \( P(H \mid E) \) for computer science and business administration using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E \mid H) \), and \( P(E \mid \neg H) \).

Let's denote the following:
- \( P(H_{CS}) \) and \( P(H_{BA}) \) are the prior probabilities that Adam was enrolled in computer science and business administration, respectively.
- \( P(E \mid H_{CS}) \) and \( P(E \mid H_{BA}) \) are the probabilities of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in computer science and business administration, respectively.
- \( P(E \mid \neg H_{CS}) \) and \( P(E \mid \neg H_{BA}) \) are the probabilities of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in computer science and business administration, respectively.

We also know that:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For our computation, since \( P(E) \) is constant across fields, we can focus on the numerator for comparison purposes:

\[ P(H \mid E) \propto P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]

### 1. Computer Science

- **Prior \( P(H_{CS}) \)**:
  Rough estimate: Given the broad interest in computer science and considering it as a popular graduate field, let's assume \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.2 \).

- **Likelihood \( P(E \mid H_{CS}) \)**:
  The traits described (curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving ability) might fit well with computer science, but a strong love for nature and animals might be less typical.
  Given this, let's assume \( P(E \mid H_{CS}) = 0.5 \).

- **Likelihood \( P(E \mid \neg H_{CS}) \)**:
  This will include fields that might better fit Adam's described personality, so let's say \( P(E \mid \neg H_{CS}) = 0.6 \).

Let's compute the proportional value:
\[ P(H_{CS} \mid E) \propto 0.5 \times 0.2 = 0.1 \]

### 2. Business Administration

- **Prior \( P(H_{BA}) \)**:
  Based on the popularity of the field, let's assume \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.15 \).

- **Likelihood \( P(E \mid H_{BA}) \)**:
  The traits described seem less aligned with business administration, which often involves a more extroverted and dynamic personality. So, let's assume \( P(E \mid H_{BA}) = 0.2 \).

- **Likelihood \( P(E \mid \neg H_{BA}) \)**:
  Similarly, let's consider fields that fit better with Adam’s personality, say \( P(E \mid \neg H_{BA}) = 0.6 \).

Let's compute the proportional value:
\[ P(H_{BA} \mid E) \propto 0.2 \times 0.15 = 0.03 \]

### Computing Final Probabilities

Note that we do not have the overall normalization constant \( P(E) \), so we will use the proportional values for comparison:

Now, for computer science:
\[ P(H_{CS} \mid E) \propto 0.1 \]

For business administration:
\[ P(H_{BA} \mid E) \propto 0.03 \]

### Conclusion

Given the values, it seems more likely that Adam would be in a field other than business administration. Computer science, while possible, is still not the perfect match considering his deep love for nature and animals. 

Here’s the answer in the requested format:
