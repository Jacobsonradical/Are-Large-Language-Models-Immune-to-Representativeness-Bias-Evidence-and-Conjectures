To calculate the probabilities, we need to break it down step by step according to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) (the prior probability of the personality sketch being true regardless of the field) is the same for both fields and doesn't affect the relative comparison, we can focus on calculating the numerator for each field.

Let's assume some reasonable estimates for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for the fields in question.

### Estimating P(H)
- \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) \): Since computer science is a common graduate field, let's assume a baseline probability of 0.2 (just a hypothetical value which means there’s a 20% chance a graduate student is in computer science).
- \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \): Business administration is also a popular graduate field, so let's assume the same baseline probability of 0.2.

### Estimating P(E|H)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \): Given Adam's interests (nature, animals, empathy), it's less likely he would have enrolled in computer science compared to other fields. We'll assume a lower conditional probability, something like 0.1.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \): Business administration also doesn't perfectly align with his personality sketch, but it might slightly fit better than computer science. We’ll assume a conditional probability of 0.2.

### Estimating P(E|\neg H)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{computer science}}) \): If Adam is not in computer science, he might be in a field more aligned with natural sciences or environmental studies. Let's assume this probability as 0.8.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business administration}}) \): If not in business administration, he might be in a field that fits more closely with his personality, so we assume 0.8 as well.

### Calculating P(H|E)
Using Bayes rule, we can calculate:

\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}})}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a common denominator, we can focus on the numerator for comparative purposes:

\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}}) \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \]

Substituting in the values:
\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.2 = 0.04 \]

So in summary, the values are:

{
  "computer science": 0.02,
  "business administration": 0.04
}

These values indicate the relative probabilities suggest that business administration is somewhat more likely than computer science given Adam's personality sketch.
