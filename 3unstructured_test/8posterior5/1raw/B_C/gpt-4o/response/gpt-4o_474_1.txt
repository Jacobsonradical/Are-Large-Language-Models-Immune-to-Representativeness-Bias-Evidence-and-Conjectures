To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to apply Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in the given field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality given the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality given any field other than \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality, which can be estimated but is not required if comparing relative probabilities. Instead, the normalization factor can be computed directly from the values.

Let's make some qualitative estimates for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each case, based on the given description of Adam and some reasonable assumptions about the distribution of graduate students in each field.

### Business Administration

1. **\( P(H) \)** (Prior probability):
   - Business administration is a common field, but not necessarily the most common for someone with Adam's interests.
   - Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

2. **\( P(E|H) \)** (Likelihood of Adam's personality given this field):
   - Interests in nature, empathy, and love for animals do not strongly correlate with a typical business administration profile.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.05 \).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)** (Likelihood of Adam's personality given any other field):
   - Given that Adam's personality may align more with fields like biology or environmental science, the likelihood is higher for these fields.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.25 \).

Using Bayes' rule, we compute:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalization factor, it will be considered later for relative comparison.

### Computer Science

1. **\( P(H) \)** (Prior probability):
   - Computer science is a popular field and might align with his intelligence and puzzle-solving interests.
   - Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

2. **\( P(E|H) \)** (Likelihood of Adam's personality given this field):
   - His intelligence and puzzle-solving skills are a good fit, but interests in nature and animals are not.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.15 \).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)** (Likelihood of Adam's personality given any other field):
   - Similar assumption as above, aligned more with non-technical fields.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.25 \).

Using Bayes' rule, we compute:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.15 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]

Now, let's compute the relative values considering the normalization factor cancels out:

- **Business Administration**: \( P(H|E) \propto 0.05 \times 0.1 = 0.005 \)
- **Computer Science**: \( P(H|E) \propto 0.15 \times 0.2 = 0.03 \)

Since \( P(E) \) is a common factor, it will be the same for both.

### Normalized Relative Probabilities

Let's normalize these to sum up to 1 for comparison (we only have two fields here):

1. Calculate sum of these intermediate probabilities:
   - Sum = \( 0.005 + 0.03 = 0.035 \)

2. Normalize:
   - Business Administration: \( \frac{0.005}{0.035} \approx 0.1429 \)
   - Computer Science: \( \frac{0.03}{0.035} \approx 0.8571 \)

So the final probabilities are approximately:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1429,
  "computer science": 0.8571
}
```
