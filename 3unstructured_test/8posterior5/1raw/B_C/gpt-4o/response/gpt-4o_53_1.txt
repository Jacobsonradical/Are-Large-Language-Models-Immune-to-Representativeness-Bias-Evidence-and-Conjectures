To apply Bayes' Rule for computing \(P(H|E)\), we need the following probabilities for each field of study:
1. \(P(H)\) - the prior probability of Adam being in that field.
2. \(P(E|H)\) - the likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given he is in that field.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\) - the likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given he is not in that field.

We then use Bayes' Rule:
\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

However, since \(P(E)\) is common for both calculations and we are interested in relative probabilities, we can reason using the likelihoods and priors directly. 

### Computer Science
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being in Computer Science. Considering the prevalence of computer science as a popular field, let's assume it is moderately likely, say 0.2.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam having the described personality traits if he is in computer science. Given his intelligence, affinity for abstract concepts, and problem-solving skills, this is quite high, say 0.7.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of Adam having the described personality traits if he is not in computer science. Given that many fields value intelligence and abstract thinking but not all overlap with his specific interests (nature, animals), this might be moderately lower, say 0.3.

Bayes Rule: \[P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H)\]
\[P(H|E) = 0.7 \times 0.2 = 0.14\]

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)**: Prior probability of Adam being in Business Administration. Considering the general appeal of this field and its broad applications, let's assume this is also moderately likely, say 0.2.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam having the described personality traits if he is in Business Administration. The traits mentioned (quiet, loves nature, animals) do not align as strongly with typical characteristics required for business administration, such as leadership and people management. Hence, let's assume it is lower, say 0.2.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: As above, the likelihood of Adam having these traits if not in Business Administration could be high due to the interdisciplinary nature of his interests, say 0.4.

Bayes Rule: \[P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H)\]
\[P(H|E) = 0.2 \times 0.2 = 0.04\]

The relative probability values for each field are:

{
  "computer science": 0.14,
  "business administration": 0.04
}

These values reflect the calculated likelihood that Adam's personality traits indicate he is more likely to be enrolled in computer science than in business administration, given the priors and assumed likelihoods.
