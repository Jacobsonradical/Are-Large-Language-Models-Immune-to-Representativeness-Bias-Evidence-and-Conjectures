To solve this problem, we will consider the probabilities for each field using the given personality sketch E and apply Bayes' theorem:

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

We don't need the exact value of \(P(E)\), since we are dealing with multiple fields and comparing their relative probabilities. Therefore, comparing the numerators (\(P(E|H) \cdot P(H)\)) will be sufficient for assessing their relative likelihoods.

### Field: Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: Probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration.
   - Business Administration is a fairly common graduate program, but given Adam's interest in nature, puzzles, and empathy, this background might make it less likely compared to other fields.
   - Let's assign a borderline value: \(P(H)=0.3\)

2. **P(E|H)**: Probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is in Business Administration.
   - While Business Administration can attract empathetic and dedicated individuals, the focus on nature and puzzles is less relevant.
   - Let's assign a lower value: \(P(E|H)=0.2\)

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in Business Administration.
   - This would be a more general probability and could be equal to his natural interests in other fields.
   - Letâ€™s assign: \(P(E|\neg H)=0.6\)

### Field: Computer Science

1. **P(H)**: Probability that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science.
   - Computer Science is a popular field, especially among individuals with high intelligence and interest in puzzles.
   - Let's assign a moderate value: \(P(H)=0.5\)

2. **P(E|H)**: Probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is in Computer Science.
   - High intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying puzzles align well with CS, although the focus on nature and plants is less direct.
   - Let's assign: \(P(E|H)=0.5\)

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in Computer Science.
   - Reduces to a more general interest pool. Assuming a bit more distant match: \(P(E|\neg H)=0.55\)


### Bayes' Rule Calculation:

For Business Administration:
\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}  \approx \frac{0.2 \times 0.3}{P(E)} = \frac{0.06}{P(E)}\]

For Computer Science:
\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}  \approx \frac{0.5 \times 0.5}{P(E)} = \frac{0.25}{P(E)}\]

Since we are only interested in the relative values and not the absolute probabilities, we can present as:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.06,
  "computer science": 0.25
}
```
These values represent the relative likelihoods based on Adam's personality sketch and the basic principles of Bayes' rule.
