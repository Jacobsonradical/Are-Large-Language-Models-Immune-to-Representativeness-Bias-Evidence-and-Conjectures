Let's break this down step-by-step for each field: computer science and business administration.

### Computer Science

1. **P(H): The prior probability of Adam being in Computer Science.**
   - Let's assume a moderate prior probability, due to the large number of students in this field. Let's take P(H) = 0.2 (or 20%).

2. **P(E|H): The probability of E given H, i.e., the likelihood of Adam having the described personality given that he is in Computer Science.**
   - Curiosity about nature: Not specifically related to computer science.
   - Enjoys solving puzzles: High (since solving puzzles relates to programming and algorithms).
   - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: High.
   - Strong empathy and warm heart: Not particularly relevant but not contradictory either.
   - Let's say P(E|H) = 0.5.

3. **P(E|\neg H): The probability of E given not H, i.e., the likelihood of the personality sketch if Adam was not in Computer Science.**
   - Considering other fields and how general attributes like high intelligence and empathy are, let's assume a moderate value. P(E|\neg H) = 0.2

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) can be derived from the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

Here, \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.8 \).

Therefore:

\[ P(E) = (0.5 \times 0.2) + (0.2 \times 0.8) = 0.1 + 0.16 = 0.26 \]

Finally:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \times 0.2}{0.26} \approx 0.3846 \]

### Business Administration

1. **P(H): The prior probability of Adam being in Business Administration.**
   - Let's assume a slightly lower prior probability due to fewer students choosing this field compared to computer science. Letâ€™s take P(H) = 0.1 (or 10%).

2. **P(E|H): The probability of Adam having the described personality given that he is in Business Administration.**
   - Curiosity about nature and plants: Unrelated.
   - Enjoys solving puzzles: Not typically associated with this field.
   - Empathy and warm heart: Relevant due to the emphasis on leadership and teamwork.
   - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: Relevant.
   - Appreciation for hard work: Relevant.
   - Let's say P(E|H) = 0.4.

3. **P(E|\neg H): The probability of E given not H.**
   - We can assume a moderate value. P(E|\neg H) = 0.2

Again using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(E) = (0.4 \times 0.1) + (0.2 \times 0.9) = 0.04 + 0.18 = 0.22 \]

So:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.1}{0.22} \approx 0.1818 \]

Thus, using the given workflow, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3846,
  "business administration": 0.1818
}
```
