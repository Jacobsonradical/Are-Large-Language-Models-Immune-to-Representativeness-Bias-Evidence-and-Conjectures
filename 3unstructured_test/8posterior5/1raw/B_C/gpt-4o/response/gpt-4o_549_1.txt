To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the following probabilities for each field (computer science and business administration):

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch (E) matches if he was enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch (E) matches if he was not enrolled in the given field.

We will use these to apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we do not have specific values, we will consider reasonable assumptions and provide educated estimates.

### Computer Science

- \( P(H) \): Let's assume the prior probability of being in computer science is moderate among graduate students, say 0.2.
- \( P(E|H) \): Adam's traits such as high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and problem-solving align moderately well with computer science, so say 0.4.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The chance of having Adam's personality traits without being in computer science is lower but not negligible, say 0.3.

### Business Administration

- \( P(H) \): Assume the prior probability of being in business administration is somewhat common among graduate students, say 0.15.
- \( P(E|H) \): Adam's deep love for animals, curiosity about nature, and empathy are less aligned with the usual traits in business administration, so say 0.1.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of having these traits without being in business administration is higher compared to P(E|H), say 0.3.

Now we can compute \( P(H|E) \):

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.08}{P(E)} \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} = \frac{0.015}{P(E)} \]

The normalization factor \( P(E) \) can be considered the same across the two fields for our comparison purposes.

Relative probabilities (unnormalized):
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} \propto 0.08 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} \propto 0.015 \]

Normalized probabilities (summing to one):
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.015} = \frac{0.08}{0.095} \approx 0.842 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} = \frac{0.015}{0.08 + 0.015} = \frac{0.015}{0.095} \approx 0.158 \]

Thus, the final answers are:

{
  "computer science": 0.842,
  "business administration": 0.158
}
