To answer this problem using Bayes' Theorem, we first need to define each component. Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's break down the problem field by field:

### Business Administration

1. **P(H) - Prior Probability of Business Administration:**
   - Reasoning: Business Administration is a relatively common field of study among graduate students.
   - Estimate: Let's assume this is around 0.1 (10%).

2. **P(E|H) - Probability of the Evidence Given Business Administration:**
   - Reasoning: The traits described (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy) don't strongly align with typical profiles of business students.
   - Estimate: Let's assume this is around 0.02 (2%).

3. **P(E|¬H) - Probability of the Evidence Given Not Business Administration:**
   - Reasoning: Since there are numerous other graduate fields that might align better with Adam's description, the probability of observing these traits formed from the rest pool is higher.
   - Estimate: Let's assume this is around 0.5 (50%).

4. **P(E) - Total Probability of the Evidence:**
   - This is the normalizing factor. Given no special information besides what's provided, assume there are many fields potentially in the consideration.
   - Approximation: This is harder to estimate exactly but for convenience, let's assume it is 0.2 (20%).

   Using Bayes' Rule:
   \[
   P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.02 \times 0.1}{0.2} = 0.01
   \]

### Computer Science

1. **P(H) - Prior Probability of Computer Science:**
   - Reasoning: Computer Science is also a commonly chosen field among graduate students.
   - Estimate: Let's assume this is around 0.1 (10%).

2. **P(E|H) - Probability of the Evidence Given Computer Science:**
   - Reasoning: Adam's high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving tendencies align well with Computer Science.
   - Estimate: Let's assume this is around 0.3 (30%).

3. **P(E|¬H) - Probability of the Evidence Given Not Computer Science:**
   - Reasoning: Given the alignment of Adam's traits with multiple fields, this still might have a higher probability.
   - Estimate: Let's assume this is around 0.4 (40%).

4. **P(E) - Total Probability of the Evidence:**
   - This is same as above; assume it is 0.2 (20%).

   Using Bayes' Rule:
   \[
   P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.1}{0.2} = 0.15
   \]

Putting these together:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.01,
  "computer science": 0.15
}
```

These values are indicative and based on assumptions made from the provided personality sketch. Though they may not add up to 1, they give a relative sense of how likely Adam is to be enrolled in each field, given his personality traits.
