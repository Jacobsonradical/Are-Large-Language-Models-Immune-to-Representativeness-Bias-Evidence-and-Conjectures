To calculate the probability that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or computer science given his personality sketch, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify \(P(H)\), the prior probability of Adam being in each field before considering his personality sketch.**
2. **Determine \(P(E|H)\), the probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in the field \(H\).**
3. **Establish \(P(E|\neg H)\), the probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in the field \(H\).**
4. **Use Bayes' theorem to compute \(P(H|E)\), the probability he is in the field given his personality sketch.**

Given:
- \(P(E)\) is the total probability of Adam's personality sketch, which remains constant for our calculations and cancels out in Bayes’ rule.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Business Administration

1. **Estimate \(P(H)\):**
   - Graduate students in business administration form a significant but specific portion of the graduate population. Let's assume \(P(H)\) to be relatively moderate at 0.15.

2. **Estimate \(P(E|H)\):**
   - Given Adam's curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals, these characteristics are less common in business administration but not impossible. Let’s assume \(P(E|H)\) to be 0.1.

3. **Estimate \(P(E|\neg H)\):**
   - For all other fields, Adam’s personality is quite common in fields like environmental science, psychology, or biology. Therefore, \(P(E|\neg H)\) might be higher, say 0.3.

Apply Bayes' rule:
\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ \approx \frac{0.1 \times 0.15}{0.3} = 0.05 \]

#### Computer Science

1. **Estimate \(P(H)\):**
   - Graduate students in computer science are a large group in many universities. Let’s assume \(P(H)\) to be relatively high, perhaps 0.25.

2. **Estimate \(P(E|H)\):**
   - High intelligence, abstract thinking, and puzzle-solving are traits often found in computer science students. Nature curiosity and empathy are slightly less prevalent but still possible. Let's estimate \(P(E|H)\) to be 0.2.

3. **Estimate \(P(E|\neg H)\):**
   - As above, for all other fields excluding computer science, Adam’s personality might still fit quite well, hence \(P(E|\neg H)\) would also be 0.3.

Apply Bayes' rule:
\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ \approx \frac{0.2 \times 0.25}{0.3} \approx 0.17 \]

### Final Probabilities
Therefore, based on the personality sketch \(E\) and the fields considered:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.17
}
```

These values show that given Adam's personality traits, he is more likely to be enrolled in computer science than business administration among the fields considered.
