To compute the probabilities, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which is formulated as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that there are other fields of study not being considered, we will not compute \( P(E) \) explicitly but rather focus on the comparative values.

### Assumptions:

1. \( P(H) \) - Prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in a given field.
    * Let's assume that the fields of study are all equally likely, without loss of generality. Therefore:
    * \( P(\text{computer science}) = P(\text{business administration}) = 0.5 \)

2. \( P(E|H) \) - The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in a specific field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is NOT in a specific field.

### Evaluation:

- **Computer Science:**
  1. \( P(\text{E|computer science}) \):
      * High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts align with a computer science field.
      * Curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals are less directly related but still possible.
      * We'll estimate this to be reasonably high, say 0.6.
  2. \( P(\text{E}|\neg\text{computer science}) \):
      * Considering other fields might also align with these traits, let’s estimate this to be moderately high, say 0.4.
 
- **Business Administration:**
  1. \( P(\text{E|business administration}) \):
      * Traits like high intelligence, empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication align with business administration.
      * Less focus on nature and animals, but still possible.
      * We'll estimate this to be moderately probable, say 0.4.
  2. \( P(\text{E}|\neg\text{business administration}) \):
      * Given that empathy and intelligence are relevant in many fields outside business administration, let’s estimate this to be 0.5.

### Calculation Using Bayes' Theorem:

To simplify comparisons (since we don't need absolute probabilities but rather relative):

\[ P(\text{computer science|E}) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} \]
Given \( P(E) \) normalization constant, we'll focus on the numerator for comparison:
\[ P(\text{computer science|E}) \propto P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) \]
\[ P(\text{computer science|E}) \propto 0.6 * 0.5 = 0.3 \]

\[ P(\text{business administration|E}) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{business administration|E}) \propto P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) \]
\[ P(\text{business administration|E}) \propto 0.4 * 0.5 = 0.2 \]

### Results:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

These values are comparative and illustrate that, based on the given personality sketch, Adam is slightly more likely to be in computer science than in business administration.
