To assess the probabilities of Adam being enrolled in "business administration" or "computer science" given his personality sketch, we can utilize Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \), we do not have specific values for all these probabilities.

Let's go step by step to estimate these values:

1. **business administration:**
   - **P(H) (Prior probability):** This is the prior likelihood that any graduate student is enrolled in business administration. Suppose it is around 0.1.
   - **P(E|H):** This is the likelihood that given Adam is in business administration, he exhibits these personality traits. Business administration typically attracts individuals who are good at abstract concepts and appreciate hard work. However, less so for curiosity about nature and love for animals. Let's estimate it at 0.2.
   - **P(E|¬H):** This is the likelihood that these personality traits are seen in someone not enrolled in business administration. There are many fields that might attract individuals with these traits, so we can estimate it at 0.6.

2. **computer science:**
   - **P(H) (Prior probability):** This is the prior likelihood that any graduate student is enrolled in computer science. Suppose it is around 0.15.
   - **P(E|H):** This is the likelihood that given Adam is in computer science, he exhibits these traits. Computer science attracts individuals who are intelligent, good at puzzles, and understand abstract concepts. Let's estimate it at 0.4.
   - **P(E|¬H):** This is the likelihood that these personality traits are seen in someone not enrolled in computer science. Again, we estimate it at 0.6.

Given that we are not normalizing across all possible fields, we’ll directly use our estimates:

1. **business administration:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{0.2 \times 0.1 + 0.6 \times (1 - 0.1)} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.54} \approx 0.0357 \]

2. **computer science:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.15}{0.4 \times 0.15 + 0.6 \times (1 - 0.15)} \approx \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.51} \approx 0.1059 \]

So the approximate posterior probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": 0.0357,
  "computer science": 0.1059
}
