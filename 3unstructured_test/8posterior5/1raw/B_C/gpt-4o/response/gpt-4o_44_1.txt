To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate the following probabilities for each field:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in that field.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Because \( P(E) \) is the same for all hypotheses and will cancel out when we compare them, we only need to focus on the numerator \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) to understand the relative probabilities.

### Computer Science
- **P(H):** Assuming a uniform prior for simplicity, let's assign it a base value (let's say 0.1 for this example).
- **P(E|H):** Given Adam's interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence, it's reasonably high. Let's say 0.6.
- **P(E|\neg H):** We need to consider if Adam was in any field other than computer science, how likely his traits would align with a different field. Let’s say 0.4 as Adam's personality aligns somewhat with the traits needed in computer science.

### Business Administration
- **P(H):** Assigning the same base value as above, so let's use 0.1 as well for consistency.
- **P(E|H):** His personality traits (strong empathy, warm heart) might be somewhat fitting for business administration, but his deep love for animals and nature would make it less likely. Let’s estimate 0.3.
- **P(E|\neg H):** If Adam was not in business administration but another field, considering all possible fields other than business administration, let's use 0.5 as a rough estimate.

### Computations
We will use:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

For computer science:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} \propto 0.6 \cdot 0.1 = 0.06 \]

For business administration:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} \propto 0.3 \cdot 0.1 = 0.03 \]

### Normalization
To get the final probabilities, we can compare the two values directly, assuming only these two fields:

- Total = 0.06 + 0.03 = 0.09

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} = \frac{0.06}{0.09} = 0.67 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} = \frac{0.03}{0.09} = 0.33 \]

Therefore, the likelihoods for Adam being in these fields are:

{
  "computer science": 0.67,
  "business administration": 0.33
}
