To solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem, we need to define the following:

- \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
- \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood of observing the personality (E) given that Adam was enrolled in the specific field (H).
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The likelihood of observing the personality (E) given that Adam was not enrolled in the specific field.
- \(P(H|E)\): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the specific field given the observed personality (E).

To make an informed judgment, let's assume some reasonable values based on the typical characteristics and student distributions in these fields. Note that these values are estimated for demonstration purposes and are not derived from real data.

1. **Business Administration**:
   - \(P(H)\): Let's assume business administration is a moderately popular field among graduate students. Say, \(P(H) = 0.1\).
   - \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood that someone in business administration matches the personality sketch. This could be low, as business administration students might not typically have the specific interests in nature, animals, and puzzles that Adam has. Let's assume \(P(E|H) = 0.1\).
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\): This is the likelihood that someone who is not in business administration has the personality sketch of Adam. Given that there are many fields where Adam's personality might fit better, let's say \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.2\).

   Using Bayes' Theorem:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   Since \(P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)\):
   \[
   P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.1) + (0.2 \times 0.9) = 0.01 + 0.18 = 0.19
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.1}{0.19} = \frac{0.01}{0.19} \approx 0.0526
   \]

2. **Computer Science**:
   - \(P(H)\): Let's assume computer science is a very popular field among graduate students. Say, \(P(H) = 0.2\).
   - \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood that someone in computer science matches the personality sketch. This could be higher since computer science students might have a curiosity for puzzles and abstract concepts. Let's assume \(P(E|H) = 0.3\).
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\): This likelihood is similar to the previous case, so \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.2\).

   Using Bayes' Theorem:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   Since \(P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)\):
   \[
   P(E) = (0.3 \times 0.2) + (0.2 \times 0.8) = 0.06 + 0.16 = 0.22
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{0.22} = \frac{0.06}{0.22} \approx 0.2727
   \]

Therefore, the posterior probabilities are as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0526,
  "computer science": 0.2727
}
```
