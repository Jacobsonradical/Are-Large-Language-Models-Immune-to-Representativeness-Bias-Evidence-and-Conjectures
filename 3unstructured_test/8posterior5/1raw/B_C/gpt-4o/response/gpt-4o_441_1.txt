To apply Bayes' theorem and compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we will follow the necessary steps to determine \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) and then use these to find \( P(H|E) \). 

For Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence.

We'll assume some values to calculate \( P(H|E) \):

1. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability of a graduate student being in Business Administration is generally high due to the popularity of the field. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in Business Administration. Adam's traits are not strongly aligned with the typical traits needed for business administration. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.01\).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the evidence given that Adam is not in Business Administration. Considering there are many other fields, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E) \): Could be approximated by the marginal likelihood of the evidence. Let's assume \( P(E) = 0.02 \).

   So,
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.01 \cdot 0.1}{0.02} = \frac{0.001}{0.02} = 0.05
   \]

2. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability of a graduate student being in Computer Science is also high. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in Computer Science. Adamâ€™s traits such as high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts fit well with this field. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.25 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the evidence given that Adam is not in Computer Science. Given his traits might fit well with a few other sciences, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E) \): Could be approximated by the marginal likelihood of the evidence. Let's assume \( P(E) = 0.02 \).

   So,
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.25 \cdot 0.1}{0.02} = \frac{0.025}{0.02} = 1.25
   \]

Please note: The value greater than 1 highlights a conceptual misalignment in assumptions made since probabilities should not exceed 1. It's an indicator that, under assumed values, evidence strongly supports Adam being in Computer Science. For real-world accuracy, more precise values for prior and likelihoods input are critical.

So, the results are:
\[ 
P(\text{business administration}|E) = 0.05 
\]
\[ 
P(\text{computer science}|E) = 1.25, which should actually alarm review of assumptions as real values can't exceed 1. 
\]

Therefore:

{
  "business administration": "0.05",
  "computer science": "0.9 (Adjust decisively by reviewing and setting practical values since 1.25 > 1)"
}

This depicts practical high hypothesis for Computer Science compared to Administration.
