To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given the personality sketch \( E \), we need to follow these steps:

1. Estimate the prior \( P(H) \) that Adam was enrolled in each field.
2. Estimate the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of the personality sketch given each field.
3. Estimate the likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \) for all other fields combined.
4. Use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \).

### Field: Computer Science

1. **Prior \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \)**:
   - Let's assume the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science is moderate due to the field's commonness among graduate students.
   - \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.3 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \)**:
   - Given Adam’s high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, there is a good fit with computer science. However, his strong empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature are less typical for this field.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.4 \)

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \)**:
   - For all other fields combined, the likelihood of having similar traits might depend on the diversity of those fields. Given Adam's traits are quite specific and some fields may align better than computer science.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.6 \)

4. **Posterior \( P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \)**:
   - Using Bayes' rule:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{CS}})}
   \]
   - Substituting the values:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{0.4 \cdot 0.3 + 0.6 \cdot 0.7} = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.42} = \frac{0.12}{0.54} \approx 0.222
   \]
   - \( P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx 0.222 \)

### Field: Business Administration

1. **Prior \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \)**:
   - Let’s assume the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration is moderate.
   - \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.2 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \)**:
   - Traits such as high intelligence, problem-solving abilities, and appreciation for hard work and dedication fit well. However, Adam’s strong empathy and love for animals and nature are less typical for this field.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.3 \)

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \)**:
   - For all other fields combined, the likelihood of having similar traits as dictated by business administration.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.6 \)

4. **Posterior \( P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \)**:
   - Using Bayes' rule:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{BA}})}
   \]
   - Substituting the values:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.6 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.48} = \frac{0.06}{0.54} \approx 0.111
   \]
   - \( P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \approx 0.111 \)

So the results can be summarized as:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.222,
  "business administration": 0.111
}
```

These ratios suggest that given Adam's personality traits, he is more likely to be enrolled in computer science than business administration, but there are other fields which are not considered here that might be an even better fit.
