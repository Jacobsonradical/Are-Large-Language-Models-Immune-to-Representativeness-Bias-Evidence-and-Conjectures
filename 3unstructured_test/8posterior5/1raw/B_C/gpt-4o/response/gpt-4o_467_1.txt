Sure, I'll use Bayes' theorem for the computations. Bayes' theorem is stated as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For the purposes of this hypothesis, let's assume the following:

- \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.1 \): Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.2 \): Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(\neg H_{BA}) = 0.9 \)
- \( P(\neg H_{CS}) = 0.8 \)

These are arbitrary prior probabilities but are reasonable starting points. 

Now let's estimate \( P(E|H) \):
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.1 \): Probability of Adam having the described personality sketch given he was in business administration. Students in this field might have some curiosity and intelligence but less emphasis on nature, animals, and empathy.
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.4 \): Probability of Adam having the described personality sketch given he was in computer science. This field can attract individuals who enjoy puzzles and abstract concepts.

Next, estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \):
- \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.7 \): Probability of Adam having the described personality sketch given he was not in business administration. Given his interests align more with fields focusing on nature or scientific inquiry.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.5 \): Probability of Adam having the described personality sketch given he was not in computer science. Other fields such as biology might fit Adam's profile better.

Finally, use these to calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \cdot P(\neg H_{BA}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.1) + (0.7 \cdot 0.9) = 0.01 + 0.63 = 0.64 \]

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \cdot P(\neg H_{CS}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.4 \cdot 0.2) + (0.5 \cdot 0.8) = 0.08 + 0.4 = 0.48 \]

Use these to plug into Bayes rule:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.64} = \frac{0.01}{0.64} \approx 0.0156 \]

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.48} = \frac{0.08}{0.48} \approx 0.1667 \]

So, the probabilities are approximately:

```JSON
{
  "business administration": 0.0156,
  "computer science": 0.1667
}
```

These probabilities suggest that Adam is much more likely to be in computer science than in business administration given his described personality sketch.
