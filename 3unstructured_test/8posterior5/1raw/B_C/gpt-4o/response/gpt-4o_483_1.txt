To calculate \(P(H|E)\) for each field using Bayes' Theorem, we need to know:

- \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \(P(E|H)\): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch \(E\) given that he was enrolled in that field.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch \(E\) given that he was not enrolled in that field.
- \(P(E)\): The overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch \(E\).

Bayes' Theorem is formulated as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \(P(E)\) is common to both fields and we are comparing them, it will cancel out when we calculate the ratios, so we can focus on the numerators.

Let's define the values step-by-step for the fields of computer science and business administration:

### Computer Science:
- \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. We assume equal priors (without additional information) for simplicity. Let's assume \(P(H)\) is around 0.1 (as there are numerous fields).
- \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood of observing Adam's traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, high intelligence, etc.) given he is in computer science. We give this a moderate likelihood, say 0.3.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of observing these traits if Adam is not in computer science. This depends on the distribution of these traits across fields. We might assume this to be lower for comparison, say 0.2.

### Business Administration:
- \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration would similarly be around 0.1.
- \(P(E|H)\): The probability of observing Adam's traits given he is in business administration appears to be lower as these traits aren't typically associated with business administration. We might set it to 0.1.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): As before, this might be 0.2.

Let's compute \(P(H|E)\):

For computer science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.3 \cdot 0.1 = 0.03 \]

For business administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.1 = 0.01 \]

We see that the posterior probability is relatively higher for computer science.

The final answers should appear relative to each other (without normalization):

{
  "computer science": "0.03",
  "business administration": "0.01"
