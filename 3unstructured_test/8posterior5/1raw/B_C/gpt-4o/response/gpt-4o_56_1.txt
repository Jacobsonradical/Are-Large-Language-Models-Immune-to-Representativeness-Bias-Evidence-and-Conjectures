To apply Bayes' theorem for the hypotheses that Adam was enrolled in computer science or business administration, we'll use the given probabilities. Let’s break it down clearly:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) = Prior probability that Adam was in that field (computer science or business administration).
- \( P(E|H) \) = Probability that we would observe Adam's personality sketch if he were in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) = Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he were not in that field.
- \( P(E) \) = Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch (can be derived based on different fields).

Let’s consider some hypothetical values for these probabilities based on reasonable assumptions.

**For Computer Science:**

1. **P(H)**: Let’s assume the probability that a student is enrolled in computer science is 0.15 (15%).
2. **P(E|H)**: Given Adam’s high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, it is somewhat likely he could be in computer science. Let’s assume this is 0.4 (40%).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: This is more challenging, but assuming Adam could also fit well into various other fields (given the broad application of his skills and personality traits), let’s assume this to be 0.2 (20%).

**For Business Administration:**

1. **P(H)**: Assume the probability that a student is in business administration is 0.1 (10%).
2. **P(E|H)**: Given Adam’s warm heart and empathy, these are traits that are valuable in business related to leadership and management. Nevertheless, his specific traits like curiosity about nature and puzzles might not be as strongly correlated. Let’s assume this is 0.2 (20%).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Similar argument as above since he fits well into various roles, let’s assume this to be 0.3 (30%).

Now let's compute the posterior probabilities:

**For Computer Science:**

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Assuming \( P(E) \) is the same for both calculations, we don't need the exact value for comparison, we use a proportional comparison:

\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) \propto P(E|\text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science}) \]
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) \propto 0.4 \cdot 0.15 \]
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) \propto 0.06 \]

**For Business Administration:**

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Assuming \( P(E) \) is the same, we'll use proportional comparison:

\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) \propto P(E|\text{Business Administration}) \cdot P(\text{Business Administration}) \]
\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.1 \]
\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) \propto 0.02 \]

For the sake of comparison, normalizing these values would give us:

\[
\begin{aligned}
    P(\text{Computer Science}|E) &= \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.02} = \frac{0.06}{0.08} = 0.75 \\
    P(\text{Business Administration}|E) &= \frac{0.02}{0.06 + 0.02} = \frac{0.02}{0.08} = 0.25
\end{aligned}
\]

Thus, the comparison indicates a higher likelihood for:

{
  "computer science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.25
}
