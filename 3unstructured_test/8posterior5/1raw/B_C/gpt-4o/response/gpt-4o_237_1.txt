To estimate \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study, we will use Bayes' Rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields, it will cancel out in a comparative analysis. Therefore, we will focus on estimating \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each hypothesis:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): Let’s assume the base rate probability of any given graduate student being in computer science is about average for the distribution of graduate fields. Computer Science is a popular field, so let's estimate \( P(H) \) to be around \( 0.15 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given the personality sketch, Adam seems to have a profile that fits well with some characteristics beneficial to computer science, such as high intelligence and enjoying solving puzzles. However, the strong empathy and love for animals are not typically associated with the stereotype of a computer science student. Overall, let's estimate \( 0.5 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): This is the likelihood of the personality sketch for someone not in computer science. This could be quite high given that the traits are common in many fields. Let’s estimate it as \( 0.6 \).

\[
P(H|E)_{CS} \propto P(E|H)_{CS} \cdot P(H)_{CS} = 0.5 \times 0.15 = 0.075
\]

2. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H) \): The base rate probability of being in business administration might also be around average. Business Administration is another popular graduate field. We can estimate \( P(H) \) to be around \( 0.15 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The personality traits such as strong empathy, a warm heart, and appreciation for dedication might fit well into business administration, focusing on management and leadership qualities. Still, strong interest in nature and love for animals might not directly align as much. Let’s estimate \( 0.6 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): This would be relatively high as well, given the traits match many other fields. Let's estimate \( 0.6 \).

\[
P(H|E)_{BA} \propto P(E|H)_{BA} \cdot P(H)_{BA} = 0.6 \times 0.15 = 0.09
\]

By comparing the two:

\[
\frac{P(H|E)_{CS}}{P(H|E)_{BA}} = \frac{0.075}{0.09} \approx 0.833
\]

This comparison indicates that the posterior probability for studying computer science is slightly less than that for business administration given the personality sketch of Adam. So, our estimates for the probabilities would be:

\[
{
  "computer science": 0.075,
  "business administration": 0.09
}
\]

Note: These values are approximations based on the provided description and general assumptions, so actual probabilities might differ with additional context or data.
