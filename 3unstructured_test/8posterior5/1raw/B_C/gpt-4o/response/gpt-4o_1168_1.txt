To apply Bayes' rule to calculate \( P(H|E) \), we need to know the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each hypothesis. Since we have to estimate these values without explicit data, we'll use reasonable assumptions based on the provided personality sketch and general knowledge.

Firstly, let's define the components:

1. **P(H)** (Prior Probability): The probability that Adam would enroll in the given field before considering his personality sketch.
2. **P(E|H)** (Likelihood): The probability of Adam having his described personality sketch given that he is enrolled in the given field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)** (Evidence): The probability of Adam having his described personality sketch given that he is enrolled in any other field.

### 1. Computer Science

#### Estimates:
- **P(H)**: Prior probability of a student enrolling in computer science. As a rough estimate, let's assume this to be around 0.3, since computer science is quite a popular field.
- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he's in computer science. Considering his high intelligence and abstract thinking, which align well with computer science, plus a curiosity about nature and solving puzzles, I would estimate this to be around 0.6.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he's in a different field. Many fields could have similar curiosity and intelligence traits, so this might be around 0.2.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since \( P(E) \) can be approximated by \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H)) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(E) = 0.6 \cdot 0.3 + 0.2 \cdot 0.7 = 0.18 + 0.14 = 0.32 \]

Now:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.3}{0.32} = \frac{0.18}{0.32} \approx 0.5625 \]

### 2. Business Administration

#### Estimates:
- **P(H)**: Prior probability of a student enrolling in business administration. Let's estimate this to be around 0.2, as it is also a popular field but maybe slightly less so than computer science among highly intelligent students.
- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he's in business administration. While empathy and hard work align well with business administration, his curiosity about nature and puzzles might align less. I would estimate this to be around 0.3.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he's in a different field, again around 0.2 as above.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(E) = 0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.2 \cdot 0.8 = 0.06 + 0.16 = 0.22 \]

Now:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.22} = \frac{0.06}{0.22} \approx 0.2727 \]

### Results:

 
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.5625,
  "business administration": 0.2727
}
```

These values represent the posterior probabilities that Adam was enrolled in computer science or business administration given his personality sketch.
