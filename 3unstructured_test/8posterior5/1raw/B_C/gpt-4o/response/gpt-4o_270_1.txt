Sure, let's break it down using Bayes' rule.

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch E.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in that specific field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that specific field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch E.

While we may not have exact mathematical values for all these terms, we can make qualitative judgments based on the given personality traits and the typical nature of the fields.

### Business Administration
**P(H):** 
Business Administration is a common field for graduate students. So, let's assume a moderate prior probability.

**P(E|H):** 
The likelihood that someone with Adam's personality sketch would enroll in Business Administration might be low. Adamâ€™s characteristics, such as a love for nature, a quiet demeanor, and a strong empathy, are not typically the main traits for a business administration focus, which usually emphasizes leadership, management, and outgoing personalities.

**P(E|\neg H):** 
Since this includes all other fields, including those more aligned with his personality, this is relatively high.

Using these qualitative assessments:
- \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \)  (assuming moderate prior probability)
- \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \) (less likely in Business Administration)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.9 \) (more likely in other fields)

### Computer Science
**P(H):**
Computer Science is also a common field for graduate students, especially for someone with high intelligence and interest in solving puzzles. This field has a moderate to high prior probability.

**P(E|H):** 
Adam's intelligence, love for puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts align well with Computer Science. So, this likelihood is relatively high.

**P(E|\neg H):** 
This again includes all other fields, but fields unrelated to his interests and personality traits would lower this probability.

Using these qualitative assessments:
- \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \)  (assuming higher prior probability)
- \( P(E|H) \approx 0.7 \) (more likely in Computer Science)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \) (relatively lower in other fields)

Now let's compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field.

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(Business Administration|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(Business Administration|E) \approx \frac{0.02}{P(E)} \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(Computer Science|E) \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(Computer Science|E) \approx \frac{0.21}{P(E)} \]

Given that \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields, we compare the numerators directly.

### Summary
{
  "business administration": "around 0.1",
  "computer science": "around 0.7"
