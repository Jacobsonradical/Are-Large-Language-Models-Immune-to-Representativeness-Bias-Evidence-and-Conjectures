To apply Bayes' theorem, we calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalization factor and not required to rank different probabilities, we'll focus on evaluating \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for each field. Here are my assumptions and estimations:

### Business Administration

**P(H):** This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Given the variety of graduate fields, let's assume it is relatively rare for someone with Adam's personality to enroll in this field. I'll estimate \( P(H) = 0.10 \).

**P(E|H):** This is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given enrollment in business administration. Business administration students generally may not have a strong focus on nature, animals, and abstract problem solving. I'll estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.10 \).

**P(E|\neg H):** This is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is not enrolled in business administration. Given his specific interests, it's more likely he is enrolled in another field. I'll estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.30 \).

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.10 \cdot 0.10 = 0.01 \]

### Computer Science

**P(H):** This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Given Adam's characteristics such as high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles, computer science seems like a plausible field. I'll estimate \( P(H) = 0.30 \).

**P(E|H):** This is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given enrollment in computer science. Computer science students often enjoy puzzles and abstract concepts, fitting well with Adam's attributes. I'll estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.60 \).

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.60 \cdot 0.30 = 0.18 \]

Here's the computed posterior probabilities based on above calculations:

{
  "business administration": 0.01,
  "computer science": 0.18
}

Note that these values are not normalized. The conclusions are relative indications of how likely each field is for Adam based on his personality sketch.
