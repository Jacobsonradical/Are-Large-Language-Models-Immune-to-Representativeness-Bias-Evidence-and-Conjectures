Sure, I'll provide my estimates for the probabilities and then apply Bayes' rule. Here's the process:

1. **P(H)**: Prior probability of Adam being in a given field based on general knowledge of graduate enrollments.
2. **P(E|H)**: Probability of observing the personality sketch given Adam is in the specified field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability of observing the personality sketch given Adam is not in the specified field.
4. **P(H|E)**: Posterior probability of Adam being in the specified field given the personality sketch (calculated using Bayes' rule).

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)**: Prior probability of Adam being in Business Administration (let's assume this is lower than general fields like computer sciences).
   - Estimate: 0.1
2. **P(E|H)**: Probability of the personality sketch given Adam is in Business Administration.
   - Empathy and understanding hard work fit, but less so curiosity about nature and love for animals. Estimate: 0.2
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability of the personality sketch given Adam is not in Business Administration.
   - Given many other fields (like biology/forestry) might better match this sketch, estimate: 0.8

### Computer Science
1. **P(H)**: Prior probability of Adam being in Computer Science (a common field).
   - Estimate: 0.2 
2. **P(E|H)**: Probability of the personality sketch given Adam is in Computer Science.
   - High intelligence and abstract thinking fit well, but less so curiosity about nature. Estimate: 0.4
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability of the personality sketch given Adam is not in Computer Science.
   - Other fields (like biology, environmental sciences) might also fit well. Estimate: 0.6

Using Bayes' rule: \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) * P(H)}{P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|\neg H) * P(\neg H)} \)

### Calculations:
1. **Business Administration**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 * 0.1}{0.2 * 0.1 + 0.8 * 0.9} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.72} = \frac{0.02}{0.74} \approx 0.027
   \]

2. **Computer Science**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 * 0.2}{0.4 * 0.2 + 0.6 * 0.8} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.48} = \frac{0.08}{0.56} \approx 0.143
   \]

### Final Answer:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.027,
  "computer science": 0.143
}
```
