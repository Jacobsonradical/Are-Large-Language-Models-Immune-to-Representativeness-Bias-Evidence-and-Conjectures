To apply Bayes' rule and compute the probabilities, let's quickly review the necessary components:

- **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
- **P(E|H):** The probability of the evidence given that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
- **P(E|¬H):** The probability of the evidence given that Adam was not enrolled in a particular field.
- **P(H|E):** The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given the evidence.

Let's start with plausible assumptions for the probabilities based on the information given:

1. **Business Administration:**

   - **P(H):** The prior probability of a graduate student being enrolled in Business Administration can be rough. If we assume an average distribution of fields, let's say P(H) = 0.1.
   - **P(E|H):** Given Adam's interests and characteristics, it seems less likely for him to be in Business Administration. Let's estimate this at P(E|H) = 0.05.
   - **P(E|¬H):** The probability of observing Adam's characteristics without him being in Business Administration is likely higher, maybe P(E|¬H) = 0.2.

   Now, applying Bayes' rule: 
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{0.05 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9}
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.18}
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{0.005}{0.185} ≈ 0.027
   \]

2. **Computer Science:**

   - **P(H):** The prior probability of a graduate student being enrolled in Computer Science also needs to be estimated. Let's assume an average distribution, similar to Business Administration, so P(H) = 0.1.
   - **P(E|H):** Given Adam's high intelligence, love for solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts, this seems plausible for Computer Science. Let's estimate P(E|H) = 0.5.
   - **P(E|¬H):** The probability of observing Adam's characteristics without him being in Computer Science could be similar in non-related fields. Let’s assume it at P(E|¬H) = 0.2.

   Now, applying Bayes' rule:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.1}{0.5 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9}
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{0.05}{0.05 + 0.18}
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{0.05}{0.23} ≈ 0.217
   \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.027,
  "computer science": 0.217
}
```

These values reflect the higher likelihood of Adam being enrolled in Computer Science over Business Administration based on his personality sketch.
