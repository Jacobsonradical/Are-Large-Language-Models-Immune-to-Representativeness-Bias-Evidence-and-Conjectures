To apply Bayes' rule and find \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we will need the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in that particular field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the personality traits given Adam is enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the personality traits given Adam is not enrolled in that field.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for all fields and we are comparing relative probabilities, we don't need to explicitly calculate it. We'll focus on the numerator, \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

**Key considerations for \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
- Business administration students may exhibit curiosity about nature, but this trait is not particularly indicative of this field.
- Computer science students may also possess high intelligence and be good at solving puzzles, making it a more likely field given Adam's traits.

### Business Administration

**Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
Let's assume the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration is moderate since a significant number of students choose this field.
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.15 \]

**Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
Since the personality traits (curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, empathy, love for animals) are not typical for business administration students:
\[ P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.05 \]

**Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
The likelihood of these traits given that Adam is not in business administration:
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.2 \]

### Computer Science

**Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
Let's assume the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science is moderate to high due to the field's popularity.
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.25 \]

**Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
The personality traits (solving puzzles, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts) are more indicative of computer science students:
\[ P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.3 \]

**Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
The likelihood of these traits given that Adam is not in computer science:
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.1 \]

### Calculation of \( P(H|E) \):

Using our approximations:

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.25}{P(E)} \]

Comparing the relative values ignoring \( P(E) \):

\[ \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \approx 0.0075 \]
\[ \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.25}{P(E)} \approx 0.075 \]

Normalizing these values for comparison:

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} \approx \frac{0.0075}{0.0075 + 0.075} \approx 0.091 \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} \approx \frac{0.075}{0.0075 + 0.075} \approx 0.909 \]

Thus, in the given context:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.091,
  "computer science": 0.909
}
```
