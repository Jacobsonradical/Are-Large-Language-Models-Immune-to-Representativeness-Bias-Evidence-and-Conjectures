To answer this question, we'll use Bayes' Theorem, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) = Probability that Adam is enrolled in the specified field (\( H \)).
- \( P(E|H) \) = Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in the specified field (\( H \)).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) = Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not enrolled in the specified field (\( H \)).
- \( P(E) \) = Total probability of observing Adam's personality sketch, which can be derived from the Law of Total Probability.

### For Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: The general likelihood of any graduate student being enrolled in Business Administration. Let's assume this is \( 0.15 \) (15%).
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of having Adam's personality characteristics given he is in Business Administration. Looking at his traits, they do not particularly align with typical Business Administration students (who might be more extroverted, profit-driven), so let's estimate this as \( 0.1 \) (10%).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of having Adam's personality traits given he is not in Business Administration. We'll assume this is higher, \( 0.9 \) (90%).

Using Bayes' Theorem, the total probability \( P(E) \) can be calculated, but for simplicity, let's focus on the ratio, as it will cancel out:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) * P(H)}{P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|\neg H) * P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 * 0.15}{0.1 * 0.15 + 0.9 * 0.85} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.015}{0.015 + 0.765} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.015}{0.78} \]

\[ P(H|E) ≈ 0.019 \] 

### For Computer Science

1. **P(H)**: The general likelihood of any graduate student being enrolled in Computer Science. Let's assume this is \( 0.25 \) (25%).
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of having Adam's personality characteristics given he is in Computer Science. Adam’s characteristics (high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, puzzle-solving) are quite well-aligned with typical Computer Science students, so let's estimate this as \( 0.8 \) (80%).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Again, the likelihood of having Adam's personality traits given he is not in Computer Science. We'll assume this to be \( 0.4 \) (40%).

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 * 0.25}{0.8 * 0.25 + 0.4 * 0.75} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2}{0.2 + 0.3} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2}{0.5} \]

\[ P(H|E) = 0.4 \]

Thus, the probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field given his personality sketch are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.019,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```
