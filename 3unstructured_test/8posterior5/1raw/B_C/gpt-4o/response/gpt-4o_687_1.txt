To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

We'll need to hypothesize the values of \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field. Given the information in Adam's personality sketch, let's proceed with reasonable assumptions for these probabilities.

### Computer Science 
1. **P(H) for Computer Science (P(H_CS)):**
    - It's common for many graduate students to be in various disciplines roughly equally, but let's say Computer Science is relatively popular. Assume \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.2 \).
  
2. **P(E|H) for Computer Science (P(E|H_CS)):**
    - The traits mentioned (intelligence, abstract thinking, solving puzzles) align well with Computer Science, though not perfectly with the stated specific interests in nature and animals. Thus, we'll give it a moderate value. Assume \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.4 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H) for Computer Science (P(E|\neg H_CS)):**
    - The baseline probability of someone having those traits without being in Computer Science. Given the broad range of fields, let's estimate it to be lower. Assume \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.1 \).

### Business Administration
1. **P(H) for Business Administration (P(H_BA)):**
    - Similarly, this field has many graduate students but should have a lower prior considering the personality fit. Assume \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.15 \).
  
2. **P(E|H) for Business Administration (P(E|H_BA)):**
    - The traits like empathy and appreciation for hard work align somewhat with Business Administration, but nature interests don't directly correlate. Let's assign a moderate value. Assume \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.25 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H) for Business Administration (P(E|\neg H_BA)):**
    - The probability of these traits without being in Business Administration could be roughly similar to the general baseline. Assume \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.1 \).

### Apply Bayes' Theorem

#### Computer Science
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \cdot P(\neg H_{CS})} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.1 \cdot 0.8} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.08} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.16} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = 0.5 \]

#### Business Administration
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \cdot P(\neg H_{BA})} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.25 \cdot 0.15}{0.25 \cdot 0.15 + 0.1 \cdot 0.85} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.0375}{0.0375 + 0.085} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.0375}{0.1225} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.0375}{0.1225} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx 0.3061 \]
