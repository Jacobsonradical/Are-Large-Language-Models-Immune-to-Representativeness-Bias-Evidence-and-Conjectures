Sure, let's go through the fields of business administration and computer science to calculate the probabilities using Bayes' rule. First, I'll use the information given to make some educated guesses about the prior probabilities, likelihoods, and compute the posterior probabilities.

For clarity, let's denote:
- \( P(H) \) as the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \) as the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) as the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was not enrolled in the field.
- \( P(H|E) \) as the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field given his personality sketch.

We will standardize initial priors \( P(H) \) for simplicity.

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: Let's assume a moderate prior probability that a graduate student might be enrolled in business administration.
    \[
    P(H) \approx 0.2
    \]

2. **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's high intelligence and appreciation for hard work, there is some alignment with business administration but not a perfect fit (especially considering his deep love for animals and nature). Let's assign a moderate probability.
    \[
    P(E|H) \approx 0.3
    \]

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: This accounts for the other fields where his traits might be less fitting for business administration.
    \[
    P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.7
    \]

Now, applying Bayes' rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.7 \cdot 0.8}
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.56} = \frac{0.06}{0.62} \approx 0.097
\]

So,
\[
\text{"business administration"} \approx 0.097
\]

### Computer Science

1. **P(H)**: Let's assume a moderate prior probability that a graduate student might be enrolled in computer science.
    \[
    P(H) \approx 0.2
    \]

2. **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's quiet nature, enjoyment in puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts, there is a strong fit with computer science. Let's assign a high probability.
    \[
    P(E|H) \approx 0.6
    \]

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: This accounts for the other fields where his traits might not fit as strongly.
    \[
    P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4
    \]

Now, applying Bayes' rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{0.6 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8}
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.32} = \frac{0.12}{0.44} \approx 0.273
\]

So,
\[
\text{"computer science"} \approx 0.273
\]

Thus, our final output is:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.097,
  "computer science": 0.273
}
```
