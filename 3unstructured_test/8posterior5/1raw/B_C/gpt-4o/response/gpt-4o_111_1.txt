To calculate \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' theorem, we need to first evaluate \(P(H)\), \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E|\neg H)\) for each field. 

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

- \(P(H|E)\) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field given his personality sketch.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was enrolled in the field.
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the field.
- \(P(E)\) is the normalizing constant ensuring the probabilities sum to 1, which can be derived but isn't needed to compare ratios since we're comparing two fields directly.

For simplicity, I'll assign plausible values based on common stereotypes and the given personality sketch.

### Computer Science:

- **\(P(H)\):** The likelihood of any given graduate student being in computer science might be reasonably high given the popularity of the field. Let's assume \(P(H) = 0.2\).
- **\(P(E|H)\):** Computer science students are often intelligent, enjoy puzzles, and understand abstract concepts. However, empathy and love for animals might be less stereotypically associated. Let's assume \(P(E|H) = 0.3\).
- **\(P(E|\neg H)\):** This value represents the likelihood of the personality sketch given Adam is not a computer science student. Given the traits are somewhat general but less associated with computer science specifically, let's assume \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.1\).

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.1 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.08} = \frac{0.06}{0.14} \approx 0.429 \]

### Business Administration:

- **\(P(H)\):** Business administration is also a popular graduate field, so let's assume \(P(H) = 0.2\).
- **\(P(E|H):** Business students may have strong empathy and appreciation for hard work, but the other traits might be less associated with the field. Let's say \(P(E|H) = 0.15\).
- **\(P(E|\neg H)\):** Similar to before, evaluating non-business administration fields with similar traits, let's assume \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.1\).

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} = \frac{0.15 \cdot 0.2}{0.15 \cdot 0.2 + 0.1 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.08} = \frac{0.03}{0.11} \approx 0.273 \]

Combining these results, we obtain:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.429,
  "business administration": 0.273
}
