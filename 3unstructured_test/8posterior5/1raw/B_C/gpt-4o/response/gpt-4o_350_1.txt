To find P(H|E) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate:

1. P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field.
2. P(E|H): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in the field.
3. P(E|\neg H): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in the field.

We'll then use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Let's make the estimates step-by-step.

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of being a Business Administration student can be assumed to be moderate since it is a common field, but not necessarily the most numerically dominant.

    - P(H) ≈ 0.2 (20%)

2. **P(E|H)**: Since Adam's personality traits (love for nature, solving puzzles, empathy, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts) are not strongly aligned with typical traits of Business Administration students, this probability should be lower.

    - P(E|H) ≈ 0.1 (10%)

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: If Adam was not in Business Administration, given his personality traits, he may fit better in other fields (e.g., environmental science, psychology). This probability may be high.

    - P(E|\neg H) ≈ 0.4 (40%)

Now applying these numbers to Bayes' rule for Business Administration:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.1 \times 0.2 + 0.4 \times 0.8}
= \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.32}
= \frac{0.02}{0.34}
≈ 0.0588 \]

### Computer Science

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of being a Computer Science student can be assumed to be fairly common, considering the popularity and broad applications of the field.

    - P(H) ≈ 0.3 (30%)

2. **P(E|H)**: Adam's personality traits (enjoys solving puzzles, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts) match well with characteristics typical among Computer Science students.

    - P(E|H) ≈ 0.4 (40%)

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: If Adam was not in Computer Science, those personality traits might fit into several other fields too, so this probability can be moderate.

    - P(E|\neg H) ≈ 0.3 (30%)

Now applying these numbers to Bayes' rule for Computer Science:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.3}{0.4 \times 0.3 + 0.3 \times 0.7}
= \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.21}
= \frac{0.12}{0.33}
≈ 0.3636 \]

Given these calculations, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0588,
  "computer science": 0.3636
}
```
