Sure, let's compute the values given the prior probabilities and likelihoods.

First, let's outline our prior assumptions:

1. \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science. Let's assume this to be relatively common among graduate students, say 0.2.
2. \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration. Let's assume this to be relatively common as well, say 0.2.

Next, let's consider the likelihoods:

1. \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is in computer science. Given Adam's personality traits such as high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, and problem-solving skills, it's reasonable to think this probability is fairly high. Let's say 0.7.

2. \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is in business administration. While empathy and strong understanding and appreciation for hard work are useful in business administration, the deep love for nature and animals might be less common. Let's say 0.4.

And, let's assume the likelihood of the personality sketch not belonging to either field:
   
1. \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not in computer science. Given the sketch, it could also apply to fields like biology. Let's assume this to be 0.3.
2. \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not in business administration. This could be higher because the personality sketch fits well in fields like biology or environmental science. Let's assume this to be 0.5.

Now, we apply Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Let's calculate:

1. For computer science:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.7 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.14 + 0.24 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.38 \]

Now,

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.38} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.14}{0.38} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx 0.368 \]

2. For business administration:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.4 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.48 \]

Now,

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.48} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.48} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \approx 0.167 \]

So, summarizing the results in the desired format:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.368,
  "business administration": 0.167
}
```
