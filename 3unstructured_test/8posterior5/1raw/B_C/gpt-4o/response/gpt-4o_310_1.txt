To solve this problem using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the required probabilities. Let's consider the relevant information for each field.

1. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H_{BA}) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration. Let's assume this as a general proportion of graduate students, say approximately 10%, i.e., \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): The probability of observing personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is in Business Administration. Business Administration is less likely to match Adam's described personality traits, so let's reasonably estimate this as 0.01.
   - \( P(E | \neg H_{BA}) \): The probability of observing personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not in Business Administration. This is more challenging, but let's make an educated guess. Since there are numerous fields and assuming this personality is more likely in other fields, let’s estimate this as 0.08.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) = 0.01 \cdot 0.1 = 0.001 \]

2. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H_{CS}) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science. Let's set the proportion of graduate students in CS higher, say 20%, i.e., \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): The probability of observing personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is in Computer Science. Given Adam's high intelligence and puzzle-solving skills, let’s assign a more favorable estimate, say 0.4.
   - \( P(E | \neg H_{CS}) \): Similar estimation as before, considering all non-CS fields, let’s use the same initial guess as 0.08.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) = 0.4 \cdot 0.2 = 0.08 \]

So, we normalize these computed values (although exact probabilities would require an accurate estimation of \( P(E) \)):

\[ \text{Normalization factor} = 0.001 + 0.08 = 0.081 \]

Hence:
- \( P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.001}{0.081} \approx 0.0123 \)
- \( P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.081} \approx 0.9877 \)

Thus, the estimated probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": 0.0123,
  "computer science": 0.9877
}
