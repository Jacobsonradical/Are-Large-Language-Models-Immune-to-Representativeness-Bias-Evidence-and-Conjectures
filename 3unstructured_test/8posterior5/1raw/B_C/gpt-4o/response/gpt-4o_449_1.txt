To calculate the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) (the probability of Adam being enrolled in a certain field given his personality sketch), we will use Bayesâ€™ theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence (personality sketch) given that Adam is in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence given that Adam is not in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the evidence (personality sketch).

Since \( P(E) \) is common in both fields and we are considering relative probabilities, we can simplify the comparison by focusing on the numerator \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for each field. We assign reasonable estimates for these probabilities based on logical deductions from the given personality sketch of Adam.

### Computer Science
- **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: Reasonably high, say 0.3, since computer science is a common graduate field in the U.S.
- **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving abilities align well with a computer science field. Thus, we can assign a high probability, e.g., 0.7.
- **Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This will be an averaged out lower value given the general distribution, say 0.4.

### Business Administration 
- **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: Also reasonably common, say 0.2.
- **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's warm heart, strong empathy, and understanding of hard work and dedication fit moderately well, but less so than computer science attributes. So assign, say, 0.4.
- **Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Higher than the background due to business administration comprising a variety of personality types, say 0.5.

### Simplified Computations

Let's take relative values:

\[ P(H|E)_{cs} \propto P(E|H)_{cs} \cdot P(H)_{cs} = 0.7 \cdot 0.3 = 0.21 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{ba} \propto P(E|H)_{ba} \cdot P(H)_{ba} = 0.4 \cdot 0.2 = 0.08 \]

Now, normalizing them:

\[
\text{Total} = 0.21 + 0.08 = 0.29
\]
\[
P(H|E)_{cs} = \frac{0.21}{0.29} \approx 0.724
\]
\[
P(H|E)_{ba} = \frac{0.08}{0.29} \approx 0.276
\]

Thus the results are:

{
  "computer science": 0.724,
  "business administration": 0.276
}
