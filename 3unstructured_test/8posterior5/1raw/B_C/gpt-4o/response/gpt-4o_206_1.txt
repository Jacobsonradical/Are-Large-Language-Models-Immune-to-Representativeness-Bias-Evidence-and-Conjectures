To apply Bayes' theorem and estimate the probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field based on his personality sketch (E), we need to perform a series of steps. 

### Definitions
- \(P(H)\): Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the field.
- \(P(E|H)\): Probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is in the field.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): Probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in the field.
- \(P(H|E)\): Posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in the field given the personality sketch.

Bayes' theorem is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is common for all hypotheses, it serves as a normalization constant. For simplicity, we'll compare the numerators \( P(E|H) \times P(H) \) and not explicitly compute \( P(E) \).

Now, let's evaluate for each field:

### Computer Science

1. **Prior probability, \(P(H)\)**
   - Assuming equal likelihood, we might start with a non-informative prior, say \(P(H) = 0.1\).

2. **Likelihood, \(P(E|H)\)**
   - Computer science students often have high intelligence and like solving puzzles, but may not have strong empathy or a love for nature.
   - \( P(E|H) \) might be moderate, say 0.3.

3. **Likelihood, \(P(E|\neg H)\)**
   - Notably, many fields might produce individuals with similar traits. Hence, moderate as well, say 0.2.

### Business Administration

1. **Prior probability, \(P(H)\)**
   - Again assuming a non-informative prior, say \(P(H) = 0.1\).

2. **Likelihood, \(P(E|H)\)**
   - Business administration may emphasize empathy and dedication, but not necessarily a love for nature.
   - \( P(E|H) \) could be lower, say 0.2.

3. **Likelihood, \(P(E|\neg H)\)**
   - Considering a less direct match to the described traits, higher, say 0.15.

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:

### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalization factor:
- Numerator for computer science: \(0.3 \times 0.1 = 0.03\).
- Numerator for business administration: \(0.2 \times 0.1 = 0.02\).

Normalizing these values:
1. Sum of values: \(0.03 + 0.02 = 0.05\).
2. Normalized posterior:

   - Computer Science: \(\frac{0.03}{0.05} = 0.6\).
   - Business Administration: \(\frac{0.02}{0.05} = 0.4\).

Final probabilities:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.4
}
