To determine the likelihood that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or business administration given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, I'll make some reasonable assumptions:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being in a particular field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he's in a particular field.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he's not in that particular field.
4. **P(E)**: The overall probability of observing Adam's personality traits.

**Computer Science:**
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is in computer science might be relatively high given that computer science is a common field for graduate students. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
- **P(E|H)**: Computer science students often have high intelligence and may enjoy solving puzzles, which fits Adam's profile. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.5 \).
- **P(E|¬H)**: The probability that someone not in computer science has similar traits. Let's assume \( P(E|¬H) = 0.1 \).
- **P(E)**: The overall probability of someone having Adam's personality traits. 

Since \( P(E) \) can be derived from both being in computer science and not being in computer science:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.5 \cdot 0.2 + 0.1 \cdot 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.1 + 0.08 = 0.18 \]

So,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.18} \approx 0.56 \]

**Business Administration:**
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is in business administration. Given it is a relatively less common field compared to computer science for someone fitting Adam's profile. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).
- **P(E|H)**: Business administration might not strongly align with Adam's traits. Empathy and communication skills are key in business, but curiosity about nature and solving puzzles are less typical. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
- **P(E|¬H)**: Same as the general non-relevant traits. Let's assume \( P(E|¬H) = 0.1 \).
- **P(E)**: Same overall probability of someone having Adam's traits as before, \( P(E) = 0.18 \).

So,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.05}{0.18} \approx 0.028 \]

Thus, the calculated posterior probabilities are:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.56,
  "business administration": 0.028
}
