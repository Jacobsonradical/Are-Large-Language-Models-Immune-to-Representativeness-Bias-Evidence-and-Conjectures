To calculate the probability of Adam being enrolled in either computer science or business administration given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is represented as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since \( P(E) \) would be a normalizing constant that is the same for both fields, we will focus on the ratios \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) relative to each other.

1. **Computer Science:**
    - **P(H) (Prior Probability):** Graduate students in computer science are quite common in the U.S. so let’s assume a moderate prior, say 0.3.
    - **P(E|H):** The personality sketch of intelligence, abstract thinking, and puzzle-solving aligns quite well with traits often associated with computer science students. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.7.
    - **P(E|\neg H):** This would depend on the distribution of the personality traits among the general population. Assuming there's a broad distribution of interests, let’s set this at 0.2.

    Using these values:
    \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.7 \cdot 0.3 = 0.21 \]

2. **Business Administration:**
    - **P(H) (Prior Probability):** Graduate students in business administration are also fairly common in the U.S., so let’s assume a moderate prior, say 0.2.
    - **P(E|H):** The personality sketch does not align as strongly with common business traits, like leadership or a focus on commerce. Let's assume a lower probability, P(E|H) = 0.3.
    - **P(E|\neg H):** Similar to above, let’s set this at 0.2.

    Using these values:
    \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.3 \cdot 0.2 = 0.06 \]

Now, we need to normalize these two probabilities so they sum up correctly:


\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.21}{0.21 + 0.06} = \frac{0.21}{0.27} \approx 0.778 \]

\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.21 + 0.06} = \frac{0.06}{0.27} \approx 0.222 \]

Thus, the probability estimates based on the given inputs can be summarized as:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.778,
  "business administration": 0.222
}
```

This suggests that, given the provided personality sketch, Adam is more likely to have been enrolled in computer science than business administration.
