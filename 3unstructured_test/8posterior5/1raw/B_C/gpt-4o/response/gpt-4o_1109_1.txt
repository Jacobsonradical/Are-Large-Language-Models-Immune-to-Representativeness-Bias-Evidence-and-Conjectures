Sure, let's apply Bayes’ rule to compute the probabilities for Adam's fields of graduate study. Bayes’ rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For each hypothesis \(H\), we need to estimate:
1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the evidence \(E\) given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the evidence \(E\) given that Adam is not enrolled in that field.

Let’s assume some rough estimates based on the personality sketch and the likely correlation with the specific fields of study:

### Computer Science

- **\(P(H)\)**: Let's assume the prior probability of Adam enrolling in Computer Science is 0.2, considering Computer Science is a popular graduate field, but not overwhelmingly likely for someone with Adam's profile.
- **\(P(E|H)\)**: Given Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and love for puzzles, assume 0.6.
- **\(P(E|\neg H)\)**: We need to estimate this as the chance of someone with Adam's profile, not being in Computer Science, which could be 0.05 based on his specific interests more oriented towards nature and empathy.

So,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

### Business Administration

- **\(P(H)\)**: Assume the prior probability of Adam enrolling in Business Administration to be 0.1, given Adam's empathy and understanding might align with some aspects of business studies, though not strongly.
- **\(P(E|H)\)**: Given the curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and love for animals, let's give this a 0.2.
- **\(P(E|\neg H)\)**: This could be higher (0.1) due to other fields like biology, environmental sciences being more relevant.

So,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

Now, with those estimates, we can compute \(P(H|E)\) proportionally.

For simplification, let's denote the normalization constant \(P(E)\) as an unknown, which will be eliminated since we’re checking relative probabilities:

\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = 0.12/P(E) \]

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = 0.02/P(E) \]

We normalize these against each other:

\[ \frac{P(\text{computer science}|E)}{P(\text{computer science}|E) + P(\text{business administration}|E)} = \frac{0.12/P(E)}{0.12/P(E) + 0.02/P(E)} = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.02} = \frac{0.12}{0.14} \approx 0.857 \]

\[ \frac{P(\text{business administration}|E)}{P(\text{computer science}|E) + P(\text{business administration}|E)} = \frac{0.02/P(E)}{0.12/P(E) + 0.02/P(E)} = \frac{0.02}{0.14} \approx 0.143 \]

Therefore, the posterior probabilities using the given estimates are approximately:

{
  "computer science": "0.857", 
  "business administration": "0.143"
}
