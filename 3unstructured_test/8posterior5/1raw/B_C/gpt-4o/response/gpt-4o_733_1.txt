To determine \( P(H|E) \), we can apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of Adam's personality sketch, which can be derived from the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

Let's estimate the values for each field:

### Computer Science
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability Adam was in computer science as a graduate student.
  - Let's assume around 0.2 (20%) for simplicity, as computer science is a common field, but not the most common.

- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch if he were in computer science.
  - Given his characteristics (high intelligence, curiosity, good at understanding abstract concepts), we can estimate around 0.6 (60%).

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch if he were not in computer science.
  - Given that his qualities (empathy, love for animals, appreciation for dedication) fit well in other fields too, we might estimate around 0.5 (50%).

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability Adam was in business administration.
  - Likely less common than computer science, so let's assume around 0.1 (10%).

- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch if he were in business administration.
  - Considering business administration doesn't typically emphasize some of his traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals), we might estimate around 0.3 (30%).

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch if he were not in business administration.
  - Again, since his characteristics fit other fields well, we can use around 0.5 (50%).

Now calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

### Computer Science
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) 
        = (0.6 \times 0.2) + (0.5 \times 0.8) 
        = 0.12 + 0.4 
        = 0.52 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} 
          = \frac{0.6 \times 0.2}{0.52} 
          = \frac{0.12}{0.52} 
          \approx 0.23 \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) 
        = (0.3 \times 0.1) + (0.5 \times 0.9) 
        = 0.03 + 0.45 
        = 0.48 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} 
          = \frac{0.3 \times 0.1}{0.48} 
          = \frac{0.03}{0.48} 
          \approx 0.0625 \]

Putting this together:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.23,
  "business administration": 0.0625
}
