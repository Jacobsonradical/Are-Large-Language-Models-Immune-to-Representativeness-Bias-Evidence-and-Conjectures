To estimate \( P(H|E) \) (the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch), we'll need to consider the following probabilities for each field:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch assuming he was enrolled in the field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch assuming he was not enrolled in the field.

Then, according to Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where \( P(E) \) can be found by 

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's take a close look at these probabilities for "computer science" and "business administration":

### Computer Science
- **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability. Let's assume it's relatively common for graduate students in the U.S. to be enrolled in computer science. We might set this at approximately 0.20.
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's qualities (high intelligence, problem-solving skills, and understanding abstract concepts), it's plausible he'd be in computer science, though his warm heart and love of nature and animals doesn't particularly match this field. Let's say 0.30.
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This would be the chance of Adam's personality sketch if he were in any field other than computer science. Again, considering the diversity of fields, we'll set this to 0.10.

### Business Administration
- **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability. Business administration is also quite popular among graduate students. Let’s set this at around 0.15.
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's empathy and appreciation for hard work and dedication, but not directly reflecting typical traits associated strongly with business fields, we might set this at about 0.10.
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Similar to before, this would be the chance of Adam's personality sketch if he were in any field other than business administration. Let’s estimate 0.12.

Now using Bayes' rule:

#### Computer Science
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.30 \times 0.20}{(0.30 \times 0.20) + ((1 - 0.20) \times 0.10)} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.08} = \frac{0.06}{0.14} = 0.4286 \approx 0.43 \]

#### Business Administration
\[ P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{0.10 \times 0.15}{(0.10 \times 0.15) + ((1 - 0.15) \times 0.12)} \]
\[ P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{0.015}{0.015 + 0.102} = \frac{0.015}{0.117} = 0.1282 \approx 0.13 \]

So, our results are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.43,
  "business administration": 0.13
}
```
