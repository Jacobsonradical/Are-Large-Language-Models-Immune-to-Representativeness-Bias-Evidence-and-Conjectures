To calculate \( P(H|E) \) for the given fields (computer science and business administration), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Estimate \( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field.
2. **Estimate \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in each field.
3. **Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in each particular field.
4. **Calculate \( P(H|E) \)** using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assuming we don't have the exact numbers, we make educated guesses based on the information provided and typical characteristics of students in each field.

### Computer Science
1. **Prior \( P(H) \):**
   - There are many graduate students enrolled in Computer Science in the U.S., so a realistic prior might be \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.15 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   - Considering Adam's high intelligence, enjoyment of puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts, these match well with CS.
   - But his curiosity about nature and plants and his warm, empathetic character are less typical for CS.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.2 \).

3. **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   - Many fields can accommodate Adam's traits, such as biology, psychology, or environmental science. The probability that someone not in CS has Adam's traits can be slightly higher.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.3 \).

### Business Administration
1. **Prior \( P(H) \):**
   - Due to many students in the U.S. pursuing MBA degrees, let's set \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.15 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   - Adam's traits like empathy and appreciation for hard work fit well.
   - Lack of typical business traits like extraversion and leadership among his listed traits weakens this fit.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.1 \).

3. **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   - Many other fields share Adam's interests and traits.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.3 \).

To calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H)) \).

### Calculations:
#### Computer Science
\[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.15 + 0.3 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.03 + 0.255 = 0.285 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{0.285} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.285} \approx 0.105 \]

#### Business Administration
\[ P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.15 + 0.3 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.015 + 0.255 = 0.27 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{0.27} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.015}{0.27} \approx 0.056 \]

The final probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": 0.105,
  "business administration": 0.056
}
