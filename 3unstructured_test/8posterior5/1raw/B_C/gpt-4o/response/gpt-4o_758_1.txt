To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \), we can use Bayes' Rule, which is stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis,
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis,
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given that the hypothesis is not true,
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence.

However, \( P(E) \) can be calculated as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For simplicity, since we are only considering two fields:
\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) \]

Let's estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) based on the given personality sketch.

### Computer Science

Adam has a high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts, which aligns with typical characteristics of a computer science student. However, the strong empathy, warm-heartedness, and deep love for animals might not be as directly relevant.

- \( P(H_{cs}) \): Suppose the prior probability of Adam being in computer science is 0.2.
- \( P(E|H_{cs}) \): Given the description aligns somewhat but not perfectly with a typical computer science student, let's assume 0.4.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{cs}) \): This should summarize the likelihood across other fields. Assume this is 0.1 (since there are other fields like environmental sciences, biology, etc., that match better).

### Business Administration

Adam's warm-heartedness, empathy, and understanding of hard work might align with business studies, especially in areas like organizational behavior or human resources. However, his deep love for animals and curiosity about nature might not fit well.

- \( P(H_{ba}) \): Suppose the prior probability of Adam being in business administration is 0.1.
- \( P(E|H_{ba}) \): Given the partial alignment, let's assume 0.2.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{ba}) \): Assume this is 0.1 as well.

Now we compute \( P(E) \):

### Computer Science
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs}) + P(E|\neg H_{cs}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{cs})) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.1 \cdot 0.8 = 0.08 + 0.08 = 0.16 \]
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.16} = \frac{0.08}{0.16} = 0.5 \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{ba}) \cdot P(H_{ba}) + P(E|\neg H_{ba}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{ba})) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.1 \cdot 0.9 = 0.02 + 0.09 = 0.11 \]
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{ba}) \cdot P(H_{ba})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.11} = \frac{0.02}{0.11} \approx 0.1818 \]

So, interpreting the results:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.1818
}
```
