To compute the probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for Adam being enrolled in computer science (CS) or business administration (BA) using Bayes' theorem, we need to first estimate the following probabilities:

### Prior Probabilities
1. \(P(\text{CS})\)
2. \(P(\text{BA})\)

The prior probability \(P(H)\) is the general likelihood that a randomly picked graduate student would be studying in that field. For simplicity, let’s assume that the number of graduate students in computer science and business administration are somewhat similar. We might choose them to be equal for this calculation.

### Likelihood
1. \(P(E|H)\) - The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in a specific field.
2. \(P(E|\neg H)\) - The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in that specific field.

### Estimations
1. **Computer Science**
    - \(P(\text{CS}) \approx 0.1\)
    - \(P(E|\text{CS})\): Adam likes solving puzzles, has high intelligence, and understands abstract concepts, so he fits the CS profile well. Let’s say \(P(E|\text{CS}) \approx 0.8\).
    - \(P(E|\neg \text{CS})\): The probability of finding his personality traits among other fields not related to CS is lower, say \(P(E|\neg \text{CS}) \approx 0.3\).

2. **Business Administration**
    - \(P(\text{BA}) \approx 0.1\)
    - \(P(E|\text{BA})\): Adam has a warm heart, strong empathy, and an appreciation for hard work, which could fit a BA profile but less so than CS. Let’s say \(P(E|\text{BA}) \approx 0.4\).
    - \(P(E|\neg \text{BA})\): The probability of finding his personality traits among other fields not related to BA is a bit higher but still not in line with business traits. Let’s say \(P(E|\neg \text{BA}) \approx 0.5\).

### Applying Bayes' Theorem
Bayes' Theorem: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

#### Computer Science
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) = 0.08 + 0.27 = 0.35 \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.35} = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \approx 0.229 \]

#### Business Administration
\[ P(E) = (0.4 \cdot 0.1) + (0.5 \cdot 0.9) = 0.04 + 0.45 = 0.49 \]
\[ P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.1}{0.49} = \frac{0.04}{0.49} \approx 0.082 \]

### Final Result
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.229,
  "business administration": 0.082
}
