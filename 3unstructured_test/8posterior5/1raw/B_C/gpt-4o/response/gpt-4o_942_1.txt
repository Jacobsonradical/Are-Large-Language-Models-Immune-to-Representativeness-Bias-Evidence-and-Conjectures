To evaluate the likelihoods for Adam being in either computer science or business administration given his personality sketch E, we can use the following steps with assumptions about the probabilities:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that a graduate student is in a specific field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is in that field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in that field.
4. **P(H|E)**: The probability that Adam is in that field given his personality sketch. This is what we need to compute using Bayes' rule: \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \)

Since precise numerical values aren't provided, I'll make some reasonable estimates:

### Computer Science
1. **P(H)**: Let's assume the prior probability for any student being in computer science is relatively high (e.g., \( P(\text{CS}) = 0.15 \)).
2. **P(E|H)**: Given Adam’s personality, it’s fairly common for someone interested in puzzles and with high intelligence to be in computer science. Additionally, the appreciation for abstract concepts aligns well with computer science. So let's say \( P(E|\text{CS}) = 0.6 \).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of this personality sketch occurring in other fields can be assumed to be lower, reflecting that not all fields require such specific traits. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg \text{CS}) = 0.3 \).
4. **P(E)**: This is an overall normalization factor but since we are comparing relative probabilities it doesn't need to be calculated explicitly.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(E)} \]

For relative comparison:
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) \propto P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) = 0.6 \times 0.15 = 0.09 \]

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability for any student being in business administration could be relatively high as well but less so than computer science considering Adam's specific traits, so let's assume \( P(\text{BA}) = 0.1 \).
2. **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's personality, business administration might be less likely compared to computer science due to the nature and focus of the field. Let’s assume \( P(E|\text{BA}) = 0.3 \).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of this personality sketch occurring in other fields remains the same, \( P(E|\neg \text{BA}) = 0.3 \).
4. **P(E)**: Again, we don't need to compute this explicitly.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{BA}) \cdot P(\text{BA})}{P(E)} \]

For relative comparison:
\[ P(\text{BA}|E) \propto P(E|\text{BA}) \cdot P(\text{BA}) = 0.3 \times 0.1 = 0.03 \]

### Final comparison
By comparing the relative probabilities, we can see that the higher value points towards a stronger likelihood that Adam is in computer science rather than business administration.

Thus, the final values are:

{
  "computer science": 0.09,
  "business administration": 0.03
}
