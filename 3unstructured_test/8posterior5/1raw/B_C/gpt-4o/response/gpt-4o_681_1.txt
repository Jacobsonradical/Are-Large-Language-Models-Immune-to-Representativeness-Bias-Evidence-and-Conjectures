To compute \( P(H|E) \) through Bayes' Rule for each field of study, we can use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for all hypotheses \( H \), we can simplify the comparison by focusing on the numerator \( P(E|H)P(H) \).

Let's consider the necessary probabilities for each field:

1. **Business Administration**
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a random graduate student is in business administration. This is context-dependent, but we can assume it to be relatively moderate given the variety of fields in graduate study (e.g., \( \approx 0.15 \) or 15%).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam having the personality sketch \( E \) given that he is enrolled in business administration. Given his interests and personality traits, it does not strongly align with the typical traits of someone in business administration but is not impossible (e.g., \( \approx 0.1 \) or 10%).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam having the personality sketch \( E \) given that he is not enrolled in business administration. Given the broad set of fields available, a moderate value might be similar to the general prior for any non-business field (e.g., \( \approx 0.85 \) or 85%).

2. **Computer Science**
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a random graduate student is in computer science. This can also be assumed to be relatively moderate given the popularity of the field (e.g., \( \approx 0.2 \) or 20%).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam having the personality sketch \( E \) given that he is enrolled in computer science. Given his interest in puzzles, intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts, this aligns somewhat well (e.g., \( \approx 0.5 \) or 50%).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Similar to above, a moderate value for any field that isn't computer science (e.g., \( \approx 0.8 \) or 80%).

Now, let's plug in these tentative probabilities into Bayes' Rule:

**Business Administration:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.15}{P(E)} \]

**Computer Science:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.5 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]

Note that \( P(E) \) is constant for both calculations, so we are only concerned with the numerators for relative comparison.

**Relative Likelihood**, ignoring \( P(E) \):

**Business Administration:**
\[ 0.1 \times 0.15 = 0.015 \]

**Computer Science:**
\[ 0.5 \times 0.2 = 0.1 \]

Since we want the answers normalized, we add the values:
\[ \text{Total} = 0.015 + 0.1 = 0.115 \]

**Normalized Probabilities:**
- For Business Administration:
  \[ \frac{0.015}{0.115} \approx 0.1304 \]
  
- For Computer Science:
  \[ \frac{0.1}{0.115} \approx 0.8696 \]

In JSON format, the answer would be:

{
  "business administration": 0.1304,
  "computer science": 0.8696
}
