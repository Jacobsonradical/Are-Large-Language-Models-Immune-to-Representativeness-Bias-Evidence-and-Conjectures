To solve for \(P(H|E)\), Bayes' Theorem is applied:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \(P(E)\) is constant across different hypotheses, the calculation focuses on the numerators.

Assume \(P(H)\), the prior probability of Adam being in a particular field, is relatively uniform across various popular graduate fields. Let's assign a generous starting prior probability to both to simplify calculations:

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}) = P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1 \] 

Given E (Adam’s personality and interests):

1. **Computer Science (CS) Hypothesis:**
    - Likelihood \(P(E|H_{\text{CS}})\):
      Adam’s curiosity about nature, problem-solving ability, understanding of abstract concepts, and high intelligence align well with traits beneficial in computer science, so we can assume:
      \[ P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.6 \]

    - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \), where \( \neg H_{\text{CS}} \) denotes Adam being in any other field:
      Assuming CS is well aligned with Adam’s traits, but so might several other fields:
      \[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.4 \]

2. **Business Administration (BA) Hypothesis:**
    - Likelihood \(P(E|H_{\text{BA}})\):
      Adam’s warm heart, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work may benefit in BA, although these traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals) are not typically primary drivers:
      \[ P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.3 \]

    - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \):
      BA is less aligned to Adam’s given sketch compared to CS, so traits fit poorly in BA:
      \[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.5 \]

Now, using Bayes’ Theorem to find the posterior probability:

1. **Computer Science:**

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.6 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \]

2. **Business Administration:**

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \]

Since \(P(E)\) is common, we only consider the proportionate values:

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto 0.6 \times 0.1 = 0.06 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \propto 0.3 \times 0.1 = 0.03 \]

Normalizing these to form a probability distribution among only these two hypotheses:

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.03} = \frac{0.06}{0.09} = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.67 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.06 + 0.03} = \frac{0.03}{0.09} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.33 \]

So, the final output would be:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.67,
  "business administration": 0.33
}
```
