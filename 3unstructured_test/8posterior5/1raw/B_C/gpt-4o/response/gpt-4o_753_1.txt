To apply Bayes' rule and compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in business administration or computer science based on the given personality sketch, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Judge the Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This is the initial probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field without considering the personality sketch.

2. **Assess Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.

3. **Determine \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in that particular field.

4. **Compute the Posterior Probability \( P(H|E) \)**: This is calculated using Bayes' rule.

### For Business Administration:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H_{BA}) \)**: Let's assume the prior probability that a student is enrolled in business administration can be around 0.1, as business administration is a common field among graduate students.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{BA}) \)**: Given Adam's love for nature, animals, solving puzzles, and appreciation for hard work, the likelihood he fits a typical business administration student might be relatively low. Let's assume \( P(E|H_{BA}) \approx 0.2 \).

3. **Conditional Probability \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \)**: This is the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in business administration. Given the nature-focused attributes, this probability may be higher. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \approx 0.8 \).

### For Computer Science:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H_{CS}) \)**: Prior probability can be assumed similarly around 0.1, as computer science is also a common field among graduate students.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{CS}) \)**: Adamâ€™s traits, especially intelligence, enjoyment of puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts, align well with computer science. Let's assume \( P(E|H_{CS}) \approx 0.6 \).

3. **Conditional Probability \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \)**: For the personality sketch given Adam is not into computer science, given his nature-oriented traits, \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \approx 0.4 \).

### Applying Bayes' Rule:

Bayes' rule formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

**Calculate for Business Administration:**

\[ P(E)_{BA} = 0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.8 \cdot 0.9 = 0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.72 = 0.74 \]

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.74} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.74} \approx 0.027 \]

**Calculate for Computer Science:**

\[ P(E)_{CS} = 0.6 \cdot 0.1 + 0.4 \cdot 0.9 = 0.06 + 0.36 = 0.42 \]

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.1}{0.42} \approx \frac{0.06}{0.42} \approx 0.143 \]

### Summary:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.027,
  "computer science": 0.143
}
```

The calculated probabilities indicate that, based on the given personality sketch, Adam is more likely to be in computer science compared to business administration.
