To apply Bayes' theorem for calculating \( P(H|E) \), we need to first establish our values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). 

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) \) can be derived from
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's evaluate these components for "business administration" and "computer science".

### Business Administration

**Judging \( P(H) \):** 
The proportion of graduate students in business administration compared to all graduate fields isn't overwhelmingly large, so \( P(H) \) might be relatively moderate.

**Judging \( P(E|H) \):** 
Given Adam's personality sketch focusing on nature, empathy, and animals, these traits are not strongly aligned with business administration. Hence, \( P(E|H) \) is likely to be low.

**Judging \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
The probability that someone not in business administration shares Adam's traits is probably moderate to high because many other fields (such as environmental science, biology, etc.) align well with his personality.

Given the lower alignment, \( P(E|H) \) would be low.

### Computer Science

**Judging \( P(H) \):**
The proportion of graduate students in computer science is relatively higher, so \( P(H) \) might be relatively moderate to high.

**Judging \( P(E|H) \):**
Adam's traits (puzzle-solving, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts) strongly align with computer science. However, his love for nature and animals might not fit perfectly but doesn't necessarily contradict it. Thus, \( P(E|H) \) would be moderate.

**Judging \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
Since there are several other fields that align even better with Adam’s nature-related traits, \( P(E|\neg H) \) might be higher than the business administration case but still not extremely high.

Let’s assume the following hypothetical values based on this reasoning to compute \( P(H|E) \):

For business administration:
- \( P(H) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \)

For computer science:
- \( P(H) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \)

Using Bayes’ Rule:

### Business Administration:
\[
P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{P(E|H)_{BA} \cdot P(H)_{BA}}{P(E)} 
= \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.1 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9} 
= \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.27} 
= \frac{0.01}{0.28} 
= 0.0357
\]

### Computer Science:
\[
P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{P(E|H)_{CS} \cdot P(H)_{CS}}{P(E)} 
= \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.3}{0.5 \cdot 0.3 + 0.5 \cdot 0.7} 
= \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.35} 
= \frac{0.15}{0.5} 
= 0.3
\]

Therefore, based on these hypothetical values, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0357,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These results suggest that based on Adam's personality sketch, it is more likely that he is a graduate student in computer science than in business administration.
