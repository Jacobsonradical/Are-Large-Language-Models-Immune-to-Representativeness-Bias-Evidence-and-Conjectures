First, let's break down the probabilities. We'll assume generic prior probabilities for Adam being in each field (P(H)) and evaluate how well the evidence (E) fits each hypothesis (P(E|H)) and the absence of each hypothesis (P(E|¬H)). These are subjective estimates based on the personality sketch provided.

**Computer Science:**

1. **P(H):** The probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is in computer science. Let's assume this is fairly common but not overly so: \( P(\text{H, Computer Science}) = 0.2 \).
  
2. **P(E|H):** The probability that a computer science student has Adam's characteristics. Given the high intelligence and abstract reasoning skills, we can assume this is somewhat likely: \( P(\text{E|H, Computer Science}) = 0.4 \).

3. **P(E|¬H):** The probability of observing Adam's characteristics in graduate students outside of computer science. This is fairly high as there are many fields where these traits are beneficial: \( P(\text{E|¬H, Computer Science}) = 0.6 \).
  
Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{ P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(\text{H, Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.6 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.48} = \frac{0.08}{0.56} = 0.143 \]

**Business Administration:**

1. **P(H):** The probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is in business administration. This field is also common, so let's assume: \( P(\text{H, Business Administration}) = 0.15 \).

2. **P(E|H):** The probability that a business administration student has Adam's characteristics. Since empathy and people skills are valued, but fewer traits align directly, this might be lower: \( P(\text{E|H, Business Administration}) = 0.2 \).

3. **P(E|¬H):** The probability of observing Adam's characteristics in graduate students outside of business administration. Again, fairly high due to multiple fields valuing these traits: \( P(\text{E|¬H, Business Administration}) = 0.6 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{ P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(\text{H, Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{0.2 \cdot 0.15 + 0.6 \cdot 0.85} = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.51} = \frac{0.03}{0.54} = 0.056 \]

Based on these calculations, the estimated probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.143,
  "business administration": 0.056
}
```

Note: These estimates are based on subjective prior probabilities and your own settings may yield different results. The values provided are a basis for logical follow-through of the sketch described.
