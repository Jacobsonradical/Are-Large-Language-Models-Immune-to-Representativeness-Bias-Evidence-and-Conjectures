Here's my assessment based on the personality sketch of Adam and the given fields:

1. **Computer Science (H₁)**
   - **P(H₁)**: The general probability of a graduate student being in computer science is relatively high. Let's assume P(H₁) = 0.3.
   - **P(E|H₁)**: Given Adam's traits—high intelligence, appreciation for abstract concepts, solving puzzles—the likelihood of him being in computer science is also high. Let's assume P(E|H₁) = 0.8.
   - **P(E|¬H₁)**: The probability of Adam having these traits if he were *not* in computer science is lower, since these traits fit well with computer science but could still be found in other fields. Let's assume P(E|¬H₁) = 0.2.

2. **Business Administration (H₂)**
   - **P(H₂)**: The general probability of a graduate student being in business administration is decent, but typically lower than some other more specialized fields. Let's assume P(H₂) = 0.2.
   - **P(E|H₂)**: Considering Adam's traits—empathy, strong appreciation for hard work—it's plausible but less likely for him to be in business administration compared to other fields like social sciences or humanities. Let's assume P(E|H₂) = 0.4.
   - **P(E|¬H₂)**: The probability of Adam having these traits if he were *not* in business administration could be somewhat moderate, but perhaps higher than for computer science. Let's assume P(E|¬H₂) = 0.5.

Now, let's calculate P(H|E) for each field using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

First, we need to calculate P(E):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H₁) \cdot P(H₁) + P(E|¬H₁) \cdot P(¬H₁) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 + 0.2 \cdot 0.7 = 0.24 + 0.14 = 0.38 \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H₂) \cdot P(H₂) + P(E|¬H₂) \cdot P(¬H₂) = 0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.8 = 0.08 + 0.4 = 0.48 \]

Performing the calculations for \( P(H|E) \):

1. **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H₁|E) = \frac{P(E|H₁) \cdot P(H₁)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.3}{0.38} ≈ \frac{0.24}{0.38} ≈ 0.632 \]

2. **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H₂|E) = \frac{P(E|H₂) \cdot P(H₂)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.48} ≈ \frac{0.08}{0.48} ≈ 0.167 \]

So our final probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.632,
  "business administration": 0.167
}
```
