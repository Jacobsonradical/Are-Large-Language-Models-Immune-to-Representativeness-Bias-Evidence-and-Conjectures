To solve for the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being in either computer science or business administration based on his personality sketch, we will use Bayes' theorem which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

First, we'll estimate the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the conditional probabilities \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \). 

### Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \) for Computer Science:**
   - The base rate for graduate students in computer science is relatively high, so let's assume:
     \[ P(H)_{CS} = 0.15 \]

2. **Conditional Probability \( P(E|H) \) for Computer Science:**
   - Adam's characteristics align moderately well with computer science students, especially the aspects of intelligence, puzzle-solving, and understanding abstract concepts:
     \[ P(E|H)_{CS} = 0.3 \]

3. **Conditional Probability \( P(E|\neg H) \) for Computer Science:**
   - Considering other fields, the combination of traits isn't overwhelmingly unique to computer science:
     \[ P(E|\neg H)_{CS} = 0.2 \]
    
Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{P(E|H)_{CS} \times P(H)_{CS}}{P(E|H)_{CS} \times P(H)_{CS} + P(E|\neg H)_{CS} \times P(\neg H)_{CS}} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.3 \times 0.15}{0.3 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times (1 - 0.15)} = \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.17} = \frac{0.045}{0.215} \approx 0.209 \]

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \) for Business Administration:**
   - The base rate for business administration is also high, but we need to estimate it in relation to Adam's traits:
     \[ P(H)_{BA} = 0.1 \]

2. **Conditional Probability \( P(E|H) \) for Business Administration:**
   - Adam's empathy, warmth, and appreciation for hard work could fit business administration, but not as strongly given his focus on nature and animals:
     \[ P(E|H)_{BA} = 0.1 \]

3. **Conditional Probability \( P(E|\neg H) \) for Business Administration:**
   - Many non-business fields could also match these traits:
     \[ P(E|\neg H)_{BA} = 0.25 \]

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{P(E|H)_{BA} \times P(H)_{BA}}{P(E|H)_{BA} \times P(H)_{BA} + P(E|\neg H)_{BA} \times P(\neg H)_{BA}} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.1}{0.1 \times 0.1 + 0.25 \times (1 - 0.1)} = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.225} = \frac{0.01}{0.235} \approx 0.043 \]

### Summary

So the computed values would be:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.209,
  "business administration": 0.043
}
```
