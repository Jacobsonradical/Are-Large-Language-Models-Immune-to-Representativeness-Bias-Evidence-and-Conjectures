To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we'll follow these steps:

1. Assign values to \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).
2. Apply Bayes' rule to find \( P(H|E) \).

**Bayes' Rule**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

**Assumptions for the given fields:**

### Computer Science

1. **\( P(H) \) (prior probability of being in computer science):**
   Let's assume a prior probability that Adam is likely to be in any one of the numerous graduate fields with an equal likelihood. Since we have two hypotheses and there are many other fields, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \) for computer science.

2. **\( P(E|H) \) (likelihood of the personality sketch given enrollment in computer science):**
   Considering Adam's high intelligence and abstract thinking ability, there's a good fit for computer science but his deep affinity for nature and animals isn't typical for this field. Thus, let's give it a \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \) (likelihood of the personality sketch given enrollment in any other field except computer science):**
   We can assume that other fields are equally likely to attract someone with Adam's traits, some of which (like biology) might be more fitting. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \).

### Business Administration

1. **\( P(H) \) (prior probability of being in business administration):**
   Similarly, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \) for business administration.

2. **\( P(E|H) \) (likelihood of the personality sketch given enrollment in business administration):**
   Adam's traits don't necessarily align with the typical business administration student profile, so let's set \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \) (likelihood of the personality sketch given enrollment in any other field except business administration):**
   As before, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \).

Now applying Bayes' rule:

### For Computer Science:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.1) + (0.6 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.03 + 0.54 = 0.57 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.57} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.57} \approx 0.053 \]

### For Business Administration:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.1) + (0.6 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.01 + 0.54 = 0.55 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.55} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.55} \approx 0.018 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.053,
  "business administration": 0.018
}
```
