To apply Bayes' theorem, we need to break down the components and then compute the probabilities for each field given Adam's personality sketch.

Bayes' theorem is stated as:

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

Where:

- \(H\) is the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
- \(E\) is the evidence, or Adam's personality sketch.

We need to estimate the following for each field:
- \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
- \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood of Adam's personality given he is in that specific field.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The likelihood of Adam's personality given he is not in that specific field.
- \(P(E)\): The overall probability of Adam's personality, which can be derived using the law of total probability.

Let's assign some plausible estimates:

### Computer Science
- **P(H):** Computer science is a popular field, so let's say the prior probability P(H) is 0.15.
- **P(E|H):** Adamâ€™s traits align well with typical traits of someone successful in computer science (high intelligence, enjoys solving puzzles), let's say this is quite high, perhaps 0.7.
- **P(E|\neg H):** Given Adam could belong to any other field, but his traits are somewhat specific, we might estimate this a bit lower, maybe around 0.2.

### Business Administration
- **P(H):** Business administration is also a popular field, so let's assign it a prior probability P(H) of 0.1.
- **P(E|H):** Adam's empathy, strong understanding and appreciation for hard work align somewhat with business administration, but not as clearly as with computer science. Let's estimate this at around 0.3.
- **P(E|\neg H):** Given Adam's personality traits, he could easily belong to other fields, so we might again estimate this around 0.2.

Now we calculate \(P(H|E)\) for each field using Bayes' theorem:

### For Computer Science:
\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

\[P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)\]

Given the assignments, \(P(\neg H)\) is remaining probability mass (1 - P(H)).
\[P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85)\]

\[P(E) = (0.105) + (0.17) = 0.275\]

\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.15}{0.275} = \frac{0.105}{0.275} \approx 0.38\]

### For Business Administration:
\[P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) = P(E)\]

\[P(\neg H)\) is remaining probability mass (1 - 0.1).
\[P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) = 0.03 + 0.18 = 0.21\]

\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.21} = \frac{0.03}{0.21} \approx 0.14\]

Combining this analysis:

{
  "computer science": 0.38,
  "business administration": 0.14
}
