To compute \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' Rule, we need to determine the following for each field (computer science and business administration):

1. \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in that field.
2. \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood of Adam's personality traits given that he is enrolled in that field.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): The likelihood of Adam's personality traits given that he is not enrolled in that field.

Let's reason through these probabilities based on Adam's described personality trait.

**Computer Science**

1. \(P(H_{\text{CS}})\): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science. Let's assume there are various fields of specialization; we might reason that the probability of computer science among all grad fields might be moderate, say 0.1 (10%).

2. \(P(E|H_{\text{CS}})\): Given Adam's high intelligence, quiet nature, love of solving puzzles, and interest in abstract concepts—traits often associated with computer science students—this probability is likely high. We could estimate it as 0.7 (70%).

3. \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}})\): The likelihood of Adam's personality traits given that he is not in computer science. Given that similar traits can be found in various analytical or technical fields but less concentrated than in CS, let's estimate this as 0.3 (30%).

Using Bayes Rule:
\[
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)}
\]
\[
P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{CS}})
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.7 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9 = 0.07 + 0.27 = 0.34
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.34} \approx 0.2059 =  0.206
\]

**Business Administration**

1. \(P(H_{\text{BA}})\): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration. We'd estimate a similar proportion among all grad fields as we did for computer science, so let’s use 0.1 (10%) again.

2. \(P(E|H_{\text{BA}})\): Given Adam's personality traits (warm heart, empathy, love for animals, and understanding of hard work), these traits are less characteristic of a typical business administration student. Let's estimate this as 0.2 (20%).

3. \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}})\): This would be the likelihood of those traits manifesting given that Adam is not in business administration. Given that many other fields could match these traits (like environmental studies, psychology, etc.), let’s estimate this as 0.4 (40%).

Using Bayes Rule:
\[
P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)}
\]
\[
P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{BA}})
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.4 \cdot 0.9 = 0.02 + 0.36 = 0.38
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.38} \approx 0.0526 =  0.053
\]

Hence, the answers:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.206,
  "business administration": 0.053
}
```
