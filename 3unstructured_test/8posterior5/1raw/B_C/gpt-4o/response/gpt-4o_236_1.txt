To calculate the probability of Adam being in each of the fields, we can use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since \( P(E) \) is the same for all fields and thus a normalizing constant, we can compare \( P(H|E) \) by comparing the numerators, \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

Let's look at \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field.

**Business Administration**:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is studying business administration. As a rough average, let's say \( P(H) \) = 0.1.
- \( P(E|H) \): Assuming Adam has a personality sketch that includes a love for nature, solving puzzles, empathy, animals, and understanding abstract concepts, these traits are less common in business administration students. Hence, let’s set \( P(E|H) \) = 0.2.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability that Adam’s personality sketch would occur regardless of him being in business administration. Since these traits don’t particularly align with business administration, let's set this to 0.8.

Now, calculate \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \cdot 0.1 = 0.02 \]

**Computer Science**:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is studying computer science. Again, using a rough average, let's say \( P(H) \) = 0.1.
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam’s curiosity, problem-solving skills, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts, these traits are more common in computer science students. Hence, let’s set \( P(E|H) \) = 0.7.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability that Adam’s personality sketch would occur regardless of him being in computer science. These traits are relatively common in graduate students, so we can set this to 0.6.

Now, calculate \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.7 \cdot 0.1 = 0.07 \]

The results calculated are not the final probabilities but are proportional to the likelihood we're looking for.

{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.07
}

Since these values are proportional, we interpret these to mean that, based on Adam's personality sketch, it is more likely he is studying computer science compared to business administration.
