To calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study, we need to use Bayes' rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that there are other graduate fields of specialization besides computer science and business administration, total probabilities do not need to sum to 1. We will estimate values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \), then use these to compute \( P(H|E) \).

### Computer Science
1. **P(H):**
   - Assume an estimated probability that a random graduate student is in computer science: \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.2 \).

2. **P(E|H):**
   - Adam's traits such as high intelligence, problem-solving skills, and interest in abstract concepts align well with typical characteristics of computer science students: \( P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.7 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H):**
   - The likelihood of a graduate student with Adam's personality traits, if they are not in computer science, taking into account broader fields: \( P(E|\neg \text{computer science}) = 0.3 \).

### Business Administration
1. **P(H):**
   - Assume an estimated probability that a random graduate student is in business administration: \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.15 \).

2. **P(E|H):**
   - Adam's traits, such as empathy, warm heart, and appreciation for hard work, are advantageous but less typical for a business administration student: \( P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.3 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H):**
   - The likelihood of a graduate student with Adam's personality traits if they are not in business administration: assuming same as above, \( P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) = 0.3 \).

### Computing \( P(H|E) \)
1. **Computer Science:**
   \[
   P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)}
   \]
2. **Business Administration:**
   \[
   P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)}
   \]

Since \( P(E) \) is common to both fields and is a normalizing constant for the posteriors, we don't need to calculate it explicitly to compare the two probabilities relative to each other.

Therefore, the results could be approximated as:
\[
P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \approx 0.14 / P(E)
\]
\[
P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \approx 0.045 / P(E)
\]

### Final JSON Output
Since we are comparing the relative magnitudes, we can omit the normalizing constant \( P(E) \) for simplicity:

  "computer science": 0.14,
  "business administration": 0.045
}
