To determine the probability that Adam is enrolled in either "computer science" or "business administration" based on his personality sketch and using Bayes' rule, we must first make some educated guesses about the values of P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|\neg H).

Here are the required probabilities:
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the given field without any additional information.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam's personality given that he is enrolled in the specified field.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam's personality given that he is not enrolled in the specified field.

### For Computer Science:
1. **P(H)**: Let's assume computer science is a reasonably common field. Let's estimate P(H) as 0.1.
2. **P(E|H)**: Adam's personality traits (high intelligence, problem-solving, appreciation for hard work) align well with computer science. Let’s estimate P(E|H) as 0.7.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: This is the probability of Adam’s personality if he is not in computer science. Since not every field may have these characteristics, let's estimate P(E|\neg H) at 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \),
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) = 0.07 + 0.27 = 0.34 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.34} \approx 0.2059 \]

### For Business Administration:
1. **P(H)**: Let’s assume business administration is another common field. Let’s estimate P(H) as 0.1.
2. **P(E|H)**: Adam’s personality (understanding and appreciation for hard work) also fits reasonably well with business administration, though not perfectly. Let’s estimate P(E|H) as 0.4.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: As before, let's keep the same value for consistency. Estimate P(E|\neg H) at 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \),
\[ P(E) = (0.4 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) = 0.04 + 0.27 = 0.31 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.1}{0.31} \approx 0.1290 \]

Thus, the result is:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2059,
  "business administration": 0.1290
}
```

These values indicate that, based on the given personality traits, there is a higher probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science compared to business administration.
