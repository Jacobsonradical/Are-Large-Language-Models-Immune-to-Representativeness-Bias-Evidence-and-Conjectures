To objectively estimate the probabilities, I need to make some reasonable assumptions based on the information provided in Adam’s personality sketch and a general understanding of these fields.

Note: The values provided are estimates and involve some degree of subjectivity.

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality traits E given that Adam is enrolled in field H.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the personality traits E given that Adam is not enrolled in field H.

### Estimating P(H)
Given there are many fields of study, I'll assign a low but nonzero prior probability to each field.

- P(H_computer_science): 0.1
- P(H_business_administration): 0.1
- Sum of all other fields (not explicitly listed): 0.8

### Estimating P(E|H) and P(E|\neg H)

Given Adam’s traits, here are some estimations:

- **Computer Science:**
  - P(E|H_computer_science): Scientists tend to have a high appreciation for solving puzzles and abstract thinking. However, a strong empathy and deep love for animals might be less common.
    - Let's estimate P(E|H_computer_science) = 0.4
    
  - P(E|\neg H_computer_science): In fields other than computer science, we might see these traits less frequently but still present.
    - Let’s estimate P(E|\neg H_computer_science) = 0.3

- **Business Administration:**
  - P(E|H_business_administration): This field typically involves social interaction and leadership skills. While empathy is valued, traits like a love for nature and solving puzzles might be less central.
    - Let's estimate P(E|H_business_administration) = 0.2
    
  - P(E|\neg H_business_administration): The probability that we see these traits outside business administration might be higher.
    - Let’s estimate P(E|\neg H_business_administration) = 0.35

### Using Bayes Rule

Bayes' theorem is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be calculated as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Now, let's calculate:

- For Computer Science:
  - P(E) = (0.4 * 0.1) + (0.3 * 0.9) = 0.04 + 0.27 = 0.31
  - P(H|E_computer_science) = \(\frac{0.4 * 0.1}{0.31} \approx 0.129 \)

- For Business Administration:
  - P(E) = (0.2 * 0.1) + (0.35 * 0.9) = 0.02 + 0.315 = 0.335
  - P(H|E_business_administration) = \(\frac{0.2 * 0.1}{0.335} \approx 0.060 \)

### Final Result
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.129,
  "business administration": 0.060
}
```
