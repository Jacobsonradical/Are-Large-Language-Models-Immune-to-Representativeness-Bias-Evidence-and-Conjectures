In order to compute \( P(H|E) \) for the hypotheses that Adam was enrolled in business administration or computer science, we need to use Bayes' Rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( H \) is the hypothesis (either business administration or computer science).
- \( E \) is the evidence (Adam's personality sketch).
- \( \neg H \) denotes the complement hypothesis (any field other than the given hypothesis).

Let's start by evaluating the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field. Since graduate students can enroll in a wide variety of fields, both business administration and computer science are popular choices, but we assume they do not represent the majority.

Assume the following rough estimates:
- \( P(H_{business\ administration}) = 0.10 \)
- \( P(H_{computer\ science}) = 0.15 \)

Now, we need to make educated guesses on \( P(E|H) \) for each field. The likelihood \( P(E|H) \) represents how likely it is that a student enrolled in the specified field would match Adam's personality sketch.

For business administration (\( P(E|H_{business\ administration}) \)):
- This field typically values leadership, communication skills, and strategic thinking, which doesn't strongly align with Adam's personality traits focused on nature, puzzles, empathy, and abstract concepts.
- Let's assume \( P(E|H_{business\ administration}) = 0.05 \)

For computer science (\( P(E|H_{computer\ science}) \)):
- This field values problem-solving skills, abstract thinking, and often attracts individuals who enjoy puzzles and have high intelligence, fitting Adam's sketch quite well.
- Let's assume \( P(E|H_{computer\ science}) = 0.40 \)

Next, we estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \), the probability of Adam's personality in fields other than the specific hypotheses:
- Given the vast diversity of graduate fields and personalities, we use an average likelihood across these fields.
- Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.02 \)

Finally, we can calculate the marginal probability \( P(E) \) by considering all possible hypotheses, but focusing on our two fields for simplicity in this scenario:

\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H_{business\ administration}) \cdot P(H_{business\ administration}) + P(E|H_{computer\ science}) \cdot P(H_{computer\ science}) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(\neg H) \approx 1 - (P(H_{business\ administration}) + P(H_{computer\ science})) \]
\[ P(\neg H) \approx 1 - (0.10 + 0.15) = 0.75 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.05 \cdot 0.10 + 0.40 \cdot 0.15 + 0.02 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.005 + 0.060 + 0.015 = 0.080 \]

Now, applying Bayes' rule:

For business administration:
\[ P(H_{business\ administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{business\ administration}) \cdot P(H_{business\ administration})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{business\ administration}|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.10}{0.080} \approx 0.0625 \]

For computer science:
\[ P(H_{computer\ science}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{computer\ science}) \cdot P(H_{computer\ science})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{computer\ science}|E) = \frac{0.40 \cdot 0.15}{0.080} \approx 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0625,
  "computer science": 0.75
}
```
