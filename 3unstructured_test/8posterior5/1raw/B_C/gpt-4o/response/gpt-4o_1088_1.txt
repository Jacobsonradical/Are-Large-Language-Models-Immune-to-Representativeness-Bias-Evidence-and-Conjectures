To use Bayes' theorem, we need the following information:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the evidence (personality sketch) given that Adam was in the given field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the evidence given that Adam was not in the given field.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
However, since we are considering only two fields, we can use:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Let's estimate the probabilities:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): Let's assume a prior of students going into Business Administration is around 0.1 (10% of graduate students).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's personality traits, it seems less likely he would choose Business Administration, which may lack the nature-oriented and puzzle-solving elements he enjoys. Estimate this at 0.1.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given the variety of other fields, let's assume a moderate likelihood of the personality traits fitting other fields. Estimate this at 0.25.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Let's assume a prior of students going into Computer Science is around 0.2 (20% of graduate students).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's affinity for solving puzzles and abstract concepts, this seems probable. Estimate this at 0.7.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Estimate a similar moderate likelihood for the personality traits fitting other fields. Estimate this at 0.25.

Now we calculate the posterior probabilities:

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \times 0.1 = 0.01 \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.7 \times 0.2 = 0.14 \]

Normalize these probabilities:

Total = \( 0.01 + 0.14 = 0.15 \)

So the normalized probabilities are:

\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.15} \approx 0.067 \]
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.14}{0.15} \approx 0.933 \]

Thus, the final estimates are:

  "business administration": 0.067,
