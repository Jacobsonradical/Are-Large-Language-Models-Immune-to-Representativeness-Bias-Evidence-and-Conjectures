Sure, let’s proceed with the calculations. First, consider the three probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam, based on the personality sketch, is characteristic of someone in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that someone with Adam's characteristics is not in that field.

Finally, we’ll use Bayes' rule to calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence, but since we are only comparing two fields, it's a common factor and does not need to be calculated explicitly for the comparison.

### Computer Science
- **P(H):** Assume the prior probability of Adam being in Computer Science is moderate but not extremely high given that it’s a common field - let’s assign it as 0.2.
- **P(E|H):** Given that Adam is intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, which are important for computer science, along with enjoying solving puzzles, the likelihood is fairly high - let’s say 0.7.
- **P(E|\neg H):** For fields other than computer science, these characteristics might be somewhat common but not as pronounced - let’s estimate it at 0.3.

Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]

### Business Administration
- **P(H):** The prior probability of Adam being in Business Administration can be considered moderate but possibly less than that for Computer Science - let’s assign it as 0.15.
- **P(E|H):** The empathy, warm heart, and understanding of hard work and dedication are favorable, but intelligence and solving puzzles fit less neatly - let’s set it at 0.4.
- **P(E|\neg H):** For fields other than Business Administration, these characteristics might be less favorable compared to the previous case - let’s set it at 0.35.

Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.15}{P(E)} \]

Given these inputs, we can compare them proportionally without explicitly calculating \( P(E) \):

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7 * 0.2 / (0.7 * 0.2 + 0.4 * 0.15),
  "business administration": 0.4 * 0.15 / (0.7 * 0.2 + 0.4 * 0.15)
}
```

### Normalizing:
- For Computer Science: \( \frac{0.7 \times 0.2}{0.7 \times 0.2 + 0.4 \times 0.15} = \frac{0.14}{0.14 + 0.06} = \frac{0.14}{0.2} = 0.7 \)
- For Business Administration: \( \frac{0.4 \times 0.15}{0.7 \times 0.2 + 0.4 \times 0.15} = \frac{0.06}{0.14 + 0.06} = \frac{0.06}{0.2} = 0.3 \)

So, the results after normalization are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```
