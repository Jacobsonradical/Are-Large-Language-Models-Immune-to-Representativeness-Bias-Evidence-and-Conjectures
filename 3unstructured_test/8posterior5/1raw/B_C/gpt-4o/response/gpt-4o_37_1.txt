Let's break down the components for each field of study. We'll consider the likelihoods \(P(H)\), \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E|\neg H)\) based on the personality sketch of Adam. Then we'll apply Bayes' Rule to compute \(P(H|E)\).

### 1. Computer Science
**P(H):** The general prior probability that a graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in Computer Science. Let's assume it's moderately common, so we'll assign \(P(H) = 0.2\).

**P(E|H):** The likelihood that Adam's characteristics would be observed if he is a Computer Science student. Given his high intelligence and interest in solving puzzles, but considering the minor fit with deep love for animals and nature, we'll estimate \(P(E|H) = 0.4\).

**P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood that Adam's characteristics would be observed if he is not a Computer Science student. Given his profile fits relatively well with other fields as well, we'll estimate \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.3\).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)} {P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}\]

\[ P(computer\ science|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2} {0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8}\]
\[ P(computer\ science|E) = \frac{0.08} {0.08 + 0.24}\]
\[ P(computer\ science|E) = \frac{0.08} {0.32}\]
\[ P(computer\ science|E) = 0.25\]

### 2. Business Administration
**P(H):** The general prior probability that a graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in Business Administration. Let's assume it's quite common, so we'll assign \(P(H) = 0.3\).

**P(E|H):** The likelihood that Adam's characteristics would be observed if he is a Business Administration student. Considering the weak alignments (nature, empathy, deep love for animals are not commonly associated), we'll estimate \(P(E|H) = 0.1\).

**P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood that Adam's characteristics would be observed if he is not a Business Administration student. We'll keep it similar to the prior assessment, \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.3\).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)} {P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}\]

\[ P(business\ administration|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.3} {0.1 \cdot 0.3 + 0.3 \cdot 0.7}\]
\[ P(business\ administration|E) = \frac{0.03} {0.03 + 0.21}\]
\[ P(business\ administration|E) = \frac{0.03} {0.24}\]
\[ P(business\ administration|E) = 0.125\]

Based on the calculations:

{
  "computer science": 0.25,
  "business administration": 0.125
}
