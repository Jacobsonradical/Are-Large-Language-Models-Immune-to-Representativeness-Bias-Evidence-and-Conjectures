Sure, I'll evaluate the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in either computer science or business administration, based on the given personality sketch, and I'll use Bayes' theorem to compute the probabilities. 

Let's start by defining the probabilities:
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability of being enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Probability of the personality sketch \(E\) given enrollment in the field \(H\).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of the personality sketch \(E\) given enrollment in any other field.

Let's make some reasonable assumptions for the priors and the conditional probabilities.

### Computer Science
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): Prior probability of a graduate student being in computer science. This could be roughly estimated as \(0.2\), assuming computer science is a common field but not overwhelmingly so.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): Given Adam's personality sketch, the probability that he is in computer science might be reasonably high because his intelligence and aptitude for solving puzzles align well with common traits in this field. Let's assume \(0.6\).
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \): Given the personality sketch, the probability that Adam is in any other field might be lower compared to computer science. This might be around \(0.3\).

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}} | E) = \frac{P(E | H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \]
Where \(P(E)\) (the marginal probability of the evidence) can be decomposed using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E | H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E | \neg H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \]

Using the numbers:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}} | E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{(0.6 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}} | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.24} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}} | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.36} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}} | E) = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.333 \]

### Business Administration
- \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): Prior probability of a graduate student being in business administration. This could be roughly estimated as \(0.1\), assuming it's a little less common than computer science.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): The probability given his sketch might be lower because his traits align less with those typically needed for business. Let's assume \(0.2\).
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \): Given the personality sketch, the probability that Adam is in any other field might be approximately the same as before, around \(0.3\).

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}} | E) = \frac{P(E | H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \]
Where \(P(E)\) can be decomposed using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E | H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E | \neg H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \]

Using the numbers:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}} | E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{(0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}} | E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.27} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}} | E) = \frac{0.02}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}} | E) \approx 0.069 \]

### Results
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.333,
  "business administration": 0.069
}
```

These probabilities suggest that, based on his personality sketch, Adam is more likely to have been enrolled in computer science than in business administration in 2021.
