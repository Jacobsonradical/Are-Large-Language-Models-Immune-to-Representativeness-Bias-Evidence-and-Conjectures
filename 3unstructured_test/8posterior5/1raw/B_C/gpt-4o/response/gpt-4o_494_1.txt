To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \(P(E)\) is the same for both hypotheses, we only need to compare the numerators \(P(E|H) \cdot P(H)\) for each hypothesis. 

First, let's consider each field:

### Business Administration:
1. **P(H)**: The probability that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration. Given that there are many different fields of graduate study, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam fits the personality sketch given that he is enrolled in Business Administration. This might be lower since Business Administration may not typically align with his strong empathy, deep love for animals, and strong appreciation for hard work and nature. Let's assign \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that Adam fits the personality sketch given he is not in Business Administration. This would be higher, possibly due to fields like environmental science, biology, etc., fitting his personality better. Let's assign \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.9 \).

Now, calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.1 = 0.01 \]

### Computer Science:
1. **P(H)**: The probability that Adam is enrolled in Computer Science. Given the popularity of the field, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam fits the personality sketch given he is enrolled in Computer Science. He displays high intelligence and good abstract thinking ability, which are advantageous in Computer Science. Assume \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that Adam fits the personality sketch given he is not in Computer Science. Assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \).

Now, calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.4 \cdot 0.2 = 0.08 \]

### Summary of Results:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.01,
  "computer science": 0.08
}
```

These values suggest that based on the personality sketch provided, Adam is more likely to be enrolled in Computer Science compared to Business Administration. However, remember these calculations are based on assumed probabilities, and the true likelihood could differ.
