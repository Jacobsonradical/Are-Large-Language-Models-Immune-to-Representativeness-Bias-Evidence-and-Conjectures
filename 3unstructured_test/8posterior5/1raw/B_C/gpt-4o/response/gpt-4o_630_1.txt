To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need the following probabilities:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field \( H \).
- \( P(E | H) \): The probability of Adam having the personality sketch \( E \) given that he was enrolled in field \( H \).
- \( P(E | \neg H) \): The probability of Adam having the personality sketch \( E \) given that he was not enrolled in field \( H \).

Since exact values are not provided, we'll make reasonable estimates based on typical characteristics associated with each field and the given personality sketch.

Bayes' rule is expressed as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll assess \( P(E|H) \) based on how well the personality sketch aligns with typical characteristics of graduates in those fields.

1. **Computer Science**

   - \( P(H = \text{computer science}) \): Estimate around 0.15 (typical undergraduate majors distribution).
   - \( P(E | H = \text{computer science}) \): Given Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, along with problem-solving skills, we'll estimate this at around 0.6.
   - \( P(E | \neg H = \text{computer science}) \): Since the personality sketch might fit other fields as well, estimate this around 0.2.

   Using Bayes' rule:
   \[
   P(H = \text{computer science} | E) = \frac{P(E | H = \text{computer science}) \cdot P(H = \text{computer science})}{P(E)}
   \]

2. **Business Administration**

   - \( P(H = \text{business administration}) \): Estimate around 0.10 (typical undergraduate majors distribution).
   - \( P(E | H = \text{business administration}) \): Given Adamâ€™s empathy and understanding of hard work, we'll estimate this at around 0.3.
   - \( P(E | \neg H = \text{business administration}) \): Since the personality sketch matches less commonly with business administration, we'll estimate this around 0.25.

   Using Bayes' rule:
   \[
   P(H = \text{business administration} | E) = \frac{P(E | H = \text{business administration}) \cdot P(H = \text{business administration})}{P(E)}
   \]

To simplify calculations, we'll assume \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant.

Calculations:
1. For computer science:
\[ 
P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.15}{P(E)}
\]
\[ 
P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.09}{P(E)}
\]

2. For business administration:
\[ 
P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.10}{P(E)}
\]
\[ 
P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.03}{P(E)}
\]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both and acts as a normalizer, we only need the ratios.

Final probabilities:
\[
P(\text{computer science} | E) = \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.03} = \frac{0.09}{0.12} = 0.75
\]

\[
P(\text{business administration} | E) = \frac{0.03}{0.09 + 0.03} = \frac{0.03}{0.12} = 0.25
\]

Thus,

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.25
}
```
