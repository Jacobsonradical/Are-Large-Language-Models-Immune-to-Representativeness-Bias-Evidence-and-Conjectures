To apply Bayes' rule, we need to compute the probabilities step-by-step:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The probability of Adam being in a specific field before considering his personality sketch.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
3. **Marginal Likelihood \( P(E) \)** or \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in a specific field.

### Assumptions
1. **Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)**
   - \( P(H_{cs}) \): Letâ€™s assume the probability of Adam enrolling in computer science as an average graduate student being in that field. Say 0.2.
   - \( P(H_{ba}) \): Similarly, the probability of Adam enrolling in business administration can be considered lower. Say 0.1.

2. **Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \)**
   - \( P(E|H_{cs}) \): The probability that Adam would show the described personality traits if he were a computer science student. Since this field values strong problem-solving skills and often attracts intelligent students with an appreciation for abstract concepts, this value might be 0.6.
   - \( P(E|H_{ba}) \): The probability that Adam would show these traits if he were a business administration student. Given that business administration may not align as closely with Adam's interests and skills, this value might be lower, perhaps 0.3.

3. **Marginal Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \) \)**: The probability of the personality traits in general graduate students who are not in the specified field. This can be more generalized given that many fields value problem-solving and intelligent individuals.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{cs}) \): Say it is around 0.4 for non-computer science students.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{ba}) \): Say it is around 0.4 similarly for non-business administration students.

### Compute Posterior using Bayes' Rule
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here let's assume \( P(E) \) is normalized such that it considers alternative fields and is balanced.

### Computer Science
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{0.4} = \frac{0.12}{0.4} = 0.3 \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.4} = \frac{0.03}{0.4} = 0.075 \]

Putting this into the requested format:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.075
}
```

These values represent the posterior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in computer science and business administration fields, given his personality sketch. Note that these values do not add up to 1 because there are other possible fields that Adam could be enrolled in as well.
