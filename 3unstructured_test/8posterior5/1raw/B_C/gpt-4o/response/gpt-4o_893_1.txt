To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch \( E \), we need to use Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam having the personality sketch \( E \) if he was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of Adam having the personality sketch \( E \) if he was not enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of Adam having the personality sketch \( E \).

For simplicity, we will focus on the relative probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field.

### Computer Science

- **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability of a graduate student being enrolled in computer science.
  Let's assume \( P(H_{CS}) \approx 0.2 \) (20% of graduate students might be in CS).

- **\( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood of Adam having this personality if he is a computer science student.
  Given Adam's high intelligence and interest in abstract concepts, as well as puzzle-solving abilities, \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) is quite high.
  Let's assume \( P(E|H_{CS}) \approx 0.7 \).

- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The likelihood of Adam having this personality if he is not a computer science student.
  Given the general fit of his personality with other fields as well, \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \approx 0.1 \).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) cancels out in relative comparison, we focus on the numerator:

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) = 0.7 \times 0.2 = 0.14 \]

### Business Administration

- **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability of a graduate student being enrolled in business administration.
  Let's assume \( P(H_{BA}) \approx 0.15 \) (15% of graduate students might be in BA).

- **\( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood of Adam having this personality if he is a business administration student.
  Given Adam's empathy, warm-hearted nature, and appreciation for hard work, \( P(E|H_{BA}) \approx 0.4 \).

- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The likelihood of Adam having this personality if he is not a business administration student.
  Given the fit of his personality with other fields as well, \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \approx 0.1 \).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) cancels out in relative comparison, we focus on the numerator:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) = 0.4 \times 0.15 = 0.06 \]

### Final Comparison

Let's normalize these to get relative probabilities:

- For computer science: \( 0.14 \)
- For business administration: \( 0.06 \)

Hence, we can compute rough relative probabilities for the likelihood \( P(H|E) \):

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.70,
  "business administration": 0.30
}
```

These are relative probabilities, indicating it's more likely Adam is a computer science student given his personality traits, but there is still a considerable probability he could be in business administration.
