To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \), we use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field (computer science or business administration).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \) is true.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \) is false.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the evidence \( E \), which can be decomposed as:
  
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's evaluate these probabilities for each field.

### For Computer Science:
- \( P(H_\text{CS}) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Suppose we start with an initial guess of 0.2 (20%).
- \( P(E|H_\text{CS}) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he is studying computer science. Given the description of Adam, certain traits like high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts align well, but a deep love for animals and nature might be less common. Let's estimate it at 0.3.
- \( P(E|\neg H_\text{CS}) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he was not studying computer science. Considering a variety of other fields, let's assume a higher probability for this broader case, say 0.7.

### For Business Administration:
- \( P(H_\text{BA}) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Suppose we start with an initial guess of 0.1 (10%).
- \( P(E|H_\text{BA}) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he is studying business administration. Business administration is less directly linked to Adam's interests and traits provided. Let’s estimate it at 0.1.
- \( P(E|\neg H_\text{BA}) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he was not studying business administration. Let’s estimate it slightly higher given the broader range of fields, say 0.8.

### Calculation:

Let's denote:
- \(P(H_\text{CS}|E)\) as the posterior for computer science given evidence \( E \).
- \(P(H_\text{BA}|E)\) as the posterior for business administration given evidence \( E \).

#### For Computer Science:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_\text{CS}) \cdot P(H_\text{CS}) + P(E|\neg H_\text{CS}) \cdot P(\neg H_\text{CS}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.3 \times 0.2 + 0.7 \times 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.06 + 0.56 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.62 \]

\[ P(H_\text{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_\text{CS}) \cdot P(H_\text{CS})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{0.62} \]
\[ P(H_\text{CS}|E) \approx \frac{0.06}{0.62} \]
\[ P(H_\text{CS}|E) \approx 0.097 \]

#### For Business Administration:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_\text{BA}) \cdot P(H_\text{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_\text{BA}) \cdot P(\neg H_\text{BA}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.1 \times 0.1 + 0.8 \times 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.01 + 0.72 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.73 \]

\[ P(H_\text{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_\text{BA}) \cdot P(H_\text{BA})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_\text{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.1}{0.73} \]
\[ P(H_\text{BA}|E) \approx \frac{0.01}{0.73} \]
\[ P(H_\text{BA}|E) \approx 0.014 \]
