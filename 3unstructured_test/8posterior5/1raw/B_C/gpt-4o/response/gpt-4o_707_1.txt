To apply Bayes' rule and determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science (H1) or Business Administration (H2), given his personality sketch (E), we will need to estimate the prior probabilities P(H1) and P(H2), the likelihoods P(E|H1) and P(E|H2), and the corresponding complementary likelihoods P(E|¬H1) and P(E|¬H2).

We compute the posterior probabilities as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we do not have the exact values for the prior probabilities and likelihoods, we'll make educated estimates based on Adam's personality sketch and typical characteristics of students in these fields.

### Step-by-Step Estimates

#### Prior Probabilities
Let's assume equal initial probabilities for being in either field since we have no prior distribution:

\( P(H1) = 0.5 \)
\( P(H2) = 0.5 \)

#### Likelihoods
Based on Adam's personality sketch:

- **Computer Science (H1)**
  - Adam is described as highly intelligent, good at understanding abstract concepts, enjoys solving puzzles, and has a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication.
  - These traits align well with those needed for success in Computer Science.
  - Therefore, we estimate \( P(E|H1) \approx 0.8 \).

- **Business Administration (H2)**
  - While some traits such as intelligence and hard work also apply to Business Administration, others like a deep love for nature and animals don't align as closely.
  - Therefore, we estimate \( P(E|H2) \approx 0.3 \).

#### Complementary Likelihoods

- **Computer Science (H1) Not True (\( \neg H1 \))**
  - Given the traits, it seems less probable for Adam to be in other fields not closely related to his personality.
  - Therefore, we estimate \( P(E|¬H1) \approx 0.4 \).

- **Business Administration (H2) Not True (\( \neg H2 \))**
  - Similar reasoning makes it less likely for Adam to be in other fields not closely related to his personality.
  - Therefore, we estimate \( P(E|¬H2) \approx 0.7 \).

### Bayes' Rule Application

First, let's calculate \( P(E) \), the normalization constant, for both hypotheses. 

\[ P(E) = P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1) + P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2) + P(E|\neg H1) \cdot P(\neg H1) + P(E|\neg H2) \cdot P(\neg H2) \]

However, we need \( \neg H1 \) and \( \neg H2 \) to sum up to the remaining probability. This estimation approach works simplistically since values are normalized equally:

#### Computer Science:
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{(0.8 \cdot 0.5) + (0.3 \cdot 0.5) } \approx \frac{0.4}{0.4 + 0.15} \approx \frac{0.4}{0.55} \approx 0.727 \]

#### Business Administration:
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.5}{(0.8 \cdot 0.5) + (0.3 \cdot 0.5) } \approx \frac{0.15}{0.4 + 0.15} \approx \frac{0.15}{0.55} \approx 0.273 \]

### Final Answer

  "computer science": 0.727,
  "business administration": 0.273
