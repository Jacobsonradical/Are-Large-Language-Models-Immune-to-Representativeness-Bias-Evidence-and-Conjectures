To use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \) for the hypotheses, we need to estimate the following probabilities for each field \( \textit{computer science} \) and \( \textit{business administration} \):

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not in that field.

Let's assume general priors and estimates for these probabilities based on typical graduate student distributions and the provided personality sketch.

For Computer Science:
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): Assume a moderate prior, say 0.2 (20%), given the popularity of the field among graduate students.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): Adam's attributes like high intelligence and puzzle solving fit well, but curiosity about nature/plants and love for animals don't strongly align. Estimate this at around 0.3 (30%).
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \): Since these attributes are quite general, this could be estimated at around 0.6 (60%).

For Business Administration:
- \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): Assume a smaller prior, say 0.1 (10%), given the relatively fewer students present in such programs with Adam's interests.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): Strong empathy and understanding for hard work/dedication fit. Attributes like a love for animals and nature are not typical. Estimate this at around 0.2 (20%).
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \): Given the general nature of the personality traits, estimate this at around 0.65 (65%).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(E)_{\text{CS}} = (0.3 \cdot 0.2) + (0.6 \cdot 0.8) = 0.06 + 0.48 = 0.54 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.54} = \frac{0.06}{0.54} \approx 0.111 \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(E)_{\text{BA}} = (0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.65 \cdot 0.9) = 0.02 + 0.585 = 0.605 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.605} = \frac{0.02}{0.605} \approx 0.033 \]

Hence, the computed probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.111,
  "business administration": 0.033
}
```

These values do not sum up to 1 because we did not consider every possible graduate field specialization.
