To apply Bayes' Rule, we need the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood of the evidence under the negation of the hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H) \). Then, Bayes' Rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where \( P(E) \) can be computed as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) P(H) + P(E|\neg H) P(\neg H) \]

Given the personality sketch of Adam and the possible fields of business administration and computer science, we need to make certain assumptions. Here are the values:

### Business Administration

#### Prior \( P(H) \)
- Business administration is a common graduate field, but it might not be the most probable choice for someone with Adam's traits.
- Let's assume \( P(\text{Business Administration}) = 0.10 \).

#### Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)
- The traits described in E (curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy, interest in solving puzzles, intelligence, understanding abstract concepts) are somewhat less typical for business administration.
- Let's estimate \( P(E|\text{Business Administration}) = 0.05 \).

#### Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)
- For fields other than business administration, these traits might still be relevant, especially in fields like biology or environmental science.
- Let's assume \( P(E|\neg \text{Business Administration}) = 0.20 \).

### Computer Science

#### Prior \( P(H) \)
- Computer science is also a common graduate field and is known for attracting intelligent individuals who enjoy solving puzzles.
- Let's assume \( P(\text{Computer Science}) = 0.20 \).

#### Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)
- The traits described in E are more closely aligned with a computer science background, especially the interest in puzzles and intelligence.
- Let's estimate \( P(E|\text{Computer Science}) = 0.30 \).

#### Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)
- If Adam was not in computer science, these traits might still apply to other fields like biology or environmental science.
- Let's assume \( P(E|\neg \text{Computer Science}) = 0.15 \).

### Calculations

#### Business Administration

\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{Business Administration}) \cdot P(\text{Business Administration})}{P(E)} \]

Where:

\[ P(E) = P(E|\text{Business Administration}) \cdot P(\text{Business Administration}) + P(E|\neg \text{Business Administration}) \cdot P(\neg \text{Business Administration}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.05 \cdot 0.10 + 0.20 \cdot 0.90 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.005 + 0.18 = 0.185 \]

So:

\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.10}{0.185} = \frac{0.005}{0.185} \approx 0.027 \]

#### Computer Science

\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science})}{P(E)} \]

Where:

\[ P(E) = P(E|\text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science}) + P(E|\neg \text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\neg \text{Computer Science}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.30 \cdot 0.20 + 0.15 \cdot 0.80 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.06 + 0.12 = 0.18 \]

So:

\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.30 \cdot 0.20}{0.18} = \frac{0.06}{0.18} \approx 0.333 \]

### Summary

Given the calculations, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.027,
  "computer science": 0.333
}
```

Note: These values are based on assumptions and illustrative estimates. Exact probabilities would require detailed and specific data.
