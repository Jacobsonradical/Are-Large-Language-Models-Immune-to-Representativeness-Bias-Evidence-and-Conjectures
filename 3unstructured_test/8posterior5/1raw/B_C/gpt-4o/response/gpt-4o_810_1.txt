To provide a quantitative answer, we need to first make some assumptions on the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field (P(H)), the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given each field (P(E|H)), and the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not in the fields specified (P(E|¬H)).

### Assumptions:

**Prior Probabilities (P(H)):**
- P(H_business) ∼ 0.1 (10%): Business Administration is a common graduate field, but not the most likely for someone with Adam's profile.
- P(H_cs) ∼ 0.2 (20%): Computer Science is quite common and has a more theoretical aspect which might attract someone interested in abstract concepts.

**Likelihood of the Personality Sketch (P(E|H)):**
- P(E|H_business) ∼ 0.2: Business Administration might attract some students with abstract thinking, but not as common for nature curiosity and empathy towards animals.
- P(E|H_cs) ∼ 0.5: Computer Science students often have high intelligence and enjoy solving problems, but the appreciation for nature and empathy toward animals may be less common.

**Likelihood of the Personality Sketch Given ¬H (P(E|¬H)):**
- Since there are many other fields that could fit Adam's personality sketch (biology, environmental science, psychology, etc.), let's assume P(E|¬H) ∼ 0.5. This reflects a modest likelihood given other fields not considered.

### Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

Let's apply this to Business Administration:

1. **P(E) for Business Administration:**
   \[
   P(E)_{business} = P(E|H_{business}) \cdot P(H_{business}) + P(E|¬H_{business}) \cdot P(¬H_{business})
   = 0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.5 \cdot 0.9 = 0.02 + 0.45 = 0.47
   \]

2. **Posterior Probability for Business Administration:**
   \[
   P(H_{business}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{business}) \cdot P(H_{business})}{P(E)_{business}} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.47} \approx 0.043
   \]

Now for Computer Science:

1. **P(E) for Computer Science:**
   \[
   P(E)_{cs} = P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs}) + P(E|¬H_{cs}) \cdot P(¬H_{cs})
   = 0.5 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.8 = 0.1 + 0.4 = 0.5
   \]

2. **Posterior Probability for Computer Science:**
   \[
   P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs})}{P(E)_{cs}} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.5} = 0.2
   \]

### Results:
Given the assumptions and calculations, here are the posterior probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.043,
  "computer science": 0.2
}

These probabilities suggest that while Adam's curiosity about nature, empathy, and intelligence align more closely with a field like Computer Science, they are less consistent with Business Administration.
