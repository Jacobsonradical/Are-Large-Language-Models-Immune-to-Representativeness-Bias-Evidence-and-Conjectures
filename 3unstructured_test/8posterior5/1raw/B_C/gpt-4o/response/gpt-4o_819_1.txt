To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field through Bayes' rule, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The prior probability of Adam being in each field. This can be estimated based on the general proportions of graduate students enrolled in these fields. For simplicity, we'll assume equal priors if we lack specific data.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of Adam having the described personality sketch, given that he is in the respective field.
3. **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of Adam having the described personality sketch, given that he is not in the respective field.

### Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: 
   - Graduate students in the U.S. have a diverse range of fields. Computer Science is a common field, so we can assume a reasonable prior. Let's assume \( P(H) \) is 0.2.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Adam’s traits include high intelligence, puzzle-solving ability, and understanding abstract concepts, which fit well with computer science. Thus, \( P(E|H) \) might be relatively high. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) as 0.7.

3. **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - Given Adam’s profile, these traits could broadly apply to other fields too. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) as 0.3.

Using Bayes’ rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.7 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.14}{0.14 + 0.24} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.14}{0.38} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.368 \]

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Business Administration is also a popular graduate field. Let's assume \( P(H) \) is 0.2 as well.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - The traits described, such as empathy and appreciation for hard work, are valuable in business administration but not exclusively descriptive of it. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) as 0.4.

3. **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - These traits can apply to many other fields, so the non-specific likelihood might be similar to CS. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) as 0.3.

Using Bayes’ rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.24} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.32} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.25 \]
