To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to apply Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the personality sketch, which can be expressed as:
  \[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's make some reasonable estimations for these probabilities based on Adam's personality sketch and the nature of the fields:

### Computer Science
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Let's assume a reasonable prior probability that a graduate student could be enrolled in Computer Science, say 0.2 (20%).
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Considering Adam's high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts, which are important characteristics for Computer Science, let's assume this likelihood to be reasonably high, perhaps 0.3 (30%).
3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Considering that many graduate students in other fields also possess high intelligence and may have other traits similar to those described, let's assume this likelihood to be 0.1 (10%).

### Business Administration
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Let's assume a reasonable prior probability that a graduate student could be enrolled in Business Administration, say 0.15 (15%).
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Considering business administration generally values empathy and understanding of hard work and dedication (though nature curiosity and puzzle-solving might be less directly relevant), let's assume a moderate likelihood, say 0.2 (20%).
3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Similar to Computer Science, many traits are generally applicable across various fields, so let's assume 0.1 (10%).

Given these assumptions, we can now calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field.

### Calculations

#### For Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability**: \( P(H) = 0.2 \)
2. **Likelihood**: \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \)
3. **Total Probability \( P(E) \)**:
   \[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
   \[ P(E) = 0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.1 \cdot 0.8 \]
   \[ P(E) = 0.06 + 0.08 = 0.14 \]

4. **Posterior Probability**:
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.14} \approx 0.4286 \]

#### For Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability**: \( P(H) = 0.15 \)
2. **Likelihood**: \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \)
3. **Total Probability \( P(E) \)** is still 0.14 because it is the same across different fields in the comparison; hence, recalculation is not needed.

4. **Posterior Probability**:
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{0.14} \approx 0.2143 \]
