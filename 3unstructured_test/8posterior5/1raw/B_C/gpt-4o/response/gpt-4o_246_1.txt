To determine \( P(H | E) \) for each field, we start with applying Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a common term and doesn't need to be normalized for a comparison between the two fields, we can evaluate the relative likelihoods of each.

Let's analyze each term:

1. **\( P(H) \)**: Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in each field.
2. **\( P(E | H) \)**: Probability of the evidence given that Adam is enrolled in each field.
3. **\( P(E | \neg H) \)**: Probability of the evidence given that Adam is not enrolled in each field.

### Computer Science
- **P(H)**: Computer Science is a relatively common field with many graduate students enrolled. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
- **P(E | H)**: Given Adam's characteristics—high intelligence, liking for solving puzzles, understanding abstract concepts—it's reasonable to assume that these align well with Computer Science. Let's assign \( P(E | H) = 0.7 \).
- **P(E | \neg H)**: There are many other fields where his characteristics could be relevant, so let's assume \( P(E | \neg H) = 0.2 \).

Using Bayes' Rule (ignoring \( P(E) \)):
\[ P(H | E) \propto P(E | H) \cdot P(H) = 0.7 \cdot 0.2 = 0.14 \]

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: Business Administration is also a common field among graduates. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
- **P(E | H)**: The traits such as high empathy, appreciation for hard work and dedication, and warm heart fit well in this field, although it's less about solving puzzles and abstract concepts. Let's assign \( P(E | H) = 0.5 \).
- **P(E | \neg H)**: Similar logic applies, \( P(E | \neg H) = 0.25 \).

Using Bayes' Rule (ignoring \( P(E) \)):
\[ P(H | E) \propto P(E | H) \cdot P(H) = 0.5 \cdot 0.15 = 0.075 \]

Based on our estimates, Adam is more likely to be enrolled in Computer Science than Business Administration.

The resulting normalized probabilities can be represented as:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.14,
  "business administration": 0.075
}
```

Note: These values are based on assumptions and are subject to the initial given probabilities. They indicate the relative likelihood rather than absolute probabilities.
