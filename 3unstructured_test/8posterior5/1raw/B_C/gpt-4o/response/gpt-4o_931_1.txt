To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study (computer science and business administration), we'll use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have the exact values, we'll make reasoned estimates for \( P(H) \) (the prior probability of being enrolled in each field), \( P(E|H) \) (the probability of seeing Adam's personality sketch given he is in a particular field), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) (the probability of seeing Adam's personality sketch given he is not in that field). We'll denote \( P(E) \) as the overall probability of seeing Adam's personality sketch, which can be considered as a normalizing constant.

1. **Computer Science**:
   - **P(H)**: 0.25 (assuming computer science is a relatively popular field among graduate students)
   - **P(E|H)**: 0.4 (Adam's personality of curiosity, high intelligence, and appreciation for solving puzzles fits reasonably well with traits beneficial in computer science)
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: 0.2 (Adam's traits could fit multiple professions, but they align somewhat less well with non-technical fields)

   By applying Bayes' rule and calculating the normalizing constant \( P(E) \):
   \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
   \[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.4 \times 0.25}{P(E)} \]

2. **Business Administration**:
   - **P(H)**: 0.15 (typically considered less common than other fields, inferred from Adam's personality sketch)
   - **P(E|H)**: 0.1 (Adam's traits don't seem to strongly align with standard expectations for business administration students)
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: 0.3 (Adam's traits, kindness, empathy, and solving puzzles can be useful but are not central)

   Similarly:
   \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
   \[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \times 0.15}{P(E)} \]

As we have estimated \( P(E) \) similarly for each, our relative values from the rule provide an insight into probabilities:

Relative values:
\[ \begin{aligned} 
  \text{"computer science"} &\approx 0.4 \times 0.25 = 0.1 \\
  \text{"business administration"} &\approx 0.1 \times 0.15 = 0.015 \\
\end{aligned} \]

Normalizing:
\[ P(E) = 0.1 + 0.015 = 0.115 \]

Hence our final probabilities:
\[ \begin{aligned} 
  P(\text{"computer science"} | E) &= \frac{0.1}{0.115} \approx 0.87 \\
  P(\text{"business administration"} | E) &= \frac{0.015}{0.115} \approx 0.13 \\
\end{aligned} \]

Therefore:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.87,
  "business administration": 0.13
}
```
