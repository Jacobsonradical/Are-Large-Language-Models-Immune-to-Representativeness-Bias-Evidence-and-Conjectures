Sure, let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**: This is the initial probability of Adam being enrolled in either field without any additional information.

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: This is the probability of observing the evidence \(E\) (Adam's personality sketch) given he is enrolled in the field \(H\).

3. **Complement Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)**: This is the probability of observing the evidence \(E\) given he is not enrolled in the field \(H\).

4. **Posterior Probability \(P(H|E)\)**: This is what we ultimately want to calculate using Bayes' theorem: 

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, we'll assume prior probabilities \(P(H)\) to be generally equal across fields (since we don't have more information) and focus more on the likelihoods \(P(E|H)\) and \(P(E|\neg H)\).

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**: Let's assume there are many fields and this field is one among them.  
   \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \)

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: 
   - Business administration students could have a wide variety of interests and traits, but Adam's strong empathy, deep love for animals, and interest in nature make it less likely compared to another field. 
   - However, high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts might be somewhat relevant.

   Since Adam's personality sketch does not heavily correlate with typical traits of a business administration student, we can set a lower likelihood.
   \( P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \)

3. **Complement Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)**:
   - This covers the probability of having such traits in other fields. Given the fields left are considerably large, the probability can be high.
   \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4  \)

### Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**: Same initial assumptions.
   \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \)

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: 
   - Computer science students often have a high level of intelligence and enjoy solving puzzles, which fits well with Adam.
   - Empathy and love for animals are less common but not unheard of.

   Considering all these, Adam's traits align reasonably well with this field.
   \( P(E|H) \approx 0.4 \)

3. **Complement Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)**: 
   - This is the probability of Adam having these personality traits but not studying computer science.
   \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \)

### Posterior Calculation

Using Bayes' theorem,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \] 

We compute this proportionally for business administration and computer science. Since we only need relative values for comparison:

Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \cdot 0.1 = 0.02 \]

Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.4 \cdot 0.1 = 0.04 \]

Combining relative posterior values and converting to a scale (for ease) reflecting beliefs:

\{
  "business administration": \( 0.02 \),
  "computer science": \( 0.04 \)
\}

Thus, the updated probabilities based on given data are:

\{
  "business administration": 0.33 (33%),
  "computer science": 0.67 (67%)
\}
