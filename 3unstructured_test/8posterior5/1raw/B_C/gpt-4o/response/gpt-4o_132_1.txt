Sure, let's apply Bayes' rule to compute \(\text{P(H|E)}\) for each field. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[
\text{P(H|E)} = \frac{\text{P(E|H)} \cdot \text{P(H)}}{\text{P(E)}}
\]

where:
- \(\text{P(H)}\) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field.
- \(\text{P(E|H)}\) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in that field.
- \(\text{P(E)}\) is the total probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.

Given that \(\text{P(E)}\) is the same for both fields, we can focus on the relative values of \(\text{P(H)}\), \(\text{P(E|H)}\), and \(\text{P(E|}\neg\text{H)}\). We'll assign reasonable probabilities based on the information provided.

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \(\text{P(H)}\)**:
   - Business administration is a popular field but may not be highly aligned with Adam's personality traits. Let's assume \(\text{P(H)} = 0.2\).

2. **Likelihood \(\text{P(E|H)}\)**:
   - Adam's personality does not strongly align with business administration, which generally requires strategic thinking and a focus on management rather than empathy and nature. Let's assume \(\text{P(E|H)} = 0.1\).

3. **Complementary Likelihood \(\text{P(E|}\neg\text{H)}\)**:
   - Given \(\neg\text{H}\) can be any other field, and Adam's traits are not common in business administration, we can assume \(\text{P(E|}\neg\text{H)}\) is higher. Let's assume \(\text{P(E|}\neg\text{H)} = 0.8\).

### Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability \(\text{P(H)}\)**:
   - Computer science is also a common field for graduate students. Given Adam's high intelligence and interest in solving puzzles, this field appears more aligned with his personality. Let's assume \(\text{P(H)} = 0.3\).

2. **Likelihood \(\text{P(E|H)}\)**:
   - Computer science involves problem-solving and abstract thinking, aligning well with Adam's traits. Let's assume \(\text{P(E|H)} = 0.6\).

3. **Complementary Likelihood \(\text{P(E|}\neg\text{H)}\)**:
   - Given \(\neg\text{H}\) can be any other field, and considering fields unrelated to problem-solving or abstract concepts, we can assume \(\text{P(E|}\neg\text{H)}\) is lower. Let's assume \(\text{P(E|}\neg\text{H)} = 0.4\).

Using Bayes' rule, we can now compute \(\text{P(H|E)}\) for both fields:

For Business Administration:
\[
\text{P(H|E)} = \frac{\text{P(E|H)} \cdot \text{P(H)}}{\text{P(E)}} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.8 \cdot (1 - 0.2)} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.64} = \frac{0.02}{0.66} \approx 0.03
\]

For Computer Science:
\[
\text{P(H|E)} = \frac{\text{P(E|H)} \cdot \text{P(H)}}{\text{P(E)}} = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.3}{0.6 \cdot 0.3 + 0.4 \cdot (1 - 0.3)} = \frac{0.18}{0.18 + 0.28} = \frac{0.18}{0.46} \approx 0.39
\]

Hence, the resulting probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.03,
  "computer science": 0.39
}
```
