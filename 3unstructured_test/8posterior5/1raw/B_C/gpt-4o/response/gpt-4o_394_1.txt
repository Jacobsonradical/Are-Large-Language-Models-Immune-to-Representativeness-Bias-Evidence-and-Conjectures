Let's start by analyzing the given fields based on the personality sketch of Adam. We will first assign probabilities to the hypotheses \( H \) (Adam being enrolled in a specific field) and then evaluate the conditional probabilities for Adam's characteristics given \( H \) or \( \neg H \).

--------

1. **Business Administration**

- **\( P(H) \)**: Probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration. Considering it's a common field with many students, we can assign a moderate probability.
  \[ P(H)_{BA} = 0.2 \]

- **\( P(E|H) \)**: Probability that someone in business administration has Adam's personality traits. Students in business administration may value empathy, intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts, but curiosity about nature and love for animals are less relevant.
  \[ P(E|H)_{BA} = 0.1 \]

- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Probability that someone not in business administration has Adam's personality traits. Given the broad range of fields, we consider a lower likelihood for this specific set of traits.
  \[ P(E|\neg H)_{BA} = 0.01 \]

- **\( P(H|E) \)**: Using Bayes' rule,
  \[
  P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{P(E|H)_{BA} \cdot P(H)_{BA}}{P(E)}
  \]
  where \( P(E) \) can be computed as \( P(E) = P(E|H)_{BA} \cdot P(H)_{BA} + P(E|\neg H)_{BA} \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Since \( P(\neg H) = 0.8 \),
  \[
  P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.01 \cdot 0.8 = 0.02 + 0.008 = 0.028
  \]
  \[
  P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.028} \approx 0.714
  \]

--------

2. **Computer Science**

- **\( P(H) \)**: Probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science. It is also a common graduate field with many students.
  \[ P(H)_{CS} = 0.2 \]

- **\( P(E|H) \)**: Probability that someone in computer science has Adam's personality traits. Given Adam's intelligence, problem-solving skills, and appreciation for hard work, this fits well with a computer science background. Additionally, a strong concern for abstract concepts aligns closely with this field.
  \[ P(E|H)_{CS} = 0.5 \]

- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Probability that someone not in computer science has Adam's personality traits. Considering the myriad other fields, this probability might be lower.
  \[ P(E|\neg H)_{CS} = 0.01 \]

- **\( P(H|E) \)**: Using Bayes' rule,
  \[
  P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{P(E|H)_{CS} \cdot P(H)_{CS}}{P(E)}
  \]

Again, \( P(E) \) can be computed as \( P(E) = P(E|H)_{CS} \cdot P(H)_{CS} + P(E|\neg H)_{CS} \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Since \( P(\neg H) = 0.8 \),
  \[
  P(E) = 0.5 \cdot 0.2 + 0.01 \cdot 0.8 = 0.1 + 0.008 = 0.108
  \]
  \[
  P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.108} \approx 0.926
  \]

--------

Combining these computations, the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field are:

{
  "business administration": 0.714,
  "computer science": 0.926
}
