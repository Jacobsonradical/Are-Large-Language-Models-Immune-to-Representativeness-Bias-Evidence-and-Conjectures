To apply Bayes' rule, we'll use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we need to apply this to two fields, we assume:

1. \(P(H)\): Probability that Adam was enrolled in the field.
2. \(P(E|H)\): Probability of the personality sketch given enrollment in the field.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): Probability of the personality sketch given not enrolled in the field.

Let's make some educated guesses based on the provided sketch and then apply Bayes' rule.

### Business Administration:

1. **P(H)**: Let's say the prior probability that any given student is enrolled in Business Administration is moderate. Assuming a value of 0.2.

2. **P(E|H)**: The personality traits described (curiosity about nature, love for animals, understanding of abstract concepts) seem less typical for a business administration student. So let's assign a lower probability, say 0.1.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: This would be the probability of having the personality traits described if Adam is not in business administration. Since these traits might fit many non-business fields, let's assume a higher probability of 0.5.

Calculating \(P(H|E)\):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we don't have a direct value for \(P(E)\), the overall probability of the personality sketch.

In the context of comparative reasoning, we can use:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

So for Business Administration,

\[ P_{\text{business administration}}(H|E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

### Computer Science:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that any given student is enrolled in Computer Science is relatively high. Assuming a value of 0.3.

2. **P(E|H)**: The personality traits described (high intelligence, solving puzzles, understanding abstract concepts) fit well with a computer science student. Let's assign a higher probability, say 0.7.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Similar as above, let's assume 0.5 for non-computer science fields.

So for Computer Science,

\[ P_{\text{computer science}}(H|E) \propto 0.7 \cdot 0.3 = 0.21 \]

### Normalizing (if needed):

To find out the exact probabilities, we need to normalize these proportional values:

Total proportional value: \(0.02 + 0.21 = 0.23\).

Normalized probabilities:

For Business Administration:

\[ P_{\text{business administration}}(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.23} \approx 0.087 \]

For Computer Science:

\[ P_{\text{computer science}}(H|E) = \frac{0.21}{0.23} \approx 0.913 \]

So, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.087,
  "computer science": 0.913
}
```
