When using Bayes' theorem to compute the probability of a hypothesis given evidence, we use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence.

Because we do not have the exact numerical values for these probabilities, we can reason about them qualitatively to provide an estimate. Below are our qualitative assessments:

### Computer Science
- **P(H)**: Prior probability Adam was enrolled in computer science.
  - Computer science is a popular graduate field, but not necessarily in line with Adam's personality given his interests in nature and animals. Therefore, P(H) might be modestly low.

- **P(E|H)**: Probability of observing Adam's personality given that he is in computer science.
  - Adam's curiosity and high intelligence are consistent with computer science. However, his empathy and love for animals are less typical. Consequently, P(E|H) would be moderate.

- **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability of observing Adam's personality given that he is not in computer science.
  - There are other fields more aligned with Adam's interests (e.g., biology, ecology, psychology). Thus, P(E|\neg H) would be higher compared to P(E|H).

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: Prior probability Adam was enrolled in business administration.
  - This field is broad but does not match Adam's described interests in nature and animals directly. Hence, P(H) might be moderately low.

- **P(E|H)**: Probability of observing Adam's personality given that he is in business administration.
  - Business administration typically involves leadership and management, which might not be a direct fit with his quiet nature and empathy for animals. Therefore, P(E|H) would be quite low.

- **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability of observing Adam's personality given that he is not in business administration.
  - As with computer science, there are fields that fit Adamâ€™s profile better, indicating P(E|\neg H) would be relatively high.

Taking these assessments into account, we might estimate the resulting probabilities qualitatively:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

This reflects that, given Adam's personality, it is somewhat more likely for him to be involved in a field other than computer science or business administration, though computer science is still a more plausible option compared to business administration due to his intelligence and problem-solving skills.
