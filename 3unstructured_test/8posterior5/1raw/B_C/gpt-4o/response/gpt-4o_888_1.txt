Let's first outline the relevant probabilities for each field of study: Business Administration and Computer Science.

**Business Administration:**
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam was not enrolled in Business Administration.

**Computer Science:**
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam was not enrolled in Computer Science.

Given Adam's personality traits, such as a love for nature, a warm heart, empathy, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work, these characteristics might not perfectly align with the typical profile for either Business Administration or Computer Science. However, we can make some educated guesses.

### Business Administration

- **P(H)**: Let's assume the general prior likelihood of someone being a Business Administration graduate student. Let's estimate it at 0.3 (30%).
- **P(E|H)**: The probability that someone with Adam’s personality traits would be in Business Administration. Business Administration does involve understanding abstract concepts, but might not align as well with a deep love for animals and nature. Let's estimate this at 0.2 (20%).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that someone with Adam’s traits would not be in Business Administration. Given the traits, it’s more likely he's in another field that fits his interests better. Let's estimate this at 0.8 (80%).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E)= \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))} \]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ P(H|E_{BA}) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.3}{0.2 \times 0.3 + 0.8 \times 0.7} = \frac{0.06}{0.56} \approx 0.107 \]

### Computer Science

- **P(H)**: Let's assume the general prior likelihood of someone being a Computer Science graduate student. Let's estimate it at 0.3 (30%).
- **P(E|H)**: The probability that someone with Adam’s personality traits would be in Computer Science. Given his love for solving puzzles and high intelligence, this seems somewhat likely, let’s estimate this at 0.4 (40%).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that someone with Adam’s traits would not be in Computer Science. Given his other interests, it’s possible he might be in other fields. Let's estimate this at 0.6 (60%).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E_{CS}) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.3}{0.4 \times 0.3 + 0.6 \times 0.7} = \frac{0.12}{0.54} \approx 0.222 \]

Therefore, the computed probabilities using Bayes' Rule are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.107,
  "computer science": 0.222
}
