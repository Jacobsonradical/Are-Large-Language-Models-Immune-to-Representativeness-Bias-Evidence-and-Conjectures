Sure, let's go through the process step-by-step for both fields to compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule. Bayes' Rule is expressed as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to determine the following probabilities for each field hypothesis:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in the field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in the field.

### For Computer Science:

1. **Prior probability (P(H)):** 
     - Assuming an equal chance of choosing any field initially, let's denote \( P(H) = 0.1 \) for computer science since there are numerous fields Adam could be choosing from.
    
2. **Likelihood (P(E|H)):**
     - Adam’s interests and characteristics closely align with attributes often associated with computer science students (high intelligence, abstract thinking, puzzle-solving).
     - Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).

3. **Probability of evidence given not H (P(E|\neg H)):**
     - This is the probability that Adam exhibits these traits if he is not in computer science but another field.
     - Assuming that these traits are relatively rare but not exclusive to computer science, we can estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

Now, we compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be obtained as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.7 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.07 + 0.18 = 0.25 \]

So,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.25} = 0.28 \]

### For Business Administration:

1. **Prior probability (P(H)):**
     - Let’s denote \( P(H) = 0.1 \) for business administration, similarly to computer science.
    
2. **Likelihood (P(E|H)):**
     - Adam’s traits do not strongly lean towards business administration attributes, which often include leadership and socializing skills.
     - Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).

3. **Probability of evidence given not H (P(E|\neg H)):**
     - This is the same as above since it involves the same negative hypothesis pool.
     - We estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

Now, we compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the same as previously computed:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.18 = 0.20 \]

So,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.20} = 0.1 \]
