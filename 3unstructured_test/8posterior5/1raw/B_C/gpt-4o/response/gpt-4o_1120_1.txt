To solve for \( P(H|E) \), we need to use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field. 

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)**: Let's assume that around 10% of all graduate students are in Business Administration.
   
   \[ P(H_{BA}) = 0.1 \]

2. **P(E|H)**: The description of Adam doesn't strongly match a typical profile for Business Administration (which might focus more on leadership, finance, and management skills rather than curiosity about nature, empathy, and abstract problem-solving).

   Let's estimate: 

   \[ P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.1 \]

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: This includes all students not in Business Administration. Given that many fields might better match Adam's profile (e.g., biology, environmental science), let's estimate this a bit higher:

   \[ P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.3 \]

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.1}{0.3} = \frac{0.01}{0.3} \approx 0.033 \]

### Computer Science
1. **P(H)**: Let's assume that around 15% of all graduate students are in Computer Science.

   \[ P(H_{CS}) = 0.15 \]

2. **P(E|H)**: Adam's skills (high intelligence, abstract thinking, puzzle-solving) are a good match for Computer Science.

   Letâ€™s estimate:

   \[ P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.5 \]

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: This includes all students not in Computer Science. Given that many other fields could match Adam's profile, let's keep it around:

   \[ P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.3 \]

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.5 \times 0.15}{0.3} = \frac{0.075}{0.3} = 0.25 \]

So, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.033,
  "computer science": 0.25
}
```
