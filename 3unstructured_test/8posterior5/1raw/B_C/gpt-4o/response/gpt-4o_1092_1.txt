Sure, we can use Bayes' rule to compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in each field given his personality sketch. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the personality sketch.

For simplicity, since \( P(E) \) will be the same for both fields when we compare them, it can be treated as a normalizing constant. We only need the ratios of \( P(E|H) \times P(H) \) for different fields.

Let's denote:
- \( P(H_\text{CS}) \) as the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(H_\text{BA}) \) as the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.

### Computer Science:
- \( P(H_\text{CS}) \): It's reasonable to assume that a decent number of graduate students are in computer science, so let’s assume a prior probability of 0.3.
- \( P(E|H_\text{CS}) \): Given Adam’s curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts, it’s plausible he could be in computer science. However, his deep love for animals and nature might make it less likely. Let’s assign this a moderate probability of 0.4.
- \( P(E|\neg H_\text{CS}) \): If Adam is not in computer science, the characteristics might still fit many other fields. Let’s assume this probability is 0.6.

### Business Administration:
- \( P(H_\text{BA}) \): Let’s assume a prior probability of 0.2, as business administration is a common field but not as common as computer science for graduate students focused on nature and empathy.
- \( P(E|H_\text{BA}) \): Given the personality sketch, it's less likely that someone with strong empathy, curiosity about nature, and love for animals would be in business administration, so let’s assign a lower probability of 0.2.
- \( P(E|\neg H_\text{BA}) \): If Adam is not in business administration, the traits could still describe him well in other fields. Let’s assume this probability is 0.7.

Using these assumptions:
\[ P(H_\text{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_\text{CS}) \cdot P(H_\text{CS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \times 0.3}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_\text{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_\text{BA}) \cdot P(H_\text{BA})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant, we can directly compare the numerators:

\[
\frac{P(H_\text{CS}|E)}{P(H_\text{BA}|E)} = \frac{0.4 \times 0.3}{0.2 \times 0.2} = \frac{0.12}{0.04} = 3
\]

Adam is 3 times more likely to be in computer science than in business administration given his personality sketch. Normalizing the probabilities:
\[
P(H_\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.04} = \frac{0.12}{0.16} = 0.75
\]
\[
P(H_\text{BA}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.12 + 0.04} = \frac{0.04}{0.16} = 0.25
\]

Thus, our results are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.25
}
```
