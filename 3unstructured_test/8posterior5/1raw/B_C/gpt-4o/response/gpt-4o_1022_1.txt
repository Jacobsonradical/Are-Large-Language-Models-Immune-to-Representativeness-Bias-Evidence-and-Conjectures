To compute the probabilities using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate:

1. \( P(H) \) - Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field.
2. \( P(E|H) \) - Likelihood of Adam's personality traits given that he is enrolled in a specific field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - Likelihood of Adam's personality traits given that he is not enrolled in a specific field.

Next, we can compute \( P(H|E) \), the posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch, using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Now let's assign approximate values for each of these probabilities based on the given information.

### Business Administration
1. **Prior Probability:**
   - \( P(\text{H}) \): There are many graduate fields of specialization, so the prior probability of any specific one (e.g., business administration) can be relatively low.
   - Let's assume:
     \[ P(\text{H}_{\text{business}}) = 0.1 \]
   
2. **Likelihood:**
   - Adam's interests and personality traits do not immediately align with typical business administration students who may prioritize leadership, economics, and business strategy over nature, animals, and puzzles. However, this does not rule out a business administration background entirely.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given the aforementioned considerations:
     \[ P(E|\text{H}_{\text{business}}) = 0.2 \]
   
3. **Likelihood (Negation):**
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): We consider the probability of Adam having his personality traits without being in business administration. Given his interests in nature and puzzles, this likelihood may actually be higher outside of business administration.
     \[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.8 \]
   
Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(\text{H}_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{H}_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(\text{H}_{\text{business}})}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|\text{H}_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(\text{H}_{\text{business}}) + P(E|\neg \text{H}_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(\neg \text{H}_{\text{business}}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.8 \cdot 0.9 = 0.02 + 0.72 = 0.74 \]

So:
\[ P(\text{H}_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.74} = \frac{0.02}{0.74} \approx 0.027 \]

### Computer Science
1. **Prior Probability:**
   - \( P(\text{H}) \): Similarly, let's assume the prior probability of Adam being in computer science, given the wide range of specializations:
     \[ P(\text{H}_{\text{comp-sci}}) = 0.1 \]

2. **Likelihood:**
   - Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work align well with computer science, where such traits are often beneficial.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given this alignment:
     \[ P(E|\text{H}_{\text{comp-sci}}) = 0.6 \]
   
3. **Likelihood (Negation):**
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam having these traits but not being in computer science is still quite high given his varied interests.
     \[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \]
   
Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(\text{H}_{\text{comp-sci}}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{H}_{\text{comp-sci}}) \cdot P(\text{H}_{\text{comp-sci}})}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|\text{H}_{\text{comp-sci}}) \cdot P(\text{H}_{\text{comp-sci}}) + P(E|\neg \text{H}_{\text{comp-sci}}) \cdot P(\neg \text{H}_{\text{comp-sci}}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.6 \cdot 0.1 + 0.4 \cdot 0.9 = 0.06 + 0.36 = 0.42 \]

So:
\[ P(\text{H}_{\text{comp-sci}}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.1}{0.42} = \frac{0.06}{0.42} \approx 0.143 \]

Result:

{
  "business administration": "0.027",
  "computer science": "0.143"
}
