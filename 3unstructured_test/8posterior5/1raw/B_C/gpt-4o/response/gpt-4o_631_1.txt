Sure, let's evaluate the probabilities for each of the given fields using Bayes' Rule. Bayes' Rule is mathematically represented as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We don't have explicit values for each of these probabilities, so we'll make some rough estimates based on common trends and the information provided about Adam.

### Computer Science

- **P(H):** This is the prior probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is enrolled in computer science. Given the popularity of computer science, let's estimate it at \(0.15\).

- **P(E|H):** This is the probability that Adam's personality aligns with the profile given that he is in computer science. While empathy and love for animals are not typically associated with this field, curiosity, high intelligence, and an affinity for puzzles are. Let's give this a moderate value of \(0.5\).

- **P(E|\neg H):** This is the probability that Adam's personality aligns with the profile given that he is not in computer science. Since his interests and skills could also fit well with several other fields, we can estimate this moderately at \(0.1\).

### Business Administration

- **P(H):** This is the prior probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is enrolled in business administration. Let's estimate it at \(0.1\).

- **P(E|H):** This is the probability that Adam's personality fits the profile given that he is in business administration. His traits do not strongly align with the business administration profile. We'll estimate this at \(0.2\).

- **P(E|\neg H):** This is the probability that Adam's personality fits the profile given that he is not in business administration. We'll maintain the same estimate as for computer science at \(0.1\).

### Applying Bayes Rule

We'll use the above estimates to compute \(P(H|E)\) for each field.

#### For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \(P(E)\) is the same for both fields when we are computing relative probabilities, we only need to compute the numerator:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.5 \times 0.15 = 0.075 \]

#### For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \times 0.1 = 0.02 \]

### Normalizing (Optional)
If we want to provide normalized values such that they sum up to 1, we can normalize the computed values:

Sum of computed values:
\[ 0.075 + 0.02 = 0.095 \]

Normalized probabilities:
- **Computer Science:** \( \frac{0.075}{0.095} \approx 0.789 \)
- **Business Administration:** \( \frac{0.02}{0.095} \approx 0.211 \)

However, the problem suggests that we don't need to sum up to 1, so we can directly output the probabilities we calculated:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.075,
  "business administration": 0.02
}
```

This format keeps the relative probabilities without normalizing them, as specified.

So, my final output as per the format requested would be:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.075,
  "business administration": 0.02
}
```
