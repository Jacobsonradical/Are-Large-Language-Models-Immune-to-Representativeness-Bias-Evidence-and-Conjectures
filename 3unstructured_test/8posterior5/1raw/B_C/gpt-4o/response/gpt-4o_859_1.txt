To calculate \( P(H|E) \), which is the probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific graduate field given his personality sketch, we need to use Bayes' Rule. Bayes' Rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the evidence (his personality sketch) given that he is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of the evidence given that he is not enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

First, we need to estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for the fields of business administration and computer science.

**Estimating Probabilities:**

1. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): Let's assume that the prior probability of a graduate student being enrolled in business administration is relatively moderate. We can assume \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.1 \) (10%).
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): Business administration might not align as closely with Adam's personality sketch (curiosity about nature, love for animals, solving puzzles). Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.2 \) (20%).
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \): The probability of the evidence if Adam is not in business administration would be higher given his profile fits more scientific or research-oriented fields. Letâ€™s assume \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.8 \) (80%).

2. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): The prior probability of a graduate student being enrolled in computer science might also be moderate. We can assume \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.1 \) (10%).
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): Computer science aligns better with Adam's personality sketch, especially his intelligence and puzzle-solving abilities. Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.6 \) (60%).
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \): The probability of the evidence if Adam is not in computer science might be lower since his traits fit well with the field. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.4 \) (40%).

Next, we use these values to calculate \( P(H|E) \) for both fields:
1. **Business Administration:**
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.02}{P(E)} \]

2. **Computer Science:**
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.06}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields, we can compare the numerators directly to determine the relative probabilities:

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx \frac{0.06}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \approx \frac{0.02}{P(E)} \]

Thus the values for \( P(H|E) \) for the two fields are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.25,
  "computer science": 0.75
}
```

These values suggest that, given Adam's personality sketch, it is more likely that he is enrolled in computer science compared to business administration.
