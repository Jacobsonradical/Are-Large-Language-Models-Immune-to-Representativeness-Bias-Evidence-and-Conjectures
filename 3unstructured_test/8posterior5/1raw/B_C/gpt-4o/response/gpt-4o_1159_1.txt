Let's break down the given personality sketch and assess the likelihood of Adam enrolling in either business administration or computer science, based on his described traits. 

Here's a recap of the Bayesian approach:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam enrolling in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence given that hypothesis.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence given the negation of that hypothesis.
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of Adam enrolling in that field given the evidence.

First, let's set some subjective prior assumptions for \( P(H) \) (the likelihood of a graduate student being in that field, without considering E):
- We assume \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \approx 0.15 \) (15% chance)
- And \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) \approx 0.20 \) (20% chance)

Next, we estimate \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for both fields.

### Business Administration
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \): Business administration students often deal with people and strategies, which might not perfectly fit Adam's personality related to nature, puzzles, and science affinity. Let's say \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \approx 0.05 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business administration}}) \): For graduate students in general, having Adam's traits (considering graduate fields outside business administration) might be higher. For approximation, let's use \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business administration}}) \approx 0.15 \).

### Computer Science
- \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \): Given Adam's interest in puzzles and abstract concepts, computer science seems like a good match. Let's say \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \approx 0.3 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{computer science}}) \): For students in other fields, Adam's traits are less specialized but still plausible. Let's approximate \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{computer science}}) \approx 0.1 \).

Bayes' Rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
Where
\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

Given prior assumptions and above estimates, calculate \( P(E) \) for each field.

For **Business Administration**:
\[
P(E) = (0.05 \times 0.15) + (0.15 \times 0.85) = 0.0075 + 0.1275 = 0.135
\]

Hence:
\[
P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.15}{0.135} \approx 0.0556
\]

For **Computer Science**:
\[
P(E) = (0.3 \times 0.2) + (0.1 \times 0.8) = 0.06 + 0.08 = 0.14
\]

Hence:
\[
P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{0.14} \approx 0.4286
\]

So the probability that Adam was enrolled in each field given his personality sketch is approximately:

{
  "business administration": 0.0556,
  "computer science": 0.4286
}
