Sure, let's walk through this step by step.

### 1. **Computer Science:**

**Step 1: Determine P(H) for Computer Science**
This represents the prior probability that a randomly selected graduate student is enrolled in computer science. This is hard to quantify without specific data, but let's assume it's reasonably common. We'll estimate it at 0.2 (20%).

**Step 2: Determine P(E|H) for Computer Science**
This is the likelihood of Adam's characteristics given he is in computer science. Given that he likes solving puzzles, is highly intelligent, and understands abstract concepts, but also has a strong empathy and love for animals and nature, I'll estimate this at 0.4 (40%).

**Step 3: Determine P(E|\neg H) for Computer Science**
This is the likelihood of Adam's characteristics given he is not in computer science. Given that these characteristics can be possessed by many people not in computer science (e.g., biology students), I'll estimate this at 0.1 (10%).

Now, apply Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll use the marginal likelihood \( P(E) \) which normalizes this to make it a proper probability. For simplicity, we can state \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing someone like Adam across all fields, which we'll consider roughly the same for a simplified calculation, and thus it cancels out in the relative comparisons.

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.4 \cdot 0.2 = 0.08 \]

### 2. **Business Administration:**

**Step 1: Determine P(H) for Business Administration**
This represents the prior probability that a randomly selected graduate student is enrolled in business administration. Letâ€™s assume this is also reasonably common. We'll estimate it at 0.15 (15%).

**Step 2: Determine P(E|H) for Business Administration**
The likelihood of Adam's characteristics given he is in business administration might be lower, as these traits (like curiosity about plants and nature) aren't as strongly associated with business administration. I'll estimate this at 0.05 (5%).

**Step 3: Determine P(E|\neg H) for Business Administration**
This is the same as before, at 0.1 (10%).

Now, apply Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.05 \cdot 0.15 = 0.0075 \]

Given these proportions:

- "computer science": 0.08
- "business administration": 0.0075

To provide these in decimal form between 0 and 1 in the format you indicated:
