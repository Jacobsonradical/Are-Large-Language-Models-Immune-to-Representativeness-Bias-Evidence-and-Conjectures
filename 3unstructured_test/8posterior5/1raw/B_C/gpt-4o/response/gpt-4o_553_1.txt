To analyze the given scenario using Bayes' Rule, we need to perform the following steps:

1. Assess the prior probability, \(P(H)\), for each field.
2. Assess the likelihood, \(P(E|H)\), for each field.
3. Assess the likelihood, \(P(E|\neg H)\), for each field.
4. Compute the posterior probability, \(P(H|E)\), using Bayes' Rule.

Bayes' Rule can be expressed as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

The total does not need to add up to 1 because there are other fields Adam could be enrolled in that we are not considering here.

### For Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability (\(P(H)\))**: Let's assume that the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a computer science program is 0.2 (20%). This is a subjective estimate but lets us proceed with the analysis.

2. **Likelihood (\(P(E|H)\))**: Given that Adam is good at puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts, these traits align well with a typical computer science student. So, we can estimate \(P(E|H)\) to be 0.8 (80%).

3. **Likelihood (\(P(E|\neg H)\))**: Given that these traits are not unique strictly to computer science but could be found in other fields, we might assume \(P(E|\neg H)\) to be 0.3 (30%).

### For Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability (\(P(H)\))**: Let's assume that the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a business administration program is 0.1 (10%).

2. **Likelihood (\(P(E|H)\))**: The personality sketch does not align strongly with typical business administration characteristics, but strong empathy and appreciation for hard work do fit. So, we could estimate \(P(E|H)\) to be 0.4 (40%).

3. **Likelihood (\(P(E|\neg H)\))**: Given that these traits are not unique to business administration, we might assume \(P(E|\neg H)\) to be 0.3 (30%).

Letâ€™s calculate the posterior probabilities:

### For Computer Science

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Note that: \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \).

Approximation for \(P(E)\):
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.16 + 0.24 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.4 \]

Now we compute \(P(H|E)\):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{0.4} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.16}{0.4} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.4 \]

### For Business Administration

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Approximation for \(P(E)\):
\[ P(E) = (0.4 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.27 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.31 \]

Now we compute \(P(H|E)\):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.1}{0.31} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.31} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.129 \]

These calculated values suggest the following:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.129
}
