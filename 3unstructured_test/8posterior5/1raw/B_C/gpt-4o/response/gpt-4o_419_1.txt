To determine \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to understand how well Adam's personality sketch (E) fits with each field (H). Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll use the following notations and assumptions:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality given that he was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality given that he was not enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality (can be calculated as a normalization constant).

Let's break down the values for each field.

### Business Administration

1. **P(H) for business administration (prior probability):**
   - Assume a uniform prior, given the number of potential fields. Let's assume 1/10 in absence of other information.
   - \( P(H) = 0.1 \)

2. **P(E|H) for business administration (likelihood):**
   - How well does the personality of Adam fit with Business Administration? Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has strong empathy, which are valuable in Business Administration, but his deep love for animals and nature might not fit perfectly.
   - \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \)

3. **P(E|\neg H) for business administration:**
   - Considering the personality traits, if Adam was not in Business Administration, these traits might fit better with other fields.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.8 \)

### Computer Science

1. **P(H) for computer science (prior probability):**
   - Given the large number of students enrolling in computer science, let's assume a prior of 1/10.
   - \( P(H) = 0.1 \)

2. **P(E|H) for computer science (likelihood):**
   - Adam's traits such as high intelligence, abstract thinking, solving puzzles, and quiet nature align well with Computer Science.
   - \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \)

3. **P(E|\neg H) for computer science:**
   - Given Adam's personality traits, if he weren't in Computer Science, the probability that he fits those roles well in another field isn't too high.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \)

Using these values, we now apply Bayes' Rule. For simplification purposes, let's ignore \( P(E) \) as a normalization constant and only compare the numerators since it is same for all hypotheses.

### Business Administration
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) \approx \frac{P(E|\text{business administration})P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = 0.02 \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) \approx \frac{P(E|\text{computer science})P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = 0.04 \]

For comparison:
\[ \frac{P(\text{computer science}|E)}{P(\text{business administration}|E)} = \frac{0.04}{0.02} = 2 \]

This ratio indicates that based on the personality sketch, Adam is roughly twice as likely to be in computer science compared to business administration.
