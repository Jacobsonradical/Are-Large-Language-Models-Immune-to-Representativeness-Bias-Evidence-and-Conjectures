Sure, let's break this down step-by-step for each field: computer science and business administration. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \), that is, the probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field. 
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis, that is, the probability of the personality sketch \( E \) if Adam was enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis is false, that is, the probability of the personality sketch \( E \) if Adam was not enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of \( E \), which can be expanded using the law of total probability: \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Let's assume generic prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field for simplicity, acknowledging that they are not strictly correct but will help demonstrate the calculation.

### For Computer Science

**P(H)**: Let's assume the probability that a graduate student is enrolled in Computer Science is approximately \( 0.2 \) (20%).

**P(E|H)**: Given the personality and skills of Adam, it seems quite plausible he could fit into Computer Science, given his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts. Let's estimate this at \( 0.5 \) (50%).

**P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam having this personality sketch while not being in Computer Science might also be reasonably high, as such traits are not exclusive to this field. Let this be \( 0.3 \) (30%).

We compute \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.5 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.1 + 0.24 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.34 \]

Now, we apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.34} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.34} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.294 \]

### For Business Administration

**P(H)**: Let's assume the probability that a graduate student is enrolled in Business Administration is approximately \( 0.2 \) (20%).

**P(E|H)**: Given the personality and skills of Adam, this field seems less likely as he appears more scientifically inclined. Let's estimate this at \( 0.2 \) (20%).

**P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam having this personality sketch while not being in Business Administration is arguably higher, as he does not show a strong inclination towards business-related traits. Let this be \( 0.4 \) (40%).

We compute \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.32 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.36 \]

Now, we apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.36} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.36} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.111 \]

So our final results are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.294,
  "business administration": 0.111
}
