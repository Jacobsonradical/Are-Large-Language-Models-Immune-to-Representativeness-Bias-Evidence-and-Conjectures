To calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood under the null hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Bayes' Rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Using the intuition provided by Adam's personality sketch \( E \), let's evaluate each field:

### Computer Science

- **Prior \( P(H) \)**: The probability that any given graduate student is in computer science.
  Suppose \( P(\text{H for CS}) \approx 0.1 \).

- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood that someone in computer science has Adam's described traits.
  Given the personality traits (e.g., high intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts), Adam could plausibly fit into computer science.
  So, \( P(E| \text{CS}) \approx 0.4 \).

- **Likelihood under null \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The likelihood of someone not in computer science having these traits.
  Given the mix of empathy, love for animals, and nature curiosity, it might be less common in CS, but let's assume a non-zero probability.
  So, \( P(E|\neg \text{CS}) \approx 0.2 \).

### Business Administration

- **Prior \( P(H) \)**: The probability that any given graduate student is in business administration.
  Suppose \( P(\text{H for BA}) \approx 0.1 \).

- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood that someone in business administration has Adam's described traits.
  Business administration students emphasizing empathy and a love for nature might be less common.
  So, \( P(E| \text{BA}) \approx 0.2 \).

- **Likelihood under null \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The likelihood of someone not in business administration having these traits is assumed to be similar across other fields.
  So, \( P(E|\neg \text{BA}) \approx 0.3 \).

### Calculation

1. For Computer Science:

\[ P(\text{CS}|E) \approx \frac{P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

2. For Business Administration:

\[ P(\text{BA}|E) \approx \frac{P(E|\text{BA}) \cdot P(\text{BA})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, assume \( P(E) \) normalizes the distribution sufficiently, and let's focus on the ratios:

\[
\frac{P(\text{CS}|E)}{P(\text{BA}|E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.1}{0.2 \cdot 0.1} = 2 \rightarrow P(\text{CS}|E) \approx 2 \cdot P(\text{BA}|E)
\]

Given this ratio, and the need for probabilities to sum to 1 for proportionate normalization (considering only these fields):

Let \( P(\text{BA}|E) = x \) and \( P(\text{CS}|E) = 2x \),

\[ 2x + x = 3x \]

Here we assume they represent their portion of the total:

\[
\implies P(\text{BA}|E) \approx \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.33 \quad \text{and} \quad P(\text{CS}|E) \approx \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.67
\]

Thus, the computed probabilities will be:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.67,
  "business administration": 0.33
}
```
