To answer this question, we'll follow the principles of Bayes' Theorem and consider the given information carefully.

Let’s denote:
- \( E \) as the evidence or personality sketch of Adam.
- \( H1 \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( H2 \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( \neg H1 \) as the negation of computer science.
- \( \neg H2 \) as the negation of business administration.

First, let’s evaluate the given probabilities:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the mentioned fields.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis.
  
Assumptions:
- Since Adam was a graduate student in the U.S., let's assume each field is equally likely before considering his personality sketch. For simplicity, we might assume \( P(H) \approx 0.05 \), since there are many fields of study.
- We have some estimates of \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \) based on the congruence of Adam's personality with typical traits of students in each field:

For computer science:
- Continual curiosity about abstract concepts and high intelligence might suit this field well, therefore, \( P(E|H1) \approx 0.8 \).
- For students not in computer science but in other fields, these traits might not be as strongly emphasized, hence \( P(E|\neg H1) \approx 0.2 \).

For business administration:
- Traits like a deep love for nature and animals along with strong empathy and a quiet, puzzle-solving demeanor might be less typical in business administration compared to fields like biology or psychology. Thus, \( P(E|H2) \approx 0.3 \), while \( P(E|\neg H2) \approx 0.7 \).

Using Bayes' Theorem, we compute:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
However, what we mainly need to compare is the relative likelihoods \( P(H|E) \), for which we simplify without needing \( P(E) \) explicitly:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Thus:
- For Computer Science:
\[ P(H1|E) \propto P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1) \approx 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04 \]

- For Business Administration:
\[ P(H2|E) \propto P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2) \approx 0.3 \cdot 0.05 = 0.015 \]

Thus, the relative likelihoods \( P(H|E) \) give us an idea of how probable each hypothesis is given Adam's personality sketch.

{
  "computer science": 0.04,
  "business administration": 0.015
}

These values indicate higher likelihood for Adam to be in computer science than business administration, given his personality sketch.
