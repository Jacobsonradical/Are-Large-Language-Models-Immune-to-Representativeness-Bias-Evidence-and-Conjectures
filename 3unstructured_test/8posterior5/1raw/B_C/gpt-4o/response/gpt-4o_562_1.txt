To compute \( P(H|E) \) for both business administration and computer science fields using Bayes' rule, we'll begin by estimating the probabilities for each component. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)**: Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Given no additional context, let's assume the prior is equally likely among numerous fields, but maybe slightly lower due to Adam's interests and personality sketch.
   \[ P(H) = 0.1 \]

2. **P(E|H)**: Probability of the evidence given that Adam was in business administration. This probability might be lower considering Adam's traits (empathy, animals, nature, puzzles) are not as commonly associated with business administration.
   \[ P(E|H) = 0.1 \]

3. **P(E | \neg H)**: Probability of the evidence given that Adam was not in business administration. Consider all non-business fields reasonably matching his personality.
   \[ P(E | \neg H) = 0.5 \]

   Using Bayes' rule:
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

   \( P(E) \) is a normalization constant, making sure probabilities sum correctly over all possible fields.

### Computer Science
1. **P(H)**: Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Given his intelligence and interest in puzzles, it seems plausible.
   \[ P(H) = 0.2 \]

2. **P(E|H)**: Probability of the evidence given that Adam was in computer science. High due to his enjoyment of solving puzzles and intelligence.
   \[ P(E|H) = 0.8 \]

3. **P(E | \neg H)**: Probability of the evidence given that Adam was not in computer science. Consider alternative fields that share some overlap.
   \[ P(E | \neg H) = 0.4 \]

   Using Bayes' rule:
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

Given \( P(E) \) should normalize the entire probability, specifics remain proportional:

### Combined:
{
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.01}{\text{normalization constant}} \) ≈ 0.02,
  "computer science": \( \frac{0.16}{\text{normalization constant}} \) ≈ 0.8
}

So:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.8
}
```
