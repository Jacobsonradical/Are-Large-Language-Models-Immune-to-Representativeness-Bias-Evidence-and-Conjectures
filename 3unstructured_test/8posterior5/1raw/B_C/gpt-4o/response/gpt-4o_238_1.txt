To calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we'll use Bayes' rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence, but since we are comparing hypotheses, \( P(E) \) will be a normalization factor. I'll assume some reasonable values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Let's start by assuming some reasonable priors:

- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): The likelihood that Adam exhibits this personality sketch given he is in computer science.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): The likelihood that Adam exhibits this personality sketch given he is in business administration.

### Assumptions

#### Computer Science (H_{\text{CS}})
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): Let's assume a 20% prior probability (\(0.20\)).
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): Computer science students can exhibit these traits (curiosity, intelligence, abstract thinking), moderately high likelihood, say 0.5.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \): Suppose the likelihood of these traits in non-computer science students is lower, say 0.3.

#### Business Administration (H_{\text{BA}})
- \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): Let's assume a 10% prior probability (\(0.10\)).
- \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): Business administration students are less likely to match this profile, moderately low likelihood, say 0.2.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \): Suppose the likelihood of these traits in non-business administration students is higher than business administration, say 0.4.

### Calculations

#### Computer Science
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.50 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.30 \)

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.50 \cdot 0.20}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = 0.10 / P(E) \]

#### Business Administration
- \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.10 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.40 \)

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.20 \cdot 0.10}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = 0.02 / P(E) \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant, let's compare the unnormalized values and renormalize. The normalizing constant is:

\[ P(E) \approx (P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})) + (P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.10 + 0.02 = 0.12 \]

So the normalized probabilities are:

#### Computer Science
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.10}{0.12} \approx 0.833 \]

#### Business Administration
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.12} \approx 0.167 \]
