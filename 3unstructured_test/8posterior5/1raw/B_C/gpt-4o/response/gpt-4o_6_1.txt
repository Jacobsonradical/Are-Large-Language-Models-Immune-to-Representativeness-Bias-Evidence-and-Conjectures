To apply Bayes' Rule, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Determine Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The initial probability that Adam is enrolled in the field, without any additional information.
2. **Determine Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of the evidence given that Adam is in the field.
3. **Determine Prior Probability of Not being in the Field \( P(\neg H) \)**: This is \( 1 - P(H) \).
4. **Determine Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of the evidence given that Adam is NOT in the field.
5. **Apply Bayes' Rule to Calculate Posterior Probability \( P(H|E) \)**:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

### Hypothesis 1: Computer Science

1. **Determine Prior Probability \( P(H_{CS}) \)**:
   - \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.2 \): Let's assume 20% probability initially since it's a common field.

2. **Determine Likelihood \( P(E|H_{CS}) \)**:
   - Evidence \( E \): Adam enjoys solving puzzles, has high intelligence, and understands abstract concepts.
   - These traits are highly consistent with characteristics common in computer science.
   - \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.6 \): 60% probability.

3. **Determine Prior Probability of Not being in the Field \( P(\neg H_{CS}) \)**:
   - \( P(\neg H_{CS}) = 1 - P(H_{CS}) = 0.8 \)

4. **Determine Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \)**:
   - Evidence \( E \): It's less likely but still possible in other fields, especially science or engineering-related fields.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.2 \): 20% probability.

5. **Apply Bayes' Rule**:
   \[
   P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.2}{(0.6 \times 0.2) + (0.2 \times 0.8)}
   \]
   \[
   P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.16} = \frac{0.12}{0.28} \approx 0.429
   \]

### Hypothesis 2: Business Administration

1. **Determine Prior Probability \( P(H_{BA}) \)**:
   - \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.1 \): Let's assume 10% probability initially since this is less likely given the personality sketch.

2. **Determine Likelihood \( P(E|H_{BA}) \)**:
   - Evidence \( E \): Solving puzzles, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts are less directly associated with business administration.
   - \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.1 \): 10% probability.

3. **Determine Prior Probability of Not being in the Field \( P(\neg H_{BA}) \)**:
   - \( P(\neg H_{BA}) = 1 - P(H_{BA}) = 0.9 \)

4. **Determine Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \)**:
   - Evidence \( E \): It's more likely in other fields.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.3 \): 30% probability.

5. **Apply Bayes' Rule**:
   \[
   P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.1}{(0.1 \times 0.1) + (0.3 \times 0.9)}
   \]
   \[
   P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.27} = \frac{0.01}{0.28} \approx 0.036
   \]
