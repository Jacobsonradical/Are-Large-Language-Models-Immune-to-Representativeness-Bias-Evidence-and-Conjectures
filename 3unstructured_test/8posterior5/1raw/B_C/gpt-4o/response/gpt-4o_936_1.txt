To apply Bayes' Theorem, we first need to assess the following probabilities for each field:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was enrolled in that field.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was not enrolled in that field.

We can calculate **P(H|E)** using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Since **P(E)** (the total probability of the evidence) is the same for all fields when we compare them, we focus on the numerators to understand the relative values. 

Let’s break it down:

### Business Administration
1. **P(H) for Business Administration:** Assume a generic prior probability for any given field among all possible fields (e.g., 0.1 if there are 10 fields evenly distributed).
2. **P(E|H) for Business Administration:**
   - Curiosity about nature and plants: Low probability.
   - Enjoys solving puzzles: Medium probability.
   - Warm heart and strong empathy: Medium probability – useful in management.
   - Deep love for animals: Low probability.
   - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts: Medium to high probability.
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication: High probability.
   Combined, this suggests a relatively lower likelihood for his personality fitting Business Administration.

3. **P(E|¬H) for Business Administration:** The likelihood of someone with Adam's characteristics being *not* in Business Administration, which can be higher given that only certain traits align well.

### Computer Science
1. **P(H) for Computer Science:** Assume a similar generic prior probability, 0.1.
2. **P(E|H) for Computer Science:**
   - Curiosity about nature and plants: Medium, interest in nature could lean towards more bioinformatics or environmental computing.
   - Enjoys solving puzzles: High probability.
   - Warm heart and strong empathy: Medium probability.
   - Deep love for animals: Medium probability, could align with certain CS applications.
   - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts: High probability.
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication: High probability.
   Combined, this suggests a relatively high likelihood for his personality fitting Computer Science.

3. **P(E|¬H) for Computer Science:** The likelihood of someone with Adam's characteristics being *not* in Computer Science would be lower since many traits align well.

Now let's assign specific (though arbitrary for illustration) values:

1. **Business Administration:**
   - **P(H) = 0.1**
   - **P(E|H) = 0.3**
   - **P(E|¬H) = 0.5** (higher than P(E|H) due to lower alignment of traits)

   Using Bayes:

   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \text { (focus on numerators as P(E) cancels) } = 0.03 \]

2. **Computer Science:**
   - **P(H) = 0.1**
   - **P(E|H) = 0.7**
   - **P(E|¬H) = 0.2** (lower than P(E|H) due to strong alignment of traits)

   Using Bayes:

   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \text { (focus on numerators as P(E) cancels) } = 0.07 \]


Finally, the relative values indicate the probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.03,
  "computer science": 0.07
}
