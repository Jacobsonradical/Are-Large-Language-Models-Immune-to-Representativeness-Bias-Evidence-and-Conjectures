To apply Bayes' rule and calculate the posterior probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for the given fields based on Adam's personality sketch \(E\), we need to follow specific steps:

1. **Define Prior \(P(H)\)**: This is the initial probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field before considering the personality sketch.

2. **Define Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: This is the probability of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam is enrolled in the field.

3. **Define Prior \(P(\neg H)\)**: This is the initial probability of Adam not being enrolled in the specific field.

4. **Define Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)**: This is the probability of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam is not enrolled in the field.

5. **Calculate Posterior \(P(H|E)\)**: Use Bayes’ rule to calculate the posterior probability.

Given Adam's characteristics, let's make some estimations for the fields in question.

### For Computer Science (CS)
1. **Prior \(P(H_{CS})\)**: Suppose the prior probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in computer science is 0.2.
2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H_{CS})\)**: The traits mentioned—high intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts, enjoys solving puzzles—align relatively well with what is expected of a CS student. Let's assign a likelihood of 0.7.
3. **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H_{CS})\)**: Since these traits are generally positive and not overly specific to computer science, they might also be common in other fields. Let's assume this probability is 0.3.

Applying Bayes’ rule: 
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto 0.7 \cdot 0.2 = 0.14 \]

### For Business Administration (BA)
1. **Prior \(P(H_{BA})\)**: Assume the prior probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in business administration is also 0.2.
2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H_{BA})\)**: Traits like strong empathy and an understanding and appreciation for hard work might be valued in business administration, though not as directly aligned as they are with computer science characteristics. Estimate the likelihood at 0.4.
3. **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H_{BA})\)**: Other fields can exhibit these traits too. Assume this probability is 0.5.

Applying Bayes’ rule:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto 0.4 \cdot 0.2 = 0.08 \]

Since the \(P(E)\) is the same for both calculations and acts as a normalizing factor, we are interested in the relative weights:

{
  "computer science": "0.14",
  "business administration": "0.08"
}

Thus, based on the personality sketch provided and these estimates, Adam appears more likely to be enrolled in computer science than in business administration.
