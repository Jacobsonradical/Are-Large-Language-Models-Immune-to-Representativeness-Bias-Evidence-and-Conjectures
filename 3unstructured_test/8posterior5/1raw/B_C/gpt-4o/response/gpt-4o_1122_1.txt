Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to estimate \(P(H)\), \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E|\neg H)\) for each hypothesis, then apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:

- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of Adam being in the given field.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch if Adam is in the given field.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch if Adam is not in the given field.
- \(P(E)\) is the total probability of observing the personality sketch.

Given that this isn't an exhaustive list of all possible fields, we don't need \(P(H) + P(\neg H)\) to sum to 1. 

Now, let's make some educated estimations:

### Business Administration

1. **Prior probability \(P(H)\)**:
   - Business administration is a relatively common field, but given Adam's specific characteristics (e.g., love for nature, animals, and abstract thinking), it doesn't seem to match a typical business administration profile very well. Let’s assume a prior probability of about 0.1.

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**:
   - If Adam were in a business administration program, the probability of the personality sketch (curiosity about nature, love for animals, abstract concepts) fitting is relatively low. Let’s estimate this at 0.2.
  
3. **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)**:
   - The probability of the personality sketch done on someone not in business administration aligns more with fields like biology or environmental science. As such, this might be around 0.8.

### Computer Science

1. **Prior probability \(P(H)\)**:
   - Computer science is a very common field for graduate students with high intelligence, good abstract thinking skills, and an interest in solving puzzles. Let's assume a prior probability of about 0.3.
  
2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**:
   - If Adam were in computer science, the probability of matching the personality sketch is relatively high, especially given his intelligence and puzzle-solving ability. Let’s say 0.6.
  
3. **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)**:
   - For other fields, the probability of matching the sketch would vary, but we can estimate this at around 0.5 as a rough average for all non-CS fields.

### Computing Posteriors

Let’s compute the posterior probabilities using Bayes' rule. Note that \( P(E) \) (the denominator) will not be explicitly calculated as the relative comparison suffices:

#### Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

#### Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \]

Now to normalize the values relatively:

For Business Administration (BA):
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.1 = 0.02 \]

For Computer Science (CS):
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto 0.6 \cdot 0.3 = 0.18 \]

Now, normalize them relative to each other:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.18} = \frac{0.02}{0.20} = 0.1 \] 
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.18}{0.02 + 0.18} = \frac{0.18}{0.20} = 0.9 \]

So our result is:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.9
}
