To determine the likelihood that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' Rule. The rule is as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) = Prior probability of the hypothesis
- \( P(E|H) \) = Likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) = Likelihood of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis
- \( P(E) \) = Total probability of the evidence (can be decomposed into \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \))

Let's assign some estimated values to these probabilities:

1. **Computer Science (CS):**
   - \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): Let's assume the prior probability of a graduate student being in CS is 0.25.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): Given Adam's traits (curiosity, intelligence, appreciation of hard work), CS is a plausible field, but not a perfect fit because of his strong love for nature and animals. Let's estimate this likelihood at 0.4.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \): For fields other than CS, given the variety of graduate programs, we might think Adam is quite likely to fit in many other fields. Let's estimate this likelihood at 0.1.

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.25}{0.4 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot (1 - 0.25)} = \frac{0.1}{0.1 + 0.075} = \frac{0.1}{0.175} \approx 0.571 \]

2. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): Let's assume the prior probability of a graduate student being in Business Administration is 0.10.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): Given Adam's traits, business administration seems less likely because it generally does not align with a strong love for nature and animals. Let's estimate this at 0.1.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \): For non-BA fields, Adam could fit better in many other fields. We'll estimate this likelihood at 0.2.

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.10}{0.1 \cdot 0.10 + 0.2 \cdot (1 - 0.10)} = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.18} = \frac{0.01}{0.19} \approx 0.053 \]

So the posterior probabilities can be expressed as:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.571,
  "business administration": 0.053
}
```

These values suggest that based on Adam's personality sketch, it's more likely he was enrolled in computer science than in business administration.
