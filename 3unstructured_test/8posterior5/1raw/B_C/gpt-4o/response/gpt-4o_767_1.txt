To estimate the probabilities, we need to consider the traits described in Adam's personality sketch and match them with the likelihood of him being enrolled in either computer science (CS) or business administration (BA). Here are the key steps for each field:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the given field without any additional information.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam having these personality traits given that he is enrolled in the given field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam having these personality traits given that he is not enrolled in the given field.

**Computer Science (CS)**:
- P(H): A reasonable prior for being in CS might be moderate (e.g., around 0.3) since CS is a popular graduate field.
- P(E|H): The likelihood of a CS student having Adam’s traits (high intelligence, puzzle-solving, understanding abstract concepts) is quite high, though empathy and love for animals may be less directly related but not contrary. Let's estimate this as around 0.6.
- P(E|\neg H): If not in CS, Adam’s traits could fit into many other fields. Let's estimate this as around 0.5 because these personality traits might be common in various academic areas, especially ones involving problem-solving and curiosity.

Applying Bayes’ rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.6 \times 0.3}{(0.6 \times 0.3) + (0.5 \times 0.7)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.18}{0.18 + 0.35} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} \approx 0.34 \]

**Business Administration (BA)**:
- P(H): A reasonable prior for being in BA might be lower since this field is less associated with the specific interests and traits mentioned. Let's say around 0.2.
- P(E|H): The likelihood of a BA student having Adam’s traits might be lower, maybe around 0.4.
- P(E|\neg H): Again estimated as 0.5 for the same broad applicability of the traits across various fields.

Applying Bayes’ rule:
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.4 \times 0.2}{(0.4 \times 0.2) + (0.5 \times 0.8)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.4} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.08}{0.48} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} \approx 0.17 \]

So, based on the estimates:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.34,
  "business administration": 0.17
}
