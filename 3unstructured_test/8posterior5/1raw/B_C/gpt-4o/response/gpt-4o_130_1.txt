To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \), we can use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll need to estimate prior probabilities \( P(H) \), likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the marginal likelihood \( P(E) \):

1. **Prior Probability (\( P(H) \))**:
   - \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field without knowing his personality sketch. We may need to assume these probabilities based on general statistics of graduate student distributions in various fields:

2. **Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \))**:
   - This is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in a particular field \( H \).

3. **Marginal likelihood (\( P(E) \))**:
   - This is the total probability of the evidence \( E \) over all possible hypotheses. It can be computed as:
     
     \[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + ... \]
     
     For simplicity and given that we are comparing only two fields, we can work with proportional values and normalize them in the end.

Let's assign rough estimates for these quantities:

### 1. Prior Probabilities (\( P(H) \)):
- Business Administration: We might assume a generic prior, say \( P(\text{BA}) = 0.1 \).
- Computer Science: Maybe slightly higher due to popularity, say \( P(\text{CS}) = 0.15 \).

### 2. Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \)):
- For Business Administration: The sketch suggests traits that are less commonly associated with business administration, so \( P(E|\text{BA}) \) might be lower, say \( 0.2 \).
- For Computer Science: The traits (intelligence, problem-solving, abstract thinking) align well, so \( P(E|\text{CS}) \) might be higher, say \( 0.5 \).

### 3. Posterior Probability (\( P(H|E) \)):
Using normalized Bayes' rule,

\[ P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{BA}) \cdot P(\text{BA})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(E)} \]

Since:
\[ P(E) = P(E|\text{BA}) \cdot P(\text{BA}) + P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) \]

Let's compute these:

\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.5 \cdot 0.15) = 0.02 + 0.075 = 0.095 \]

\[ P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.095} = \frac{0.02}{0.095} \approx 0.2105 \]

\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.15}{0.095} = \frac{0.075}{0.095} \approx 0.7895 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2105,
  "computer science": 0.7895
}
