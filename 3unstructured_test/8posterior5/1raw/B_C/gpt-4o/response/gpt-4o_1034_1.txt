To apply Bayes' theorem for computing the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \), where \( H \) denotes the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in a specific field, we need to consider the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the marginal likelihood \( P(E) \). We also consider the complement scenario \( \neg H \) and evaluate \( P(E|\neg H) \).

The posterior probability is computed using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \), we can estimate the probabilities for business administration and computer science as follows:

### For Business Administration

1. **Prior probability, \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \)**:
   - Business Administration is a common graduate field, but Adam's personality sketch suggests interests that are more aligned with science and nature.
   - We assign a lower prior probability: \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1 \).

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \)**:
   - Business Administration students may have curiosity and intelligence, but the specific focus on nature, animals, and empathy is less common.
   - We estimate: \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.2 \).

3. **Complement probabilities, \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \)**:
   - Considering other fields, which may better fit the provided personality sketch.
   - We estimate: \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.5 \).

### For Computer Science

1. **Prior probability, \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \)**:
   - Computer Science is a common field, and high intelligence and abstract thinking are well-suited for this field.
   - We assign a moderate prior probability: \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.2 \).

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \)**:
   - Computer Science fits characteristics like intelligence and problem-solving but less likely to focus on nature and animals.
   - We estimate: \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.4 \).

3. **Complement probabilities, \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \)**:
   - Considering other fields that fit more closely with Adamâ€™s personality.
   - We estimate: \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.4 \).

### Calculations

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

### For Business Administration
\[ 
P(H_{\text{BA}} | E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{(0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.5 \cdot 0.9)} 
= \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.45} 
= \frac{0.02}{0.47} 
\approx 0.0426 
\]

### For Computer Science
\[ 
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{(0.4 \cdot 0.2) + (0.4 \cdot 0.8)} 
= \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.32} 
= \frac{0.08}{0.40} 
= 0.20 
\]

The computed posterior probabilities for the two fields are:

{
  "business administration": "0.0426",
  "computer science": "0.20"
}
