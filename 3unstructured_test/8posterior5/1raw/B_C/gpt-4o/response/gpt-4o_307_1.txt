To solve this, we need to use Bayes' Theorem, which is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability (the probability that Adam was enrolled in the field given his personality sketch).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood (the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in the field).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability (the probability that Adam was enrolled in the field before considering the personality sketch).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood (the total probability of the personality sketch across all fields).

Let's evaluate each field:

1. **Business Administration**
   - \( P(H) \): The baseline probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in business administration could be low given the large number of fields available, but for simplicity, let's assume it's a common field, so \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Business administration doesn't strongly align with the traits described (curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, empathy for animals), so \( P(E|H) \) might be low. Let's set it to \( P(E|H) \approx 0.05 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given a student not in business administration, the traits might be more common, especially in science and engineering fields, so \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \).

2. **Computer Science**
   - \( P(H) \): Computer science is a very common field, with many graduate students, so \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Computer science students often exhibit high intelligence, problem-solving skills, and an interest in abstract concepts, making this more likely, so \( P(E|H) \approx 0.4 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): For those not in computer science, these traits might be less common but still present in many STEM fields, so \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.1 \).

Now, using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)}  \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)}  \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both cases, we can compare the numerators to find the relative probabilities:

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.05 \cdot 0.1 = 0.005 \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.4 \cdot 0.2 = 0.08 \]

Now, let's normalize these probabilities (divide each by the sum of both to make them sum to 1):

Sum = \( 0.005 + 0.08 = 0.085 \)

Normalized probabilities:

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.085} \approx 0.0588 \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.085} \approx 0.9412 \]

Hence, here are the final probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.0588,
  "computer science": 0.9412
