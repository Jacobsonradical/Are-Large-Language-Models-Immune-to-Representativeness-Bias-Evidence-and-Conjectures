To use Bayes' rule to calculate the probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field of study, given his personality sketch \(E\), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine prior probabilities, \(P(H)\):** These represent our initial guesses about how likely it is that Adam was enrolled in each field, without knowing anything specific about him.
2. **Determine likelihoods, \(P(E|H)\):** This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he were in that field.
3. **Determine marginal likelihoods, \(P(E)\):** This is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch across all fields of study. It can be computed indirectly as \(P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)\).
4. **Apply Bayes' rule to find the posterior probabilities, \(P(H|E)\): This tells us the probability of Adam being in each field, given his personality sketch.

Since we are comparing two fields directly without relative frequency data for Adam's enrollment, we will provide qualitative estimates rather than precise numerical values. However, for simplicity, we will assume equal prior probabilities.

Let's estimate each component:

### 1. Prior Probabilities \(P(H)\)
Without specific context, assume Adam was equally likely to be in any field:
- \(P(\text{business administration}) = 0.5\)
- \(P(\text{computer science}) = 0.5\)

### 2. Likelihoods \(P(E|H)\)
Given Adam's personality traits:
- **High compatibility with Computer Science:**
  - Curiosity about nature and abstract concepts aligns well with research and analysis.
  - Quiet and enjoys puzzlesâ€”common in coding and algorithm development.
  - High empathy and warm heart might not be direct indicators, but aren't contradictions.
  - \(P(E|\text{computer science}) \approx 0.7\)

- **Lower compatibility with Business Administration:**
  - Genuine curiosity and empathy might match human resources but not all business areas.
  - Business often requires strong extroverted communication and networking, less suited to a quiet boy.
  - \(P(E|\text{business administration}) \approx 0.3\)

### 3. Marginal Likelihoods \(P(E)\)
- Estimated as \(P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)\)
  - For simplification: Given there's no direct frequency, we adjust relatively with given \(P(E|H)\).

### Posterior Probabilities \(P(H|E)\)
Using Bayes' rule \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)}\):
- For business administration:
  - \(P(E) = 0.5 \times 0.3 + 0.5 \times P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}})= 0.15 + 0.5 \times x\), needing \(x\), estimated as equal \(0.5\), simplifying others.
- For computer science:
  - Thus, \(P(E_{\text{total}}) = \approx 0.45\), re-estimation similar.

{
  "business administration":  \(\approx \frac{0.3 \times 0.5}{0.45}= \frac{0.15}{0.45} = \approx 0.33\),
  "computer science": \(\approx \frac{0.7 \times 0.5}{0.45}= \frac{0.35}{0.45} = \approx 0.77\)
}

These values reflect qualitative opinions, and detailed numerical data could refine Precision for computing.
