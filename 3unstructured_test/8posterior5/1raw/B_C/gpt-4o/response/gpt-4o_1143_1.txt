To solve this problem, we must first determine the probabilities for hypothesis \( H \) (the field Adam was enrolled in), given the personality sketch \( E \).

Specifically, we'll assess:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the personality traits \( E \) given that Adam is in a particular field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the personality traits \( E \) given that Adam is not in that particular field.

The goal is to compute \( P(H|E) \) (the posterior probability) for each field using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}. \]

Given that exact numerical values are not available for these probabilities, we will use intuitive estimations.

For 'computer science', \( H_{\text{cs}} \):
- \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) \): Assume a moderate prior, say 0.2.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \): Given that Adam has high intelligence and enjoys solving puzzles, it's quite likely but not assured. Assume a higher probability, say 0.7.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}}) \): Personality traits like empathy for animals and an appreciation of hard work are somewhat neutral regarding not being in computer science. Assume a lower probability, say 0.4.

For 'business administration', \( H_{\text{ba}} \):
- \( P(H_{\text{ba}}) \): The prior is perhaps lower given Adam's traits, say 0.1.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) \): Business administration commonly rewards people-oriented skills and may not align directly with Adam's specific nature traits. Assume a lower probability, say 0.3.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{ba}}) \): Similar as before for other non-aligned fields, assume 0.5.

We can simplify \( P(E) \) to focus on comparing the \( P(H|E) \) between fields.

For computer science:
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.7 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.14}{0.14 + 0.32} = \frac{0.14}{0.46} \approx 0.304. \]

For business administration:
\[ P(H_{\text{ba}}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.3 \cdot 0.1 + 0.5 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.45} = \frac{0.03}{0.48} \approx 0.0625. \]

Thus, the results are:

{
  "computer science": 0.304,
  "business administration": 0.0625
}
