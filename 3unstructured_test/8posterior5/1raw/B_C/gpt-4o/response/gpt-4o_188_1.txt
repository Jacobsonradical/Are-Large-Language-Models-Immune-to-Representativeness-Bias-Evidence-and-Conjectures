To determine the probabilities, we should first outline the various components involved:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in a given field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in a specific field.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not enrolled in a specific field.

For simplicity:

1. **P(H)** can be assumed to be roughly the enrollment distribution among all graduate programs, which might be assumed to be equal if we do not have specific data. However, intuitively, we might think some fields are more popular.
2. **P(E|H)** is how well Adam's personality sketch matches typical students in the given field.
3. **P(E|¬H)** is the general probability of Adam's personality sketch among all other fields.

Let's assume the following arbitrary prior probabilities (these are reasonable but hypothetical for the sake of the exercise):

- P(H_computer_science) ≈ 0.15
- P(H_business_administration) ≈ 0.15

Next, let's estimate the likelihoods:

- **P(E|computer_science)**: Adam's characteristics such as high intelligence and abstract thinking are often associated with computer science, but his empathy and love for nature and animals suggest it may be less likely in his case compared to other fields.
  - Let's estimate P(E|computer_science) ≈ 0.2

- **P(E|business_administration)**: Adam's empathy, appreciation for hard work, and nature curiosity do not align strongly with typical business administration profiles, though it's possible.
  - Let's estimate P(E|business_administration) ≈ 0.05

Finally, let's assume P(E|¬H) to be the average likelihood across all other fields:

- P(E|¬H_computer_science) ≈ 0.1 (weighted average)
- P(E|¬H_business_administration) ≈ 0.1 (weighted average)

Now, applying Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Let's denote \(\sum\) to represent the normalization factor, which we'll assume to be roughly equal for simplicity.

So, our calculations will look like this:

For **Computer Science**:

\[
P(H|E)_{cs} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{\sum} \approx \frac{0.03}{\sum}
\]

For **Business Administration**:

\[
P(H|E)_{ba} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.15}{\sum} \approx \frac{0.0075}{\sum}
\]

Without knowing \(\sum\), we can't determine absolute probabilities, but we can still give relative comparison:

- Computer Science is relatively more likely given Adam's E than Business Administration.

Thus, we can express results as probabilities that are relative to each other:

\[
\text{result}_{cs} = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.0075} \approx 0.8
\]
\[
\text{result}_{ba} = \frac{0.0075}{0.03 + 0.0075} \approx 0.2
\]

So, within the context given and only comparing these two fields:

{
  "computer science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
