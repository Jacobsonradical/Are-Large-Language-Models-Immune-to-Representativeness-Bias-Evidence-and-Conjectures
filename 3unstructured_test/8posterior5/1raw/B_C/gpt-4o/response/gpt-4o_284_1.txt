To solve this, we need to assess the likelihoods and priors for Adam being a graduate student in both business administration and computer science, given his personality sketch (E).

### For Business Administration:

1. **Prior Probability \(P(\text{H})\)**:
   - Let's assume a moderate base rate for students enrolled in business administration: \(P(\text{H})\) ≈ 0.2.
   
2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)** (The probability of Adam's personality traits given that he is in business administration):
   - While business administration may involve problem-solving and appreciation for hard work, traits like a love for nature, plants, and animals are less strongly associated with the field.
   - Thus, \(P(E|H)\) may be quite low: \(P(E|H)\) ≈ 0.1.

3. **Prior Probability of the Complement \(P(\neg H)\)**:
   - Complement is simply the rest of the possibilities: \(P(\neg H)\) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

4. **Likelihood of the Complement \(P(E|\neg H)\)**:
   - This is trickier. Assuming the personality is shared across other non-business fields ('general population'), and considering many alternative fields, \(P(E|\neg H)\) might be small: \(P(E|\neg H)\) ≈ 0.05.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{(0.1 \times 0.2) + (0.05 \times 0.8)}
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.04} = \frac{0.02}{0.06} ≈ 0.333
\]

### For Computer Science:

1. **Prior Probability \(P(\text{H})\)**:
   - Assume a moderate base rate for students enrolled in computer science: \(P(\text{H})\) ≈ 0.3.

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**:
   - Traits such as curiosity about nature, problem-solving skills, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts align well with computer science.
   - Thus, \(P(E|H)\) is relatively high: \(P(E|H)\) ≈ 0.7.

3. **Prior Probability of the Complement \(P(\neg H)\)**:
   - Complement is the rest excluding computer science: \(P(\neg H)\) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

4. **Likelihood of the Complement \(P(E|\neg H)\)**:
   - Like the business case, the general population likelihood will need consideration: \(P(E|\neg H)\) ≈ 0.05.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.3}{(0.7 \times 0.3) + (0.05 \times 0.7)}
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.21}{0.21 + 0.035} = \frac{0.21}{0.245} ≈ 0.857
\]

Combining the results:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.333,
  "computer science": 0.857
}
```

These values suggest that given Adam's personality sketch, he is much more likely to be enrolled in computer science than in business administration.
