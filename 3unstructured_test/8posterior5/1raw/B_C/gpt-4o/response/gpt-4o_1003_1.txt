To apply Bayes' rule and compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \), we need to evaluate the given values \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Let's go through each field step-by-step.

### Business Administration:

1. **P(H) - The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration (before considering any personality traits)**
   - Business Administration is a common field, so P(H) is not very low. However, given Adam's personality traits which lean towards empathy, nature, and solving puzzles, his interest might not strongly align with Business Administration.
   - Let's estimate \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \) as 0.10.

2. **P(E|H) - The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in Business Administration**
   - Business Administration students can have a variety of personality traits, but they typically don’t heavily emphasize a love of nature and animals.
   - Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \) as 0.05.

3. **P(E|\neg H) - The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch in any field other than Business Administration**
   - Since Adam’s traits are not tightly aligned with a typical Business Administration profile, but rather with more nature-centric or empathetic disciplines, the probability of his personality sketches occurring in other fields might be higher.
   - Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \) as 0.20.

Using Bayes’ rule:

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) P(H) + P(E|\neg H) P(\neg H) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.05 \cdot 0.10) + (0.20 \cdot 0.90) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.005 + 0.18 = 0.185 \]

Thus:

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.10}{0.185} \approx 0.027 \]

### Computer Science:

1. **P(H) - The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Computer Science**
   - Computer Science is a popular graduate field, which emphasizes problem-solving and intelligence. Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has a high intelligence, making him somewhat aligned with Computer Science.
   - Let's estimate \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \) as 0.20.

2. **P(E|H) - The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in Computer Science**
   - Computer Science students often exhibit traits of problem-solving and understanding abstract concepts. However, not all may have a strong affinity for nature and animals.
   - Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \) as 0.10.

3. **P(E|\neg H) - The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch in any field other than Computer Science**
   - Since high intelligence, solving puzzles, and empathy could align with several fields but perhaps not strongly with nature-related ones (similar to what we have considered earlier).
   - Let's also consider \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \) as 0.20.

Using Bayes’ rule:

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.10 \cdot 0.20) + (0.20 \cdot 0.80) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.16 = 0.18 \]

Thus:

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.10 \cdot 0.20}{0.18} \approx 0.111 \]

Putting it all together:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.027,
  "computer science": 0.111
}
```

These probabilities suggest that based on Adam's personality traits, it is more likely (albeit still fairly low probability) that he is enrolled in Computer Science compared to Business Administration.
