Let's break this down step by step for both fields: Computer Science and Business Administration.

### Computer Science
**Initial Hypothesis (H) - Adam was enrolled in Computer Science:**

1. **P(H)** for Computer Science:
   - Graduate programs in universities have a substantial number of students in Computer Science, but it's not the majority among all possible fields.
   - Let's assume P(H) for Computer Science to be somewhat significant, say 0.1 (10%).

2. **P(E|H) - Probability of observing the evidence given the hypothesis:**
   - The personality sketch describes Adam as highly intelligent, good at understanding abstract concepts, enjoys solving puzzles, and has strong empathy and dedication.
   - Computer Science students often fit this description, particularly the intelligence, abstract thinking, and enjoyment of puzzles.
   - Let's assume P(E|H) to be high, around 0.8 (80%).

3. **P(E|\neg H) - Probability of observing the evidence given the hypothesis is false:**
   - Considering all other fields and their students, it's less likely but possible to find a similar personality sketch across various fields.
   - Let's assume P(E|\neg H) to be lower, around 0.2 (20%).

Using Bayes' Rule for Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.18 = 0.26 \]

Thus,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.26} \approx 0.3077 \]

### Business Administration
**Initial Hypothesis (H) - Adam was enrolled in Business Administration:**

1. **P(H)** for Business Administration:
   - Business Administration is also a popular field, but generally, fewer people with Adam's specific personality traits might choose it when compared to CS.
   - Let's assume P(H) for Business Administration to be about the same as Computer Science, say 0.1 (10%).

2. **P(E|H) - Probability of observing the evidence given the hypothesis:**
   - The traits described fit less well with typical Business Administration students, though there are exceptions.
   - Let's assume P(E|H) to be moderate, around 0.5 (50%).

3. **P(E|\neg H) - Probability of observing the evidence given the hypothesis is false:**
   - As with Computer Science, the broader student population would not typically fit Adam's unique characteristics as closely.
   - Let's assume P(E|\neg H) to be around 0.2 (20%).

Using Bayes' Rule for Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.5 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.05 + 0.18 = 0.23 \]

Thus,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.1}{0.23} \approx 0.2174 \]
