To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' theorem, we need the following components for each field:

1. \( P(H) \) - The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field. 
2. \( P(E|H) \) - The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch (E) given that he is enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in that field (this is more complicated, but we approximate it using general knowledge).

Given the qualitative nature of this scenario, the exact probabilities will be subjective estimates based on the personality sketch and typical characteristics associated with graduate students in these fields.

### For Business Administration:
1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a given graduate student is studying business administration. Let's assume a moderate prior:
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \)

2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he studies business administration:
   - Curiosity about nature and plants: Low relevance
   - Quiet, enjoys solving puzzles: Low to moderate relevance (less typical for business administration)
   - Warm heart, strong empathy: Possibly relevant, as business can involve people skills
   - High intelligence, understanding abstract concepts: Relevant but less critical compared to some other fields
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication: Relevant to any field
   - Given these points, \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \)

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not studying business administration:
   - This is roughly the average likelihood of Adam's traits across all other fields. Let's approximate it as being moderately likely:
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \)

Using Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   Since \( P(E) \) is common across the fields and will normalize the probabilities, we focus on the numerator:
   \[
   P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \approx 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02
   \]

### For Computer Science:
1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a given graduate student is studying computer science. Let's assume a moderate prior:
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \)

2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he studies computer science:
   - Curiosity about nature and plants: Not very relevant, except possibly in bioinformatics
   - Quiet, enjoys solving puzzles: Highly relevant, typical of many computer science students
   - Warm heart, strong empathy: Not especially relevant
   - High intelligence, understanding abstract concepts: Highly relevant, needed for abstract thought in algorithms, data structures, etc.
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication: Relevant to any field
   - Given these points, \( P(E|H) \approx 0.4 \)

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not studying computer science:
   - As before, approximating a moderate likelihood across other fields:
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \)

Using Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   Since \( P(E) \) is common across the fields and will normalize the probabilities, we focus on the numerator:
   \[
   P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \approx 0.4 \cdot 0.2 = 0.08
   \]

Providing the final answer:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.08
}
```

These values conceptually reflect the relative probabilities on available information. For precise decisions, ideally, we would use a more detailed statistical model or specific data.
