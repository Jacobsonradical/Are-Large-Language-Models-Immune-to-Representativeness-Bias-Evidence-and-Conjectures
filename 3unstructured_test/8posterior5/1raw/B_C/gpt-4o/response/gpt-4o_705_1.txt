To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood that Adam's personality sketch (E) fits given that he is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood that Adam's personality sketch (E) fits given that he is not enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of Adam's personality sketch, which is a normalizing constant.

Given the limited context, let's assume some reasonable estimates for the prior probabilities and the conditional probabilities based on typical characteristics of the fields and the information provided about Adam.

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
   Since business administration is a common graduate field, let's assume \( P(H) \) to be 0.15 (15%).

2. **Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   - \( P(E|H) \): Personality traits like empathy and a strong understanding of dedication might fit reasonably well. However, curiosity about nature, puzzles, and a love for animals may not be as relevant. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) to be 0.2 (20%).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given that these traits might be more common outside business administration, we estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) to be 0.3 (30%).

### Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
   Computer science is also a common graduate field, let's assume \( P(H) \) to be 0.20 (20%).

2. **Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   - \( P(E|H) \): Traits such as solving puzzles, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and quiet demeanor are highly relevant. Empathy and love for animals are less so, but still possible. We estimate \( P(E|H) \) to be 0.5 (50%).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): These traits might not be as common outside computer science, so we estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) to be 0.2 (20%).

Next, we use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since \( P(E) \) is the same for all hypotheses and will act as a normalizer, we can simplify our comparison without calculating \( P(E) \) explicitly. We compute the numerator for each case and compare them directly.

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \times 0.15 = 0.03 \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.5 \times 0.20 = 0.10 \]

The ratios of these products give us an idea of the relative values:

{
  "business administration": "0.03",
  "computer science": "0.10"
}

Here, the values indicate the relative strength of each hypothesis given the personality sketch of Adam.
