Let's break this down step-by-step to make the calculations clear. We are trying to compute \( P(H|E) \), the probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given that Adam is in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

We need to calculate this for both business administration and computer science. Let's assume below values for probabilities:

1. **Business Administration (H1):**
   - \( P(H1) \): Let's assume the prior probability is 0.1 (10%) for a typical graduate student.
   - \( P(E|H1) \): Given Adam's traits (nature curiosity, puzzle-solving, love for animals), let's assume a low probability of 0.05 (5%), as they are less aligned with business traits.
   - \( P(E|\neg H1) \): Assuming some alignment with a non-business major, let's take 0.4 (40%).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

2. **Computer Science (H2):**
   - \( P(H2) \): Let's assume the prior probability is 0.15 (15%) for a typical graduate student in the U.S.
   - \( P(E|H2) \): Given Adamâ€™s intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and understanding of abstract concepts, let's assume a higher probability of 0.6 (60%).
   - \( P(E|\neg H2) \): Assuming some alignment with a non-computer science major, let's take 0.3 (30%).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \]

To simplify, let's ignore \( P(E) \) since it cancels out and only consider the numerators for comparison purposes:

\[ P(H1|E) \propto 0.05 \cdot 0.1 = 0.005 \]
\[ P(H2|E) \propto 0.6 \cdot 0.15 = 0.09 \]

Normalizing these to sum to 1:
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.09} = \frac{0.005}{0.095} \approx 0.0526 \]
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.005 + 0.09} = \frac{0.09}{0.095} \approx 0.9474 \]

Given that Adam's personality aligns more closely with traits useful in computer science, he is far more likely to be in computer science than in business administration.
