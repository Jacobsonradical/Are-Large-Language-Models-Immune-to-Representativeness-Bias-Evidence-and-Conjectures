To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Rule, we need to estimate the following quantities:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam having the described personality sketch given that he is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam having the described personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in that field.

Without specific data, we'll base our estimates on generic assumptions about these fields and how they might align with the provided personality sketch. 

1. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): Let's assume a prior probability of around 0.2 for computer science, as this is a popular graduate field.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's intelligence and aptitude for solving puzzles, computer science seems reasonably well-matched. Let's estimate this at 0.7.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of having the given personality sketch if not in computer science might be moderately high due to the broad applicability of these traits. Let's assume 0.4.

   Using Bayes' Rule:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   Here, \( P(E) \approx P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).
   \[
   P(E) \approx (0.7 \cdot 0.2) + (0.4 \cdot 0.8) = 0.14 + 0.32 = 0.46
   \]
   Then,
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.46} \approx 0.304
   \]

2. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H) \): Let's assume a prior probability of around 0.15 for business administration.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's empathy, teamwork capabilities, and appreciation of hard work, there is some alignment, but not as strong as with computer science. Let's estimate this at 0.4.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Similar to the previous field, let's assume a moderate 0.4.

   Using Bayes' Rule:
   \[
   P(E) \approx (P(E|H) \cdot P(H)) + (P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)) 
   \]
   \[
   P(E) \approx (0.4 \cdot 0.15) + (0.4 \cdot 0.85) = 0.06 + 0.34 = 0.40
   \]
   Then,
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.15}{0.40} = 0.15
   \]

Thus, the computed probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": "0.304",
  "business administration": "0.15"
}
