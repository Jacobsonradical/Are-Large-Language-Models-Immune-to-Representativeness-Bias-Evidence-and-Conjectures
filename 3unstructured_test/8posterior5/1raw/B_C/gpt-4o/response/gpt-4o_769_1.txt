To calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Rule, we need the following probabilities:
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood that Adam's personality sketch would be observed given that he is enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likelihood that Adam's personality sketch would be observed given that he is not enrolled in a particular field.

We then calculate \( P(H|E) \) through Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\( P(E) \) is a normalizing factor ensuring that the probabilities sum to 1, but since we are only comparing two fields, we will focus on the relative probabilities.

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \):**
   - Let's assume the probability that a graduate student is studying business administration is moderate. As an estimate, let \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \):**
   - The personality traits described (curiosity about nature, love for animals, etc.) are less typical for business administration. Hence, \( P(E|H) \) might be lower. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).

3. **Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   - Assume that the probability that this personality sketch fits someone not enrolled in business administration is more likely. Let’s estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.7 \).

### Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \):**
   - Let’s estimate the prior probability for computer science to be moderate as well. For this, we will use \( P(H) = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \):**
   - The personality traits (enjoys solving puzzles, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts) align more closely with computer science. Let’s estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).

3. **Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   - Assume that the probability of this personality sketch fitting someone not enrolled in computer science is moderate. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

Now compute the posterior probabilities using Bayes' Rule:

For business administration \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

For computer science \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.25}{P(E)} \]

As a normalization factor, we can omit \( P(E) \) for a relative comparison since it is the same denominator for both hypotheses.

Compare the numerators:
- Business Administration: \( 0.2 \cdot 0.2 = 0.04 \)
- Computer Science: \( 0.7 \cdot 0.25 = 0.175 \)

Notice that the relative posterior is higher for computer science.

Normalizing these values:
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.175} \approx 0.186 \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.175}{0.04 + 0.175} \approx 0.814 \]

Thus, our final answer is:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.186,
  "computer science": 0.814
}
