To apply Bayes' theorem and compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field, let's first define our terms and then proceed with the estimates.

\[ P(H) \] - The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
\[ P(E|H) \] - The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch fits given he was enrolled in the specific field.
\[ P(E|\neg H) \] - The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was not enrolled in the specific field.

### Business Administration

1. **P(H) - Prior probability of being in Business Administration**: Graduate students are spread across various fields, but let's assume about an equal distribution across major fields. Given that business administration is popular, let's assign a moderate prior probability.

\[ P(H_{BA}) = 0.10 \]

2. **P(E|H) - Likelihood of personality sketch given Business Administration**: Business Administration students are usually known for their strategic thinking and interpersonal skills. They may not exhibit a strong interest in nature and animals. Thus, this is less likely.

\[ P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.02 \]

3. **P(E|\neg H) - Likelihood of personality sketch given not in Business Administration**: This is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch across all other fields. Given his interests and personality, this could be moderately high as there are multiple fields (e.g., biology, environmental science) where this fits well.

\[ P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.15 \]

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA})P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{BA})P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA})P(\neg H_{BA}) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.02 \times 0.10) + (0.15 \times 0.90) = 0.002 + 0.135 = 0.137 \]

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.02 \times 0.10}{0.137} \approx 0.0146 \]

### Computer Science

1. **P(H) - Prior probability of being in Computer Science**: Similar to Business Administration, let's assume a moderate prior probability for this field.

\[ P(H_{CS}) = 0.10 \]

2. **P(E|H) - Likelihood of personality sketch given Computer Science**: Computer Science students often demonstrate strong problem-solving skills and abstract thinking. However, not all may have an interest in nature and animals, so this is moderately less likely.

\[ P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.05 \]

3. **P(E|\neg H) - Likelihood of personality sketch given not in Computer Science**: Similar calculation as above.

\[ P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.15 \]

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS})P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{CS})P(H_{CS}) + P(E|\neg H_{CS})P(\neg H_{CS}) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.05 \times 0.10) + (0.15 \times 0.90) = 0.005 + 0.135 = 0.14 \]

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.10}{0.14} \approx 0.0357 \]
