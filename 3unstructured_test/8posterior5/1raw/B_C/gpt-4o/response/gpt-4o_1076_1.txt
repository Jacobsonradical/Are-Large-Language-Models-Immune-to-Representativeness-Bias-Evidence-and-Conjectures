To apply Bayes' Theorem, we need to determine the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood of the evidence given that the hypothesis is false \( P(E|\neg H) \). Then we can use these to find the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \).

Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)} \]

We will assume some reasonable priors and likelihoods based on the given personality sketch of Adam.

### 1. Business Administration
- **Prior probability \( P(H_{BA}) \)**: Generally, we might assume that the probability of a graduate student being in business administration is low compared to other fields because many graduate programs have more students in fields like sciences and engineering. Let's assume:
  \[
  P(H_{BA}) = 0.1
  \]

- **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{BA}) \)**: Considering Adam's traits, a high intelligence and appreciation for hard work could fit a business administration profile, but his deep love for nature and animals and preference for puzzles might not align well with typical business administration interests. Therefore, we'll assign a moderate value:
  \[
  P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.2
  \]

- **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \)**: The likelihood of Adam's characteristics fitting any other random graduate student program would likely be somewhat higher, particularly with his love for animals, intelligence, and empathy. Thus, we might consider nature-related fields or sciences more fitting. We'll assign:
  \[
  P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.4
  \]

### 2. Computer Science
- **Prior probability \( P(H_{CS}) \)**: The field of computer science is quite popular and enrolls a significant number of graduate students. Let's assume:
  \[
  P(H_{CS}) = 0.2
  \]

- **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{CS}) \)**: Adam's traits such as solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts fit well with computer science. Let's assign:
  \[
  P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.6
  \]

- **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \)**: The probability of Adamâ€™s traits fitting any other random graduate student program might still be notable, particularly because there are other fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology that could also align well. We'll assign:
  \[
  P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.5
  \]

Now, we use Bayes' Rule to compute the posterior probabilities. 

### Posterior probability for Business Administration
\[
P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) P(H_{BA})}{P(E|H_{BA}) P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA}) P(\neg H_{BA})}
\]
\[
P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{0.2 \times 0.1 + 0.4 \times 0.9} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.36} = \frac{0.02}{0.38} \approx 0.0526
\]

### Posterior probability for Computer Science
\[
P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) P(H_{CS})}{P(E|H_{CS}) P(H_{CS}) + P(E|\neg H_{CS}) P(\neg H_{CS})}
\]
\[
P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.2}{0.6 \times 0.2 + 0.5 \times 0.8} = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.4} = \frac{0.12}{0.52} \approx 0.2308
\]

### Summary

  "business administration": 0.0526,
  "computer science": 0.2308
