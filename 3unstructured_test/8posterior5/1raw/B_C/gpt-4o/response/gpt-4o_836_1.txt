Certainly, let's break down the given hypothesis and apply Bayes' Theorem to compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \). Here’s a structured way to approach this:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a certain field (computer science or business administration).
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given Adam is in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given Adam is not in that field.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we are not trying to find absolute probabilities but relative probabilities, we can work with the proportional form:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Let's make some reasonable assumptions and estimations for each field.

### Computer Science
- **P(H):** Assuming a relatively high number of students are enrolled in this field, we can take \( P(H_{cs}) = 0.3 \).
- **P(E|H):** Given that people in computer science often have strong problem-solving skills, high intelligence, and interest in abstract concepts (but may or may not have strong empathy or a love for nature and animals), let's say \( P(E|H_{cs}) = 0.5 \).
- **P(E|\neg H):** This will depend on the overall population, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{cs}) = 0.2 \).

### Business Administration
- **P(H):** Assuming a relatively moderate number of students are enrolled in this field, we can take \( P(H_{ba}) = 0.2 \).
- **P(E|H):** Business Administration students might not typically exhibit a strong interest in nature and puzzles but may have empathy. Let’s say \( P(E|H_{ba}) = 0.2 \).
- **P(E|\neg H):** Again, using the overall population, let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H_{ba}) = 0.2 \).

Now, let's calculate the posterior probabilities proportionally for each field using the formula given.

### Calculation:
For **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) \propto P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs}) = 0.5 \times 0.3 = 0.15 \]

For **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) \propto P(E|H_{ba}) \cdot P(H_{ba}) = 0.2 \times 0.2 = 0.04 \]

Normalized (for relative comparison):
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.04} = \frac{0.15}{0.19} \approx 0.79 \]
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.15 + 0.04} = \frac{0.04}{0.19} \approx 0.21 \]

### Final Result:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.79,
  "business administration": 0.21
}
