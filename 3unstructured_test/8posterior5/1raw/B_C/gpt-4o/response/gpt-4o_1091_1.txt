First, let's denote the following probabilities: 

- P(H) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field.
- P(E|H) is the probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given he is enrolled in that field.
- P(E|¬H) is the probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given he is not enrolled in that field.
- P(H|E) is the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field given his personality sketch.

Let's proceed to estimate these probabilities for each field:

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of a graduate student being enrolled in business administration can be assumed to be reasonably common, let's estimate P(H) = 0.2.
   
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in business administration. Considering that business administration students are usually people-oriented and less likely to be extremely focused on nature, puzzles, and animals, we might estimate P(E|H) = 0.1.

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not enrolled in business administration. Given the general population of graduate fields, we might estimate slightly higher, say P(E|¬H) = 0.25.

Now, using Bayes rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To calculate \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.25 \cdot 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.22 \]

Then:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.22} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.22} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.0909 \]

### Computer Science
1. **P(H)**: Given that computer science is a popular field among graduate students, let's estimate P(H) = 0.3.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in computer science. Given that computer science students often have strong problem-solving skills and can be quieter, we might estimate P(E|H) = 0.4.

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not enrolled in computer science. We can use a similar reasoning and estimate P(E|¬H) = 0.2.

Now, using Bayes rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To calculate \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.4 \cdot 0.3 + 0.2 \cdot 0.7 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.14 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.26 \]

Then:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.4615 \]

So the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0909,
  "computer science": 0.4615
}
```
