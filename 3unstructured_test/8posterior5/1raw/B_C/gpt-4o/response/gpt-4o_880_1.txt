To use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \), we need:

1. \( P(H) \) - The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field.
2. \( P(E|H) \) - The probability of observing E given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - The probability of observing E given that Adam is not enrolled in that field.
4. \( P(E) \) - The overall probability of observing E (which can be derived as needed).

Let's quantify the priors and likelihoods, noting that exact values are not readily available, so we'll make qualitative judgments. The scale is from 0 to 1.

1. **Business administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): Let's assume that the prior probability of a graduate student studying business administration is moderate. We'll set \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's personality traits do not strongly align with typical traits one would expect in business administration students, such as an affinity for nature, empathy, and love for animals. We'll estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given that E is more general and not particular to business administration, it could have a higher probability across other fields. We'll estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

2. **Computer science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Considering the popularity and demand for computer science, let's set a higher prior probability. We'll set \( P(H) = 0.25 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's traits of solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts align well with computer science. We'll estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.6 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): For E not given H in computer science, it might still be moderately probable but less specific. We'll set \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Using Bayesâ€™ rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

With \( P(E) \) being approximated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H)) \]

Let's calculate for each:

1. **Business administration**:
   \[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.15 + 0.4 \cdot 0.85 \approx 0.35 \]
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{0.35} \approx 0.086 \]

2. **Computer science**:
   \[ P(E) = 0.6 \cdot 0.25 + 0.3 \cdot 0.75 \approx 0.375 \]
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.25}{0.375} \approx 0.4 \]

The results are concise as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.086,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
