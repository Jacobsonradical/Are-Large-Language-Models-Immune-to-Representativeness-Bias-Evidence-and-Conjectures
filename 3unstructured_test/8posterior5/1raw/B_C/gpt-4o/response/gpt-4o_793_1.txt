Sure, let's assess each hypothesis using Bayes' rule. The formula for Bayes' rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both hypotheses and will cancel out when comparing them, we only need to calculate numerators \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for each hypothesis.

### Computer Science

- **P(H [Computer Science])**: Let's assume the prior probability of any given U.S. graduate student being in computer science is moderately high, say \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
- **P(E|H [Computer Science])**: Given Adam's personality sketch, characterized by high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts, curiosity about nature (possibly leaning towards logical structure of software), and liking puzzles, we could reasonably assume he might fit well. Suppose \( P(E|H) = 0.5 \).
- **P(E|\neg H [Computer Science])**: For graduates outside CS who also fit this description, let's say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

Using Bayes' rule for computer science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

### Business Administration

- **P(H [Business Administration])**: Let's assume the prior probability of any given U.S. graduate student being in business administration is also moderate, say \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
- **P(E|H [Business Administration])**: Given Adam's warm heart, empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, he might somewhat fit but not perfectly given the lack of explicit interest in business. Suppose \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).
- **P(E|\neg H [Business Administration])**: For graduates outside business administration who fit this description, let’s assume it’s bit higher, \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.25 \).

Using Bayes' rule for business administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \]

### Comparing the probabilities

Although we don't know \( P(E) \), we can compute proportional likelihoods:

For **computer science**:
\[ P(H|E)_{cs} \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.5 \cdot 0.2 = 0.1 \]

For **business administration**:
\[ P(H|E)_{ba} \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.3 \cdot 0.15 = 0.045 \]

Finally, we normalize these values to fit between 0 and 1.

\[
\begin{cases}
P(H|E)_{cs} = \frac{0.1}{0.1 + 0.045} \approx 0.689 \\
P(H|E)_{ba} = \frac{0.045}{0.1 + 0.045} \approx 0.310 \\
\end{cases}
\]

Therefore,

{
  "computer science": 0.689,
  "business administration": 0.310
}
