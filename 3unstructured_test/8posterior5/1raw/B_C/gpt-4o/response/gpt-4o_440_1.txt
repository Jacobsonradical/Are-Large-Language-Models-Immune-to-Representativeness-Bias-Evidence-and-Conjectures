To calculate \( P(H|E) \) for the fields "computer science" and "business administration," we will follow Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since this is a relative comparison, \( P(E) \) can be considered as a normalization factor that will be the same for each field. Consequently, we only need to consider \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for each hypothesis.

### Assumptions and Justifications:

1. **Prior Probability (P(H)):**
   - For simplicity, we assume a uniform prior probability for each field of study, as we are not given any specific information to favor one over the other.

2. **Likelihood (P(E|H)):**
   - Given Adam's personality, interests, and characteristics, we need to estimate the likelihood of these traits matching each field.

### Estimates:

#### Computer Science:
- **P(H)**: Assume equal priors for simplicity, let's say 0.5.
- **P(E|H)**: Considering his high intelligence, affinity for abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles, Adam seems a good fit. People in computer science often share these traits.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Given there's a wide range of other fields, but not all fit the personality traits as well.

#### Business Administration:
- **P(H)**: Assume equal priors for simplicity, let's say 0.5.
- **P(E|H)**: Business administration requires social skills, leadership abilities, and practical thinking, which don't align as closely with Adam's described personality. This suggests a lower likelihood.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Business administration would likely still see a good number of people with varied traits.

### Calculation:

We now assume \( P(E) \) is constant across fields, so we focus on the product \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

1. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(H) = 0.5 \)
   - \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \) (since Adam fits the profile well)
   - Therefore, \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \times 0.5 = 0.4 \)

2. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H) = 0.5 \)
   - \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \) (since his profile does not fit as well)
   - Therefore, \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.3 \times 0.5 = 0.15 \)

Using these relative probabilities, we normalize:

### Normalization:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

\(P(E)\) is the sum of all \( P(E|H_i) \cdot P(H_i) \) terms, which in this simplified two-hypothesis example is \(0.4 + 0.15 = 0.55\).

\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.4}{0.55} \approx 0.727 \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.15}{0.55} \approx 0.273 \]

So, the final result is:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.727,
  "business administration": 0.273
}
```
