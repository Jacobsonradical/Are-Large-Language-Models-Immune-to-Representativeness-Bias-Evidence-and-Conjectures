To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the following:

1. Prior probabilities \( P(H) \): The likelihood of Adam enrolling in a given field before knowing his personality sketch.
2. Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in a specific field.
3. Complement likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in the specific field.

When we apply Bayes' rule, it is expressed as follows:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) \) is the normalization constant ensuring that the total probability sums to 1 across all hypotheses.

### Estimating Probabilities

#### Business Administration

1. **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Let's assume the prior probability, \( P(\text{business administration}) \), is relatively low because the personality traits mentioned are more closely aligned with fields that involve interaction with nature and abstract concepts.

   - \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.1 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The sketch of Adam does not strongly correlate with typical traits for business administration students, who may focus more on leadership, economics, and management rather than puzzles, nature, and empathy.

   - \( P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.2 \)

3. **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Considering that Adam's personality aligns more with fields involving natural sciences or humanitarian efforts, the probability of him having this personality sketch while not being a business administration student is higher.

   - \( P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) = 0.7 \)

#### Computer Science

1. **Prior \( P(H) \)**: The likelihood that Adam is in computer science is higher than business administration considering he likes puzzles and abstract concepts, which align with computer science interests.

   - \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.3 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adamâ€™s enjoyment of puzzles and understanding abstract concepts fit well with computer science.

   - \( P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.6 \)

3. **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Given that computer science is a potential fit but not the only field that relates to his personality, the likelihood can be estimated as moderate.

   - \( P(E|\neg \text{computer science}) = 0.5 \)

### Posterior Probabilities

Let's compute the posterior probabilities:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) \) can be ignored when comparing across fields as it acts as a normalizer.

#### Business Administration

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.02}{P(E)} \]

#### Computer Science

\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.3}{P(E)} = \frac{0.18}{P(E)} \]

### Normalizing

To get the normalized probabilities, let's assume the values sum to 1 and solve as proportions of these values:

1. Sum of unnormalized probabilities: \( 0.02 + 0.18 = 0.20 \)

2. Normalized probabilities:
   
   - Business Administration: \( \frac{0.02}{0.20} = 0.1 \)
   - Computer Science: \( \frac{0.18}{0.20} = 0.9 \)
