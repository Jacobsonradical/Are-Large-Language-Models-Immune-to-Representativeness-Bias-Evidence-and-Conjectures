To apply Bayes' theorem for computing \( P(H|E) \), we need three main probabilities for each field:

1. \( P(H) \): Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): Probability of observing the personality sketch given Adam is enrolled in the field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of observing the personality sketch given Adam is not enrolled in the field.

Bayes' theorem formula for \( P(H|E) \) is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be found using:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's estimate these probabilities based on the description provided.

### Computer Science

#### Prior Probability (\( P(H) \)):

Given no specific prior information, let's assume a uniform prior probability. Say there are 10 common graduate fields, so:

\[ P(H) = \frac{1}{10} = 0.1 \]

#### Probability of Personality Traits in Computer Science (\( P(E|H) \)):

- Curiosity about nature: Moderate relevance.
- Quiet, enjoys puzzles: High relevance.
- Warm heart, strong empathy: Moderate relevance.
- Love for animals: Less common but possible.
- High intelligence, understanding abstract concepts: High relevance.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication: High relevance.

Let's assume:

\[ P(E|H) = 0.6 \]

#### Probability of Personality Traits Not in Computer Science (\( P(E|\neg H) \)):

Study fields not closely matching his personality might be less likely to exhibit the same level of relevance.

Let's assume:

\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \]

### Business Administration

#### Prior Probability (\( P(H) \)):

Using the same uniform distribution:

\[ P(H) = \frac{1}{10} = 0.1 \]

#### Probability of Personality Traits in Business Administration (\( P(E|H) \)):

- Curiosity about nature: Less relevance.
- Quiet, enjoys puzzles: Low relevance.
- Warm heart, strong empathy: Moderate relevance.
- Love for animals: Typically not relevant.
- High intelligence, understanding abstract concepts: Moderate relevance.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication: High relevance.

Let's assume:

\[ P(E|H) = 0.3 \]

#### Probability of Personality Traits Not in Business Administration (\( P(E|\neg H) \)):

\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \]

### Calculation of \( P(H|E) \)

Using Bayes' theorem, we now calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field.

For Computer Science:

\[ P(E) = (0.6 \times 0.1) + (0.3 \times 0.9) = 0.06 + 0.27 = 0.33 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.1}{0.33} \approx 0.1818 \]

For Business Administration:

\[ P(E) = (0.3 \times 0.1) + (0.5 \times 0.9) = 0.03 + 0.45 = 0.48 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.1}{0.48} \approx 0.0625 \]
