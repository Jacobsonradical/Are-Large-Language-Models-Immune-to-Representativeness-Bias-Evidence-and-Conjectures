To compute \( P(H|E) \), we will use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have the exact values for \( P(E) \), we can compare the relative values of \( P(H|E) \) for the two fields, assuming \( P(E) \) is constant. Here’s the approach:

1. **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field.
2. **P(E|H)**: This is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in that field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: This is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in that field.

### Computer Science
- **P(Hc)**: Computer science is a popular field, but not everyone studies it. Let's assume a typical value for graduate students might be \( 0.1 \).
- **P(E|Hc)**: Given that Adam has traits (high intelligence, solving puzzles, abstract concepts), it is quite likely he was in Computer Science. Let's estimate \( 0.3 \).
- **P(E|\neg Hc)**: Given that Adam's traits can match various other fields, but not specifically Computer Science, let's estimate it as \( 0.1 \).

### Business Administration
- **P(Hb)**: Business Administration is also a popular field. Let's assign a similar probability as for Computer Science, \( 0.1 \).
- **P(E|Hb)**: The traits (solving puzzles, empathy, hard-work appreciation) are less closely related to Business Administration than to Computer Science. Let’s estimate \( 0.1 \).
- **P(E|\neg Hb)**: Given that these traits apply moderately to other fields and not specifically Business Administration, let's estimate it as \( 0.2 \).

### Calculations:
We will compute \( P(H|E) \) estimates based on the given values, assuming constant \( P(E) \).

#### For Computer Science:
\[ P(Hc|E) = \frac{P(E|Hc) \cdot P(Hc)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.03}{P(E)} \]

#### For Business Administration:
\[ P(Hb|E) = \frac{P(E|Hb) \cdot P(Hb)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.01}{P(E)} \]

Given these relative calculations, the probability \( P(H|E) \) for Computer Science will be higher than for Business Administration:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.03,
  "business administration": 0.01
}
```
Remember, these values serve for comparison and must be scaled accordingly if necessary.
