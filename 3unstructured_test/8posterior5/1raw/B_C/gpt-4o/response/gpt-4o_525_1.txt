Sure, let's break down each hypothesis and compute the required probabilities using Bayes' rule.

1. **Computer Science**: 
   - **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science, which we can assume based on the general proportions of graduate students. Let's suppose it's moderate since computer science is a popular field. Let’s assume P(H) = 0.2.
   - **P(E|H)**: The probability that someone in computer science would have the traits described. Someone in computer science could be curious, good at solving puzzles, intelligent, and understanding abstract concepts, but might not strongly fit the warm-hearted, empathetic, and love for animals traits. Let’s estimate P(E|H) = 0.2.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that someone not in computer science would have the traits described. This could be relatively high since the traits are broad and common in many other fields. Let’s estimate P(E|\neg H) = 0.5.

2. **Business Administration**: 
   - **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration, which we can assume based on the general proportions of graduate students. Let’s assume P(H) = 0.1.
   - **P(E|H)**: The probability that someone in business administration shares the given traits. Business students might appreciate hard work and being intelligent, but might not strongly align with solving puzzles, having a warm heart, or a deep love for animals. Let’s estimate P(E|H) = 0.1.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that someone not in business administration would have the traits described. This could be higher because the traits can fit many other fields more easily. Let’s estimate P(E|\neg H) = 0.5.

Using Bayes' theorem for each hypothesis:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For **Computer Science**:
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.2) + (0.5 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.4 = 0.44 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.44} = \frac{0.04}{0.44} \approx 0.091 \]

For **Business Administration**:
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.1) + (0.5 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.01 + 0.45 = 0.46 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.46} = \frac{0.01}{0.46} \approx 0.022 \]

Thus, the computed probabilities are:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.091,
  "business administration": 0.022
}
