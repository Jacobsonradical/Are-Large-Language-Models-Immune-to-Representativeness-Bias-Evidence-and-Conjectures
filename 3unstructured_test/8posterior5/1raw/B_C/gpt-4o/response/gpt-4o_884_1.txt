To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in each field, we'll use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to estimate:
1. P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science or business administration.
2. P(E|H): The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
3. P(E|\neg H): The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was not enrolled in a specific field.
4. P(E): The overall probability of observing the personality sketch E.

### Computer Science
- **P(H_computer_science)**: Considering the popularity of the field and the probability of graduate students enrolling in it, let's estimate it as 0.3.
- **P(E|H_computer_science)**: Adam's traits such as high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving are highly relevant to computer science. Let’s assign a high probability, say 0.8.
- **P(E|\neg H_computer_science)**: We need to consider the probability of observing the given traits in students not enrolled in computer science. Since these traits can be present in other fields as well, let's assume it’s somewhat lower, maybe around 0.5.

### Business Administration
- **P(H_business_administration)**: Considering its popularity as well, let’s estimate it as 0.25.
- **P(E|H_business_administration)**: The traits of a warm heart, empathy, and strong appreciation for hard work align well, but others like puzzle-solving and understanding abstract concepts are less relevant. Let’s assign a moderate probability, say 0.5.
- **P(E|\neg H_business_administration)**: Since these traits could be prevalent in several other fields, we can estimate it at around 0.6.

### Computing P(H|E)
To complete the calculation, we'll need \( P(E) \). However, for the purposes of comparative likelihoods, we can focus on the relative values since P(E) remains constant for all hypotheses.

#### For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.3}{(0.8 \cdot 0.3) + (0.5 \cdot (1-0.3))} = \frac{0.24}{0.24 + 0.35} = \frac{0.24}{0.59} \approx 0.41 \]

#### For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.25}{(0.5 \cdot 0.25) + (0.6 \cdot (1-0.25))} = \frac{0.125}{0.125 + 0.45} = \frac{0.125}{0.575} \approx 0.22 \]

So, the final probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.41,
  "business administration": 0.22
}
```

These values demonstrate the relative likelihood of Adam being enrolled in each of these fields based on his personality sketch.
