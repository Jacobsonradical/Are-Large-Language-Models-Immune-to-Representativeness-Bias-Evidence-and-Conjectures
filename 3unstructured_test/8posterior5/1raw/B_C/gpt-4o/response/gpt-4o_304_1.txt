To make the required judgments and compute the probabilities, we will first need to estimate the individual terms for Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's assess the probabilities for each field:

### Computer Science (CS)
1. **P(H_CS):** The prior probability that a graduate student is studying computer science. Let's assume that this is a relatively high probability field in general, but not overwhelmingly common. We'll estimate it as 0.2.
2. **P(E|H_CS):** The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch if he is studying computer science. Adam's traits include curiosity, intelligence, and enjoyment of puzzles, which fit well with character traits common in computer science students. However, CS students might not typically have a strong emphasis on empathy or a love for animals. Let's estimate this as 0.3.
3. **P(E|¬H_CS):** The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch if he is not studying computer science. Considering that Adam's personality might fit multiple fields, we'll estimate this as 0.1.

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.1 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.08} = \frac{0.06}{0.14} \approx 0.43 \]

### Business Administration (BA)
1. **P(H_BA):** The prior probability that a graduate student is studying business administration. Let's assume it's also a relatively common field but less so than computer science. We'll estimate it as 0.15.
2. **P(E|H_BA):** The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch if he is studying business administration. Adam's traits of empathy and understanding could fit a business administration student, but his love for nature and animals is not typically associated with this field. We'll estimate it as 0.15.
3. **P(E|¬H_BA):** The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch if he is not studying business administration. Again, we'll assume that the sketch fits various fields, so we'll estimate it as 0.1.

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx \frac{0.15 \cdot 0.15}{0.15 \cdot 0.15 + 0.1 \cdot 0.85} = \frac{0.0225}{0.0225 + 0.085} = \frac{0.0225}{0.1075} \approx 0.21 \]

Based on these calculations, the posterior probabilities that Adam is enrolled in each field are approximately:

{
  "computer science": 0.43,
  "business administration": 0.21
