To use Bayes' theorem, we need to first determine the required probabilities:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field (either computer science or business administration).
2. **P(E | H)**: The likelihood of the evidence given that Adam is in a specific field.
3. **P(E | \neg H)**: The likelihood of the evidence given that Adam is not in the specific field.
4. **P(H | E)**: The posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field given the evidence.

Given the information, let's make some reasonable qualitative assessments.

### Computer Science (CS)
- **P(H for CS)**: Given the popularity of computer science among graduate students in the U.S., let's assume a reasonable prior:
  \[
  P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.2
  \]

- **P(E | H for CS)**: Adam shows a high intelligence and enjoys solving puzzles, both of which are strong indicators for computer science. However, his deep love for nature and animals is somewhat less typical for CS students.
  \[
  P(E | H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.4
  \]

- **P(E | \neg H for CS)**: The probability of the evidence given that Adam is not a computer science student. Including garden/plant-related fields, psychology, and environmental science could align with his characteristics.
  \[
  P(E | \neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.6
  \]

Using Bayes' rule:
\[
P(H_{\text{CS}} | E) = \frac{P(E | H_{\text{CS}}) P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)}
\]
Given \( P(E) = P(E | H_{\text{CS}}) P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E | \neg H_{\text{CS}}) P(\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \):
\[
P(E) = 0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.6 \cdot 0.8 = 0.08 + 0.48 = 0.56
\]
Thus,
\[
P(H_{\text{CS}} | E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.56} \approx 0.14
\]

### Business Administration (BA)
- **P(H for BA)**: Similarly, assume a reasonable prior:
  \[
  P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.2
  \]

- **P(E | H for BA)**: Adam's empathy and appreciation for hard work could be relevant, but his strong interest in nature and solving puzzles is less indicative.
  \[
  P(E | H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.2
  \]

- **P(E | \neg H for BA)**: Includes many other fields where empathy and puzzle-solving might fit better.
  \[
  P(E | \neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.6
  \]

Using Bayes' rule:
\[
P(H_{\text{BA}} | E) = \frac{P(E | H_{\text{BA}}) P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)}
\]
Given \( P(E) = P(E | H_{\text{BA}}) P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E | \neg H_{\text{BA}}) P(\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \):
\[
P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.2 + 0.6 \cdot 0.8 = 0.04 + 0.48 = 0.52
\]

Thus,
\[
P(H_{\text{BA}} | E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.52} \approx 0.077
\]

So, the estimations would be:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.14,
  "business administration": 0.077
}
```
