To determine the likelihood that Adam is enrolled in a particular graduate field given his personality sketch, we will apply Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is expressed as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam is enrolled in the given field (H) given his personality sketch (E).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch (E) if Adam is enrolled in the given field (H).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the given field (H).
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch (E).

Because \( P(E) \) is the same across different fields and we are comparing relative values, we can focus on calculating \( P(H|E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for each field and then comparing these values.

### 1. Business Administration

#### P(H) - Prior Probability
We may assume that a moderate number of graduate students opt for a business administration program.

#### P(E|H) - Probability of E given H
- Curiosity about nature and plants: Low relevance
- Quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles: Medium to low relevance
- Warm heart, empathy, love for animals: Low relevance
- High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts: Medium relevance
- Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work: Medium to high relevance

In business administration, although aspects like intelligence and appreciation for hard work are valuable, other traits like deep love for animals and curiosity about nature are less relevant.

#### P(E|\neg H) - Probability of E given not H
We will not focus on this as it is encompassed by the base rates in relative comparison.

### 2. Computer Science

#### P(H) - Prior Probability
The number of graduate students in computer science is also significant.

#### P(E|H) - Probability of E given H
- Curiosity about nature and plants: Low to medium relevance (possibly interests in biology-related computing fields)
- Quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles: High relevance
- Warm heart, empathy, love for animals: Low to medium relevance
- High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts: High relevance
- Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work: Medium to high relevance

Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence are strong indicators for computer science. Curiosity about plants may also align with bioinformatics or similar fields.

Based on these considerations:

- Business Administration: Adam’s traits less strongly align.
- Computer Science: Adam’s traits more strongly align.

So our relative values for \( P(H|E) \) for each field will be:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```

These values suggest that based on Adam's personality sketch, it is more likely he is enrolled in computer science than business administration. The total does not add up to 1 as there are other possible fields (e.g., biology, environmental science) where his personality traits could also be a good match.
