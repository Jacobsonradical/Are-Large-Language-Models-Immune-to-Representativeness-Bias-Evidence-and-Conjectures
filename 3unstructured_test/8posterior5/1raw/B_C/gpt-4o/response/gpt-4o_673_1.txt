To calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field given Adam's personality sketch, we need to use Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we don't have the exact values for \( P(E) \), \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \), we'll make educated guesses based on the information provided. These guesses should work under the assumption that they maintain relative coherence to the average distribution of students across different departments.

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**
   - Let's assume both fields (computer science and business administration) have equal prior probability, adjusting slightly by the general number of students typically in these fields.
   - I'm going to assign moderately high probabilities to starting conditions since both fields are common.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**
   - We will consider the fit of Adam's personality sketch to each field:
     - For computer science: Adam's high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of puzzles point towards a good fit.
     - For business administration: While empathy and understanding hard work are important, his agnostic interest in nature and animals might make it a less perfect match.

3. **Non-conditional Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \) would generally factor in the likelihood of Adam's personality in all fields other than the specific one mentioned, which we can assume to be relatively moderate given how general some of Adamâ€™s characteristics are.

Let's give it a structured attempt:

1. **Computer Science (CS)**
   - \( P(H) \): 0.05 (assuming slightly higher engagement from students in technology fields).
   - \( P(E|H) \) for CS: 0.7 (good fit with high intelligence, puzzles, abstract concepts).

2. **Business Administration (BA)**
   - \( P(H) \): 0.03 (given Adam's interest in nature might be less conventional in this field).
   - \( P(E|H) \) for BA: 0.3 (some suitability, but weaker than CS).

Assuming for simplicity purposes that the likelihood of having Adam's personality sketch in other domains is generally \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

Finally, calculate \( P(H|E) \):

### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|\neg H)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{0.1} = 0.35 \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|\neg H)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.03}{0.1} = 0.09 \]
