To solve this problem, let's use Bayes' theorem, which is represented by the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability, i.e., the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood, i.e., the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability, i.e., the initial probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the normalizing constant, also known as the evidence, which ensures that the posterior probabilities sum to 1 across all hypotheses.

For simplicity, let's assume that \( P(E) \) is the same across all hypotheses since we don't need to calculate exact values but just provide relative probabilities. We'll estimate the relative probability of Adam being a graduate student in business administration or computer science based on his personality sketch.

Firstly, let's make some reasonable assumptions to estimate the probabilities:

### Prior Probability \( P(H) \)

We don't have specific data on how many students are enrolled in business administration vs. computer science, so we might assume that the prior probabilities are perhaps close to equal in the absence of specific data. However, it might be reasonable to give a slight edge to computer science since it's a more common field of graduate studies these days. 

Let's assume:
\[ P(\text{business administration}) = 0.4 \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}) = 0.6 \]

### Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \)

Given Adam's personality:

1. **Interest in nature and plants, empathy, love for animals**:
   - Likely lower relevance to business administration.
   - Might be more aligned with computer science in areas like environmental computing or simulations.

2. **Enjoys solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts**:
   - Strong fit for computer science.
   - Somewhat relevant to business analytics but generally less typical for business administration.

3. **High intelligence and strong understanding/appreciation for hard work**:
   - Equally relevant to both fields.

Given these considerations:
\[ P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.3 \]
\[ P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.7 \]

### Normalizing Constant \( P(E) \) (for relative comparison)

Since we are comparing only two fields, we can ignore the normalizing constant for relative values:

\[ P(E) = P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) + P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) \]

Now, we can calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

1. **Business Administration**:
   \[
   P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)}
   \]

2. **Computer Science**:
   \[
   P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)}
   \]

### Calculations

For simplicity, the normalizing constant \( P(E) \) is:
\[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.4) + (0.7 \cdot 0.6) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.42 = 0.54 \]

Thus:

1. **Business Administration**:
   \[
   P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.4}{0.54} \approx 0.222
   \]

2. **Computer Science**:
   \[
   P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.6}{0.54} \approx 0.778
   \]

### Conclusion
Thus, the relative probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.222,
  "computer science": 0.778
}
```

These values indicate that, based on Adam's personality sketch, it is more likely that he was enrolled in computer science compared to business administration, but not an absolute certainty.
