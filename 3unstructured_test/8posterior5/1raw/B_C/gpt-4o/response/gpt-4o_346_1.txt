To estimate the probabilities \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to calculate the following probabilities for each hypothesis:

1. \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
2. \(P(E|H)\): The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in that field.

Once we have these probabilities, we can use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \(P(E)\) is the same for both hypotheses and we are comparing relative probabilities, we can simplify this to:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) P(H) \]

Where \(\propto\) denotes proportionality.

### For Computer Science

**Prior \(P(H)\)**: Let's assume the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a Computer Science graduate program is moderate, say 0.2, given the wide variety of possible graduate fields.

**Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: The personality sketch does not strongly align with the typical Computer Science profile. While high intelligence might fit, the affinity towards nature, plants, animals, and empathy is less common in computer science students. Let's assume a low value, say 0.3.

**Complement \(P(E|\neg H)\)**: This is the likelihood of the personality sketch if Adam is in any other field than Computer Science. Given the broad spectrum of fields and the specific characteristics described, let's assume this to be relatively high, say 0.6.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.3 \times 0.2 = 0.06 \]

### For Business Administration

**Prior \(P(H)\)**: Let's assume the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a Business Administration graduate program is moderate, similar to Computer Science, say 0.2.

**Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: The personality sketch better fits fields that value empathy, understanding, and abstract thinking. Business Administration might not be a perfect match but isn't far-fetched either, perhaps moderate, say 0.4.

**Complement \(P(E|\neg H)\)**: This is still high given the same reasoning as before, say 0.6.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.4 \times 0.2 = 0.08 \]

### Summary

Relative to each other and using the chosen priors and likelihoods, the probabilities simplify to:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.06,
  "business administration": 0.08
}
```

As relative probabilities, Business Administration seems slightly more likely than Computer Science based on the provided personality sketch.
