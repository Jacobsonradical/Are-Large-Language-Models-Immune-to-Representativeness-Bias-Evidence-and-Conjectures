To apply Bayes' rule to find the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each of the two fields given the personality sketch \( E \), we need to consider the following components for each field:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch given Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch given Adam is not enrolled in that field.

We will assume initial generic values for \( P(H) \). Note that these values can be adjusted based on specific data if available.

### Business Administration

#### Priors and Likelihoods
\[
P(H_{\text{ba}}) = 0.2 \quad \text{(assuming a generic value based on the number of graduate fields)}
\]

Considering the personality sketch traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, solving puzzles) might not fit as strongly with a typical business administration profile, we can reasonably assume:

\[
P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) = 0.1
\]

Now, considering \( \neg H_{\text{ba}} \) employs some understanding of other fields, including computer science and others:

\[
P(E|\neg H_{\text{ba}}) = 0.4
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{ba}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ba}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)}
\]

Note that \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ba}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{ba}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{ba}})
\]

Substituting values,

\[
P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.4 \cdot 0.8) = 0.02 + 0.32 = 0.34
\]

So,

\[
P(H_{\text{ba}}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.34} = \frac{0.02}{0.34} \approx 0.0588
\]

### Computer Science

#### Priors and Likelihoods
\[
P(H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.2 \quad \text{(assuming a generic value based on the number of graduate fields)}
\]

Given Adam's traits, they might align more closely with interests in computer science:

\[
P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.6
\]

Considering \( \neg H_{\text{cs}} \):

\[
P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.2
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{0.34} = \frac{0.12}{0.34} \approx 0.3529
\]

### Results

\[
\{
  "business administration": 0.0588,
  "computer science": 0.3529
\}
\]

This suggests that given the personality sketch \( E \), the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science is higher compared to business administration.
