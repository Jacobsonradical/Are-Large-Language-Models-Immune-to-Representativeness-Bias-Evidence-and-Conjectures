To calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we use the formula:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

To simplify, let's denote:

- \( H_{BA} \): Hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( H_{CS} \): Hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science.

We'll assess the prior probabilities \( P(H_{BA}) \) and \( P(H_{CS}) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H_{BA}) \) and \( P(E|H_{CS}) \), and the evidence \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \) and \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \).

1. **Business Administration**:

   - **P(H)**: Assuming a reasonable balance among different fields, let's assign a modest prior probability to business administration, say 0.1.
   - **P(E|H_{BA})**: The characteristics described for Adam (curiosity about nature, love for animals, solving puzzles) do not particularly point to business administration. We might estimate this probability to be relatively low, say 0.1.
   - **P(E|\neg H_{BA})**: Given the vast number of other fields where Adam's personality would fit better, let's assign a high value, say 0.9.

2. **Computer Science**:

   - **P(H)**: Computer science is a common field, especially for someone with high intelligence and good abstract reasoning skills. Let's assign it a higher prior, say 0.2.
   - **P(E|H_{CS})**: The traits described fit relatively well with computer science (solving puzzles and high intelligence). We might estimate this to be higher, say 0.6.
   - **P(E|\neg H_{CS})**: Given that computer science fits closely but isn't exclusive, let's estimate a moderate value, say 0.4.

Using these values, we compute using Bayes' rule:

### Business Administration
\[
P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)}
\]
Since \( P(E) \) is the same regardless of the hypothesis being tested and will simply normalize the result, we can compute the numerator for ranking purposes:
\[
P(H_{BA}|E) \propto P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) = 0.1 \cdot 0.1 = 0.01
\]

### Computer Science
\[
P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)}
\]
Similarly, just the numerator:
\[
P(H_{CS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) = 0.6 \cdot 0.2 = 0.12
\]

Normalizing these to get probabilities:
- For Business Administration:
  \[
  \text{Normalized } P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.12} = \frac{0.01}{0.13} \approx 0.077
  \]

- For Computer Science:
  \[
  \text{Normalized } P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.01 + 0.12} = \frac{0.12}{0.13} \approx 0.923
  \]

So, the probability estimates are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.077,
  "computer science": 0.923
}
```
