To apply Bayes' rule and compute \(P(H|E)\) for Adam's likelihood of being enrolled in business administration or computer science, we need to estimate three probabilities for each field:

1. \(P(H)\): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the given field.
2. \(P(E|H)\): The probability of E (the personality sketch) given that Adam is in the specified field.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of E given that Adam is not in the specified field.

And then, we use Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, \(P(E)\) can be considered as a normalizing constant since we are only comparing the relative probabilities.

### Business Administration

1. \(P(H)\) for business administration: Generally, business administration is a common graduate program, so let's assume a prior of 0.1 (or 10%).
2. \(P(E|H)\) for business administration:
   - Curiosity about nature: Low
   - Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles: Neutral
   - Warm heart, empathy, love for animals: Low to Moderate
   - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: Moderate
   - Appreciation for hard work: High
   
   Overall, Adam's personality does not strongly align with typical traits needed in business administration. Let's estimate this at 0.2.

3. \(P(E|\neg H)\) for business administration:
   - Considering other graduate fields (science, engineering, humanities), Adam's personality might be more common. Let's estimate it at 0.5.

So, 
\[P(H|E) _{\text{business admin}} \approx \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{P(E)}\]

### Computer Science

1. \(P(H)\) for computer science: Computer science is also a common graduate program. Assume a prior of 0.1 (or 10%).
2. \(P(E|H)\) for computer science:
   - Curiosity about nature: Moderate
   - Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles: High
   - Warm heart, empathy, love for animals: Moderate to High
   - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: High
   - Appreciation for hard work: High

   Adam's personality seems to align fairly well with computer science traits (problem-solving, abstract thinking, dedication). Let's estimate this at 0.6.

3. \(P(E|\neg H)\) for computer science:
   - Considering the rest of the fields, Adamâ€™s personality might still be moderate to high in alignment. Let's estimate this at 0.4.

So, 
\[P(H|E) _{\text{computer science}} \approx \frac{0.6 \times 0.1}{P(E)}\]

Since the normalizing constant \(P(E)\) is the same for both fields:

\[P(H|E) _{\text{business admin}} \approx \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{P(E)}\]

\[P(H|E) _{\text{computer science}} \approx \frac{0.6 \times 0.1}{P(E)}\]

Finally, normalize the values:
\[ w_\text{business admin} = 0.2 \times 0.1 = 0.02 \]

\[ w_\text{computer science} = 0.6 \times 0.1 = 0.06 \]

Now the probabilities are proportional to these weights:

\[
P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.06} = \frac{0.02}{0.08} = 0.25
\]

\[
P(H|E)_{\text{computer science}} = \frac{0.06}{0.02 + 0.06} = \frac{0.06}{0.08} = 0.75
\]

Therefore, the computed relative probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.25,
  "computer science": 0.75
}
```
