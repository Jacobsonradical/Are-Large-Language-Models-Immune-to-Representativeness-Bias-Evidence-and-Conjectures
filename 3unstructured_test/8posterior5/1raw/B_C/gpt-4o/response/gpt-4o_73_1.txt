To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the hypotheses that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science or Business Administration using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field before considering the personality sketch.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in a particular field.

Given that we do not have specific data on the actual priors, conditioning probabilities, or field enrollment distributions, I will make reasonable assumptions based on the provided personality sketch and common field characteristics:

### Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \)**
    - Assuming there are many possible fields, let's estimate the prior probability:
    - \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.1 \) (10%)

2. **Conditional Probability \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \)**
    - Adam is intelligent, good at abstract concepts, solves puzzles, and has an appreciation for hard work, all of which are common traits in computer science students.
    - \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.6 \) (high, but not certain)

3. **Conditional Probability \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \)**
    - For fields other than computer science, some could still share these traits but perhaps not all of them.
    - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.3 \)

Now, apply Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \]

We need \( P(E) \), the evidence, but as an approximation, we use:
\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \]
\[ P(E) \approx (0.6 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) \approx 0.06 + 0.27 = 0.33 \]

Thus,
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.1}{0.33} \approx \frac{0.06}{0.33} \approx 0.182 \]

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \)**
    - Estimate the prior probability:
    - \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.1 \) (10%)

2. **Conditional Probability \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \)**
    - Adam's traits include empathy and understanding of hard work, which might suit business administration, but not as strongly as it fits the profile for computer science.
    - \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.4 \)

3. **Conditional Probability \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \)**
    - For fields other than business administration, some could still share these traits but to varying extents.
    - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.35 \)

Now, apply Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \]

We need \( P(E) \), but as an approximation, we use:
\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \]
\[ P(E) \approx (0.4 \cdot 0.1) + (0.35 \cdot 0.9) \approx 0.04 + 0.315 = 0.355 \]

Thus,
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \approx \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.1}{0.355} \approx \frac{0.04}{0.355} \approx 0.113 \]
