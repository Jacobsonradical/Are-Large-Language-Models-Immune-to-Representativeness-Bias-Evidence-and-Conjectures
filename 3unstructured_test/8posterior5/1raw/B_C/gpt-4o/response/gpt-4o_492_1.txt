To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' rule, which is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to estimate:

1. \(P(H)\): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the specified field.
2. \(P(E|H)\): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch, given that he is enrolled in the specified field.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch, given that he is not enrolled in the specified field.

1. **Business Administration**:
   - **P(H)**: Prior probability of Adam being in business administration. In the absence of specific data, we might assume some rough egalitarian distribution among different fields. For simplicity, let's assume \(P(H)_{BA} = 0.1\).
   - **P(E|H)**: Likelihood of the personality sketch if Adam were in business administration. The sketch suggests a strong affinity for nature, puzzles, and animals, which seems less likely to match someone in business administration. Let's estimate this as 0.05.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: Likelihood of the personality sketch for someone not in business administration. Given that there are numerous other fields, many of which seem like better fits (e.g., biology, environmental science), let's estimate it as 0.2.

   Using Bayes' rule:
   \[
   P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{P(E|H)_{BA} \cdot P(H)_{BA}}{P(E)_{BA}}
   \]
   We assume \(P(E)\) approximately 0.2 across various fields.
   \[
   P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{0.2} = 0.025
   \]

2. **Computer Science**:
   - **P(H)**: Prior probability of Adam being in computer science. Assume \(P(H)_{CS} = 0.1\).
   - **P(E|H)**: Likelihood of the personality sketch if Adam were in computer science. Computer science students often deal with abstract concepts and puzzles, which fits some aspects of Adam's description well. However, the strong interest in nature and animals is less common in this field. Let's estimate this as 0.1.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: Likelihood of the personality sketch for someone not in computer science. With many fields possibly being a better fit, let's keep it at 0.2.

   Using Bayes' rule:
   \[
   P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{P(E|H)_{CS} \cdot P(H)_{CS}}{P(E)_{CS}}
   \]
   We assume \(P(E)\) approximately 0.2.
   \[
   P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.2} = 0.05
   \]

Thus, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.025,
  "computer science": 0.05
}
```
