To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the personality sketch \( E \), let's evaluate \( P(H), P(E|H), and \ P(E|\neg H) \).

### Computer Science
- **P(H)**: This represents the probability that Adam is enrolled in Computer Science. Let's assume a prior probability for graduate students in Computer Science, say \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.2 \).
- **P(E|H)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's traits if he is in Computer Science. Given his curiosity, intelligence, and puzzle-solving skills, we might set this quite high, say \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.7 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: This represents the probability of observing Adam's traits if he is not in Computer Science. Given his traits, it's plausible such a personality could be found in other fields too, so let's set this at an intermediate level, say \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.4 \).

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: This represents the probability that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration. Let's assume a prior probability for graduate students in Business Administration, say \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.1 \).
- **P(E|H)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's traits if he is in Business Administration. Considering business administration might not be the most likely field given Adam's curiosity about nature and animals, this might be lower, say \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.3 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: This represents the probability of observing Adam's traits if he is not in Business Administration. This value can be set considering other fields may better fit Adam's traits, say \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.6 \).

### Bayes' Rule Calculation
Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we don't need a total probability of 1 across all fields, we will assume equal evidence \( P(E) \) across fields for simplicity.

### Computer Science
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields, we compare the relative probable values:

\[
P(H_{CS}|E) \approx 0.14
\]
\[
P(H_{BA}|E) \approx 0.03
\]
