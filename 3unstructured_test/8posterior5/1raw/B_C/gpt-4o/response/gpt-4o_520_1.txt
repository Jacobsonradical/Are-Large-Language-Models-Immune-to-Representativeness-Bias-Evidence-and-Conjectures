To solve this problem using Bayes' rule, let's denote the following probabilities:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a certain graduate field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing personality sketch \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \) (Adam is enrolled in a specific field).
- \( P(E | \neg H) \): The likelihood of observing personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in that specific field.
- \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in a certain graduate field given the personality sketch \( E \).

Bayes' theorem is given by the formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant, and for each field, we'll use the following approach to check consistency.

### Computer Science
1. **Prior probability \( P(H) \):**
   - Assume a reasonable prior: \( P(H) = 0.10 \) (since there are many fields and computer science is one possible field).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   - Given personality traits such as high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, solving puzzles, and quiet, it is likely that Adam fits well with computer science: \( P(E|H) = 0.70 \) (these traits align well with typical CS profiles).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   - Given a broad population not in computer science, these traits are less common but not extremely rare: \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.30 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.70 \cdot 0.10) + (0.30 \cdot 0.90) = 0.07 + 0.27 = 0.34 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.70 \cdot 0.10}{0.34} \approx 0.206 \]

{
  "computer science": 0.206
}

### Business Administration
1. **Prior probability \( P(H) \):**
   - Assume a reasonable prior: \( P(H) = 0.10 \) (since business administration is one possible field among many).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   - Given personality traits such as empathy, warm heart, understanding, appreciation for hard work, and solving puzzles, it is somewhat likely but not as strong a fit as computer science: \( P(E|H) = 0.40 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   - Given a broad population not in business administration, these traits are less likely: \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.30 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Since \( P(E) \) remains the same (an overall constant for normalization):
\[ P(E) = (0.40 \cdot 0.10) + (0.30 \cdot 0.90) = 0.04 + 0.27 = 0.31 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.40 \cdot 0.10}{0.31} \approx 0.129 \]

{
  "business administration": 0.129
}

Given the personality sketch of Adam, the probabilities calculated using Bayes' rule reflect the more likely field given the available information.

The final results are:
{
  "computer science": 0.206,
  "business administration": 0.129
}
