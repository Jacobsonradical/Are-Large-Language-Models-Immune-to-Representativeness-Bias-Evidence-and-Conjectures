To calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was in the given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was in the given field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not in the given field.

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of \( E \), which can be derived as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Since we don't know the exact values, we typically assign reasonable estimates based on the scenario.

### Computer Science

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability \( P(H) \) that Adam is studying computer science:
   - Let's assume the proportion of graduate students in computer science is reasonably high. Hence, \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given computer science:
   - Given the traits mentioned (high intelligence, good at abstract concepts), Adam's personality could fit within computer science, but not all of it (love for animals, nature) aligns perfectly. Hence, \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in computer science:
   - Considering other fields that might also have students with Adam's traits, \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.1 \).

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability \( P(H) \) that Adam is studying business administration:
   - Let's assume the proportion of graduate students in business administration is reasonably high as well. Hence, \( P(H) \approx 0.15 \).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given business administration:
   - The traits such as empathy and appreciation for hard work fit well with business administration, but others like love for nature might not. Hence, \( P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in business administration:
   - Similarly, other fields matching some of the traits. \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.1 \).

Now, we can compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

### Computer Science

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields, we simplify to compare:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

For computer science:
\[ P(CS|E) \propto 0.3 \cdot 0.2 = 0.06 \]

### Business Administration

For business administration:
\[ P(BA|E) \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.15 = 0.03 \]

### Normalizing

To make these probabilities sum up to 1, we normalize them:

\[ P(CS|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.03} = 0.67 \]
\[ P(BA|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.06 + 0.03} = 0.33 \]

Thus, the final computed probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": 0.67,
  "business administration": 0.33
}
