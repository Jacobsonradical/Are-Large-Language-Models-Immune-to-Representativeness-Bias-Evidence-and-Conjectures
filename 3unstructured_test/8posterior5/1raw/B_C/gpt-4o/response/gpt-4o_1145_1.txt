To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, where \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field, \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence given the hypothesis, and \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence given any field other than the hypothesis, we follow the equation:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, to simplify, we can compare the relative probabilities for each field as a ratio. Given we are not comparing directly against other fields, we'll simplify with plausible values:

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Let's reasonably assume this as 0.15 (15%), considering many other fields of study.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of having Adam's personality sketch (E) if he was in business administration. This is likely low, as a deep curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strength in abstract concepts do not strongly align with typical traits expected in business administration. Let's assume this as 0.10 (10%).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the evidence given that he is not in business administration. Assume this to be 0.90 because it is more likely that his traits match with fields other than business administration.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.10 \cdot 0.15}{0.90} = 0.0167 \]

### Computer Science

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Letâ€™s reasonably assume this as 0.20 (20%).
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of having Adam's personality sketch (E) if he was in computer science. This is fairly high, given his strong intelligence, abstract thinking, and puzzle-solving nature, which are common in computer science. Let's assume this as 0.70 (70%).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the evidence given that he is not in computer science. Assume this to be 0.30, as his traits are more aligned with fields like computer science.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.70 \cdot 0.20}{0.30} = 0.4667 \]

Thus, our computed probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0167,
  "computer science": 0.4667
}
```

Please note that these probabilities will be balanced relative to other possible fields not considered here.
