To compute \( P(H|E) \), the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch (E), we will use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (Adam being enrolled in that field).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of observing the evidence under all possible hypotheses.

Since we're comparing two fields, we don't need to compute \( P(E) \) explicitly, because it will cancel out when we're just comparing ratios. Instead, we will compare \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for each field.

Let's assume initial prior probabilities \( P(H) \) that are somewhat equally likely for Adam being in business administration or computer science. Generally, these might be:

- \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.5 \)

Next, we'll estimate \( P(E|H) \), the likelihood of having Adam's personality traits given each field:

### Business Administration
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \):
  - Curiosity about nature and plants: Low
  - Quiet, puzzle-solving: Medium
  - Warm heart, empathy: Medium
  - Love for animals: Low
  - High intelligence, abstract concepts: High
  - Appreciation for hard work: Medium
- Combining these, let's qualitatively assess \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \) as approximately 0.2.

### Computer Science
- \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \):
  - Curiosity about nature and plants: Medium
  - Quiet, puzzle-solving: High
  - Warm heart, empathy: Medium
  - Love for animals: Medium
  - High intelligence, abstract concepts: High
  - Appreciation for hard work: High
- Combining these, let's qualitatively assess \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \) as approximately 0.7.

Finally, calculate \( P(H|E) \) using these estimates:

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \times P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) \propto 0.2 \times 0.5 = 0.1 \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \times P(H_{\text{computer science}}) \]
\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) \propto 0.7 \times 0.5 = 0.35 \]

Combining these proportions:

{
  "business administration": 0.1 / (0.1 + 0.35) ≈ 0.22,
  "computer science": 0.35 / (0.1 + 0.35) ≈ 0.78
}

Therefore, the answers are:
{
  "business administration": 0.22,
  "computer science": 0.78
}
