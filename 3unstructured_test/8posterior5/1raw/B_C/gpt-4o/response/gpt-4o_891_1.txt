To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis \( H \), we need to use Bayes' rule. The formula for Bayes' rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both hypotheses, we can calculate the proportional terms and compare them. 

Let's evaluate the relevant probabilities for the given hypotheses.

### Hypothesis: Adam was enrolled in Computer Science

**P(H):** Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in Computer Science. Given that we have no prior knowledge about his overall likelihood of choosing any specific field, we might assume a neutral prior probability. However, due to the specialization nature, computer science can be considered a moderately popular field among graduate students.
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}) \approx 0.2 \]

**P(E|H):** Probability of the personality sketch E given Adam was in Computer Science. Considering his attributes like curiosity about nature, love for animals, and enjoyment in puzzle-solving, these traits fit moderately well:
\[ P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \approx 0.4 \]

**P(E|\neg H):** Probability of having this personality E given Adam was not in Computer Science. Given the diversity of graduate fields, this probability might be fairly distributed among other fields.
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}}) \approx 0.6 \]

### Hypothesis: Adam was enrolled in Business Administration

**P(H):** Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in Business Administration. This field is also a common choice for many students, often seen as popular as Computer Science.
\[ P(H_{\text{ba}}) \approx 0.2 \]

**P(E|H):** Probability of the personality sketch E given Adam was in Business Administration. This doesnâ€™t fit quite as well as Computer Science because Business Administration might be expected to favor outgoing and extroverted personalities, more attuned to leadership and economics rather than nature and animals:
\[ P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) \approx 0.2 \]

**P(E|\neg H):** Probability of having this personality E given Adam was not in Business Administration. This distribution would be similar to the Computer Science case given the variety of graduate fields.
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{ba}}) \approx 0.8 \]

### Applying Bayes' Rule

**Computer Science:**

\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.4 \cdot 0.2 = 0.08 \]

**Business Administration:**

\[ P(H_{\text{ba}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ba}}) = 0.2 \cdot 0.2 = 0.04 \]

### Normalizing to Find Relative Probabilities

To make these probabilities relative:

\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.04} = \frac{0.08}{0.12} = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.67 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{ba}}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.08 + 0.04} = \frac{0.04}{0.12} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.33 \]

Given the above computation, we can conclude:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.67,
  "business administration": 0.33
}
