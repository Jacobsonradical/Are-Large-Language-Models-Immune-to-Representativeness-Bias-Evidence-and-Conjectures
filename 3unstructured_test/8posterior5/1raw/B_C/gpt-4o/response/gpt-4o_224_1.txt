To use Bayes' Rule to compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in either computer science (CS) or business administration (BA), we'll follow this process:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The initial probability that Adam is enrolled in each field without considering the personality sketch.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch given Adam is in that field.
3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch given Adam is not in that field.
4. **Posterior Probability \( P(H|E) \)**: The probability that Adam is in that field given the personality sketch.

Given that we don't have specific data, we'll have to make reasonable assumptions based on the personality sketch and general knowledge about these fields.

### 1. Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)

Let's assume all graduate fields are equally likely:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}) = P(H_{\text{BA}}) = \frac{1}{N} \]
where \( N \) is the number of possible fields of study. For simplicity, we assume there are 10 possible fields:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}) = P(H_{\text{BA}}) = \frac{1}{10} = 0.1 \]

### 2. Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \)

#### **Computer Science (CS)**
- CS favors high intelligence, abstract thinking, puzzle-solving, and a quiet nature. Therefore, it's reasonable to assign a high probability.
\[ P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.7 \]

#### **Business Administration (BA)**
- BA may favor understanding hard work and dedication, and empathy, but may be less tied to nature, high asbstract thinking, or puzzle-solving.
\[ P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.3 \]

### 3. Likelihoods \( P(E|\neg H) \)

#### **Computer Science (CS)**
- If Adam is not in CS, he still might have these personality traits to varying degrees in other fields.
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.1 \]

#### **Business Administration (BA)**
- If Adam is not in BA, these traits can vary, but since nature and empathy are not as defining for BA specifically:
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.2 \]

### 4. Posterior Probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule

Bayes' rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

#### **Computer Science (CS)**:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.1}{0.7 \times 0.1 + 0.1 \times 0.9} = \frac{0.07}{0.07 + 0.09} = \frac{0.07}{0.16} \approx 0.4375 \]

#### **Business Administration (BA)**:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.1}{0.3 \times 0.1 + 0.2 \times 0.9} = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.18} = \frac{0.03}{0.21} \approx 0.1429 \]

Here is the formatted answer:

{
  "computer science": 0.4375,
  "business administration": 0.1429
}
