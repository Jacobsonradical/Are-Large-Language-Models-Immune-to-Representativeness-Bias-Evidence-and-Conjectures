To calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \), where \( H \) is the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in a particular graduate field and \( E \) is the personality sketch, we can use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's denote \( H_{CS} \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science and \( H_{BA} \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration. Here's what we need to estimate:

1. \( P(H_{CS}) \): Prior probability that a graduate student is in Computer Science.
2. \( P(H_{BA}) \): Prior probability that a graduate student is in Business Administration.
3. \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is in Computer Science.
4. \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): Likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is in Business Administration.
5. \( P(E) \): We can ignore the exact value since it remains constant for each comparison.

We assign rough estimates for these probabilities based on the sketch and common knowledge. Note that these values are illustrative.

### For Computer Science (CS):

- \( P(H_{CS}) \): Suppose 30% of graduate students are in Computer Science.
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Given his attributes like high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts, but considering his warm heart and empathy might be less typical, let's estimate 0.4.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \): If not in CS, his personality might not fit as well with the general expectations of other fields. Let's rough it to 0.6.

### For Business Administration (BA):

- \( P(H_{BA}) \): Suppose 20% of graduate students are in Business Administration.
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): Given his warm heart and strong empathy, this field might seem less fitting, let us estimate 0.1.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \): If not in BA, his personality might fit other fields better, let's put it at 0.8.

Now we apply Bayes' rule for each:

### Computer Science:

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]

Ignored \( P(E) \), simplifies to proportional calculation:

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) = 0.4 \cdot 0.3 = 0.12 \]

### Business Administration:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]

Ignored \( P(E) \), simplifies to proportional calculation:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]
