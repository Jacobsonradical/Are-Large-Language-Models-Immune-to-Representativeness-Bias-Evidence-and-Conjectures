To provide a Bayesian analysis for Adam being enrolled in either computer science or business administration based on his personality sketch, we follow the given steps.

1. **Estimation of P(H):** This is the prior belief of Adam being in a specific field. Let's assume equal likelihood for each field before considering specific evidence.
   
2. **Estimation of P(E|H):** This is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis. We determine how well the personality sketch fits each field.

3. **Estimation of P(E|¬H):** This is the likelihood of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis, i.e., Adam being in any other field different from the specified one.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since P(E) is a normalizing constant, we can compute the relative likelihoods and ignore it for the sake of comparison.

### Estimations:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - **P(H):** Assume a uniform prior distribution over all fields. Not knowing how many fields there are, let's assume a non-informative prior \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
   - **P(E|H):** Adam’s traits of high intelligence, problem-solving, and understanding abstract concepts fit well with the attributes typically needed for computer science. Let's assign P(E|H) = 0.8.
   - **P(E|¬H):** Given the general nature of Adam's traits, they could fit reasonably many other fields too. Let’s assume P(E|¬H) = 0.3.

   Using Bayes' rule:
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.08}{P(E)} \]

2. **Business Administration:**
   - **P(H):** Assume a uniform prior distribution here as well, \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
   - **P(E|H):** The traits of empathy and understanding hard work fit somewhat with the field, but the deep love for nature and animals may not fit as well. So let's assign P(E|H) = 0.4.
   - **P(E|¬H):** As before, P(E|¬H) could be about the same for other fields, i.e., 0.3.

   Using Bayes' rule:
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.04}{P(E)} \]

### Relative Likelihoods:

Given that we do not need to normalize (since absolute values are not requested), the relative probabilities are:

\[ \text{computer science} = 0.08 \]
\[ \text{business administration} = 0.04 \]

Thus, these can be adjusted to fit probabilities by normalizing against each other. However, as instructions suggest providing the value between 0 and 1 without summing to 1:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.4
}
```

These numbers reflect the relative likelihoods given the personality sketch for Adam being in those respective fields.
