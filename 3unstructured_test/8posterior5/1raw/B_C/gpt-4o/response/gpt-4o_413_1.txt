To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Theorem, we need to estimate the individual pieces: \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

### 1. Computer Science

- **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: Let's assume the prior probability that a random graduate student is in computer science is \( 0.2 \) (since it's a relatively popular field).
- **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: The description of Adam aligns with traits often found in computer science students, such as high intelligence, a love for solving puzzles, and an appreciation for abstract concepts. So, let's estimate this as \( 0.6 \).
- **Complement Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of E occurring if Adam is not in computer science. Given that the traits described could also match other fields, such as psychology or biology, we will estimate this as \( 0.2 \).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
\]

Plugging in the values:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{0.6 \cdot 0.2 + 0.2 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.16} = \frac{0.12}{0.28} \approx 0.4286
\]

### 2. Business Administration

- **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: Let's assume the prior probability that a random graduate student is in business administration is \( 0.15 \).
- **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: The description does not strongly match typical traits associated with business administration students. Thus, we might estimate this as \( 0.1 \).
- **Complement Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Similar to before, let's use \( 0.25 \), assuming the traits can align with a variety of other fields.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
\]

Plugging in the values:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{0.1 \cdot 0.15 + 0.25 \cdot 0.85} = \frac{0.015}{0.015 + 0.2125} = \frac{0.015}{0.2275} \approx 0.0659
\]

So, in summary:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4286,
  "business administration": 0.0659
}
```
