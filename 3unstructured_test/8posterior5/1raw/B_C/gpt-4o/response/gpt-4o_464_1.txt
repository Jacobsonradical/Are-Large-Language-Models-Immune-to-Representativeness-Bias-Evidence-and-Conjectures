To solve this problem using Bayes' rule, we need to judge three probabilities for each field of study:
1. \( P(H) \) - the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
2. \( P(E|H) \) - the likelihood of observing E given that Adam was enrolled in H.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - the likelihood of observing E given that Adam was not enrolled in H.

Then we apply Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \), the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field given his personality sketch E.

Bayes' rule formula is:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Since we are comparing the probabilities across different hypotheses, \( P(E) \) is the same for all and thus can be ignored for relative comparisons.

### 1. Business Administration
- **P(H) for Business Administration**: Let's assume there's a fair distribution across various fields. Typically, Business Administration might have a reasonable share. So, let's pick \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

- **P(E|H) for Business Administration**: Given the description, the traits like empathy and appreciation for hard work might fit, but the curiosity about nature, love for animals, and solving puzzles are less typical. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

- **P(E|\neg H) for Business Administration**: Many other fields might fit the personality sketch better. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

### 2. Computer Science
- **P(H) for Computer Science**: Given the growing popularity and frequency of students enrolled in this field, let's pick \( P(H) = 0.3 \).

- **P(E|H) for Computer Science**: Traits like high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and solving puzzles are strong indicators for this field. Curiosity and appreciation for nature might be less direct but are not inconsistent. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).

- **P(E|\neg H) for Computer Science**: Given the unique combination of traits aligning with computer science, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

Now applying Bayes' rule and considering relative likelihoods:

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.7 \cdot 0.3 = 0.21 \]

When normalized for comparison:
\[ \text{{total}} = 0.02 + 0.21 = 0.23 \]

The probabilities would be approximately:
\[ \frac{0.02}{0.23} \approx 0.087 \]
\[ \frac{0.21}{0.23} \approx 0.913 \]

Thus, the corresponding estimates are:

{
  "business administration": 0.087,
  "computer science": 0.913
