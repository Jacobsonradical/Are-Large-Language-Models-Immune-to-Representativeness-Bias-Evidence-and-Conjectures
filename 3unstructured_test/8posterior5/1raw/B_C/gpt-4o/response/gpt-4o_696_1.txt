To solve this problem using Bayes' rule, let's denote:

- \( H_b \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration.
- \( H_c \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science.
- \( E \) as the evidence, which is the personality sketch of Adam.
- \( \neg H_b \) as the negation of \( H_b \) (Adam was not enrolled in Business Administration).
- \( \neg H_c \) as the negation of \( H_c \) (Adam was not enrolled in Computer Science).

Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

We need to estimate the following for each hypothesis:

1. **Prior Probability (\( P(H) \)): **
   - For Business Administration: Let's assume \( P(H_b) = 0.05 \) (5%)
   - For Computer Science: Let's assume \( P(H_c) = 0.15 \) (15%)

2. **Likelihood of the evidence (\( P(E|H) \)):**
   - For Business Administration: Given Adamâ€™s characteristics like love for nature, empathy, and abstract thinking, it seems less likely for Business Administration. Let's assume \( P(E|H_b) = 0.01 \) (1%)
   - For Computer Science: Curiosity about nature, enjoying solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts match well with Computer Science. Let's assume \( P(E|H_c) = 0.40 \) (40%)

3. **Likelihood of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis (\( P(E|\neg H) \)):**
   - For Business Administration: The likelihood that Adam exhibits these traits and is not in Business Administration is higher. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_b) = 0.20 \) (20%)
   - For Computer Science: The likelihood that Adam exhibits these traits and is not in Computer Science is lower since these traits align well with Computer Science. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_c) = 0.35 \) (35%)

Now, let's calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule.

### For Business Administration:
\[ P(H_b|E) = \frac{P(E|H_b) \cdot P(H_b)}{P(E)} \]
Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_b) \cdot P(H_b) + P(E|\neg H_b) \cdot P(\neg H_b) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.01 \times 0.05) + (0.20 \times (1 - 0.05)) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.0005 + 0.190 = 0.1905 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H_b|E) = \frac{0.01 \times 0.05}{0.1905} \]
\[ P(H_b|E) = \frac{0.0005}{0.1905} \approx 0.0026 \]

### For Computer Science:
\[ P(H_c|E) = \frac{P(E|H_c) \cdot P(H_c)}{P(E)} \]
Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_c) \cdot P(H_c) + P(E|\neg H_c) \cdot P(\neg H_c) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.40 \times 0.15) + (0.35 \times (1 - 0.15)) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.060 + 0.2975 = 0.3575 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H_c|E) = \frac{0.40 \times 0.15}{0.3575} \]
\[ P(H_c|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.3575} \approx 0.1678 \]

So, the final probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0026,
  "computer science": 0.1678
}
```
