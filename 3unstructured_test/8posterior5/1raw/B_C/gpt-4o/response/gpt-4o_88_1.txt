To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \), we will need to use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam’s personality sketch given he is enrolled in that particular field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of Adam’s personality sketch given he is not enrolled in that particular field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of Adam’s personality sketch occurring.

For simplicity, let's assume \( P(H) \) for both fields are equal, reflecting that Adam could potentially be interested in any field initially. We can denote these priors as equal and assign them a general value (for example, 0.5 before seeing evidence). We then approximate likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \) based on typical characteristics associated with each field and the given personality sketch \( E \).

### Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability** \( P(\text{CS}) \)

Without further information, we can assume \( P(\text{CS}) = 0.5 \).

2. **Likelihood** \( P(E|\text{CS}) \)

Adam’s traits suggest he is intelligent, good at understanding abstract concepts, enjoys solving puzzles, and has a strong appreciation for hard work. These traits align well with a typical computer science student.

Let’s set \( P(E|\text{CS}) \approx 0.8 \).

3. **Likelihood of Negation** \( P(E|\neg \text{CS}) \)

This is more complex, as negation includes all other fields. However, considering all other fields, many may not align as closely with Adam's traits.

Let’s set \( P(E|\neg \text{CS}) \approx 0.4 \).

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability** \( P(\text{BA}) \)

As with CS, let’s assume \( P(\text{BA}) = 0.5 \).

2. **Likelihood** \( P(E|\text{BA}) \)

Business administration may not align as closely with Adam's love for nature, animals, puzzles. It requires different primary traits such as leadership and business acumen.

Let’s set \( P(E|\text{BA}) \approx 0.3 \).

3. **Likelihood of Negation** \( P(E|\neg \text{BA}) \)

Again including all other fields, but since many fields potentially align better than business administration, let’s set \( P(E|\neg \text{BA}) \approx 0.5 \).

### Calculating \( P(H|E) \)

Using Bayes’ rule:

\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{BA}) \cdot P(\text{BA})}{P(E)} \]

\( P(E) \) is common in the denominator, and we compare the numerators for relative probabilities.

For computer science:
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4}{P(E)} \]

For business administration:
\[ P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.5}{P(E)} = \frac{0.15}{P(E)} \]

Since comparison of numerators \( \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)} \):

Relative probabilities:
\[ \text{CS} = 0.4 \]
\[ \text{BA} = 0.15 \]

Given that \( P(E) \) cancels out in both cases as a constant, the relative probability estimates are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.40,
  "business administration": 0.15
}
```

Keep in mind the final step would involve normalization to ensure sum up to 1 if comparing exactly, but for this task, raw relative comparisons suffice.
