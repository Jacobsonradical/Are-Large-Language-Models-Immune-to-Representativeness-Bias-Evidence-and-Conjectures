Let's begin by identifying the probabilities involved:

1. **P(H)**: The probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field (computer science or business administration) without any knowledge of his personality sketch.
   
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch, given that he was in a specific field.
   
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch, given that he was not in a specific field.
   
4. **P(H|E)**: The probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field, given his personality sketch.

Let's assume a baseline probability for **P(H)**. Since we are considering all possible fields Adam could be enrolled in, let's assume **P(H) = 0.1** for both computer science and business administration (assuming an approximately equal distribution across 10 potential fields, for simplification).

Next, we estimate **P(E|H)** and **P(E|\neg H)**:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - **P(E|H)**: Adam's personality sketch includes attributes such as high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and a love for solving puzzles, which correlate well with computer science. So, we can subjectively assign a relatively high probability, let's say 0.7.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: If Adam is not in computer science, his personality traits could still fit reasonably well in many other fields, not as high but significant. Let's assume 0.6.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - **P(E|H)**: Although business administration might appreciate intelligence and dedication, the specific traits like a genuine curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, and strong empathy might not align as closely with the typical profile. Let's assign a lower probability, say 0.3.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: If Adam is not in business administration, his traits still fit reasonably well in other fields given his versatility. Let's assume 0.7.

Now, using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
Given \(P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H)\):

Let's start with computer science:
\[ P(E)_{CS} = (0.7 \cdot 0.1) + (0.6 \cdot 0.9) = 0.07 + 0.54 = 0.61 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.61} \approx \frac{0.07}{0.61} \approx 0.115 \]

Next, business administration:
\[ P(E)_{BA} = (0.3 \cdot 0.1) + (0.7 \cdot 0.9) = 0.03 + 0.63 = 0.66 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.66} \approx \frac{0.03}{0.66} \approx 0.045 \]

So the results are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.115,
  "business administration": 0.045
}
```

Remember this process involves a subjective estimation of probabilities and assumes a simplified equal prior probability distribution. Different assumptions might yield different results.
