To answer your question, we need to evaluate the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in either business administration or computer science given the personality sketch (E) and use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probabilities. Let's start by assigning reasonable probabilities and then applying Bayes' rule.

**Bayes' rule is stated as:**

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability of hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of evidence \( E \) occurring.

We need to assign values to \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field (business administration and computer science).

### Business Administration
- \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): Let's assume the prior probability of Adam enrolling in business administration is relatively average for a graduate student.
  - \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.15 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): The likelihood of Adam having the described personality if he is in business administration. Given he enjoys nature, animals, and puzzles, this might be less typical.
  - \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \): The likelihood of Adam having the described personality if he is not in business administration (considering a broad range of other fields).
  - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.4 \) (higher probability since the personality aligns more with other fields)

### Computer Science
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): Let's assume the prior probability of Adam enrolling in computer science is also average for a graduate student.
  - \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.2 \) (maybe slightly higher due to popular demand for CS)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): The likelihood of Adam having the described personality if he is in computer science. Given the personality traits like solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, this fits well with CS.
  - \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.5 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \): The likelihood of Adam having the described personality if he is not in computer science.
  - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.3 \)

Now, letâ€™s calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field.

### Business Administration
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \]

We need \( P(E) \), which is the total probability of the evidence:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}} \text{ and } \neg H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{BA}} \text{ and } \neg H_{\text{CS}}) \]
Assuming \( P(\neg H_{\text{BA}} \text{ and } \neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 1 - P(H_{\text{BA}}) - P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.65 \) and \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}} \text{ and } \neg H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.3 \):

\[ P(E) \approx (0.1 \cdot 0.15) + (0.5 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.65) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.015 + 0.1 + 0.195 = 0.31 \]

Now we can insert back:

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{0.31} \approx 0.048 \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.31} \approx 0.323 \]

### Summary
Based on the calculations:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.048,
  "computer science": 0.323
}
```

These values indicate that, based on Adam's personality sketch, it is more likely he was a graduate student in computer science than in business administration.
