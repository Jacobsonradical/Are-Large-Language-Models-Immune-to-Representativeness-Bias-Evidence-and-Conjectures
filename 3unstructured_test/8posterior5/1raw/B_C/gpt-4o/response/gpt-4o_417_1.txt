Let's break down the process step-by-step for each field: Business Administration and Computer Science.

### Step 1: Evaluate Prior Probabilities \(P(H)\)
We don't have specific data on the enrollment probabilities for each field, so we'll assume they are roughly equal for these purposes. However, practical knowledge suggests that fields like Business Administration and Computer Science might be common among graduate students, but exact prior probabilities can vary. For simplicity, let's assume:

\[ P(\text{Business Administration}) = 0.2 \]
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}) = 0.2 \]

### Step 2: Evaluate Likelihoods \(P(E|H)\)
Given the personality sketch \(E\):

#### Business Administration \(P(E|\text{Business Administration})\)
Traits like curiosity about nature, warmth, empathy, and love for animals do not strongly align with the typical characteristics we might expect for Business Administration students. They could still fit, especially empathy and understanding of hard work, but likely not as well as other fields. Let's estimate this probability as:

\[ P(E|\text{Business Administration}) = 0.1 \]

#### Computer Science \(P(E|\text{Computer Science})\)
Traits like intelligence, solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts align well with Computer Science. The love for nature and animals does not specifically align but does not conflict either. Let's estimate this probability as:

\[ P(E|\text{Computer Science}) = 0.4 \]

### Step 3: Evaluate the Complement Likelihoods \(P(E|\neg H)\)
This is more challenging without comprehensive data on all fields. However, let's make reasonable estimates based on the idea that there are many possible graduate fields that encompass a range of personality traits.

Given the generic nature of some of the traits:
\[ P(E|\neg\text{Business Administration}) = 0.3 \]
\[ P(E|\neg\text{Computer Science}) = 0.2 \]

### Step 4: Compute Posterior Probabilities Using Bayes' Rule

For Business Administration:
\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{Business Administration}) \cdot P(\text{Business Administration})}{P(E)} \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science})}{P(E)} \]

To calculate \(P(E)\), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|\text{Business Administration}) \cdot P(\text{Business Administration}) + P(E|\text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \]

With the assumptions:
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.2) + (0.4 \times 0.2) + (0.3 \times 0.8) + (0.2 \times 0.8) \]

For simplicity, let's normalize without exact computation for \(P(E)\) as the relative focus is on the ratio:

### Posterior Probabilities:

\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]

Since we are focusing on the ratio:
\[ \frac{P(\text{Computer Science}|E)}{P(\text{Business Administration}|E)} = \frac{0.4}{0.1} = 4 \]

If we assume a normalization constant to keep proportions correct relative to each other:

### Final Answer:
