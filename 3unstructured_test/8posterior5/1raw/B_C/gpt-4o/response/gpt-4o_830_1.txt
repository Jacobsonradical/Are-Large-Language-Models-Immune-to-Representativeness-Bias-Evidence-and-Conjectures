To apply Bayes' theorem, we need to determine the following probabilities for each field: 

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam was indeed enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.

Bayes' theorem is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the normalizing constant, we can simplify this to compare the relative values of \( P(H|E) \) for different hypotheses.

Let's consider each field:

### Computer Science

1. **P(H):** Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in Computer Science. Assuming equal distribution over various fields, we can set a moderate prior for effectiveness.
   \[ P(H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.1 \]

2. **P(E|H):** Probability that Adam has the described personality and characteristics given he is enrolled in Computer Science.
   - Good understanding of abstract concepts and intelligence are well-aligned with Computer Science.
   - Curiosity-driven activities like puzzles also align well with the analytical nature of CS.
   - Slight misalignment: strong empathy and a love for animals are not specific indicators of a Computer Science student, reducing the fit slightly.
   \[ P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.6 \]

3. **P(E|\neg H):** Probability of Adam having these traits given that he is not in Computer Science, considering other fields might align better.
   \[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.3 \]

Using Bayes' rule, we estimate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \]

### Business Administration

1. **P(H):** Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in Business Administration.
   \[ P(H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.1 \]

2. **P(E|H):** Probability that Adam has these characteristics given he is in Business Administration.
   - Strong empathy and a deep love for animals might align with roles in CSR or HR, but these are more specific aspects.
   - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts are generally beneficial, but Business Administration is typically not focused on abstract ideas.
   \[ P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.3 \]

3. **P(E|\neg H):** Probability of observing these traits if Adam is not enrolled in Business Administration.
   \[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.7 \]

Using Bayes' rule, we estimate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \]


### Calculations

Bayes' theorem adjusts the priors based on the fit of the evidence, but for simplicity, we will provide the adjusted probabilities relatively scaled, not normalized:

{
  "computer science": \(\frac{0.6 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \approx 0.2\)
  "business administration": \(\frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \approx 0.04\)
}

Normalizing within other parameter constraints involving remaining fields would yield final probabilities such that total adds up to 1.

Thus, taking into account only two:

{
  "computer science": "0.67",
  "business administration": "0.33"
}

A more realistic picture would depend on more detailed consideration of uncomputed gradients across other possible fields without limitation.
