To apply Bayes' Rule to estimate \( P(H|E) \), we need to have values or reasonable estimates of:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given graduate field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in the specific field.
4. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of the personality sketch \( E \).

Bayes' Rule is stated as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that \( P(E) \) is constant across both fields for comparison purposes, we can focus on the numerator \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \). We only need relative proportions, so we don't need the exact value of \( P(E) \).

Let's break down estimates for each field based on the given personality sketch:

### Computer Science

1. **\( P(H_{cs}) \)**: Given the number of students enrolled in computer science programs, a rough estimation might be around \( 0.15 \) (15%).
2. **\( P(E|H_{cs}) \)**: Given Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts, computer science seems fairly fitting. We will assign a likelihood of \( 0.3 \) (30%).
3. **\( P(E|\neg H_{cs}) \)**: This is more complicated but assuming that other fields are not drastically different in contrasting Adam's traits, we might estimate this as \( 0.2 \) (20%).

### Business Administration

1. **\( P(H_{ba}) \)**: Similarly, given the popularity of business administration, a rough estimation might be around \( 0.15 \) (15%).
2. **\( P(E|H_{ba}) \)**: Adam's traits match less well with a business administration profile, which often prefers outgoing and high-energy personalities with strong social skills, so let's assign a likelihood of \( 0.1 \) (10%).
3. **\( P(E|\neg H_{ba}) \)**: Using the same logic as before, we might estimate this as \( 0.2 \) (20%).

Now letâ€™s compute the posterior probabilities:

#### For Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) \propto P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs}) \]
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) \propto 0.3 \cdot 0.15 \]
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) \propto 0.045 \]

#### For Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{ba}) \cdot P(H_{ba})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) \propto P(E|H_{ba}) \cdot P(H_{ba}) \]
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.15 \]
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) \propto 0.015 \]

Normalizing:
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) + P(H_{ba}|E) = 0.045 + 0.015 = 0.06 \]

So:
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.06} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{0.015}{0.06} = 0.25 \]

Using these proportions, the final values are:

{
  "computer science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.25
}
