To compute \( P(H|E) \), we will use Bayes' Rule, which is given as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For both fields (business administration and computer science), we need to estimate the following probabilities:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.

Since \( P(E) \) is a constant for both fields, we can simplify our comparison by focusing on the relative quantities of \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

Let's estimate these values:

1. **Business Administration (B)**
   - \( P(H)_{\text{B}} \): Assume the prior probability of being enrolled in business administration is relatively low for someone with Adam's profile.
   - \( P(E|H)_{\text{B}} \): Given Adam's strong appreciation for nature, empathy, curiosity about plants, love for animals, and solving puzzles, the probability of this sketch matching someone in business administration might be lower.
   - \( P(E|\neg H)_{\text{B}} \): The probability of observing this personality sketch given he is not in business administration is relatively higher because there are many other fields that align better with his characteristics.

2. **Computer Science (C)**
   - \( P(H)_{\text{C}} \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science can be considered higher due to his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts.
   - \( P(E|H)_{\text{C}} \): Given Adam's characteristics, this probability is moderate since the field involves solving puzzles and abstract thinking.
   - \( P(E|\neg H)_{\text{C}} \): The probability is lower, as his specific appreciation for nature and animals might not be perfectly aligned with this field, but itâ€™s still plausible.

Given these considerations, let's provide estimated values:

- For Business Administration:
  - \( P(H)_{\text{B}} \): 0.1
  - \( P(E|H)_{\text{B}} \): 0.1
  - \( P(E|\neg H)_{\text{B}} \): 0.3 (since other fields may be more likely)

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{B}} \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.01}{P(E)} \]

- For Computer Science:
  - \( P(H)_{\text{C}} \): 0.2
  - \( P(E|H)_{\text{C}} \): 0.3 (considering he enjoys solving puzzles and abstract thought)
  - \( P(E|\neg H)_{\text{C}} \): 0.2 (other fields might also match his characteristics)

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{C}} \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.06}{P(E)} \]

Now, comparing relative values, although \( P(E) \) is unknown, the ratios can tell us about their relative likelihoods.

So, our estimates are:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.01,
  "computer science": 0.06
}
```

These values are not absolute probabilities but relative likelihoods showing that Adam is more likely to be enrolled in computer science than in business administration given his personality sketch.
