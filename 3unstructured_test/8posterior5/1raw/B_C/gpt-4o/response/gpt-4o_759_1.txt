To apply Bayes' theorem, we will use the following standard notation:

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is not enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field given his personality sketch. 

In this context, we need to set some initial values to proceed with calculations. Note that exact values can be subjective without additional information, but Iâ€™ll provide reasonable assumptions based on typical distributions and relevance.

### Computer Science
#### Hypothesis H: Adam was enrolled in computer science.

1. **P(H):** Probability of being enrolled in computer science.
   - Let's assume \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.2 \) (a common major field for graduate students).

2. **P(E|H):** Probability of the personality sketch matching someone in computer science.
   - Adam's traits, such as high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles, fit well with computer science.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.6 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H):** Probability of the personality sketch matching someone not in computer science.
   - Let's assume this is lower as Adam's characteristics are quite aligned with computer science compared to other fields.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg \text{computer science}) = 0.3 \).

Now applying Bayes' rule:
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) + P(E|\neg \text{computer science}) \cdot P(\neg \text{computer science}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.6 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) = 0.12 + 0.24 = 0.36 \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{0.36} = \frac{0.12}{0.36} = 0.333 \]

### Business Administration
#### Hypothesis H: Adam was enrolled in business administration.

1. **P(H):** Probability of being enrolled in business administration.
   - Let's assume \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.15 \) (a common field but less so compared to computer science).

2. **P(E|H):** Probability of the personality sketch matching someone in business administration.
   - Adam's empathy and warm heart might fit with business administration roles focused on people management, but abstract problem-solving is less emphasized.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.3 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H):** Probability of the personality sketch matching someone not in business administration.
   - Considering attributes that are less specific to business administration.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) = 0.4 \).

Now applying Bayes' rule:
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) + P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) \cdot P(\neg \text{business administration}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.15) + (0.4 \cdot 0.85) = 0.045 + 0.34 = 0.385 \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.15}{0.385} = \frac{0.045}{0.385} \approx 0.117 \]

### Summary
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.333,
  "business administration": 0.117
}
```

This computation suggests that based on the given personality sketch, it is more likely that Adam was enrolled in computer science compared to business administration.
