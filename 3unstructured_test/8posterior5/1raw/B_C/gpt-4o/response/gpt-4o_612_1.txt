To address the problem, let's break it down step by step and then apply Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \).

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: This represents the general likelihood that Adam would be enrolled in each field before considering his personality sketch.

   - \( P(\text{computer science}) \)
   - \( P(\text{business administration}) \)

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he were enrolled in each specific field.

   - \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \): Given Adam's love for solving puzzles and his high intelligence, this seems moderately likely.
   - \( P(E|\text{business administration}) \): Given Adam's warm heart, empathy, and understanding of hard work and dedication, this seems less likely.

3. **Probability of Evidence given not the Hypothesis, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This represents the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch across all other fields he could be enrolled in.

4. **Posterior Probability \( P(H|E) \)**: This can be computed using Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Let's assign some reasonable values based on the given personality sketch:

### Computer Science:
1. **Prior (\(P(\text{computer science})\))**: Let's assume a moderate prior probability of 0.1 (since there are many other fields Adam could be in).
2. **Likelihood (\(P(E|\text{computer science})\))**: Given the personality traits such as love for solving puzzles and high intelligence, let's assign a value of 0.6.
3. **Probability of Evidence \(P(E|\neg \text{computer science})\)**: Since we don't have specific data for other fields, let's assume an average likelihood across all other fields, approximately 0.3.

Now calculate the posterior:
\[
P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.1}{(0.6 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9)} = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.27} = \frac{0.06}{0.33} \approx 0.1818
\]

### Business Administration:
1. **Prior (\(P(\text{business administration})\))**: Let's assume a reasonable prior probability of 0.1.
2. **Likelihood (\(P(E|\text{business administration})\))**: Given Adam's warm heart, empathy, and understanding of dedication, let's assign a value of 0.4.
3. **Probability of Evidence \(P(E|\neg \text{business administration})\)**: Using the same average likelihood across all other fields, approximately 0.3.

Now calculate the posterior:
\[
P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.1}{(0.4 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9)} = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.27} = \frac{0.04}{0.31} \approx 0.1290
\]

Following this framework, the results are:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.1818,
  "business administration": 0.1290
}
```
