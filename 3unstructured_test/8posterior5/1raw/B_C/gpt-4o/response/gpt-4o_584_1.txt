To structure the solution, we will break down the process step-by-step:

1. **Assessing Prior Probabilities, \(P(H)\):**
    - \(P(H_{CS})\): The probability that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science based on general graduate field distribution.
    - \(P(H_{BA})\): The probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration based on general graduate field distribution.

2. **Assessing Likelihoods, \(P(E|H)\):**
    - \(P(E|H_{CS})\): The probability of Adam having the described personality traits given he was in Computer Science.
    - \(P(E|H_{BA})\): The probability of Adam having the described personality traits given he was in Business Administration.

3. **Assessing Complementary Likelihoods, \(P(E|\neg H)\):**
    - This is trickier to assess without knowing the broad distribution of each field. However, as a simplification, I will approximate the complementary probabilities assuming an equal split among many graduate fields and some intuition about the match between personality and fields.

4. **Applying Bayes Rule:**
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
   
Given that \(P(E)\) is the same for both fields, it cancels out in a comparative analysis.

Here are some generalized, reasonable estimates based on common knowledge and the personality fit for the fields in question:

1. **For Computer Science (CS):**
    - \(P(H_{CS})\): Approximately 0.1 (as CS is a popular, yet specialized field in graduate studies).
    - \(P(E|H_{CS})\): Moderate, about 0.3, as intelligence and problem-solving match, but specific empathy and love for nature are less typical.
    - \(P(E|\neg H_{CS})\): Higher, about 0.7, since more humanities-oriented people fit this personality better.

2. **For Business Administration (BA):**
    - \(P(H_{BA})\): Approximately 0.1 (assuming a similar proportion of students to maintain simplification).
    - \(P(E|H_{BA})\): Lower, about 0.2, as nature curiosity isn't a typical alignment; however, empathy might be moderately relevant.
    - \(P(E|\neg H_{BA})\): Higher, about 0.8, given a personality fit is more common in non-business fields.

Now applying Bayes Rule relatively:

\[
P(H_{CS}|E) \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.3 \cdot 0.1 + 0.7 \cdot (1 - 0.1)} \approx 0.041
\]

\[
P(H_{BA}|E) \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.8 \cdot (1 - 0.1)} \approx 0.022
\]

Thus:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.041,
  "business administration": 0.022
}
```

Please note, these results depend heavily on assumed priors and likelihood approximations tailored to Adam's personality fit. More precise values would require empirical data.
