Sure, let's go through the reasoning process.

### Computer Science

- **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science. Without specific information about the distribution of graduate students across various fields, we might assume that computer science is reasonably popular, but not overwhelmingly so. Let's assign a modest P(H) = 0.2.
- **P(E|H):** The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is in computer science. Being highly intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts fits well with computer science. However, his love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles is not exclusively aligned with computer science. Let's assign P(E|H) = 0.4.
- **P(E|¬H):** The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in computer science. His traits are quite general and could fit many other fields, especially those involving nature or problem-solving. Let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.3.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))} 
\]
\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8} 
\]
\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.24} 
\]
\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.32} 
\]
\[ 
P(H|E) = 0.25 
\]

### Business Administration

- **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration. Business administration is also a reasonably popular field. Let's assign P(H) = 0.15.
- **P(E|H):** The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is in business administration. The field typically involves different traits, like strategic thinking and leadership. His love for nature, empathy, and solving puzzles does not strongly align with typical business administration traits. Let's assign P(E|H) = 0.2.
- **P(E|¬H):** The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in business administration. Again, these traits could fit many other fields. Let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.3.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))} 
\]
\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{0.2 \cdot 0.15 + 0.3 \cdot 0.85} 
\]
\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.255} 
\]
\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.285} 
\]
\[ 
P(H|E) = 0.105 
\]

Summarizing the results:

{
  "computer science": "0.25",
  "business administration": "0.105"
}
