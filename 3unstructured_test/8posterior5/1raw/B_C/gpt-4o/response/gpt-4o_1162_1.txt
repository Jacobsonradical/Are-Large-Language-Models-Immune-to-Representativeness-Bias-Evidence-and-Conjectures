To calculate the probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field, let's make some reasonable assumptions:

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in that field.

For simplicity, let's assume that:

1. The prior probability \( P(H) \) for each specific field is approximately equal, so we'll set \( P(H) = 0.1 \) (as we assume there are many possible fields Adam could be enrolled in, but not excessively many).
2. \( P(E|\neg H) \) can be approximated based on the general alignment of the personality sketch \( E \) to the general population. Given Adam's specific interests and traits, we might set \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.05 \).

Now let's evaluate \( P(E|H) \) for each field:

- **Computer Science**: 
  - Computer science would align with Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts. However, his deep love for nature, animals, and empathy might not be as directly associated with computer science.
  - Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) for computer science to be around 0.4.

- **Business Administration**: 
  - Business administration is less directly associated with strong empathy for animals and nature, and although intelligence and appreciation for hard work are relevant, it might not be a perfect fit.
  - Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) for business administration to be around 0.2.

Now, using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

For each field:

### Computer Science
1. \( P(H) = 0.1 \)
2. \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \)
3. \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.05 \)

\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.4 \cdot 0.1) + (0.05 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.045 = 0.085 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.1}{0.085} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.47 \]

### Business Administration
1. \( P(H) = 0.1 \)
2. \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \)
3. \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.05 \)

\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.05 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.045 = 0.065 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{0.065} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.31 \]

Thus, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.47,
  "business administration": 0.31
}
```
