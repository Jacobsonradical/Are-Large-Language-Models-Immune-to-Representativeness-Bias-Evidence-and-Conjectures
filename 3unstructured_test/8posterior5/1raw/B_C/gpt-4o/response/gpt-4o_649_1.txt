To calculate \( P(H|E) \) for Adam's likelihood of being enrolled in specific fields, we need to use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence (personality sketch) given that Adam is in that particular field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is not in that particular field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the evidence.

Given that there are multiple potential fields and limited specific data on prior probabilities, we must apply reasonable assumptions and heuristic reasoning about these probabilities:

### Computer Science
1. **P(H) for Computer Science**: Graduate fields like computer science are quite popular in the U.S. among highly intelligent students with a knack for solving puzzles.
  - Assume \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.2 \) (20%).

2. **P(E|H) for Computer Science**: Adam's personality sketch fits reasonably well with computer science students, who are often curious, good at solving puzzles, and intelligent.
  - Assume \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.5 \) (50%).

3. **P(E|\neg H) for Computer Science**: This is the probability of observing the given evidence when Adam is not a computer science student.
  - Assume \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.2 \) (20%).

### Business Administration
1. **P(H) for Business Administration**: Business administration is also a common field but not necessarily aligned with very high intelligence, love for nature, or solving puzzles.
  - Assume \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.15 \) (15%).

2. **P(E|H) for Business Administration**: Adam's personality doesn't strongly align with traditional business administration, which generally does not focus much on nature or puzzles.
  - Assume \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.2 \) (20%).

3. **P(E|\neg H) for Business Administration**: This is the probability of observing the given evidence when Adam is not a business administration student.
  - Assume \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.2 \) (20%).

By applying Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \times P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \times P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \]

Let's assume \( P(E) \) (the overall probability of observing the evidence given any field) is sufficiently normalized such that the relative comparison is meaningful.

Normalizing for simplicity:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) + \ldots \]

Relative probabilities:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto 0.5 \times 0.2 = 0.1 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \propto 0.2 \times 0.15 = 0.03 \]

Putting into context of comparison:
\[
\begin{equation}
{
  "computer science": \frac{0.1}{0.1 + 0.03} \approx 0.769,
  "business administration": \frac{0.03}{0.1 + 0.03} \approx 0.231
}
\end{equation}
\]

Thus we get:
\[
{
  "computer science": 0.769,
  "business administration": 0.231
}
\]
