To use Bayes' theorem to compute \( P(H|E) \), or the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch, we need to consider the following probabilities:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing E given that Adam was not enrolled in that specific field.

Bayes' theorem is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we don't have the exact values for these probabilities, so we will estimate them based on the personality sketch E and typical characteristics relevant to each field.

### Computer Science:
- **P(H)**: Computer Science is a common field of graduate study. Assuming no prior information about Adam's field, we can assign a moderate prior probability, say 0.2.
- **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and love for solving puzzles, it is likely he might be in Computer Science. This probability can be relatively high, say 0.6.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: This is the probability of observing E given Adam was not in Computer Science. Without accurate stats, let's assign a reasonable estimation of 0.5 (given that these traits can apply to multiple fields).

### Business Administration:
- **P(H)**: Business Administration is also quite common. Let's assign a prior probability of 0.2.
- **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's traits, it's less likely he pursued Business Administration. Traits such as curiosity about nature and love for animals don't strongly suggest a business focus. Estimate, say, 0.3.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: This will be similar to the probability used in the computer science case, 0.5.

Now, let's use these to compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field.

### Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields, it cancels out when comparing them:
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) \approx \frac{0.6 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.12}{P(E)} \]

### Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{BA}|E) \approx \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.06}{P(E)} \]

Finally, normalizing for comparison (not total probabilities summing to 1):
{
  "computer science": 0.12,
  "business administration": 0.06
}

Given this result, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science, given his personality sketch, is comparatively higher than the probability that he was enrolled in business administration.
