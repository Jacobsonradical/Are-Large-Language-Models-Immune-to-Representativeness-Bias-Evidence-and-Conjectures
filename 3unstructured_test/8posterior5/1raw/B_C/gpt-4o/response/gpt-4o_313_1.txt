To calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in a particular field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in that particular field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of Adam's personality sketch.

For the purpose of the problem, some qualitative assessments can be useful in determining these probabilities:

**Field: Business Administration**
1. **\( P(H) \)**: Business administration is a fairly common field for graduate students, so let's assume a general baseline probability.
\[ P(H_{\text{Business Administration}}) = 0.10 \]

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: The description suggests strong empathy and understanding of hard work, which might be somewhat relevant but not specifically aligned with business administration.
\[ P(E|H_{\text{Business Administration}}) = 0.20 \]

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch omitting business administration carries the remainder distribution of personality traits across all other possible fields.
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{Business Administration}}) = 0.10 \]

By using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E_{\text{Business Administration}}) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{Business Administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{Business Administration}})}{P(E)} \]

Although without the exact \( P(E) \), simplifying for proportionality:
\[ P(H|E_{\text{Business Administration}}) \propto P(E|H_{\text{Business Administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{Business Administration}}) = 0.20 \cdot 0.10 = 0.02 \]

**Field: Computer Science**
1. **\( P(H) \)**: Computer science is also a common field for graduate students.
\[ P(H_{\text{Computer Science}}) = 0.15 \]

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: The description aligns very well with computer science due to Adam's interest in puzzles, intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts.
\[ P(E|H_{\text{Computer Science}}) = 0.70 \]

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Similar to the previous field but the likelihood outside computer science context.
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{Computer Science}}) = 0.10 \]

Again, using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E_{\text{Computer Science}}) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{Computer Science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{Computer Science}})}{P(E)} \]

Similarly simplifying for proportionality:
\[ P(H|E_{\text{Computer Science}}) \propto P(E|H_{\text{Computer Science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{Computer Science}}) = 0.70 \cdot 0.15 = 0.105 \]

Therefore, given our rough estimates and proportional reasoning, the answers would be:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.105
}
```

These values (0.02 and 0.105) are approximate, and actual probability calculations would need more precise data regarding \( P(E) \).
