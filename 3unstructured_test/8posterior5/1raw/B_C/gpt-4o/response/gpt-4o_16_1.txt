Sure, let's evaluate the probabilities step by step using Bayes' rule. 

Given:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence E given that Adam was enrolled in this field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence E given that Adam was not enrolled in this field.
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in this field given the evidence E.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

### Hypothesis for Computer Science and Business Administration:

#### Computer Science

- **Prior Probability (P(H))**: Let's assume a prior based on common knowledge. The computer science field is popular among graduate students, particularly in the U.S. Let's estimate the prior \( P(H) \) at 0.1.
- **Likelihood (P(E|H))**: Adam demonstrates high intelligence and loves solving puzzles, both of which are typical traits for someone in computer science. Let's estimate this at 0.3.
- **Inverse Likelihood (P(E|\neg H))**: Considering the thousands of different fields, many others also require high intelligence and puzzle-solving skills, but not necessarily the whole set of attributes. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) at 0.05 because the specific combination of attributes (nature curiosity, empathy, quiet personality, etc.) is somewhat distinctive.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \]

\( P(E) \) is approximated but not directly given. For this exercise, let's normalize later if needed and focus on relative likelihoods.

#### Business Administration

- **Prior Probability (P(H))**: Business administration is also popular among graduate students, though it doesn't align as closely with the described attributes. Let's estimate the prior \( P(H) \) at 0.05.
- **Likelihood (P(E|H))**: The traits of empathy and appreciation for hard work fit, but high abstract concept understanding and puzzle thinking are less critical in typical business administration. Let's estimate this at 0.05.
- **Inverse Likelihood (P(E|\neg H))**: Many other fields share similar non-specific traits (empathy, appreciation for hard work) but do not align strongly with those attributes. Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) at 0.07 for broader distribution.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.05}{P(E)} \]

### Relative Posterior Probabilities (Ignoring \( P(E) \) for Consistency)

1. Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.3 \times 0.1 = 0.03 \]

2. Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.05 \times 0.05 = 0.0025 \]

### Proportional Comparison

Let's scale them appropriately to fit a simplified context.

{
  "computer science": "0.03",
  "business administration": "0.0025"
}

This gives us a sense that, given the profile, Adam is much more likely to be in computer science compared to business administration. Note that these values are not normalized but provide relative comparison values.
