To calculate the probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration or computer science given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's go through the three steps first for each field: estimate P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|\neg H) then compute P(H|E).

### Field: Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: The base rate probability that a randomly selected graduate student is enrolled in business administration. Let's assume this is a common field but not overwhelmingly so.
   - Estimate: 0.10

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is in business administration. Given Adam's love for nature, animals, and puzzles, it doesn't strongly fit the typical profile one might associate with business administration.
   - Estimate: 0.05

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is in a field other than business administration. Given Adam's personality traits, fields related to natural sciences, biology, or other related specific areas might be more likely. However, he may still be in a different field that's not a perfect fit but somewhat plausible.
   - Estimate: 0.15

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Let's calculate:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.10}{0.05 \times 0.10 + 0.15 \times 0.90} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.135} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.14} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.036 \]

### Field: Computer Science

1. **P(H)**: The base rate probability that a randomly selected graduate student is enrolled in computer science. This is a highly popular field.
   - Estimate: 0.20

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is in computer science. Adam's affinity for solving puzzles and strong intelligence may fit well with computer science.
   - Estimate: 0.30

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is in a field other than computer science. There are likely other fields that also match his description well.
   - Estimate: 0.20

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Let's calculate:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.30 \times 0.20}{0.30 \times 0.20 + 0.20 \times 0.80} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.16} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.22} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.273 \]

So, given the personality sketch, the updated probabilities that Adam is enrolled in either business administration or computer science are as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.036,
  "computer science": 0.273
}
```
