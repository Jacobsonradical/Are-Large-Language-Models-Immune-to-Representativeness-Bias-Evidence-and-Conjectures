To assess the likelihood that Adam was enrolled in a particular field based on the given personality sketch (E) and available hypotheses (H), we can use Bayesian inference.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's consider the fields:
1. Computer Science
2. Business Administration

#### Step-by-step Calculation

1. **Define Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
    - This is the initial probability we assign to Adam being enrolled in each field before considering the personality sketch.

2. **Define Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
    - This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he were enrolled in the given field.

3. **Define Complementary Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
    - This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he were not enrolled in the given field.

4. **Bayesian Calculation \( P(H|E) \)**:
    - Apply Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior probability.

### Assumptions:
- Choose prior probabilities \( P(H) \) based on rough graduate enrollment in these fields.
  - Assume \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.2 \)
  - Assume \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.15 \)
    - (\( P(\neg H) \) would then be 0.8 and 0.85 respectively, considering these fields are not exhaustive.)

### Likelihood considerations:
- For **computer science**:
  - Adam is of high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts, which aligns well.
  - However, the strong empathy and love for animals might not be as typical, but not entirely exclusive.

- For **business administration**:
  - His warm heart, empathy, and appreciation for hard work might fit.
  - However, the genuine curiosity about nature and love for animals may be less aligned.

Assumption of Likelihoods:
- Let \( P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.6 \)
- Let \( P(E|\neg \text{computer science}) = 0.4 \)
- Let \( P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.4 \)
- Let \( P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) = 0.5 \)

### Calculation:

#### Computer Science:
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{(0.6 \cdot 0.2) + (0.4 \cdot 0.8)} \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.32} \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.44} \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = 0.2727 \]

#### Business Administration:
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.15}{(0.4 \cdot 0.15) + (0.5 \cdot 0.85)} \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.425} \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.485} \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = 0.1237 \]

{
  "computer science": 0.2727,
  "business administration": 0.1237
}
```

These values indicate the computed probabilities based on the given personality sketch and Bayesian analysis.
