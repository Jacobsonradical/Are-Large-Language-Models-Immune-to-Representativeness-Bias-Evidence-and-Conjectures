To calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where \( P(E) \) can be derived from:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For simplicity, let's assume \( P(H) \) (the prior probability that Adam could be enrolled in either computer science or business administration) is the same for both fields (we often start with an equal prior when no specific prior information is given). Also, \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) \). 

Let's assign some estimates based on the personality sketch and the typical alignment of those qualities with each field. 

### Hypothetical Estimates for Computer Science (H1)
1. \( P(H1) = 0.1 \): Prior probability that Adam is a computer science graduate student.
2. \( P(E|H1) = 0.7 \): Probability that a computer science student has Adam's characteristics.
3. \( P(E|\neg H1) = 0.3 \): Probability that someone who is not a computer science student has Adam's characteristics.

### Hypothetical Estimates for Business Administration (H2)
1. \( P(H2) = 0.1 \): Prior probability that Adam is a business administration graduate student.
2. \( P(E|H2) = 0.2 \): Probability that a business administration student has Adam's characteristics.
3. \( P(E|\neg H2) = 0.5 \): Probability that someone who is not a business administration student has Adam's characteristics.

Now, we'll compute \( P(H|E) \) for both fields.

### For Computer Science
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1) + P(E|\neg H1) \cdot P(\neg H1) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.7 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9 = 0.07 + 0.27 = 0.34 \]

So,
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.34} \approx 0.2059 \]

### For Business Administration
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2) + P(E|\neg H2) \cdot P(\neg H2) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.5 \cdot 0.9 = 0.02 + 0.45 = 0.47 \]

So,
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.47} \approx 0.0426 \]

### Final Results
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2059,
  "business administration": 0.0426
}
```

Please note these values are hypothetical estimates based on typical trends and the given personality sketch, and actual values would require more precise data.
