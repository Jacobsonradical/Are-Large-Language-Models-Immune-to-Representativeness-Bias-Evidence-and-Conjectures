To compute \( P(H|E) \) - the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field (H) based on his personality sketch (E) - using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is not enrolled in that field.
4. \( P(E) \): Overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is constant for all fields and doesn't change the relative comparison, we'll focus on calculating the numerator \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

### Assumptions:
- Let's assume that \( P(H) \) (the prior probabilities) for Adam being enrolled in Business Administration or Computer Science are relatively moderate and equal due to lack of specific information. For simplicity, we can set them both to 0.1 (this can be adjusted based on more specific data).
- \( P(E|H) \) reflects how well Adamâ€™s personality sketch matches the typical profile for a particular field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) reflects the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch across all other fields outside of the specified one.

Given Adam's characteristics such as curiosity about nature, empathy, and intelligence, certain fields might align better than others. Let's proceed with the calculations:

#### Business Administration
- \( P(H_{\text{business}}) = 0.1 \): Moderate chance.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \): Adam's personality traits don't strongly align with the stereotypical traits for business administration. Let's estimate this to be low, around 0.2.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}}) \): Higher than within business, say 0.8.

\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}}) = 0.2 \cdot 0.1 = 0.02 \]

#### Computer Science
- \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.1 \): Moderate chance.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \): Adam's intelligence, puzzle-solving ability, and understanding of abstract concepts align well with computer science. Estimate this to be high, around 0.7.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}}) \): Lower than within computer science, say 0.3.

\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.7 \cdot 0.1 = 0.07 \]

### Normalizing the Probabilities
Given that the \(\propto\) sign indicates that we are not yet working with probabilities that sum to 1, normalization will be necessary if comparing across multiple hypotheses.

However, since the prompt specifies the absolute posterior probabilities need not add up to 1 in the context (likely for simplicity), we will present the values without normalization:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.07
}
```

Hence, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science based on the given personality sketch is higher compared to business administration.
