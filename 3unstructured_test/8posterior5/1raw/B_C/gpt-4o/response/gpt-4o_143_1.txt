Given the description of Adam and the fields considered, we'll make some educated guesses about the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the complements \( P(E|\neg H) \). Then, we'll use these to calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule for the two fields:

1. **Computer Science**
2. **Business Administration**

### Computer Science

**Prior Probability ( \( P(H) \) ):**
Let's assume that there's a moderate chance Adam could be in computer science:

\( P(H) = 0.3 \)

**Likelihood of E given H ( \( P(E|H) \) ):**
Given Adam’s attributes like high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles, these attributes align well with someone in computer science.

\( P(E|H) \approx 0.7 \)

**Likelihood of E given not H ( \( P(E|\neg H) \) ):**
Adam’s attributes could also align with other fields, but possibly to a lesser extent.

\( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \)

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.3}{0.7 \cdot 0.3 + 0.4 \cdot 0.7} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.21}{0.21 + 0.28} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.21}{0.49} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.429 \]

### Business Administration

**Prior Probability ( \( P(H) \) ):**
Let's assume a lower prior for Business Administration based on Adam's personality. Although this is subjective, it seems less aligned with his attributes:

\( P(H) = 0.1 \)

**Likelihood of E given H ( \( P(E|H) \) ):**
The likelihood is lower given his traits, which do not strongly align with business administration:

\( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \)

**Likelihood of E given not H ( \( P(E|\neg H) \) ):**

\( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \)

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.3 \cdot 0.1 + 0.5 \cdot 0.9} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.45} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.03}{0.48} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.063 \]

### Results

{
  "computer science": 0.429,
  "business administration": 0.063
}

Note: These calculations rely heavily on subjective estimates for the priors and likelihoods, given the limited information provided. Adjusting those inputs could yield different posterior probabilities.
