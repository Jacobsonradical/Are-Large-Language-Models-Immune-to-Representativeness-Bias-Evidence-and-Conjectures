To calculate \( P(H|E) \) (the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch), we can use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the given personality sketch if Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the given personality sketch if Adam is not enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the given personality sketch.

Since we are looking at two specific fields, we can compare the probabilities for each, keeping in mind that the total does not need to add up to 1.

Let's assess the probabilities for each field based on the provided information:

### 1. Computer Science

- **P(H)**: Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Computer Science. This is generally dependent on the proportion of students in Computer Science among all graduate fields. For estimation purposes, let's assume \( P(\text{Computer Science}) = 0.2 \) (since Computer Science is a common graduate field).

- **P(E|H)**: Likelihood of observing the given personality sketch if Adam is enrolled in Computer Science. Given that Adam is good at solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, which aligns well with characteristics valuable in Computer Science, let's estimate \( P(E|\text{Computer Science}) = 0.7 \).

- **P(E|\neg H)**: Likelihood of observing the given personality sketch if Adam is not enrolled in Computer Science. This would include all other fields, some of which may also value similar traits. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg \text{Computer Science}) = 0.3 \).

### 2. Business Administration

- **P(H)**: Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration. For estimation, let's assume \( P(\text{Business Administration}) = 0.1 \) (assuming it is less common among graduate students compared to fields like Computer Science).

- **P(E|H)**: Likelihood of observing the given personality sketch if Adam is enrolled in Business Administration. While business fields may value empathy and a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work, they might not as strongly align with his interest in nature and solving puzzles. Let's estimate \( P(E|\text{Business Administration}) = 0.4 \).

- **P(E|\neg H)**: Likelihood of observing the given personality sketch if Adam is not enrolled in Business Administration. This includes all other fields. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg \text{Business Administration}) = 0.3 \).

We do not have specific values for \( P(E) \), but for comparison purposes, we can derive:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Now we compute:

### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.7 \cdot 0.2 = 0.14 \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.4 \cdot 0.1 = 0.04 \]

Finally, normalizing these within the context of our given fields (although exact total probability is not necessary):

{
  "computer science": 0.14 / (0.14 + 0.04) ≈ 0.78,
  "business administration": 0.04 / (0.14 + 0.04) ≈ 0.22
