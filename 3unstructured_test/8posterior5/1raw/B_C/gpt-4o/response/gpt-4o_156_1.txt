To solve this problem using Bayes' rule, we need to determine the following probabilities for each field:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field, without any additional information about his personality sketch.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in the given field.
4. **P(H|E)**: The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field given his personality sketch, which we compute using Bayes' rule.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given:
- **P(H):** Initial assumption about the field's probability without additional information.
- **P(E|H):** The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he was in that field.
- **P(E|¬H):** The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he was not in that field.

For simplicity, let's assume the following broad estimates for the fields:

### Business Administration:
1. **P(H):** Low/Medium, since there's a diverse range of graduate fields and business administration is quite specific.
2. **P(E|H):** Low/Medium, as business administration typically doesn't align strongly with a deep curiosity about nature and plants, or empathy and love for animals.
3. **P(E|¬H):** We objectly need to marginalize over all non-business administration fields, but since it's broader and has more overlap with Adam's personality, it may be higher than **P(E|H)**.

### Computer Science:
1. **P(H):** Medium/High, computer science is a popular graduate field.
2. **P(E|H):** Medium, since problem-solving and understanding abstract concepts align well with this field.
3. **P(E|¬H):** Given how numerous non-computer science fields are, **P(E|¬H)** may be similar or higher.

Based on these qualitative assessments, we might assume:

1. Business Administration:
   - \( P(H) = 0.1 \)
   - \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \)
   - \( P(E|¬H) = 0.5 \) (assuming multiple non-specific fields)

2. Computer Science:
   - \( P(H) = 0.3 \)
   - \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \)
   - \( P(E|¬H) = 0.4 \)

### Computing Bayes' Posterior:
Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
We approximate \( P(E) \approx P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \).

For simplicity, assume **P(E)** can be omitted for relative comparisons between the fields.

#### Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \]

#### Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.3}{P(E)} \]

Therefore, the relative estimates for Bayesian probabilities may look like:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.01,
  "computer science": 0.09
}
```

These values reflect the relatively higher likelihood that Adam's personality sketch aligns with a field where abstract thinking and problem-solving are more prominently valued, such as computer science.
