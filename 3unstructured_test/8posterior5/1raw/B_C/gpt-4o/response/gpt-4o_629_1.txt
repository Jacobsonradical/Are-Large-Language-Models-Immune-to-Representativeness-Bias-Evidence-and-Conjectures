To determine \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study using Bayes' rule, we use the equation:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here's the step-by-step process for "computer science" and "business administration":

1. **Computer Science**:
   - **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Assuming a general distribution among graduate students, let's say there's a moderate probability Adam would be in Computer Science.
     \[ P(\text{Computer Science}) = 0.2 \]
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's strong intelligence, abstract thinking, and problem-solving abilities fit well with a Computer Science profile.
     \[ P(E|\text{Computer Science}) = 0.7 \]
   - **Likelihood of E given not H \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Considering multiple other fields, the probability that Adam's personality fits them evenly.
     \[ P(E|\neg \text{Computer Science}) = 0.3 \]

2. **Business Administration**:
   - **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Assuming a general distribution among graduate students, let's say there's a moderate probability Adam would be in Business Administration.
     \[ P(\text{Business Administration}) = 0.1 \]
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adamâ€™s profile is less associated with typical business administration traits.
     \[ P(E|\text{Business Administration}) = 0.2 \]
   - **Likelihood of E given not H \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Considering multiple other fields, the probability that Adam's personality fits them evenly.
     \[ P(E|\neg \text{Business Administration}) = 0.3 \]

By Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assuming for simplicity that \( P(E) \) is the same for every field comparison,

For **Computer Science**:
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.7 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot (1-0.2)} \]

For **Business Administration**:
\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot (1-0.1)} \]

Now calculating these:

\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.14}{0.14 + 0.24} = \frac{0.14}{0.38} \approx 0.368 \]

\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.27} = \frac{0.02}{0.29} \approx 0.069 \]

Thus, the probabilities are: 

\[ 
{
  "computer science": 0.368,
  "business administration": 0.069
} 
\]
