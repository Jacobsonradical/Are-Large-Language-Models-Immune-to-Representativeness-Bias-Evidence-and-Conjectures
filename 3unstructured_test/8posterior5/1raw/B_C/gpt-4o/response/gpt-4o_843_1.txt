Let's break down the probabilities needed to apply Bayes' theorem:

Bayes' theorem is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam having the described personality sketch given that he was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of Adam having the described personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the personality sketch of Adam (which can be split into the weighted sum of \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \)).

Since we do not have specific numerical data, we will make some educated guesses based on qualitative reasoning to assess these probabilities.

### Computer Science

**Prior Probability \( P(H) \) for Computer Science**:
Let's assume that the base rate of being in a computer science graduate program among all graduate fields is moderate:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.2 \]

**Likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for Computer Science**:
Given the personality sketch, particularly Adam's intelligence, curiosity in nature and puzzles, and problem-solving abilities, it seems moderately likely for computer science:
\[ P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.5 \]

**Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \) for non-Computer Science**:
For non-computer science fields where we don't have those specific trait alignments, this might be lower. Let's assume a rough average considering various other fields:
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.3 \]

### Business Administration

**Prior Probability \( P(H) \) for Business Administration**:
Assume it is slightly lower since traits like empathy and a warm heart might not be as emphasized in business fields as they are in others:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1 \]

**Likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for Business Administration**:
The traits given (such as a strong curiosity about nature, animals, puzzles) are less likely to be aligned with a business administration student's typical traits. These traits seem less relevant:
\[ P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.2 \]

**Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \) for non-Business Administration**:
Still assuming the base rate from other fields, particularly non-business ones, is moderately probable:
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.4 \]

To apply Bayes' theorem, we need to calculate the posterior probabilities. We assume \( P(E) \) to be a weighted average of the probabilities across all hypotheses but simplify our calculations per field assumption inferred from \(\neg H\) assessments.

#### Computer Science:

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{(0.5 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8)} \approx \frac{0.1}{0.1 + 0.24} \approx \frac{0.1}{0.34} \approx 0.294 \]

#### Business Administration:

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{(0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.4 \cdot 0.9)} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.36} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.38} \approx 0.052 \]

So, we have (approximately):

{
  "computer science": 0.294,
  "business administration": 0.052
}
