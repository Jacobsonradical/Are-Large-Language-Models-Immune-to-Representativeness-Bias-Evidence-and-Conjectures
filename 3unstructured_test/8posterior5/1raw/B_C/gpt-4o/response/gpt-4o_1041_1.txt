To compute the probabilities, let's consider the following steps using Bayes' theorem:

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

### 1. Business Administration

- **P(H):** Probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
  Let's assume a prior probability of 5% (0.05) since business administration is a common but not overwhelming graduate field.

- **P(E|H):** Probability of E given H (business administration).
  Given Adam's profile, it seems less likely than average for a business administration student to share those traits:
  - Genuine curiosity about nature and plants: Not specifically related to business administration.
  - Quiet, enjoys solving puzzles: Not particularly relevant or common in this field.
  - Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals: Again, not particularly aligned with business administration.
  - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: More relevant, but still not strongly indicative.

  Let's estimate this probability as 0.2.

- **P(E|¬H):** Probability of E given ¬H (any other field).
  Given that many fields could match his traits, let's assume a higher probability. Let's estimate this as 0.6.

Now we use these estimates to calculate \( P(H|E) \) for business administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant and we only need relative values, we can simplify this to:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H)\]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.05 = 0.01\]

### 2. Computer Science

- **P(H):** Probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
  Given its popularity, let's assume a prior probability of 15% (0.15).

- **P(E|H):** Probability of E given H (computer science).
  Given Adam's profile, it seems more likely for a computer science student:
  - Genuine curiosity about nature and plants: More likely aligned with fields like data science, bioinformatics, or environmental modeling in computer science.
  - Quiet, enjoys solving puzzles: Strongly aligned with computer science.
  - Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals: While not specifically relevant, not contradictory either.
  - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts: Strongly aligned.

  Let's estimate this probability as 0.7.

- **P(E|¬H):** Probability of E given ¬H (any other field).
  As before, we estimate it as 0.6.

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = 0.7 \cdot 0.15 = 0.105 \]

### Normalized Results:

Let's find a normalized probability for relative comparison:

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = 0.01 \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = 0.105 \]

Now let's normalize these to sum to 1:

Total = \(0.01 + 0.105 = 0.115\)

Normalized \(P(H|E)\) values:
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.115} = 0.087\]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.105}{0.115} = 0.913\]

Final probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.087,
  "computer science": 0.913
}
