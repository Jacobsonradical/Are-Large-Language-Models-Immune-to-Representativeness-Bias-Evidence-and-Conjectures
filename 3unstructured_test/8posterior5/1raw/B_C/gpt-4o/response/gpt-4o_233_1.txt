To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in either Business Administration or Computer Science given his personality sketch, we'll need to make some educated guesses about the base rates and likelihoods. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **P(H)**: Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field, without any additional information.
2. **P(E|H)**: Probability of observing Adam's personality traits given he is enrolled in that field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability of observing Adam's personality traits given he is not enrolled in that field.
4. **P(E)**: Probability of observing Adam's personality traits regardless of the field of study.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplification, we will assume certain values based on general knowledge and context.

### Business Administration

P(H₁): Prior probability of enrolling in Business Administration. Let's assume it to be around 15%.
P(E|H₁): Given Adam's personality, the likelihood of enrolling in Business Administration is low because it typically attracts more extroverted and business-oriented individuals. Let's assume this to be 0.1.
P(E|\neg H₁): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch in the population not in Business Administration. Let's assume it to be 0.2.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H₁|E) = \frac{P(E|H₁) \cdot P(H₁)}{(P(E|H₁) \cdot P(H₁) + P(E|\neg H₁) \cdot P(\neg H₁))} \]
\[ P(H₁|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{(0.1 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85)} \]
\[ P(H₁|E) = \frac{0.015}{(0.015 + 0.17)} \]
\[ P(H₁|E) = \frac{0.015}{0.185} \]
\[ P(H₁|E) ≈ 0.081 \]

### Computer Science

P(H₂): Prior probability of enrolling in Computer Science. Let's assume it to be around 20%.
P(E|H₂): Given Adam's traits, the likelihood of being enrolled in Computer Science is moderate, as the field often attracts individuals who enjoy solving puzzles and have strong abstract thinking abilities. Let's assume this to be 0.5.
P(E|\neg H₂): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch in the population not in Computer Science. Let's assume it to be 0.2.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H₂|E) = \frac{P(E|H₂) \cdot P(H₂)}{(P(E|H₂) \cdot P(H₂) + P(E|\neg H₂) \cdot P(\neg H₂))} \]
\[ P(H₂|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.20}{(0.5 \cdot 0.20 + 0.2 \cdot 0.80)} \]
\[ P(H₂|E) = \frac{0.1}{(0.1 + 0.16)} \]
\[ P(H₂|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H₂|E) ≈ 0.385 \]

So, the posterior probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either Business Administration or Computer Science given his personality sketch are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.081,
  "computer science": 0.385
}
```
