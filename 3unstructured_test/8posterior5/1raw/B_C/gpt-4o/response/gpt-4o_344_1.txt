Let's start with estimating the probabilities for business administration and computer science based on Adam's personality sketch and compute the conditional probabilities using Bayes' rule.

### Business Administration

- **P(H\_BA):** Probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration. Since business administration is a common field and many students enroll in it, let's assume a moderate prior probability.
  - Let's estimate P(H\_BA) = 0.15

- **P(E|H\_BA):** Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in business administration. While empathy and understanding of hard work can align with business administration, the strong curiosity about nature, puzzles, and love for animals might not be a perfect fit.
  - Let's estimate P(E|H\_BA) = 0.2

- **P(E|\neg H\_BA):** Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in business administration. Since there are several fields that could better match Adam's personality, this probability could be relatively high.
  - Let's estimate P(E|\neg H\_BA) = 0.7

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H\_BA|E) = \frac{P(E|H\_BA) \cdot P(H\_BA)}{P(E|H\_BA) \cdot P(H\_BA) + P(E|\neg H\_BA) \cdot P(\neg H\_BA)} \]
\[ P(H\_BA|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{0.2 \cdot 0.15 + 0.7 \cdot 0.85} \]
\[ P(H\_BA|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.595} \]
\[ P(H\_BA|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.625} \]
\[ P(H\_BA|E) \approx 0.048 \] 

### Computer Science

- **P(H\_CS):** Probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science. Computer science is also a common graduate field with high enrollment, so we will assume a moderate prior probability.
  - Let's estimate P(H\_CS) = 0.15

- **P(E|H\_CS):** Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in computer science. Adam's interest in puzzles and high intelligence make computer science a potentially good fit.
  - Let's estimate P(E|H\_CS) = 0.6

- **P(E|\neg H\_CS):** Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in computer science. Given his strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature, his profile seems slightly less aligned with computer science, so this probability would be lower than our prior estimate.
  - Let's estimate P(E|\neg H\_CS) = 0.4

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H\_CS|E) = \frac{P(E|H\_CS) \cdot P(H\_CS)}{P(E|H\_CS) \cdot P(H\_CS) + P(E|\neg H\_CS) \cdot P(\neg H\_CS)} \]
\[ P(H\_CS|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.15}{0.6 \cdot 0.15 + 0.4 \cdot 0.85} \]
\[ P(H\_CS|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.34} \]
\[ P(H\_CS|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.43} \]
\[ P(H\_CS|E) \approx 0.209 \]

Here are the final results:

{
  "business administration": 0.048,
  "computer science": 0.209
