To determine the probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in a particular graduate field given the personality sketch \( E \), we need to use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll assess the probability for each hypothesis \( H \):
1. Business Administration
2. Computer Science

**Step-by-step calculation:**

### 1. Business Administration

#### Prior Probability: \( P(H) \)
The prior probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in Business Administration. Assume a standard prior if not given; let's set this to 0.2 (20%).

#### Likelihood: \( P(E|H) \)
This is the probability of Adam having the personality sketch \( E \), given he is in Business Administration.
- Curiosity about nature and various plants: Low relevance
- Quiet, enjoys solving puzzles: Neutral
- Warm heart, empathy, love for animals: Neutral to low relevance, as Business Administration is typically more people-oriented and task-driven.
- High intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts: Present but not unique to Business Administration
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication: Relevant in many fields

Let's say \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \) (10%).

#### Complement Likelihood: \( P(E|\neg H) \)
This is the probability of Adam having the personality sketch \( E \) given he is not in Business Administration.
Since he can be in many other fields, assume it to be slightly higher. Assume this as 0.15 (15%).

### 2. Computer Science

#### Prior Probability: \( P(H) \)
The prior probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in Computer Science. Assume this as 0.3 (30%).

#### Likelihood: \( P(E|H) \)
- Curiosity about nature and various plants: Neutral relevance
- Quiet, enjoys solving puzzles: High relevance
- Warm heart, empathy, love for animals: Neutral to low relevance for the discipline, although beneficial.
- High intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts: High relevance
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication: Relevant in Computer Science

Let's say \( P(E|H) = 0.6 \) (60%).

#### Complement Likelihood: \( P(E|\neg H) \)
This is the probability of Adam having the personality sketch \( E \) given he is not in Computer Science.
Assume this as 0.15 (15%).

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:

### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.15 \cdot 0.8} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.12} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.14} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.143 \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.3}{0.6 \cdot 0.3 + 0.15 \cdot 0.7} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.18}{0.18 + 0.105} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.18}{0.285} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.632 \]

Thus, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.143,
  "computer science": 0.632
}
```
