To address this problem, we need to estimate the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field (business administration or computer science).
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \), given that Adam is in a particular field \( H \).
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \), given that Adam is not in a particular field \( \neg H \).

Given these probabilities, we use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

We will assume the following for each field:

### Business Administration (BA)

1. **P(H for Business Administration)**:
   Graduate students in business administration programs are somewhat common, but not as common as some other fields like computer science.
   \[ P(H_{BA}) = 0.1 \]

2. **P(E|H for Business Administration)**:
   Business administration students may have strong empathy and appreciation for hard work, but not necessarily a strong curiosity about nature or solving puzzles.
   \[ P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.2 \]

3. **P(E|\neg H for Business Administration)**:
   This is the probability that someone not in business administration has similar traits. Given the diverse traits, it might be reasonably high.
   \[ P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.5 \]

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.1 = 0.02 \]

### Computer Science (CS)

1. **P(H for Computer Science)**:
   Computer science is a very common field for graduate students.
   \[ P(H_{CS}) = 0.3 \]

2. **P(E|H for Computer Science)**:
   Computer science students often enjoy solving puzzles and have a high intelligence quotient. Curiosity about nature and empathy are less common traits, but not out of the question.
   \[ P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.4 \]

3. **P(E|\neg H for Computer Science)**:
   The probability that someone not in computer science has these traits. Given the diverse fields available, this could be moderately high.
   \[ P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.6 \]

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto 0.4 \cdot 0.3 = 0.12 \]

### Final Probabilities

We need to normalize these probabilities so that the total adds up to 1 for these two fields:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) + P(H_{CS}|E) \propto 0.02 + 0.12 = 0.14 \]

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.14} \approx 0.143 \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.14} \approx 0.857 \]

Thus, the approximate probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.143,
  "computer science": 0.857
}
