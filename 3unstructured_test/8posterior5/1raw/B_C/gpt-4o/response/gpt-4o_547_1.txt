To find the probability P(H|E) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to assess the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field, the likelihood of the personality sketch given that he is enrolled in each field, and the likelihood of the personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in each field.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to approximate:
1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch of Adam given that he is enrolled in the given field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch of Adam given that he is not enrolled in the given field.

We also assume that \( P(E) \), the overall likelihood of the personality sketch, is the same for both fields since it's common to both and would cancel out in the relative comparison.

### Computer Science:
1. **P(H)**: Considering computer science is a common field for graduate students, we might estimate \( P(H) \) around 0.15 (15%).
2. **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving skills, he seems suitable for computer science. Hence, \( P(E|H) \) might be around 0.7 (70%).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Adam's characteristics are not exclusive to computer science and might appear in other fields, so we might estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) around 0.2 (20%).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.15}{0.2} \approx 0.525 \]

### Business Administration:
1. **P(H)**: Business administration is also a common field for graduate students, so we might estimate \( P(H) \) around 0.1 (10%).
2. **P(E|H)**: Adam's personality sketch with his traits like empathy, warm heart, and appreciation for dedication might fit business administration, but perhaps less perfectly than computer science. Hence, \( P(E|H) \) might be around 0.4 (40%).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Again, these traits are not exclusive to business administration, so we might keep \( P(E|\neg H) \) around 0.2 (20%).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.1}{0.2} \approx 0.2 \]

The estimates in the provided format are as follows:

{
  "computer science": 0.525,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
