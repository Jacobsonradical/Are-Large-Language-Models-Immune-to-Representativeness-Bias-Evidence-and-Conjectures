To evaluate \(P(H|E)\) for each field (business administration and computer science) using Bayes' rule, we need to determine the following probabilities:

1. \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the field.
2. \(P(E|H)\): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in the field.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in the field.

We use Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \(P(E)\) is constant across all hypotheses, we can instead compute the relative likelihoods up to a proportional constant:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Let's make some assumptions and rough estimations to assign these probabilities:

### Assumptions
1. **Prior Probabilities** (\(P(H)\)):
   - Business Administration is a very common graduate field but may not be particularly appealing to someone with Adam's interests and characteristics. Let's assume: \(P(H)_{\text{BA}} \approx 0.2\).
   - Computer Science is also a common field and aligns well with Adam's intelligence, puzzle-solving enjoyment, and abstract conceptual understanding. Let's assume: \(P(H)_{\text{CS}} \approx 0.25\).

2. **Likelihoods** (\(P(E|H)\)):
   - Business Administration: Adam's personality does not strongly align with the typical traits of business administration students, so let's estimate: \(P(E|H)_{\text{BA}} \approx 0.1\).
   - Computer Science: Adam's traits align quite well with typical traits in computer science, such as intelligence, puzzle-solving, and abstract thinking. Let's estimate: \(P(E|H)_{\text{CS}} \approx 0.4\).

3. **Complementary Likelihoods** (\(P(E|\neg H)\)):
   - This is more challenging but let's assume a constant average value across a variety of other fields (arbitrary value for demonstration).

Given these assumptions, we calculate the normalized posterior probabilities:

### Bayes' Calculation

For business administration:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

For computer science:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.4 \cdot 0.25 = 0.1 \]

### Normalization (if needed)
We could normalize these values, but since the question states we don't need the total to add up to 1 (as there are other fields), we'll just report them as is.

### Result
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.1
}
```

These values suggest that, based on the given personality sketch \(E\), it is more likely (given our rough assumptions and estimations) that Adam is enrolled in computer science rather than business administration.
