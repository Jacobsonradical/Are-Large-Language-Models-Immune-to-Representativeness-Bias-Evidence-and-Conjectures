To calculate the probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the probability of the evidence \( P(E) \) for each field.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) will be a constant across all fields (and considering other fields of specialization), we will express the results in relative terms, omitting the denominator \( P(E) \). This will allow us to compare the relative values of \( P(H|E) \).

### Computer Science

- **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being in the computer science field can be reasonably assumed, let's give it a moderate prior:
  \[ P(H) \approx 0.3 \]

- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam's characteristics given that he is in computer science. Adam's appreciation for nature, love for animals, and solving puzzles might align somewhat with computer science, but it's less common for this field to be heavily focused on nature and animals. We'll give this a moderate likelihood:
  \[ P(E|H) \approx 0.4 \]

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of Adam's characteristics given that he is not in computer science. This should include other fields that might fit better with his interests:
  \[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.7 \]

### Business Administration

- **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being in the business administration field. Since business administration typically deals with enterprise management and might involve work that is less related to nature or animals, we'll give this a lower prior:
  \[ P(H) \approx 0.1 \]

- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam's characteristics given that he is in business administration. It seems less aligned with his love for nature and animals:
  \[ P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \]

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of Adam's characteristics given that he is not in business administration.
  \[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.8 \]

Now, let's calculate:

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \approx 0.4 \cdot 0.3 = 0.12 \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \approx 0.2 \cdot 0.1 = 0.02 \]

Normalizing these (keeping \( P(E) \) constant for comparative purposes), we get:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.12,
  "business administration": 0.02
}
```

These relative probabilities suggest that, given the personality sketch of Adam, it is more likely he was enrolled in computer science rather than business administration.
