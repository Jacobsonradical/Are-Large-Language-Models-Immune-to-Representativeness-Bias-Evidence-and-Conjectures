To determine the likelihood \(P(H|E)\) for each field of study that Adam might have been enrolled in, we need to use Bayes' Rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch, which can be simplified using \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Given that there are other possible graduate fields, \( P(\neg H) \) will involve considering the other fields collectively. Here are the steps to estimate each component:

### Computer Science
1. **\( P(H)_{CS} \)**: Assume the prior probability \((P(H)_{CS})\) for Adam being in Computer Science is roughly the same for any random student, which we can estimate to be relatively standard, say around 0.15.
2. **\( P(E|H)_{CS} \)**: Considering Adam's skills in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, the likelihood of these traits if he were a Computer Science student is high, roughly 0.7.
3. **\( P(E|\neg H)_{CS} \)**: The likelihood of these traits if Adam were not a Computer Science student might be lower at around 0.4.

\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{P(E|H)_{CS} \cdot P(H)_{CS}}{P(E)} \]

### Business Administration
1. **\( P(H)_{BA} \)**: Assume the prior probability \((P(H)_{BA})\) for Adam being in Business Administration is also relatively standard for any random student, which might be around 0.1.
2. **\( P(E|H)_{BA} \)**: Considering Adam's empathy, warm heart, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, the likelihood if he were a Business Administration student might be around 0.6.
3. **\( P(E|\neg H)_{BA} \)**: Given the similarities in traits desirable in other fields, this likelihood might be around 0.5.

\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{P(E|H)_{BA} \cdot P(H)_{BA}}{P(E)} \]

#### Overall Probability \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)_{CS} \cdot P(H)_{CS} + P(E|H)_{BA} \cdot P(H)_{BA} + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For simplification purposes, we will consider that \(\neg H\) includes all other possible fields, and this will have an approximate value combining all potentials not being listed.

### Calculation:
Given \(P(E) \approx 0.7 \cdot 0.15 + 0.6 \cdot 0.1 + 0.4 \cdot 0.75 \approx 0.105 + 0.06 + 0.3 = 0.465\).

For Computer Science:

\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.15}{0.465} \approx 0.225 \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.1}{0.465} \approx 0.129 \]

So the final likelihoods would be:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.225,
  "business administration": 0.129
}
