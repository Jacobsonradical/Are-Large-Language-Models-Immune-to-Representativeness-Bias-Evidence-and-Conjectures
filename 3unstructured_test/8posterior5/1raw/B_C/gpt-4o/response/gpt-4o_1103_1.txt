To compute \( P(H|E) \) for both business administration and computer science fields, we'll follow the steps outlined:

1. **Assess prior probabilities \( P(H) \)**:
   - For business administration, let's assume that \( P(H_{\text{Business}}) = 0.2 \) (a modest prior indicating 1 in 5 graduate students might choose this field).
   - For computer science, let's set \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.4 \) (a higher prior due to the popularity of the field).

2. **Assess likelihoods \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - How likely is Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given he is in business administration \( H_{\text{Business}} \)? This field typically emphasizes leadership, economics, and management skills, which might not align perfectly with Adam's natural curiosity about nature and strong empathy. Let's set \( P(E|H_{\text{Business}}) = 0.1 \).
   - For computer science \( H_{\text{CS}} \), the field often aligns with high intelligence and an understanding of abstract concepts, paired with puzzle-solving skills. Therefore, let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.6 \).

3. **Assess the complement likelihoods \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - For business administration, considering Adam's attributes again, let's assume \( P(E | \neg H_{\text{Business}}) = 0.8 \) as many other fields might align better with his personality.
   - Similarly, let's estimate \( P(E | \neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.4 \), given that Adam’s traits might be common among other fields like biology or environmental science.

4. **Compute \( P(H|E) \) through Bayes' rule**:
   - Bayes' rule: \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \)
   - \( P(E) \) (total probability) = \( P(E|H_{\text{Business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{Business}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{Business}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{Business}}) \)

   - For Business Administration:
     \[
     P(E)_{\text{Business}} = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.8 \cdot 0.8) = 0.02 + 0.64 = 0.66 
     \]
     \[
     \Rightarrow P(H_{\text{Business}}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.66} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.66} \approx 0.0303
     \]

   - For Computer Science:
     \[
     P(E)_{\text{CS}} = (0.6 \cdot 0.4) + (0.4 \cdot 0.6) = 0.24 + 0.24 = 0.48
     \]
     \[
     \Rightarrow P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.4}{0.48} \approx \frac{0.24}{0.48} = 0.5 
     \]

{
  "business administration": 0.0303,
  "computer science": 0.5
}

These values indicate that based on Adam’s personality sketch, it’s significantly more likely that he was enrolled in computer science than in business administration in 2021.
