Let's analyze the given information and make educated estimates based on the personality sketch of Adam. The Bayes' rule formula is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

For computer science (CS), denote \( H_{CS} \) as Adam being a CS student.
For business administration (BA), denote \( H_{BA} \) as Adam being a BA student.

We need to estimate the following for each field:

- \( P(H_{CS}) \) and \( P(H_{BA}) \): The prior probabilities that Adam is in each field.
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) and \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): The likelihood of observing Adam’s personality given he is in each field.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \) and \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \): The likelihood of observing Adam’s personality given he is not in each field.

Given values for the prior probabilities (\(P(H_{CS})\) and \(P(H_{BA})\)):

Since we have no specific prior probability distribution, let's assume a hypothetical equal prior of \(0.1\) for simplicity, which would be 10% (0.1) for each of the fields under consideration as there are many fields.

### 1. Computer Science (CS)
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Adam's traits such as high intelligence, good at abstract concepts, and enjoys solving puzzles fit well with a typical CS student. Let's assume a high value of 0.8 for this probability.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \): Considering he might be in any other field, the probability of these traits would be moderately high but not as high as if he were in CS. Let's say 0.3.

Using Bayes' Rule for CS:

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \cdot P(\neg H_{CS})} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.27} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \approx 0.2286 \]

### 2. Business Administration (BA)
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): Adam's traits such as strong empathy and appreciation for hard work are somewhat relevant for a BA student, but not as convincingly as for CS. We'll choose a moderate value of 0.3.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \): For any other field, these traits may also be moderately observable. Let's say 0.3.

Using Bayes' Rule for BA:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \cdot P(\neg H_{BA})} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.3 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.27} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.30} = 0.1 \]

### Summary
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2286,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

Remember, these values are based on educated guesses and assumptions, and the actual values could be different based on real statistical data.
