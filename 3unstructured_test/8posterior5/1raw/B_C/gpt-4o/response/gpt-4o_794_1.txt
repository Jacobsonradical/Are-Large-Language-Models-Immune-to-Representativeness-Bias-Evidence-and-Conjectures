Let's break this down step by step for the fields "business administration" and "computer science".

1. **Prior Probability (P(H)):**

   - **Business Administration**: Let's assume a reasonable prior probability for business administration for a graduate student in 2021. We'll assume P(H) = 0.2.
   - **Computer Science**: Similarly, we will assume a prior probability for computer science. Let P(H) = 0.2.

2. **Likelihood (P(E|H)):**

   - **P(E|Business Administration)**: Business administration students may not strongly align with Adam's personality sketch, which places a high value on curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and abstract thinking. Let's estimate P(E|H) = 0.1.
   - **P(E|Computer Science)**: Computer Science students often engage in solving puzzles and abstract thinking, which aligns more closely with Adam’s characteristics. However, less so with a focus on nature and animals. Let's estimate P(E|H) = 0.3.

3. **Likelihood of Evidence Not Given the Hypothesis (P(E|¬H)):**

   To calculate this, we need P(E) across all fields except for the given one. This isn't straightforward and we use it to get an intuition for Bayes Theorem calculation.

   - **P(E|¬Business Administration)**: Since Adam's characteristics might not fit well with business administration, P(E|¬H) could be higher. Let’s assume it’s about 0.4.
   - **P(E|¬Computer Science)**: Considering Adam's characteristics might align well with several other fields (biology, environmental science, etc.), it might be lower. Let's assume it’s around 0.5.

4. **Posterior Probability (P(H|E)) using Bayes' Rule:**

   P(H|E) = (P(E|H) * P(H)) / P(E)

    - Since P(E) is factored out in both hypotheses equally (referring to the total probability of evidence occurring), we use Bayes’ rule proportionally:

   - **For Business Administration:**
     
     P(H|E) = (0.1 * 0.2) / (0.1 * 0.2 + 0.4 * (1 - 0.2))
            = 0.02 / (0.02 + 0.32)
            ≈ 0.0588

   - **For Computer Science:**

     P(H|E) = (0.3 * 0.2) / (0.3 * 0.2 + 0.5 * (1-0.2))
            = 0.06 / (0.06 + 0.4)
            ≈ 0.1304

So based on these simplified calculations:

{
  "business administration": 0.0588,
  "computer science": 0.1304
}
