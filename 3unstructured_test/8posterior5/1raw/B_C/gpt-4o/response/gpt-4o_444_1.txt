To compute the probabilities of Adam being enrolled in business administration or computer science given his personality sketch (E) using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate:

1. \(P(H)\): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the specified fields.
2. \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given he is enrolled in the specified fields.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given he is not enrolled in the specified fields.

Let's make some reasonable assumptions:

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: The prior probability of a graduate student being enrolled in business administration. Let's assume a moderate probability of around 0.2.
- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of a business administration student having Adam's personality traits. Since business administration usually involves more people-oriented traits and may not align well with Adam's fascination with nature and quiet disposition, let's assume a lower probability of about 0.1.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given he is not in business administration. Given that business administration represents only one field among many, we estimate this to be higher, around 0.3.

### Computer Science
- **P(H)**: The prior probability of a graduate student being enrolled in computer science. Given the popularity of the field, let's assume a higher probability of about 0.3.
- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of a computer science student having Adam's traits. Considering Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has a high intelligence in abstract concepts, this seems moderately likely, so let's say 0.5.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given he is not in computer science. Since computer science is quite specific, and considering people from various fields might have similar traits, we estimate this to be about 0.2.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

Since we're not given \(P(E)\), and it would typically normalize the probabilities, we will use comparative reasoning to estimate \(P(H|E)\) relatively:

For **Business Administration**:
\[P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} \propto P(E|H)_{\text{BA}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{BA}}\]
\[P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02\]

For **Computer Science**:
\[P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} \propto P(E|H)_{\text{CS}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{CS}}\]
\[P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} \propto 0.5 \cdot 0.3 = 0.15\]

Putting these values into a format:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.02",
  "computer science": "0.15"
}
```

This suggests that given Adam's personality sketch, he is more likely to be enrolled in computer science than business administration, as the calculated probability is higher for computer science.
