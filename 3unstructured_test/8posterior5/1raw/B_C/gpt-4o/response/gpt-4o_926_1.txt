Let's break down the problem using Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule can be expressed as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here's how we'll proceed:

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \):** This is the initial probability that Adam is in the given field before considering the personality sketch \( E \). Given no additional information, we might assume a uniform distribution across various fields. However, graduate students are more common in certain fields, so we'll assume:
   - \( P(\text{Computer Science}) = 0.2 \)
   - \( P(\text{Business Administration}) = 0.15 \)

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \):** This is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is in the specific field \( H \).

3. **Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \):** This is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not in the specific field \( H \).

4. **Computing \( P(E) \):** This will be the sum of the probabilities of observing \( E \) across all possible fields. However, since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant, we typically only need relative comparisons for \( P(H|E) \).

### Assumptions for \( P(E|H) \):
- Given Adam's traits of curiosity about nature and understanding abstract concepts, he seems more likely to be in a field that values analytical thinking and possibly scientific inquiry.
  
- **Computer Science (CS):**
  - \( P(E|\text{CS}) \) is relatively high because CS requires high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and often involves solving complex puzzles.
  - Let's assign \( P(E|\text{CS}) = 0.5 \).

- **Business Administration (BA):**
  - \( P(E|\text{BA}) \) might be lower because while it requires intelligence and empathy, the traits associated with curiosity about nature and love for animals seem less relevant.
  - Let's assign \( P(E|\text{BA}) = 0.1 \).

### Assumptions for \( P(E|\neg H) \):
- For simplicity, assume the average likelihood of the personality sketch outside these fields.

- **Computer Science (CS):**
  - Given many fields, let's assume the average \( P(E|\neg \text{CS}) = 0.2 \).

- **Business Administration (BA):**
  - Similar logic, the average \( P(E|\neg \text{BA}) = 0.2 \).

### Bayesian Inference:
Using Bayes' rule, let's calculate \( P(H|E) \):

- **Computer Science (CS):**
  \[
  P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(E)}
  \]
  Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields and will cancel out proportionally:
  \[
  P(\text{CS}|E) \propto P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})
  \]
  \[
  P(\text{CS}|E) \propto 0.5 \times 0.2 = 0.1
  \]

- **Business Administration (BA):**
  \[
  P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{BA}) \cdot P(\text{BA})}{P(E)}
  \]
  Similarly:
  \[
  P(\text{BA}|E) \propto P(E|\text{BA}) \cdot P(\text{BA})
  \]
  \[
  P(\text{BA}|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.15 = 0.015
  \]

### Results:

Let's normalize so that the total probabilities sum to 1 for easier interpretation:
- Total = \( 0.1 + 0.015 = 0.115 \)

Normalized probabilities:
- \( P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.115} \approx 0.87 \)
- \( P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{0.015}{0.115} \approx 0.13 \)

Thus, the relative probabilities are:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.87,
  "business administration": 0.13
}
