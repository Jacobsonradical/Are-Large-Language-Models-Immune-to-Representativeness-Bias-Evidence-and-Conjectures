To approach this problem, we need to evaluate the probabilities for Adam being enrolled in computer science (CS) or business administration (BA) based on his personality sketch, using Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the evidence probability.

### Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\):**
   Generally, a considerable number of graduate students are enrolled in computer science, but this number has to be balanced against the total number of graduate programs.

   \( P(H_{CS}) \approx 0.2 \) (Assumption: 20%)

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\):**
   Given Adam's traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy), they are not directly typical of a CS student but intelligence and appreciation for abstract concepts can align well with CS.

   \( P(E|H_{CS}) \approx 0.4 \)

3. **Complement Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\):**
   This represents Adam's profile likelihood among non-CS graduate fields. With his love for animals and nature, fields like biology and environmental science may be more probable.

   \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \approx 0.1 \)

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\):**
   Business administration is a common field for graduate studies, but less so compared to CS for a profile with Adam's traits.

   \( P(H_{BA}) \approx 0.1 \) (Assumption: 10%)

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\):**
   Given Adam's traits, particularly his empathy and understanding for hard work and dedication, fit well but are not strictly indicative of a BA student.

   \( P(E|H_{BA}) \approx 0.3 \)

3. **Complement Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\):**
   Likelihood of this profile in non-BA fields would be higher due to the traits aligning with various natural and social sciences.

   \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \approx 0.15 \)

### Applying Bayes' theorem:

#### For Computer Science

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]

Estimating \( P(E) \) as a normalization factor:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \cdot P(\neg H_{CS}) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.1 \cdot 0.8 = 0.08 + 0.08 = 0.16 \]

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.16} = \frac{0.08}{0.16} = 0.5 \]

#### For Business Administration

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]

Estimating \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \cdot P(\neg H_{BA}) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.3 \cdot 0.1 + 0.15 \cdot 0.9 = 0.03 + 0.135 = 0.165 \]

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.165} = \frac{0.03}{0.165} \approx 0.1818 \]

### Results

Therefore:

{
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.1818
}
