Let's assess the probabilities step-by-step for each field of study:

### Business Administration:

1. **P(H):** The prior probability that any given student is enrolled in business administration. Let's assume the graduate enrollments balance fairly evenly among different fields. A reasonable estimate might be 0.10 (10%).

2. **P(E|H):** The probability of Adam's traits being consistent with studying business administration. Given his empathy, high intelligence, and understanding of hard work, these align somewhat with business administration, but his deep love for animals and plants may make it slightly less probable. Let's assume a moderate probability of 0.30 (30%).

3. **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of Adam's traits if he is not studying business administration. Since his traits could align uncannily well with several other fields like biology, environmental science, etc., the relevant traits for other fields might be higher. Let's estimate this at 0.25 (25%).

4. **P(H|E):** Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assuming \( P(E) \) as a normalizing constant:

\[ P(H|E) \text{ (for business administration)} \approx \frac{0.30 \cdot 0.10}{0.30 \cdot 0.10 + 0.25 \cdot 0.90} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.225} = \frac{0.03}{0.255} \approx 0.118 \]

### Computer Science:

1. **P(H):** The prior probability that any given student is enrolled in computer science. Again, let's use 0.10 (10%).

2. **P(E|H):** Considering the fields of computer science, the quiet nature and puzzle-solving skills are positive indicators. Given the intelligence and abstract concept understanding, this matches well, but we should consider this somewhat due to conflicting interests regarding plants and animals. Let's set this to 0.40.

3. **P(E|\neg H):** If Adam is not in computer science, his traits (nature-interest, empathy, and animals) could still be highly aligned with other studies. Let's keep this similar to business administration: 0.25 (25%).

4. **P(H|E):** Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) \text{ (for computer science)} \approx \frac{0.40 \cdot 0.10}{0.40 \cdot 0.10 + 0.25 \cdot 0.90} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.225} = \frac{0.04}{0.265} \approx 0.151 \]

So, given the analysis, the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in these fields are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.118,
  "computer science": 0.151
}
```
