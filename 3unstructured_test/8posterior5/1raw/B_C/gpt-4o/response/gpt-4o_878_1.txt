Sure, to compute the probabilities, we need to apply Bayes' rule as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we do not know the exact values, we will make reasonable assumptions based on the given personality sketch and field characteristics.

### Assumptions and Reasoning:

1. **P(H)** should be the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each of the fields. Without additional information, we can assume that these prior probabilities P(H) are equally likely for simplification.

2. **P(E|H)** is the probability of observing the personality sketch E given Adam is in a specific field H.

3. **P(E|\neg H)** is the probability of observing the personality sketch E given Adam is not in a specific field H.

For the fields **computer science** and **business administration**, we estimate these probabilities:

#### Computer Science:
- **P(H)**: Assume a prior of 0.5 (50%) because we have no information favoring one field over another.
- **P(E|H)**: High, as interest in nature, problem-solving, abstract concepts, and high intelligence are often qualities found in Computer Science students. Estimate it as 0.8.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of someone having these traits and being in some other field is less. Estimate it as 0.2.

#### Business Administration:
- **P(H)**: Assume a prior of 0.5 (50%) because we have no information favoring one field over another.
- **P(E|H)**: Moderate, because while strong empathy and appreciation for hard work might fit, the fascination with nature, solving puzzles, and abstract thinking is less correlated. Estimate it as 0.3.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: As most students in other fields might not exhibit a high level of these traits, estimate it as 0.6.

Now applying Bayes' rule:

### Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{P(E|H)_{CS} \cdot P(H)_{CS}}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} \]

### Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{P(E|H)_{BA} \cdot P(H)_{BA}}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the normalization factor that is the same for both, we only need their relative probabilities:

### Relative probabilities:
- Computer Science: \( 0.8 \cdot 0.5 = 0.4 \)
- Business Administration: \( 0.3 \cdot 0.5 = 0.15 \)

Normalizing:
\[ \sum P = 0.4 + 0.15 = 0.55 \]

### Normalized:
- Computer Science: \( \frac{0.4}{0.55} \approx 0.727 \)
- Business Administration: \( \frac{0.15}{0.55} \approx 0.273 \)

Thus, the approximate probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.727,
  "business administration": 0.273
}
