Sure, let's break down the problem using Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem in its formal form is expressed as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( \neg H \) represents the negation of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given the negation of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of evidence \( E \).

Please note that \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Though exact numerical values are difficult to specify without empirical data, we can use reasoning to derive plausible values:

### Business Administration

1. **Hypothesis \( H \)**: Adam was enrolled in business administration.
2. **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Let's assume that the prior probability is moderate. Let's say:
   \[ P(H) \approx 0.1 \]
3. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The description of Adam's personality (love for nature, puzzles, animals) seems less typical of a business administration student. Let's set:
   \[ P(E|H) \approx 0.05 \]
4. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This includes fields outside of business administration and computer science:
   \[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \]

### Computer Science

1. **Hypothesis \( H \)**: Adam was enrolled in computer science.
2. **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Computer science students are fairly common among graduate students in the U.S., let's say:
   \[ P(H) \approx 0.2 \]
3. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's interest in puzzles and abstract thinking aligns well with computer science. Let's set:
   \[ P(E|H) \approx 0.7 \]
4. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This involves other fields excluding computer science and business administration:
   \[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.1 \]

Now let's calculate \( P(H|E) \):

For **business administration**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

For **computer science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

Given \( P(E) \) is generally the sum of \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for all hypotheses including those not explicitly considered here, let's approximate \( P(E) \) based on the weighted sum of given prior and likelihood values:

\[ P(E) \approx (0.05 \cdot 0.1) + (0.7 \cdot 0.2) + other \]

If we simplify assuming "other" to be small in comparison:

\[ P(E) \approx 0.01 + 0.14 = 0.15 \]

So,

\[ P(H|E) \text{ for business administration} \approx \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{0.15} = \frac{0.005}{0.15} \approx 0.0333 \]

\[ P(H|E) \text{ for computer science} \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.15} = \frac{0.14}{0.15} \approx 0.9333 \]

Hence,

  "business administration": 0.0333,
  "computer science": 0.9333
