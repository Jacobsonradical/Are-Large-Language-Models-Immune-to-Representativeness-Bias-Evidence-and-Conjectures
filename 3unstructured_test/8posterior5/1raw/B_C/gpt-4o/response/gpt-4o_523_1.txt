To compute the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\), we use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \(H\) is the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
- \(E\) is the personality sketch of Adam.

For the purposes of this calculation, I'll make educated guesses about the probabilities based on the personality sketch and typical attributes relevant to each field.

### Assessing the Values

**Computer Science:**
- \(P(H)\): The prior probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is studying computer science. Let's assume a moderate value. \(P(\text{CS}) \approx 0.2\).
- \(P(E|H)\): The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is in computer science. Given Adam's high intelligence and interest in puzzles, let's assume this is relatively high. \(P(E|\text{CS}) \approx 0.4\).
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not in computer science. This includes all other fields, so let's assume a more moderate value. \(P(E|\neg \text{CS}) \approx 0.2\).

**Business Administration:**
- \(P(H)\): The prior probability of a randomly chosen graduate student studying business administration. Let's assume a lower value relative to STEM fields. \(P(\text{BA}) \approx 0.1\).
- \(P(E|H)\): The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is in business administration. Given Adam's empathy and appreciation for hard work, but less direct fit with puzzles or nature, let's assume this is low. \(P(E|\text{BA}) \approx 0.05\).
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): Conversely, let's take into account the general occurrence, \(P(E|\neg \text{BA}) \approx 0.25\).

### Computing Posterior Probabilities

We will assume that the total probability \(P(E)\) is the same for both computations as it is the same evidence.

\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(E) = P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(E|\neg \text{CS}) \cdot P(\neg \text{CS}) \]

\[ P(E) \approx (0.4 \cdot 0.2) + (0.2 \cdot 0.8) = 0.08 + 0.16 = 0.24 \]

\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.24} \approx \frac{0.08}{0.24} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.333 \]

\[ P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{BA}) \cdot P(\text{BA})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(E) = (0.05 \cdot 0.1) + (0.25 \cdot 0.9) = 0.005 + 0.225 = 0.23 \]

\[ P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{0.23} \approx \frac{0.005}{0.23} \approx 0.0217 \]

Here is the final answer:

{
  "computer science": 0.333,
  "business administration": 0.0217
}
