To compute the posterior probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for each hypothesis \((H)\) given the evidence \((E)\), we need to consider:

1. \(P(H)\) - The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
2. \(P(E|H)\) - The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in that field.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\) - The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in that field.
4. \(P(E)\) - The overall probability of Adam's personality sketch, which can be computed using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

The Bayesian update formula is then:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to assign some reasonable values to these probabilities. These are hypothetical and for demonstration purposes:

### Computer Science:
- \(P(H)\):
  - Let's assume there are many fields Adam could be enrolled in. Assume 1/10 fields, so \(P(H) = 0.1\).

- \(P(E|H)\):
  - Considering traits like high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles, \(P(E|H)\) should be relatively high. Let’s estimate \(0.7\).

- \(P(E|\neg H)\):
  - The probability of the personality sketch given not being in computer science is still somewhat high because the traits aren't exclusive to this field but they are generally beneficial. Let's estimate \(0.4\).

\[ P(E) = 0.7 \times 0.1 + 0.4 \times 0.9 = 0.07 + 0.36 = 0.43 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.1}{0.43} \approx 0.1628 \]

### Business Administration:
- \(P(H)\):
  - Similar prior probability. Assume 1/10 fields, so \(P(H) = 0.1\).

- \(P(E|H)\):
  - Considering high empathy, appreciation for hard work, and strong understanding, \(P(E|H)\) may be moderately high. Let’s estimate \(0.5\).

- \(P(E|\neg H)\):
  - The probability of the personality sketch given not being in business administration might be slightly lower compared to being in it. Let's estimate \(0.45\).

\[ P(E) = 0.5 \times 0.1 + 0.45 \times 0.9 = 0.05 + 0.405 = 0.455 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \times 0.1}{0.455} \approx 0.1099 \]
