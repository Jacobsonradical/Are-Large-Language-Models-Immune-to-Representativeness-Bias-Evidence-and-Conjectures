To apply Bayes' Rule for inference about Adam's field of study, we'll assess the fields of business administration and computer science. Bayes' Rule is stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E) \) is the normalizing constant, the overall probability of observing the personality sketch.

First, let's establish rough estimates for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

### business administration:
- \( P(H) \) for business administration: This field is quite common, but given Adam's traits (curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, empathy, animals, high intelligence), it's not typically associated with business administration.
  - \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \) (10%)

- \( P(E|H) \) for business administration: The likelihood of a person with Adam's specific personality traits being in a business administration program seems lower.
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.05 \) (5%)

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given he could be in any other program that may fit better.
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \) (20%)

### computer science:
- \( P(H) \) for computer science: Given that Adam is good at understanding abstract concepts and enjoys solving puzzles, computer science seems like a plausible fit.
  - \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \) (20%)

- \( P(E|H) \) for computer science: His traits match well with characteristics often found in computer science students.
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \) (30%)

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): As before, this is the probability of Adam's traits given he is not in computer science.
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \) (20%)

We can use these to compute \( P(H|E) \).

### Bayes rule application

For business administration:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant and can be thought of as the summation over all hypotheses:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Given:
\[ P(H_{\text{bus}}|E) \approx \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{0.05 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9} \]

\[ P(H_{\text{bus}}|E) \approx \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.18} \approx \frac{0.005}{0.185} \approx 0.027 \]

For computer science:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given:
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.2 \cdot 0.8} \]

\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) \approx \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.16} \approx \frac{0.06}{0.22} \approx 0.273 \]

Hence, the posterior probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": 0.027,
  "computer science": 0.273
}
