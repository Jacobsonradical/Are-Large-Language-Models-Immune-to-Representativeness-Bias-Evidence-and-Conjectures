Sure, let's break this down step-by-step using Bayes' rule. First, let's define the probabilities we need:

1. **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field.
2. **P(E|H):** The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given that he was enrolled in the specific field.
3. **P(E|¬H):** The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in the specific field.
4. **P(H|E):** The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the specific field given his personality sketch (what we want to calculate).

Bayes' Rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Though P(E) is typically needed for exact calculation, it can often be approximated when comparing across multiple hypotheses assuming P(E) is similar for all fields considered. This simplifies to:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

We then normalize the results to get a proper probability distribution if needed. 

### Business Administration

- **P(H):** This depends on the general enrollment rates in business administration graduate programs, let's assume it's fairly common.
\[ P(H) = 0.2 \]

- **P(E|H):** How likely is Adam’s personality sketch if he were in business administration? Given:
  - Business students may value hard work and dedication but empathy, love for animals, and solving puzzles are less directly related. 
  - Moderate indication.
\[ P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \]

- **P(E|¬H):** How likely is Adam's personality sketch given he is in some other field? This will depend on how representative his traits are across other fields.
\[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.7 \]

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.3 \cdot 0.2 = 0.06 \]

### Computer Science

- **P(H):** Assume it's also fairly common among graduate students.
\[ P(H) = 0.2 \]

- **P(E|H):** How likely is Adam’s personality sketch if he were in computer science? Given:
  - High intelligence, enjoys solving puzzles, understanding abstract concepts, and possibly an interest in nature/animals (AI, simulations, etc.)
  - Strong indication.
\[ P(E|H) \approx 0.7 \]

- **P(E|¬H):** Given non-CS fields.
\[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \]

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.7 \cdot 0.2 = 0.14 \]

Now we can normalize these values to get a proper posterior distribution:

- Sum for normalization: \( 0.06 + 0.14 = 0.20 \)

- Normalized values:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} = \frac{0.06}{0.20} = 0.3 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{computer science}} = \frac{0.14}{0.20} = 0.7 \]

So, the final answers are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```
