To use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis, we need to estimate the following probabilities:
1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality traits given that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality traits given that Adam is not enrolled in that specific field.

We will then use Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

While \( P(E) \) should ideally be the same for each hypothesis when comparing them, we'll simplify our calculations by focusing on relative comparisons and assuming that \( P(E) \) is just a normalizing factor.

### Business Administration

**P(H):**
Let's assume the prior probability \( P(H) \) that a graduate student is in business administration is relatively moderate. Let's say \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

**P(E|H):**
The description of Adam does not strongly align with the typical traits associated with business administration students. Business students may not all necessarily have a deep love for nature, nature's plants, animals, puzzles, or the abstract thinking required for understanding nature. So let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

**P(E|\neg H):**
The probability of observing these traits in someone who is not in business administration might be somewhat higher, as these traits could be more common in fields like biology or environmental science. Let’s say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Using these estimates:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.02}{P(E)} \]

### Computer Science

**P(H):**
Computer science is another viable field for a graduate student, so let’s assume the prior probability \( P(H) \) is moderate. Let's say \( P(H) = 0.25 \).

**P(E|H):**
The traits of curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts align well with a computer science student. So let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.6 \).

**P(E|\neg H):**
The probability of observing these traits in a non-computer science student might be somewhat lower. Let’s say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

Using these estimates:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.6 \times 0.25}{P(E)} = \frac{0.15}{P(E)} \]

### Relative Probabilities

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields and just a normalizing factor, we can compare the relative likelihoods directly:

- For Business Administration: \( P(H|E) \propto 0.02 \)
- For Computer Science: \( P(H|E) \propto 0.15 \)

### Final Result

Based on our estimates, it is much more likely that Adam is in computer science compared to business administration. While we don't have the exact value of \( P(E) \), we can see the relative probabilities.

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.15
}
```

These values suggest that, based on the personality sketch, Adam is significantly more likely to be enrolled in computer science than in business administration.
