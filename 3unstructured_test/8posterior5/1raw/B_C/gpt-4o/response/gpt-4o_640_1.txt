To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need:
1. \( P(H) \) - the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field.
2. \( P(E|H) \) - the probability of Adam's personality sketch given he was enrolled in the field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - the probability of Adam's personality sketch given he was not enrolled in the field.

Bayes' rule: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \), we can compute \( P(H|E) \).

Let's make reasoned estimates for these probabilities.

### Computer Science:
1. **\( P(H) \)**: Let's assume the prior probability that a random graduate student is in computer science is 0.2 (20%).
2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's interest in solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts, the likelihood of his personality traits aligning with a computer science student seems fairly high. Let's estimate it as 0.7.
3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he was enrolled in something other than computer science might be reasonably lower, let's estimate it as 0.4.

### Business Administration:
1. **\( P(H) \)**: Let's assume the prior probability that a random graduate student is in business administration is 0.15 (15%).
2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's traits (e.g., strong empathy and appreciation for dedication), but considering his deep love for nature and animals and preference for abstract concepts might be less aligned, let's estimate it as 0.4.
3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he was enrolled in something other than business administration might be somewhat higher after considering the remaining fields of study. Let's estimate it as 0.5.

Now, compute \( P(H|E) \):

### Computer Science:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) = (0.7 \times 0.2) + (0.4 \times 0.8) = 0.14 + 0.32 = 0.46
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.46} \approx \frac{0.14}{0.46} \approx 0.304
\]

### Business Administration:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) = (0.4 \times 0.15) + (0.5 \times 0.85) = 0.06 + 0.425 = 0.485
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.15}{0.485} \approx \frac{0.06}{0.485} \approx 0.124
\]

Therefore, the answers are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.304,
  "business administration": 0.124
}
