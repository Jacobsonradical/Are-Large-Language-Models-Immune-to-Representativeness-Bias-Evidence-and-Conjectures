To use Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following probabilities for each field:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam's personality sketch is true given that he was enrolled in that field.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability that Adam's personality sketch is true given that he was NOT enrolled in that field.
4. **P(E)**: The overall probability of the personality sketch, which can be calculated as 
    \[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|¬H)P(¬H) \]

5. **P(H|E)**: The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field given his personality sketch.

### Computer Science
1. **P(H_cs)**: Assume a graduate student in the U.S. has an equal probability of enrolling in any field.
   We arbitrarily decide that P(H_cs) = 0.1 (assuming 10 fields are equally likely).
2. **P(E|H_cs)**: Given that computer science involves abstract concepts and puzzles, and many computer science students are intelligent and empathetic, we might estimate this at 0.5.
3. **P(E|¬H_cs)**: The probability of Adam having these traits given that he is not in computer science would still be significant, considering many fields foster such traits, let’s assume 0.2.

Now, using Bayes' rule,
\[ P(H_\text{cs}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_\text{cs}) \cdot P(H_\text{cs})}{P(E)} \]
where
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_\text{cs}) \cdot P(H_\text{cs}) + P(E|¬H_\text{cs}) \cdot P(¬H_\text{cs}) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.5 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) = 0.05 + 0.18 = 0.23 \]

\[ P(H_\text{cs}|E) = \frac{0.5 \times 0.1}{0.23} \approx 0.217 \]

### Business Administration
1. **P(H_ba)**: Assume a graduate student in the U.S. has an equal probability of enrolling in any field.
   We arbitrarily decide that P(H_ba) = 0.1 (assuming 10 fields are equally likely).
2. **P(E|H_ba)**: Business administration students might also display hard work and empathy, but abstract concepts and puzzles might not align perfectly. Let’s estimate this at 0.3.
3. **P(E|¬H_ba)**: As before, we assume the personality traits can belong to students outside business administration reasonably well, assume 0.25.

Now, using Bayes' rule,
\[ P(H_\text{ba}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_\text{ba}) \cdot P(H_\text{ba})}{P(E)} \]
where
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_\text{ba}) \cdot P(H_\text{ba}) + P(E|¬H_\text{ba}) \cdot P(¬H_\text{ba}) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.1) + (0.25 \cdot 0.9) = 0.03 + 0.225 = 0.255 \]

\[ P(H_\text{ba}|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.1}{0.255} \approx 0.118 \]

Note: The priors (P(H)) and conditional probabilities (P(E|H) and P(E|¬H)) were assumed based on the description provided and common sense estimates related to fields. These values can be adjusted based on more precise data or refined assumptions.
