To apply Bayes' rule, we need to use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's assume \( P(H) \) for both computer science (CS) and business administration (BA) to be the general likelihood that a graduate student could be in those fields. Since the exact proportion of students in each field is not given, we can make a simplified assumption with hypothetical values. 

For simplification:
- Assume \( P(H) \) is the same for both fields and other fields.
- Assume \( P(E) \) is the overall likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits in any graduate student field.

### Hypotheses:
- H\_CS: Adam is a computer science student.
- H\_BA: Adam is a business administration student.

### Probabilities:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - **P(H\_CS):** Probability that a graduate student is in computer science.
     Let's assume: \( P(H\_CS) \approx 0.2 \) (20%).

   - **P(E|H\_CS):** Probability of Adam's personality sketch given he's in computer science.
     Adam doesn't exhibit the typical traits associated with a field focused heavily on programming and algorithms, which may not align perfectly with his love for nature, strong empathy, and animals.
     Let's assume: \( P(E|H\_CS) \approx 0.2 \) (20%).

   - **P(E|\neg H\_CS):** Probability of Adam's personality sketch given he's not in computer science.
     Given that Adam has traits that could align with various other fields, this probability should be slightly higher.
     Let's assume: \( P(E|\neg H\_CS) \approx 0.6 \) (60%).

### Applying Bayes' Rule for Computer Science:
\[ P(H\_CS|E) = \frac{P(E|H\_CS) \cdot P(H\_CS)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) can be computed as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H\_CS) \cdot P(H\_CS) + P(E|\neg H\_CS) \cdot P(\neg H\_CS) \]

Using the values:
\[ P(E) \approx (0.2 \cdot 0.2) + (0.6 \cdot 0.8) = 0.04 + 0.48 = 0.52 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H\_CS|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.52} \approx \frac{0.04}{0.52} \approx 0.077 \]

2. **Business Administration:**
   - **P(H\_BA):** Probability that a graduate student is in business administration.
     Let's assume: \( P(H\_BA) \approx 0.2 \) (20%).

   - **P(E|H\_BA):** Probability of Adam's personality sketch given he's in business administration.
     The traits described in Adam's personality are less typical for a field focused on business, economics, and administration.
     Let's assume: \( P(E|H\_BA) \approx 0.1 \) (10%).

   - **P(E|\neg H\_BA):** Probability of Adam's personality sketch given he's not in business administration.
     This probability should be similar to the previous calculation.
     Let's assume: \( P(E|\neg H\_BA) \approx 0.6 \) (60%).

### Applying Bayes' Rule for Business Administration:
\[ P(H\_BA|E) = \frac{P(E|H\_BA) \cdot P(H\_BA)}{P(E)} \]

Using the values:
\[ P(E) \approx (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.6 \cdot 0.8) = 0.02 + 0.48 = 0.5 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H\_BA|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.5} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.5} \approx 0.04 \]

### Results:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.077,
  "business administration": 0.04
}
```

These results suggest that, given the personality sketch, Adam is slightly more likely to be a computer science graduate student than a business administration student, but both probabilities remain relatively low due to the mismatch of personality traits with these fields.
