To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to follow these steps:
1. Estimate \( P(H) \), the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field.
2. Estimate \( P(E|H) \), the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \), given that Adam is in each field.
3. Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \), the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \), given that Adam is not in each field.
4. Use Bayes' Rule to update the probabilities \( P(H|E) \).

Let's denote the relevant probabilities as follows:
- \( P(H_{CS}) \): Prior probability that Adam is in computer science.
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is in computer science.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \): Probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in computer science.
- \( P(H_{BA}) \): Prior probability that Adam is in business administration.
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): Probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is in business administration.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \): Probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in business administration.

### Estimates

- **Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)**:
  - \( P(H_{CS}) \): Graduate students in computer science are somewhat common, but not overwhelmingly so. Let's assume a prior probability of 0.3 for computer science.
  - \( P(H_{BA}) \): Graduate students in business administration are also common. Let's assume a prior probability of 0.3 for business administration.

- **Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \)**:
  - \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Likelihood that Adam, with his interest in nature, abstract concepts, empathy, and warm heart is in computer science. Assuming these traits are somewhat less common in computer science, we might estimate this as 0.2.
  - \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \): Likelihood of Adam’s characteristics given he is not in computer science. Assuming these traits might be more common in other fields, let's estimate this at 0.4.
  - \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): Likelihood that Adam is in business administration given his traits. Given his curiosity about nature, this might be less common, so let's estimate 0.1.
  - \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \): Likelihood of Adam’s characteristics given he is not in business administration. Assuming these traits might be more common in other fields, let's estimate this at 0.4.

### Bayes' Rule
Bayes' Rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the normalizing constant:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

#### For computer science:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{CS})P(H_{CS}) + P(E|\neg H_{CS})P(\neg H_{CS}) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.3 + 0.4 \cdot 0.7 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.06 + 0.28 = 0.34 \]

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{0.34} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.34} \approx 0.176 \]

#### For business administration:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{BA})P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA})P(\neg H_{BA}) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.3 + 0.4 \cdot 0.7 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.03 + 0.28 = 0.31 \]

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.3}{0.31} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.31} \approx 0.097 \]

### Summary
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.176,
  "business administration": 0.097
}
```

These probabilities show that based on the given personality sketch, Adam is more likely to be a graduate student in computer science compared to business administration, though neither field is particularly likely given the information provided.
