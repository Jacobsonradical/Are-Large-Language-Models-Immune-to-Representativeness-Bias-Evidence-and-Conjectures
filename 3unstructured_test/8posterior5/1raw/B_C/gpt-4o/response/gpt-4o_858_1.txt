To compute the values for P(H|E) for "business administration" and "computer science", I'll start by making some general assumptions about P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|\neg H) for each field.

### Business Administration

1. **P(H): Prior Probability**  
   Business administration (MBA) programs are quite popular, so we can assume P(H) could be around 0.1 (10%).

2. **P(E|H): Likelihood of E given H**  
   Business administration students may not typically have a profile with a deep curiosity about nature, strong empathy for animals, or a love for solving puzzles, so let's assign a lower probability, say 0.05 (5%).

3. **P(E|\neg H): Likelihood of E given not H**  
   The likelihood of having such a profile outside business administration would still be relatively low, but not as low as inside it, so we assign it a value like 0.2 (20%).

### Computer Science

1. **P(H): Prior Probability**  
   Computer science is also a very popular graduate field. Let's assign P(H) = 0.15 (15%).

2. **P(E|H): Likelihood of E given H**  
   Computer science students are often curious and good at solving puzzles, and the field involves understanding abstract concepts. So, let's assign a higher probability, say 0.3 (30%).

3. **P(E|\neg H): Likelihood of E given not H**  
   Outside computer science, having such a profile could be more varied. Assuming a moderate value, let's set P(E|\neg H) to 0.25 (25%).

Now, using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]

### Business Administration

\[ P(E) = (0.05 \times 0.1) + (0.2 \times 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.005 + 0.18 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.185 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.1}{0.185} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.185} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.027 \] (approx. 2.7%)

### Computer Science

\[ P(E) = (0.3 \times 0.15) + (0.25 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.045 + 0.2125 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.2575 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.15}{0.2575} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.2575} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.175 \] (approx. 17.5%)

Here are the final results:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.027,
  "computer science": 0.175
}
```
