To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the hypotheses \( H \) where \( H \) is the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in a specific field, we use Bayes' Rule. Bayes' Rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here:

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence given that Adam is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence given that Adam is not enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the evidence.

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for all fields and we're comparing relative probabilities, we can focus on computing \( P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

### Assumptions

To simplify and remain within the constraints of the task, let's assume the following plausible values:

- \( P(H) \), the prior probability for each field. Given no other information, we assume equal priors for simplicity:
  - \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.2 \)
  - \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.2 \)

- \( P(E|H) \), the likelihood based on Adam's personality sketch, which indicates a strong leaning toward natural sciences, empathy, and abstract thinking. Let's assign the values based on the fit of the description:
  - For Business Administration:
    - \( P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.1 \) (less fit with curiosity about nature, empathy, and abstract thinking)
  - For Computer Science:
    - \( P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.4 \) (better fit with curiosity, puzzles, intelligence, and abstract thinking)

- \( P(E|\neg H) \):
  - Given as the description is not very typical for business administration students:
    - \( P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) = 0.5 \)
  - This description could more commonly be found in students outside computer science:
    - \( P(E|\neg \text{computer science}) = 0.6 \)

### Computations

Using these assumptions, we apply Bayes' Rule as relative probabilities:

1. For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.2 \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) \propto 0.02 \]

2. For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) \propto 0.4 \cdot 0.2 \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) \propto 0.08 \]

Finally, to normalize (even though summation is not required in your format):

The final probabilities reflect these computations, but since you're asking for the values within the same context without normalization:

\[
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.08
}
\]
