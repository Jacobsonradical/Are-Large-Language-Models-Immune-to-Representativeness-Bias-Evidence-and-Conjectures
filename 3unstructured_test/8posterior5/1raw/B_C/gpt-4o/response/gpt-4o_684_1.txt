To approach this problem systematically, we need to make some reasonable estimates for the probabilities involved and then use Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior probabilities.

### Definitions:
- \( H_{\text{cs}} \): Adam is enrolled in computer science.
- \( H_{\text{ba}} \): Adam is enrolled in business administration.
- \( E \): The given personality sketch of Adam.
- \( \neg H_{\text{cs}} \): Adam is not enrolled in computer science.
- \( \neg H_{\text{ba}} \): Adam is not enrolled in business administration.

### Bayesian Formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, \( P(E) \) can be derived from the law of total probability but is not required for comparative purposes since we are only comparing fields here:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{cs}}) \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ba}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{ba}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{ba}}) \]

To simplify comparison, we assume baseline values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

### Estimations and Reasoning:

1. **Computer Science (CS)**
   - **P(H_{\text{cs}})**: Proportion of graduate students in the U.S. who are in CS. Let's estimate it around \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.2 \).
   - **P(E|H_{\text{cs}})**: Adam's personality traits fit moderately well with CS given interest in puzzles and abstract concepts. Estimate \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.3 \).
   - **P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}})**: Probability of having Adam's personality traits if he is not in CS. Since many fields might share these characteristics, roughly estimate \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.1 \).

2. **Business Administration (BA)**
   - **P(H_{\text{ba}})**: Proportion of graduate students in the U.S. who are in BA. Estimated lower than CS, perhaps around \( P(H_{\text{ba}}) = 0.1 \).
   - **P(E|H_{\text{ba}})**: Adam's personality seems less aligned with typical BA traits but still possible. Estimate \( P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) = 0.1 \).
   - **P(E|\neg H_{\text{ba}})**: Probability of having Adam's personality traits if he is not in BA. Keep it similar to general non-specific baseline. Estimate \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{ba}}) = 0.15 \).

### Calculation:

For **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}} | E) = \frac{P(E | H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.06}{P(E)} \]

For **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H_{\text{ba}} | E) = \frac{P(E | H_{\text{ba}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ba}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.1 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.01}{P(E)} \]

For comparison purposes:
\[ \frac{P(H_{\text{cs}} | E)}{P(H_{\text{ba}} | E)} = \frac{0.06 / P(E)}{0.01 / P(E)} = \frac{0.06}{0.01} = 6 \]

This suggests Adam is roughly 6 times more likely to be in Computer Science compared to Business Administration.

{
  "computer science": 0.6 (comparative posterior likelihood),
  "business administration": 0.1 (comparative posterior likelihood)
}

Please keep in mind these probabilities are based on assumed and simplified estimates rather than precise statistical data.
