To apply Bayes' theorem for finding \( P(H|E) \), we need to calculate the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \). 

Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

We can approximate \( P(E) \) by using:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)
\]

However, for simplicity, we can compare the values without calculating \( P(E) \), since it is constant for both fields.

Given Adam’s personality sketch, it seems more probable that he would fit into fields that involve understanding abstract concepts and appreciation for nature and animals. Here’s our assessment:

### Business Administration
- **P(H) for Business Administration**: Let's assume a relatively moderate prior probability that any given graduate student could be in business administration. Let's say \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.2 \).
- **P(E|H) for Business Administration**: Given the personality sketch, it seems less likely that a person with a strong love for nature, animals, and empathy would fit perfectly into an MBA program. Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.1 \).
- **P(E|\neg H) for Business Administration**: For the fields other than business administration, it is a more appealing fit. Let's set \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.3 \).

### Computer Science
- **P(H) for Computer Science**: There is a moderate probability for any graduate student to be in computer science as well, so \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.2 \).
- **P(E|H) for Computer Science**: Given Adam’s characteristics, an interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, it is relatively high. Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.6 \).
- **P(E|\neg H) for Computer Science**: For fields other than computer science, it is less likely to share Adam’s strong fit. Let's set \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.4 \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H)
\]

Now we calculate and normalize values as:

For Business Administration:
\[
P(H_{BA}|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02
\]

For Computer Science:
\[
P(H_{CS}|E) \propto 0.6 \times 0.2 = 0.12
\]

Normalizing these values:
\[
P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.12} \approx 0.1429
\]
\[
P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.02 + 0.12} \approx 0.8571
\]

Therefore, the answer values are:

{
  "business administration": 0.1429,
  "computer science": 0.8571
}
