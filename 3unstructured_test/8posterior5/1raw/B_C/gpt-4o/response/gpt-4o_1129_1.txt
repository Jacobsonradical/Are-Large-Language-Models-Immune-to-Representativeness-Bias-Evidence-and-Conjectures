To solve this, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Estimate Prior Probabilities (P(H))**: These are the probabilities that Adam is enrolled in either computer science or business administration without any other knowledge.
   
2. **Estimate Likelihoods (P(E|H))**: These are the probabilities that the given personality sketch of Adam would occur if he were in each field.

3. **Estimate Complement Likelihoods (P(E|\neg H))**: These are the probabilities that the given personality sketch of Adam would occur if he were not in each respective field.

4. **Apply Bayes Rule**: Use these probabilities to compute the posterior probability (P(H|E)).

### Assumptions and Estimates

To proceed, we need to make some reasonable estimates based on the information given.

1. **P(H)** for each field:
   - For a graduate student in the U.S., let's assume the prior probability distributions among different fields. Let's say there is a moderate chance he could be in computer science or business administration. To simplify, let’s assume:
     - P(H_computer_science) = 0.2
     - P(H_business_administration) = 0.1

2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality traits given his field of study.
   - Computer Science: People in this field often have strong puzzle-solving skills and high intelligence; however, a deep love of nature and warm empathy may be less common.
     - P(E|H_computer_science) = 0.3
   - Business Administration: This field might not directly foster a love for animals or nature and might favor different traits such as leadership and networking.
     - P(E|H_business_administration) = 0.1

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of Adam’s personality traits given that he is not in the specified field.
   - Since these personality traits are general and can apply to many fields like Biology, Environmental Science, Psychology, etc., we will assume higher likelihoods here.
     - P(E|\neg H_computer_science) = 0.6
     - P(E|\neg H_business_administration) = 0.7

### Bayes Rule
Bayes' Theorem formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \)

### Calculations

1. **Computer Science**:
   \[
   P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.2) + (0.6 \cdot 0.8) \\
   P(E) = 0.06 + 0.48 \\
   P(E) = 0.54
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.54} \\
   P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.06}{0.54} \\
   P(H|E)_{CS} \approx 0.111
   \]

2. **Business Administration**:
   \[
   P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.1) + (0.7 \cdot 0.9) \\
   P(E) = 0.01 + 0.63 \\
   P(E) = 0.64
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.64} \\
   P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.01}{0.64} \\
   P(H|E)_{BA} \approx 0.016
   \]

So, the resulting probabilities based on Bayes' Theorem would be:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.111,
  "business administration": 0.016
}
```
These probabilities indicate that, based on Adam's personality traits, it's somewhat more likely he is studying computer science compared to business administration, but it still remains relatively unlikely in both contexts given the high probability for those traits to appear in other fields.
