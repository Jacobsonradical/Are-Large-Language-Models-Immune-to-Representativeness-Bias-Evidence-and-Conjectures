To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study using Bayes' rule, we need to analyze the probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Here's how it can be approached for the fields "computer science" and "business administration":

### For Computer Science:
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \)**:
   - Given the range of possible graduate fields, let's assume a rough prior probability. Considering computer science is a popular field, we can assign a moderate prior.
   - \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.2 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \)**:
   - Adam's curiosity about nature and animals, and his love for solving puzzles, suggests a decent fit for computer science due to its common inclusion of problem-solving.
   - However, the deep love for nature and animals isn't a strong indicator for computer science.
   - Let's estimate this as \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.3 \)

3. **Probability \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \)**:
   - The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in computer science includes all other fields including ones closely aligned with his nature interests.
   - Let's assign a higher value because there are other fields like biology or environmental science that match his attributes well.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.6 \)

4. **Posterior Probability \( P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \)** using Bayes' rule:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)}
   \]
   Since \( P(E) \) is the same for all fields and ensures normalization of probabilities, it can be simplified as proportional to:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) P(H_{\text{CS}})
   \]
   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto 0.3 \times 0.2 = 0.06
   \]

### For Business Administration:
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \)**:
   - Business administration is also a popular graduate field but since it might be less common than computer science, assign it a slightly lower prior.
   - \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.15 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \)**:
   - Business administration doesn't directly align with Adam's curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals and puzzles.
   - Let's estimate this as lower.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1 \)

3. **Probability \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \)**:
   - Given the same reasoning as before for non-BA fields, the commonality of Adam's profile with other more fitting fields.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.65 \)

4. **Posterior Probability \( P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \)** using Bayes' rule:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) P(H_{\text{BA}})
   \]
   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.15 = 0.015
   \]

### Normalizing the Posterior Probabilities
Since standard normalization ensures the posterior probabilities sum to 1 across all considered fields, maintaining the comparative focus:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) P(H_{\text{BA}})}
\]

For simplicity, we often leave in non-normalized form unless strictly dividing by the sum to ensure proportional representation fractions.

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.06,
  "business administration": 0.015
}
```

This reflects Adam's personality sketch is less indicative of business administration and somewhat more in line with computer science given the discussed attributes and hypothetical values assigned. The exact values can change with more precise priors or additional fields inclusion and better detailing E configurations.
