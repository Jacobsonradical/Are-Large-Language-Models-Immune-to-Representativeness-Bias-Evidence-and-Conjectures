To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' rule, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, calculating \( P(E) \) for normalization is non-trivial without a concrete reference for all possible fields of specialization and their probabilities. Therefore, we will treat \( P(E) \) as a constant denominator (or normalize after the fact if more fields were provided).

Let's start with some assumptions to estimate the probabilities. These are subjective but based on typical characteristics associated with each field.

**1. Hypothesis: Computer Science**

- \( P(H) \): General probability of being in Computer Science. Given the trends in the past years, let's assume 15% of graduate students might be in this field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's characteristics given he is in Computer Science. Curiosity about nature and abstract problem-solving fits, but a strong empathy and love for animals might fit less well. Assign a value like 0.30.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's characteristics given he is not in Computer Science. Given a broad range of other fields, the empathy and love for animals might be more common elsewhere. Assign a value like 0.70.

**2. Hypothesis: Business Administration**

- \( P(H) \): General probability of being in Business Administration. Assume 10% of graduate students might be in this field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Adam's characteristics - curious about nature and animals, and empathy, might be less typical in Business Administration. Assign a value like 0.10.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Similar to the above, 0.70.

We will calculate the posterior probabilities.

**For Computer Science:**

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.30 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \]

**For Business Administration:**

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.10 \cdot 0.10}{P(E)} \]

Since \( \frac{0.30 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \neq \frac{0.10 \cdot 0.10}{P(E)} \), we can ignore the shared \( P(E) \) term for relative comparison.

**Normalized:**

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.30 \cdot 0.15}{0.30 \cdot 0.15 + 0.10 \cdot 0.10} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.10 \cdot 0.10}{0.30 \cdot 0.15 + 0.10 \cdot 0.10} \]

Calculations:

1. Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.01} = \frac{0.045}{0.055} \approx 0.82 \]

2. Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.045 + 0.01} = \frac{0.01}{0.055} \approx 0.18 \]

Thus the posterior probabilities for Adam being in each field, under the provided assumptions, are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.82,
  "business administration": 0.18
}
```

These values are subjective estimates. A more accurate assessment would require concrete data on graduate populations and specific characteristics distributions across fields.
