To approach this problem, it's essential to understand how likely Adam's personality and interests align with each given field (business administration and computer science) using Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)} {P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of Adam having his personality traits given he was enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of Adam having his personality traits overall.
- \( P(E| \neg H) \) is the probability of Adam having his personality traits given he was not enrolled in a given field.

For simplicity, we will assume \( P(H) \) is the same for both fields (each field is equally likely a priori), which means it's a constant and will cancel out when comparing the fields.

We'll mainly focus on estimating \( P(E|H) \) and qualitatively judging \( P(E|\neg H) \) for comparing the posterior probabilities of different fields. \( P(E) \) is also a constant when comparing the two fields.

### Business Administration

1. \( P(H) \): If fields are equally likely, let's set \( P(H) = 0.5 \) (Just a baseline, and ultimately it will cancel out).

2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam's traits aligning with business administration:
   - High intelligence: Approximately relevant.
   - Genuine curiosity about nature and plants: Less relevant.
   - Enjoys solving puzzles: Less relevant.
   - Warm heart and strong empathy: Somewhat relevant.
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication: Relevant.
   
   Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \).

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam's traits given he's not in business administration.
   - Since business administration is not closely aligned with nature or puzzles, this could be higher.
   
   Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \).

### Computer Science

1. \( P(H) \): Same as above, let's set \( P(H) = 0.5 \).

2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam's traits aligning with computer science:
   - High intelligence: Highly relevant.
   - Genuine curiosity about nature and plants: Somewhat less relevant directly, but curiosity is a good trait.
   - Enjoys solving puzzles: Highly relevant (programming often involves problem-solving).
   - Warm heart and strong empathy: Less relevant, but not determining.
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication: Relevant.
   
   Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.7 \).

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam's traits given he's not in computer science.
   - Curiosity, puzzles, and intelligence find strong relevance elsewhere also.
   
   Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \).

### Calculating Posteriors:

For business administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.3 \cdot 0.5 = 0.15 \]

For computer science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.7 \cdot 0.5 = 0.35 \]

Now normalize these probabilities to get the comparative likelihoods (though absolute values here are informative):

{
  "business administration": "0.15",
  "computer science": "0.35"
}

So, based on this approach using Bayesâ€™ rule, it seems more likely that Adam was enrolled in computer science compared to business administration.
