Sure, let's break this down systematically:

### Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)
First, we need to consider the prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each of these fields. We'll denote them as \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \) for computer science and \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \) for business administration.

Given Adam's interests and skills:

- **Computer Science (CS):** Considering Adam’s high intelligence and skill in solving puzzles, there’s a reasonable chance he might have considered computer science.
- **Business Administration (BA):** Considering Adam’s qualities like strong empathy and appreciation for hard work, business administration is a viable but perhaps less likely scenario.

Let’s assume these are roughly balanced for a graduate population:

- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.4 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.2 \)

### Conditional Probabilities \( P(E|H) \)
Next, we need to evaluate how likely Adam’s personality sketch \( E \) is if he were enrolled in each field.

- **Computer Science (CS):**
  - Highly intelligent and good at abstract thinking aligns well.
  - Solving puzzles aligns well with the problem-solving aspect of CS.

  Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.8 \).

- **Business Administration (BA):**
  - Empathy and warm-heartedness align somewhat.
  - Deep love for animals and nature might be less directly relevant.

  Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.4 \).

### Conditional Probabilities \( P(E|\neg H) \)
- For \( P(E|\neg H) \), which considers the probability of Adam's traits if he weren't in a particular field, might be distributed among many other fields like biology, environmental science, etc.

  Let's assume a balanced scenario across other fields not analyzed here.

  Therefore, let's approximate \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.3 \) and \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.5 \).

### Applying Bayes' Rule
Bayes' theorem is defined as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) (the total probability of Adam’s characteristics) can be simplified as a normalization factor.

We’ll ignore the detailed calculation of \( P(E) \) as we’re interested in relative probabilities.

### Calculation
For **computer science**:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.4}{P(E)} = \frac{0.32}{P(E)} \]

For **business administration**:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.08}{P(E)} \]

### Normalizing
To provide relative values which sum to 1 for simplification:

Let’s denote:
\[ K = P(E) \]
Then we normalize:

\[
P_{\text{CS}} = \frac{0.32}{0.32 + 0.08} \approx 0.8
\]
\[
P_{\text{BA}} = \frac{0.08}{0.32 + 0.08} \approx 0.2
\]

### Final Answer

{
  "computer science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
