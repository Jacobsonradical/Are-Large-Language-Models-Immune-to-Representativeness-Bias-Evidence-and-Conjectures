To determine which field Adam was likely enrolled in, we can apply Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \(P(H|E)\) is the probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field (H) given the evidence (E).
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of the evidence (E) given that Adam is enrolled in the specific field (H).
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the specific field (H).
- \(P(E)\) is the total probability of the evidence (E). 

Since \(P(E)\) is a normalization factor across all fields and our probability does not need to sum to 1, we can use approximate values and estimate the relative likelihood.

Let's denote \(P(H)\) for computer science and business administration based on general U.S. graduate enrollment trends and their match to Adam's personality. Assuming there's a considerable number of grad students enrolled in both fields:

- Let's approximate \(P(H)\) for both fields at 0.25 (since there are other grad fields and for simplicity in comparison).

Next, we consider \(P(E|H)\):

- For computer science: Given Adam's curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts, these traits fit well with a graduate field where puzzle-solving, logic, and intelligence are prevalent.
  \[
  P(E|H_{cs}) \approx 0.6
  \]

- For business administration: This field might not align as well with Adam's appreciation for nature and animals, though his intelligence and understanding of hard work could fit.
  \[
  P(E|H_{ba}) \approx 0.2
  \]

Now, consider \(P(E|\neg H)\), the probability of the evidence given that Adam is not in a particular field. For simplicity, because we’re not taking into account all other fields in detail, we might assume it’s neutral for both fields:
\[
P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5
\]

Applying Bayes' Rule:

1. **Computer Science (CS):**
   \[
   P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{cs})P(H_{cs})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.6 \times 0.25}{P(E)}
   \]

2. **Business Administration (BA):**
   \[
   P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{ba})P(H_{ba})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \times 0.25}{P(E)}
   \]

Comparing the numerators since \(P(E)\) is constant:

\[
P(H_{cs}|E) \propto 0.6 \times 0.25 = 0.15
\]
\[
P(H_{ba}|E) \propto 0.2 \times 0.25 = 0.05
\]

When compared, the estimate for \(P(H_{cs}|E)\) is significantly higher than \(P(H_{ba}|E)\). Converting these proportional values to probabilities adding to 1:

\[
Total = 0.15 + 0.05 = 0.20
\]

Thus, the final probabilities:

\[
P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{0.15}{0.20} = 0.75
\]
\[
P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{0.05}{0.20} = 0.25
\]

So, the final result is:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.25
}
```
