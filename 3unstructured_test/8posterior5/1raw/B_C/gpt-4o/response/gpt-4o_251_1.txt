To compute \( P(H|E) \) or \( P(H \text{ given } E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is in a particular field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not in that particular field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch, which can be computed as \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

We do not have the exact values for these probabilities, but we can give an estimation based on the provided sketch of Adam’s personality and interests.

Let's denote:
- \( P(H_{CS}) \) as the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(H_{BA}) \) as the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) as the probability of Adam's personality sketch given he was in computer science.
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \) as the probability of Adam's personality sketch given he was in business administration.

Given Adam’s interest in nature, plants, solving puzzles, abstract concepts, and empathy for animals, we might reasonably estimate the following probabilities:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(H_{CS}) \): There is a significant number of students in computer science in the U.S. Let's assume: \( P(H_{CS}) \approx 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Computer science students often have strong analytical skills and enjoy solving puzzles, but their interest in nature and animals might not be as high. Let's estimate: \( P(E|H_{CS}) \approx 0.3 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \): Given the various other fields of study, let's estimate: \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \approx 0.7 \).

2. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H_{BA}) \): There are also many students in business administration, but Adam's personality may not perfectly align with common characteristics seen in this field. Assume: \( P(H_{BA}) \approx 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): Business administration may attract individuals with strong dedication and empathy, but it might not align well with Adam’s interest in nature and abstract concepts. Let's estimate: \( P(E|H_{BA}) \approx 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \): Given the numerous other fields, let's estimate: \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \approx 0.8 \).

Now, we use Bayes' formula:

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]

Given the prior estimates and likelihoods, we can compute the posterior probabilities. Note that \( P(E) \) normalizes the probabilities and is a bit complex to estimate without exact figures, so I'll provide relative values.

Here’s how to format the response considering the relative nature of our estimates:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.13",
  "business administration": "0.04"
}
```

Note: These values are relative approximations based on the given personality sketch and assumptions about the fields. They provide an idea of how likely it might be that Adam chose these fields given his personality, but they do not sum to 1 because there are other possible fields outside the given options.
