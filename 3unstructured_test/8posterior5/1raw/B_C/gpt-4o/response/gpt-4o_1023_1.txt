To determine \( P(H|E) \) for each field (computer science and business administration), we need to use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To apply Bayes' Rule, we need to assess the following probabilities for each field:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The probability that Adam is enrolled in that specific field without any additional information.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in that field.
3. **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in that field.

Let's analyze these for computer science and business administration:

### Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \)**:
   Let's assume a moderate prior probability because computer science is a popular field, but without additional context, we'll use a value like 0.2.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \)**:
   Given that Adam has a deep curiosity about nature, plants, animals, and enjoys puzzles, his personality might not directly suggest a strong inclination towards computer science traditionally. However, his intelligence and abstract thinking ability are positive indicators. This could lead us to a moderate probability, around 0.4.

3. **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \)**:
   This would be the probability of Adamâ€™s personality if he were in another field aside from computer science. Assuming the qualities are somewhat general and could fit in numerous other fields, we might use a value like 0.7.

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \)**:
   Again, let's assume a moderate prior probability because business administration is also a typical field of study. We'll use a value like 0.2.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \)**:
   Adam's qualities like empathy, warm-heartedness, and understanding of hard work could be beneficial in business administration. However, his deep love for animals and nature may not correlate strongly. A moderate, slightly lower likelihood around 0.3 seems reasonable.

3. **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \)**:
   Similarly, this would reflect the probability of his personality traits fitting other fields than business administration. Using a value like 0.7 again seems fair.

Now we apply Bayes' Rule:

### For Computer Science

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ \approx \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{(0.4 \cdot 0.2) + (0.7 \cdot 0.8)} \]
\[ \approx \frac{0.08}{(0.08) + (0.56)} \]
\[ \approx \frac{0.08}{0.64} \]
\[ \approx 0.125 \]

### For Business Administration

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{(0.3 \cdot 0.2) + (0.7 \cdot 0.8)} \]
\[ \approx \frac{0.06}{(0.06) + (0.56)} \]
\[ \approx \frac{0.06}{0.62} \]
\[ \approx 0.097 \]

So the final results are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.125,
  "business administration": 0.097
}
```
