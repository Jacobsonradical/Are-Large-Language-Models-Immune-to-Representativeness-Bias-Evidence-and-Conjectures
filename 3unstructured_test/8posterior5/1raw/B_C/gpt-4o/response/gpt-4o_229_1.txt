To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we are comparing two specific fields of study, we do not need to compute the absolute values but can compare the relative likelihoods. We define the following:

- \( P(H) \) = Prior probability of H (before considering the evidence E).
- \( P(E|H) \) = Likelihood of observing the evidence E given that H is true.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) = Likelihood of observing the evidence E given that H is false.

We'll assume that the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field are equal, and we'll focus on \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Given Adam's personality sketch, let's assign the likelihoods subjectively based on the fit of the profile to each graduate field.

1. **Computer Science**:
    - **Prior Probability, \(P(H)\)**: Let's assume a relatively middle-ground prior probability of 0.5.
    - **Likelihood, \(P(E|H)\)**: Adam's curiosity about nature, intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving aligns well with a field like computer science. We can estimate a high likelihood, such as 0.7.
    - **Likelihood, \(P(E|\neg H)\)**: For those not in computer science but in other fields, Adam's characteristics might not be as strong a match since certain fields may not value these traits equally. Let's estimate this as 0.3.

    - **Posterior Probability, \(P(H|E)\)**: Using Bayes' theorem.
      \[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
      
      Since we're comparing fields, we don't need to compute \( P(E) \) precisely, only relative likelihoods.

2. **Business Administration**:
    - **Prior Probability, \(P(H)\)**: Similar to above, assume 0.5.
    - **Likelihood, \(P(E|H)\)**: Adam's traits seem less aligned with traditional business administration traits such as leadership and decision-making in finance or operations. A more reasonable estimate might be 0.2.
    - **Likelihood, \(P(E|\neg H)\)**: This would represent how likely it is to have Adam's traits in fields not business administration, perhaps comparable to the computer science scenario, so set this at 0.4.

    - **Posterior Probability, \(P(H|E)\)**: Likewise using Bayes' theorem for relative comparisons.

For our comparisons:

\[
P(\text{{computer science}}|E) \propto P(E|\text{{computer science}}) \cdot P(\text{{computer science}}) = 0.7 \cdot 0.5 = 0.35
\]

\[
P(\text{{business administration}}|E) \propto P(E|\text{{business administration}}) \cdot P(\text{{business administration}}) = 0.2 \cdot 0.5 = 0.1
\]

Now, making these estimates relatively, here is the final relative likelihood for each field:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.35,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These values represent the relative strengths of the posterior probabilities given the evidence and assumptions about the prior and likelihood values.
