Certainly! First, let's break down the needed probabilities for each field:

### Business Administration

**1. Prior Probability, P(H)**
   - P(business administration) can be considered moderate since it's one of the popular graduate fields but let's assume a prior probability of around 0.15 (15%).

**2. Likelihood, P(E|H)**
   - The description provided does not have many traits specifically associated with business administration. The traits such as a deep love for animals and strong empathy are less typically associated with this field. Let's assume P(E|business administration) = 0.05.

**3. Complement Likelihood, P(E|¬H)**
   - Given that there are many other fields which might better fit this personality sketch, it's reasonable to say that the complementary likelihood would be around 0.11.
   
### Computer Science

**1. Prior Probability, P(H)**
   - P(computer science) can be considered moderate since it's another highly popular field in graduate studies. Let's assume a prior probability of around 0.15 (15%).

**2. Likelihood, P(E|H)**
   - Computer Science can be well-aligned with traits such as high intelligence, puzzle-solving, and understanding abstract concepts. Say P(E|computer science) = 0.30.

**3. Complement Likelihood, P(E|¬H)**
   - Given that other fields might also fit well, the complementary likelihood could be taken as P(E|¬computer science) = 0.10.

Now let's apply Bayes' Rule to compute P(H|E) for each field:

### Bayes' Rule
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E| \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For simplication, we can assume that for each H,

\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) \]

### Business Administration

\[ P(E)_{BA} = (0.05 \times 0.15) + (0.11 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E)_{BA} = 0.0075 + 0.0935 \]
\[ P(E)_{BA} = 0.101 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.05 \times 0.15}{0.101} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.0075}{0.101} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} \approx 0.074 \]

### Computer Science

\[ P(E)_{CS} = (0.30 \times 0.15) + (0.10 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E)_{CS} = 0.045 + 0.085 \]
\[ P(E)_{CS} = 0.13 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.30 \times 0.15}{0.13} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.045}{0.13} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} \approx 0.346 \]

Now, representing these probabilities for each hypothesis:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.074,
  "computer science": 0.346
}
```

These computed probabilities suggest that, based on the personality sketch provided, Adam is more likely to be enrolled in "computer science" than in "business administration".
