To compute the probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for each field, we need to use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we're only computing each field independently and not normalizing the distribution, we'll focus on the relative likelihoods based on the provided description.

Let's start by estimating the individual probabilities:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration. This field is quite common among graduate students but not necessarily correlated with natural curiosity about nature and plants or a strong empathy for animals. Let's estimate \(P(H) = 0.1\).
   - **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam has the characteristics described given that he is studying Business Administration. Business typically attracts people enthusiastic about business, economics, and management, rather than nature and animals. Let's estimate \(P(E|H) = 0.2\).
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that Adam has the characteristics described given that he is not studying Business Administration. Given that natural curiosity, empathy, and intelligence are broad traits, they might be more common outside of Business Administration. Let's estimate \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.6\).
   
   Using Bayes Rule:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)} \approx \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{0.2 \times 0.1 + 0.6 \times 0.9} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.54} \approx 0.0357
   \]

2. **Computer Science**:
   - **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Computer Science. This field also attracts many students and could correlate with his interest in puzzles and abstract concepts. Let's estimate \(P(H) = 0.2\).
   - **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam has the described characteristics given that he is studying Computer Science. Strong empathy and love for animals might be less common but not incompatible. Estimating \(P(E|H) = 0.6\).
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that Adam has the described characteristics given that he is not studying Computer Science. These traits might be somewhat less common in fields that require less analytical thinking. Let's estimate \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.5\).
   
   Using Bayes Rule:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)} \approx \frac{0.6 \times 0.2}{0.6 \times 0.2 + 0.5 \times 0.8} = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.4} \approx 0.2308
   \]

Thus, the updated probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0357,
  "computer science": 0.2308
}
```

These values intuitively suggest that it is more likely Adam is studying computer science than business administration, given his described personality traits.
