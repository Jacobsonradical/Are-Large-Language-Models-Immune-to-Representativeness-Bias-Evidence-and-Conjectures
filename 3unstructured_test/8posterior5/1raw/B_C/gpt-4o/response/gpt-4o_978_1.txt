To compute the probabilities \( P(H | E) \) for each field (business administration and computer science), we need to evaluate the following:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the given field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam would have the personality sketch \( E \), given he is enrolled in the field \( H \).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that Adam would have the personality sketch \( E \), given he is not enrolled in field \( H \).
4. **P(E)**: The overall probability of the personality sketch, which can be computed from the probabilities above but is not strictly necessary for comparison.

Then we use Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we only need to compare the two fields provided, we'll focus on the relative likelihoods instead of absolute probabilities. 

Assumptions:
- Adam's interests and personality traits suggest he might lean more toward fields that involve problem-solving, nature, animals, and abstract thinking.
- We'll use qualitative reasoning to assess \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam enrolling in business administration might be moderate given that many students choose this field, irrespective of their natural inclinations or interests.
   - Let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \).

2. **P(E|H)**: Given Adam’s personality traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, problem-solving), these do not strongly align with typical business administration traits. This makes \( P(E|H) \) relatively low.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of having these traits without being in business administration might be higher. Assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \).

### Computer Science

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam enrolling in computer science might be moderate to high, especially if he enjoys solving puzzles and abstract thinking.
   - Let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \).

2. **P(E|H)**: Given Adam’s problem-solving and abstract thinking skills, along with empathy (often seen as valuable in human-computer interaction), \( P(E|H) \) is relatively high.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.6 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of having these traits without being in computer science is moderate since some of his interests could align with many other scientific fields. Assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \).

### Calculations

Instead of providing exact numbers for \( P(H|E) \) which requires values for \( P(E) \), we can qualitatively compare:

- For business administration:
  \[
  P(H | E) \propto P(E | H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02
  \]

- For computer science:
  \[
  P(H | E) \propto P(E | H) \cdot P(H) = 0.6 \times 0.3 = 0.18
  \]

### Results

Given the above qualitative analysis, the relative likelihoods are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.18
}
```

Here, the probabilities do not need to sum up to 1 as other fields are also possible. The values suggest that given Adam's personality traits, he is significantly more likely to be enrolled in computer science than in business administration.
