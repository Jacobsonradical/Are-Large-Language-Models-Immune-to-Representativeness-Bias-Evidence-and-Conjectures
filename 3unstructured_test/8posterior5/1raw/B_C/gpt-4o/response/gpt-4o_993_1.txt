To apply Bayes' Rule to determine the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or business administration based on his personality sketch, we need to evaluate and compute the following components for each hypothesis:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of the hypothesis, i.e., the likelihood that Adam chose that field of study without any additional information about his personality.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is in that field.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is not in that field.

Let's estimate and compute these components qualitatively based on typical associations:

### Computer Science (CS)

- **P(H)**: Suppose the prior likelihood of a graduate student enrolling in computer science is 0.2. 
- **P(E|H)**: Given his high intelligence and problem-solving skills, there is a higher likelihood that someone like Adam would enroll in CS. For estimation, let’s say 0.7.
- **P(E|¬H)**: Assuming Adam’s traits can be observed in various other fields (e.g., biology, physics), let's assign a value of 0.4.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Since \( P(E) \) acts as a normalizing constant, we can look at the relative weights:

\[ P(H|E)_{cs} \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.7 \cdot 0.2 = 0.14 \]

### Business Administration (BA)

- **P(H)**: Suppose the prior likelihood of a graduate student enrolling in business administration is 0.15.
- **P(E|H)**: Given his personality traits, it is relatively less likely but possible for Adam to be in business administration. Let’s assign a value of 0.3.
- **P(E|¬H)**: Given the broader scope of Adam’s traits (e.g., empathy, nature lover), the likelihood of observing these traits outside BA is higher. Let’s assign a value of 0.5.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E)_{ba} \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.3 \cdot 0.15 = 0.045 \]

### Normalizing the Probabilities

To make sure the relative weights are compared properly, we compute the proportion:

For computer science:
\[ P(H|E)_{cs} = \frac{0.14}{0.14 + 0.045} = \frac{0.14}{0.185} \approx 0.757 \]

For business administration:
\[ P(H|E)_{ba} = \frac{0.045}{0.14 + 0.045} = \frac{0.045}{0.185} \approx 0.243 \]

So, we have the posterior probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.757,
  "business administration": 0.243
}
```

According to these estimates, it is more likely that Adam was enrolled in computer science than business administration based on his personality traits. Note that these numbers are qualitative estimations based on typical presumptions, and in real-world scenarios, actual statistical data would refine these values.
