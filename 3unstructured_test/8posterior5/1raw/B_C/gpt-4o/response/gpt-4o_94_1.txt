Sure, let's break it down step-by-step.

### Business Administration (H1)

#### Assessing Probabilities:
1. **P(H1)**: The probability that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration without considering the personality sketch. This might be fairly low as business administration typically attracts individuals interested in finance, management, and marketing rather than nature, puzzles, empathy, and animals. Let's estimate it around 0.1 (10%).

2. **P(E|H1)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is in Business Administration. Since Adam's interests and traits don't align well with typical Business Administration characteristics, this probability is low. Let's estimate it around 0.05 (5%).

3. **P(E|¬H1)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is NOT in Business Administration. Given that his interests align more closely with fields outside of Business Administration, this would be higher. Let's estimate it around 0.2 (20%).

Using Bayes' Rule to compute \( P(H1|E) \):

\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1)}{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1) + P(E|\neg H1) \cdot P(\neg H1)} \]

\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{0.05 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9} \]

\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.18} \]

\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.185} \]

\[ P(H1|E) \approx 0.027 \]

### Computer Science (H2)

#### Assessing Probabilities:
1. **P(H2)**: The probability that Adam is enrolled in Computer Science without considering the personality sketch. Given that he enjoys solving puzzles and understands abstract concepts, this is relatively higher than for Business Administration. Let's estimate it around 0.2 (20%).

2. **P(E|H2)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is in Computer Science. Adam’s traits like high intelligence and enjoyment of puzzles fit well with Computer Science students. Therefore, this probability should be fairly high. Let's estimate it around 0.6 (60%).

3. **P(E|¬H2)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is NOT in Computer Science. This would be much lower as his traits match well with a Computer Science background. Let's estimate it around 0.15 (15%).

Using Bayes' Rule to compute \( P(H2|E) \):

\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2)}{P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2) + P(E|\neg H2) \cdot P(\neg H2)} \]

\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{0.6 \cdot 0.2 + 0.15 \cdot 0.8} \]

\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.12} \]

\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.24} \]

\[ P(H2|E) = 0.5 \]

### Results

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.027,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```

These probabilities indicate that, based on Adam's personality sketch, it is much more likely that he is enrolled in Computer Science compared to Business Administration.
