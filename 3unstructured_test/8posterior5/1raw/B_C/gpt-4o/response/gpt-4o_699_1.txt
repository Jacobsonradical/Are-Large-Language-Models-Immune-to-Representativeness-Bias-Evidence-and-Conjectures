Sure, let's go through the evaluation for both hypotheses step by step. 

### Computer Science

1. **P(H):** The overall probability that Adam was enrolled in a computer science program. In a general context, let's assume it's reasonably common but not overwhelmingly so for graduate students. I'll assign it a base probability of 0.15.
2. **P(E|H):** The conditional probability of observing the personality sketch if Adam was in computer science. Given his high intelligence, love for solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts, it aligns fairly well with the skills needed for computer science. I'll assign this a probability of 0.6.
3. **P(E|¬H):** The probability of observing the personality sketch if Adam was not in computer science. Considering that his traits align with several other fields, it would still remain reasonably high. Let's assign 0.4.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \), let's compute it first:

\[ P(E) = (0.6 \times 0.15) + (0.4 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.09 + 0.34 = 0.43 \]

Now, \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.15}{0.43} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.09}{0.43} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.209 \]

### Business Administration

1. **P(H):** The overall probability that Adam was enrolled in a business administration program. This field is also relatively common for graduate students, so I'll assign it a base probability of 0.2.
2. **P(E|H):** The conditional probability of observing the personality sketch if Adam was in business administration. While some traits fit (e.g., appreciation for hard work and dedication), others like love for animals and nature, solving puzzles, and high empathy aren't typical hallmarks. I'll assign this a lower probability, say 0.3.
3. **P(E|¬H):** The probability of observing the personality sketch if Adam was not in business administration. It would still be high since the traits are more fitting for other fields. Let's assign 0.45.

Using the same Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(E) = (0.3 \times 0.2) + (0.45 \times 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.06 + 0.36 = 0.42 \]

Now, \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{0.42} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.06}{0.42} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.143 \]

So, summarizing the results:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.209,
  "business administration": 0.143
}
