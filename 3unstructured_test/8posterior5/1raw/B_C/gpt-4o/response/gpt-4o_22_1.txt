To calculate the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being in the fields of computer science and business administration, we need to use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a constant across all hypotheses and we are only comparing \( P(H|E) \) across the given fields, we can simplify the calculation to proportional comparisons:

### Hypothesis: Computer Science
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is in computer science.
   - Given the general distribution of graduate students, let's assume \( P(H) \) for computer science might be relatively high, say 0.2 (20%).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is in computer science.
   - While computer science students do possess high intelligence and an interest in abstract concepts, the warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for nature and animals might not be as strongly associated with typical computer science personalities. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not in computer science.
   - Given that \( E \) seems to align better with fields involving nature or animals, \( P(E|\neg H) \) might be higher. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Using these estimations in Bayes' rule, we get:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

### Hypothesis: Business Administration
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is in business administration.
   - Given general distributions, let's assume \( P(H) \) for business administration is lower, say 0.1 (10%).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is in business administration.
   - Business administration students are generally not specifically associated with strong empathy for nature and animals, although intelligence and understanding hard work may fit. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.05 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not in business administration.
   - Again, since \( E \) seems more suited to nature or animal-related fields, \( P(E|\neg H) \) might be higher. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Using these estimations in Bayes' rule, we get:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.05 \cdot 0.1 = 0.005 \]

### Normalized Posterior Probabilities
To normalize these probabilities for comparison:

\[ P(H|E) \text{ for Computer Science} \propto 0.02 \]
\[ P(H|E) \text{ for Business Administration} \propto 0.005 \]

Sum is 0.02 + 0.005 = 0.025:

Normalized,
\[ P(H|E) \text{ for Computer Science} = \frac{0.02}{0.025} = 0.8 \]
\[ P(H|E) \text{ for Business Administration} = \frac{0.005}{0.025} = 0.2 \]
