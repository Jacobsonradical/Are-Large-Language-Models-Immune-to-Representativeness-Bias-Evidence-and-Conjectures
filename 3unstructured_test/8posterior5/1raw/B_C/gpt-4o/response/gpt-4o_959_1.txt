To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given Adam's personality sketch \( E \), we need to use Bayes' theorem, which is expressed as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we are comparing different fields and focusing on the relative probabilities, we can simplify to:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

We need to judge the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihoods \( P(E|\neg H) \).

1. **Business Administration:**
   - **P(H):** The prior probability that a random graduate student is studying business administration. Let's assume it is 15%.
   - **P(E|H):** The likelihood of Adam's personality given he studies business administration. Since his traits align more with a scientific or empathetic field rather than a corporate or organizational focus, let's estimate this to be relatively low, say 0.1.
   - **P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood of Adam's personality given he does not study business administration. Assuming the number of fields where his traits fit better is relatively high, let's say it's 0.3.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - **P(H):** The prior probability that a random graduate student is studying computer science. Let's assume it is 20%.
   - **P(E|H):** The likelihood of Adam's personality given he studies computer science. His curiosity, intelligence, and interest in puzzles fit well here. Let's assign a higher value, say 0.5.
   - **P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood of Adam's personality given he does not study computer science. Using the same reasoning as above, let's say it's again 0.3.

Given these estimations, we can compute the proportional values for \( P(H|E) \):

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.15 = 0.015 \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.5 \cdot 0.20 = 0.10 \]

Now we normalize these values by summing them and dividing each by the total:

\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.015}{0.015 + 0.10} = \frac{0.015}{0.115} \approx 0.130 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.10}{0.015 + 0.10} = \frac{0.10}{0.115} \approx 0.870 \]

Thus, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.130,
  "computer science": 0.870
}
