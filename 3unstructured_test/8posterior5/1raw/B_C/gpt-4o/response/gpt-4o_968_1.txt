First, let's break down the steps needed to apply Bayes' Rule. Bayes' Rule is formulated as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To evaluate \( P(H|E) \), we need the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in that specific field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not enrolled in that specific field.
4. \( P(E) \): The marginal probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.

To simplify the computation, we can assume \( P(E) \) is constant across different fields because it is common in the denominator.

For the fields of business administration and computer science:

### Business Administration
- **P(H) (prior probability)**: Let's assume prior probability for being in business administration among all graduate fields is 0.1.
- **P(E|H) (likelihood)**: While business administration doesn't typically require a deep love for nature, animals, or high empathy, let's use a moderate likelihood given the broad scope of the field: 0.3.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: For illustrative purposes, let's put it at 0.2, assuming a similar level of empathy and curiosity about nature is found in other fields but not distinctly so.

Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.03}{P(E)} \]

### Computer Science
- **P(H) (prior probability)**: Let's assume the prior probability for being in computer science among all graduate fields is 0.2 (higher considering the increasing trend in computer science enrollment).
- **P(E|H) (likelihood)**: Given his high intelligence, abstract thinking skills, and love for solving puzzles, let's use a higher likelihood: 0.6.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: For similar reasoning and illustrative purposes, assume it is 0.15.

Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.12}{P(E)} \]

Now we only need to compute the ratio comparing these probabilities without solving for \( P(E) \) explicitly.

Comparing \( P(H|E)_{BA} \) and \( P(H|E)_{CS} \):
\[
\text{Ratio for Business Administration:} \frac{0.03}{P(E)}
\]
\[
\text{Ratio for Computer Science:} \frac{0.12}{P(E)} 
\]

Now normalizing and converting these ratios directly to probabilities:

\[
\text{Total} = 0.03 + 0.12 = 0.15
\]
\[
P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.03}{0.15} = 0.2 
\]
\[
P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.12}{0.15} = 0.8 
\]

In the final format:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.8
}
