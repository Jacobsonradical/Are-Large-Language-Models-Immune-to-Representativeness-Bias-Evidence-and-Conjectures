Sure. Let's conduct the analysis for the two fields, computer science and business administration.

### Computer Science (H1)

**P(H1):**  
Computer science is a fairly common graduate field, so let's assume P(H1) = 0.2.

**P(E|H1):**  
Given Adam's love for puzzles and high intelligence, it's plausible he's in computer science. However, his strong empathy and love for animals are less closely related to this field. Let's assume P(E|H1) = 0.5.

**P(E|¬H1):**  
If Adam is not in computer science, the description could fit several other fields. Therefore, P(E|¬H1) might be reasonably close to P(E|H1), say P(E|¬H1) = 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1) + P(E|¬H1) \cdot P(¬H1) \). Let's compute \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.5 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) = 0.1 + 0.24 = 0.34 \]

Now, compute \( P(H1|E) \):

\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.34} \approx 0.294 \]

### Business Administration (H2)

**P(H2):**  
Business administration is another common graduate field. Let's assume P(H2) = 0.15.

**P(E|H2):**  
Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy don't typically align with the profile for business administration. Therefore, P(E|H2) might be lower. Let's assume P(E|H2) = 0.1.

**P(E|¬H2):**  
If Adam is not in business administration, the description of E still fits with several other fields better. So, P(E|¬H2) could be relatively higher. Let's assume P(E|¬H2) = 0.36.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2) + P(E|¬H2) \cdot P(¬H2) \). Let's compute \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.15) + (0.36 \cdot 0.85) = 0.015 + 0.306 = 0.321 \]

Now, compute \( P(H2|E) \):

\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{0.321} \approx 0.047 \]

### Summary

Here are the computed probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.294,
  "business administration": 0.047
}
