To assess the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science (CS) or business administration (BA) given his personality sketch, we'll use Bayes' theorem. The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of evidence \( E \).

We'll break down the probabilities for each field:

1. **Computer Science (CS)**
   - **P(H):** The prior probability that any given graduate student is in CS. Let's assume 20% of graduate students are in CS, so \( P(H) = 0.20 \).
   - **P(E|H):** The probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is in CS. Adam’s curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts are characteristics that align fairly well with CS. Let’s assign \( P(E|H) = 0.6 \).
   - **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is not in CS. Assuming the characteristics described are less common but not exceedingly rare in other fields, let's assign \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

2. **Business Administration (BA)**
   - **P(H):** The prior probability that any given graduate student is in BA. Let’s assume 15% of graduate students are in BA, so \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
   - **P(E|H):** The probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is in BA. The warm heart, empathy, and appreciation for hard work may align, but the abstract concepts and solving puzzles fit less. Hence, let’s assign \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).
   - **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is not in BA. Assuming these characteristics are somewhat common in other fields as well, let's assign \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

Next, we calculate \( P(E) \) for each field to normalize the probabilities. However, since we're comparing relative probabilities:

For CS:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.20}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.12}{P(E)} \]

For BA:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.045}{P(E)} \]

Given we don't need absolute probabilities, we can directly compare these ratios:

{
  "computer science": 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.045) ≈ 0.727,
  "business administration": 0.045 / (0.12 + 0.045) ≈ 0.273
}

Thus, the conditional probabilities based on Adam's personality sketch are approximately
{
  "computer science": 0.727,
  "business administration": 0.273
}
