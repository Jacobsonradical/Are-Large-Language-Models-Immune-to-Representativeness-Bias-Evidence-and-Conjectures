To compute the probabilities, we'll use Bayes' rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For each field \( H \):

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability that Adam has the described personality traits given that he is in the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability that Adam has the described personality traits given that he is not in the field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability that Adam has the described personality traits.

Let's denote:

- \( P(H_{\text{ba}}) \) as the probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) \) as the probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) \) as the probability that Adam has the described personality traits given that he is in business administration.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \) as the probability that Adam has the described personality traits given that he is in computer science.
- \( P(\neg H_{\text{ba}}) \) as the probability that Adam is not in business administration.
- \( P(\neg H_{\text{cs}}) \) as the probability that Adam is not in computer science.

While specific numerical values for these probabilities can be hard to define without further data, we can make some educated guesses based on Adam's personality traits:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H_{\text{ba}})\): Let's assume it's less likely that Adam enrolled in business administration given his traits, we might estimate it around 0.2.

   - \( P(E|H_{\text{ba}})\): Given that Adam enjoys nature, animals, and puzzles, it seems that these traits are less typical for business administration students. We might estimate this as 0.1.

   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{ba}})\): This would be higher since Adam's traits might be more common outside of business administration, let's put this at 0.5.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H_{\text{cs}})\): Given Adam's intelligence, love for puzzles, and ability to understand abstract concepts, it appears more likely that he could be enrolled in computer science. We might estimate it around 0.4.

   - \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}})\): Adam's traits seem reasonably fitting for computer science students, particularly given the problem-solving and understanding of abstract concepts. Let's estimate this as 0.3.

   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}})\): This would again be higher because there are many fields outside of computer science where his traits are fitting. Let's put this at 0.5.

Using these estimates, we can calculate \( P(H_{\text{ba}}|E) \) and \( P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) \):

\[
P(H_{\text{ba}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ba}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.5} = 0.04
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.4}{0.5} = 0.24 
\]

To present these values:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.04,
  "computer science": 0.24
}
```

These values suggest that, based on Adam's personality traits, it is more likely (by our estimates) that he is enrolled in computer science rather than business administration.
