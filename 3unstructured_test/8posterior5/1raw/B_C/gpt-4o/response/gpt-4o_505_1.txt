To apply Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the given hypotheses, we need to use the following formula:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where:

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis.

The values \( P(E) \) can be derived using the law of total probability:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

Let's make some reasonable assumptions based on the personality sketch of Adam:

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
   - Business Administration is a common field for graduate students, but Adam's described personality and interests (nature, puzzles, empathy, animals, abstract concepts) might not align perfectly with typical Business Administration students.
   - Let's assign a lower prior value: \( P(\text{Business Administration}) = 0.1 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   - The description of Adam’s personality doesn't strongly suggest that he would be in Business Administration.
   - Let's assign a lower likelihood: \( P(E|\text{Business Administration}) = 0.2 \).

3. **Likelihood of Evidence Given Not That Field \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   - Since Adam's field could be anything else, this probability should support a wide range of considered fields like natural sciences, psychology, or computer science.
   - We'll estimate this higher because Business Administration is not our only specific alternative: \( P(E|\neg \text{Business Administration}) = 0.5 \).

### Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
   - Computer Science is a popular field among graduate students, and Adam’s interest in puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts align well with this field.
   - Let's give a reasonable prior probability: \( P(\text{Computer Science}) = 0.3 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   - Adam’s attributes such as high intelligence, curiosity about abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving skills align closely with typical Computer Science profiles.
   - Let's assign a high likelihood: \( P(E|\text{Computer Science}) = 0.7 \).

3. **Likelihood of Evidence Given Not That Field \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   - The likelihood that these personality traits fit another field which isn't Computer Science but may also align well with Adam’s description.
   - We would assign this a reasonable value: \( P(E|\neg \text{Computer Science}) = 0.5 \).

### Calculation

Using the above values, we can now apply Bayes' Rule for both hypotheses.

For Business Administration:
\[
P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{Business Administration}) \cdot P(\text{Business Administration})}{P(E)}
\]
\[
P(E) \text{ is a normalizing constant that ensures probabilities sum to 1, but since we only need relative proportions it can be omitted in this step.}
\]

For Computer Science:
\[
P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science})}{P(E)}
\]

\[
\text{Normalize both probabilities for output.}
\]

### Result

The relative probabilities (values provided are illustrative):

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2 * 0.1 = 0.02",
  "computer science": "0.7 * 0.3 = 0.21"
}
```

After normalization:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.02 / (0.02 + 0.21) = 0.086",
  "computer science": "0.21 / (0.02 + 0.21) = 0.913"
}
```

Thus the revised and normalized outputs are:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.086",
  "computer science": "0.913"
}
```
