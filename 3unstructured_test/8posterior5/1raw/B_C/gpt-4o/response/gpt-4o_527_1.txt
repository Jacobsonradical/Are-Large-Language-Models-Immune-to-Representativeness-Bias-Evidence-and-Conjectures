To calculate the probabilities of Adam being enrolled in either computer science or business administration based on his personality sketch, we'll follow Bayes' theorem. The Bayes' theorem formula is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to estimate the following:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field (computer science or business administration).
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is in a specific field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in the specific field.
- \( P(E) \): The overall probability of the personality sketch (E).

Since the overall probability \( P(E) \) will cancel out when comparing the relative probabilities for different fields, we can focus on the numerator of Bayes' theorem for our comparison.

### Estimations:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(H_\text{CS}) \): The base rate of graduate students in computer science. Let's assume this is 0.1, acknowledging that not all graduate students are in computer science but a reasonable fraction are.
   - \( P(E|H_\text{CS}) \): The likelihood that Adam's personality fits a computer science grad student. Considering his intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and understanding of abstract concepts fit well, we might estimate this high, say 0.7.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_\text{CS}) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch if Adam is not in computer science. This could be lower, since puzzle-solving and abstract thinking are less critical in non-technical fields. Suppose we estimate this at 0.2.

2. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H_\text{BA}) \): The base rate of graduate students in business administration. Let's assume this is similar to CS at 0.1.
   - \( P(E|H_\text{BA}) \): The likelihood that Adam's personality fits a business administration grad student. Given business requires empathy and appreciation for hard work, but is less reliant on solving puzzles or abstract thinking, we might estimate this moderate, say 0.3.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_\text{BA}) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch if Adam is not in business administration. Given that we estimated non-business fields could fit his personality moderately better, let's say this is around 0.4.

### Calculations:

For computer science:
\[ P(H_\text{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_\text{CS}) \cdot P(H_\text{CS})}{P(E)} \propto 0.7 \times 0.1 = 0.07 \]

For business administration:
\[ P(H_\text{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_\text{BA}) \cdot P(H_\text{BA})}{P(E)} \propto 0.3 \times 0.1 = 0.03 \]

### Normalization:

To get relative probabilities:
\[ P(H_\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.07}{0.07 + 0.03} = 0.7 \]
\[ P(H_\text{BA}|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.07 + 0.03} = 0.3 \]

Thus, the relative probabilities are as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
