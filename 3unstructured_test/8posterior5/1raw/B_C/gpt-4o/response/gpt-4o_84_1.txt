To calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' theorem, we need to understand the following components:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of the hypothesis H, that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the evidence E given hypothesis H.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the evidence E given that hypothesis H is not true.
- \( P(E) \) is derived from combining \( P(E|H)\cdot P(H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Given that we do not have detailed numerical priors or probabilities, we will make educated estimates based on the personality sketch and the characteristics typically associated with different fields of study.

Let's proceed with our estimation:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H_{cs}) \): The general prior for any student being in computer science, let's estimate it reasonably based on general enrollment. Let’s assume \( P(H_{cs}) = 0.2 \) (20%).
   - \( P(E|H_{cs}) \): Given Adam’s curiosity about nature, puzzle-solving ability, intelligence, and abstract thinking, he fits well in computer science. So, we estimate \( P(E|H_{cs}) = 0.7 \) (high probability).
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{cs}) \): Given Adam’s traits are common in many fields, we estimate \( P(E|\neg H_{cs}) = 0.4 \).

   Using Bayes' Theorem: 
   \[
   P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs})}{P(E)}
   \]
   Since we have multiple fields, \( P(E) \) is generally influenced by both hypotheses:
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs}) + P(E|\neg H_{cs}) \cdot P(\neg H_{cs}) 
   \]
   \[
   P(E) = 0.7 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8 = 0.14 + 0.32 = 0.46
   \]
   So,
   \[
   P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.46} \approx 0.304
   \]

2. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H_{ba}) \): The general prior for any student being in business administration, let’s assume \( P(H_{ba}) = 0.2 \) (20%).
   - \( P(E|H_{ba}) \): Although empathy and a warm heart might be beneficial in business administration, Adam's deep love for nature and animals makes it less direct. We estimate \( P(E|H_{ba}) = 0.3 \) (moderate probability).
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{ba}) \): Similar to the general population fitting other fields, we estimate \( P(E|\neg H_{ba}) = 0.5 \).

   Using Bayes' Theorem:
   \[
   P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{ba}) \cdot P(H_{ba})}{P(E)}
   \]
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|H_{ba}) \cdot P(H_{ba}) + P(E|\neg H_{ba}) \cdot P(\neg H_{ba}) 
   \]
   \[
   P(E) = 0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.8 = 0.06 + 0.4 = 0.46
   \]
   So,
   \[
   P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.46} \approx 0.130
   \]

So the estimated probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.304,
  "business administration": 0.130
}
```

These computations assume no significant bias within the prior probabilities, and they are rough estimates based on the available qualitative data about Adam and the fields.
