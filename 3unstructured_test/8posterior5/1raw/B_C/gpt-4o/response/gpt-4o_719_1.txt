To compute the probability of Adam being enrolled in each field (computer science and business administration) given his personality sketch, we will use Bayes' theorem. We'll follow these steps:

1. **Estimate Prior Probabilities (P(H)):**
   - This is the probability of Adam being in each field without considering his personality sketch.
    
2. **Estimate Likelihoods (P(E|H)):**
   - This is the probability of Adam's personality sketch being as described, given that he is enrolled in each specific field.

3. **Estimate Complementary Likelihoods (P(E|\neg H)):**
   - This is the probability of Adam's personality sketch being as described, given that he is not enrolled in each specific field.

Since we do not have exact numerical values, we will make reasonable assumptions based on the nature of each field and Adam's personality sketch, then compute P(H|E) (the probability of Adam being in each field, given his personality sketch).

### Computer Science:

1. **P(H):**
   - Let’s assume there are many fields of study, so P(H) for any particular field might be reasonably set to, say, 0.1.

2. **P(E|H):**
   - Given that Adam's personality includes high intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles, which are traits well-aligned with computer science, we might set P(E|H) relatively high. Let's estimate it at 0.7.

3. **P(E|\neg H):**
   - This is the probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in computer science. Let's assume the likelihood of having his described traits in other fields isn't uncommon but somewhat less likely than in computer science. Let's estimate it at 0.4.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is a normalizing factor, calculated as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Plugging in values:
\[ P(E) = 0.7 \cdot 0.1 + 0.4 \cdot 0.9 = 0.07 + 0.36 = 0.43 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.43} \approx 0.16 \]

### Business Administration:

1. **P(H):**
   - Again, we start with a prior probability, P(H) = 0.1.

2. **P(E|H):**
   - Given Adam's strong empathy, appreciation for hard work, and warm heart, some of these traits might fit well in business administration, although not as specifically as computer science. Let's say P(E|H) = 0.5.

3. **P(E|\neg H):**
   - The probability of Adam’s personality sketch in other fields, P(E|\neg H), may not be vastly different from business administration. We'll estimate it at 0.45.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.5 \cdot 0.1 + 0.45 \cdot 0.9 = 0.05 + 0.405 = 0.455 \]

Thus, for business administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.1}{0.455} \approx 0.11 \]

Finally, we compile our results:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.16,
  "business administration": 0.11
}
```

These values are illustrative and based on reasonable assumptions. In an actual scenario, more precise data and probabilities would be needed for a definitive calculation.
