To calculate the probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for each field, we need to use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we don't have \(P(E)\), we can compare \(P(H|E)\) relatively by focusing on the numerators \(P(E|H) \cdot P(H)\). Here’s a step-by-step approach for each field:

### Computer Science

1. **Prior probability \(P(H)\)**:
   - Assume \(P(\text{CS}) = 0.25\) (It's a popular field, but not overwhelmingly so).

2. **Conditional probability \(P(E|H)\)** (probability of Adam's personality given that he is in CS):
   - Given Adam's traits – curiosity, puzzle-solving, intelligence, and abstract thinking – these could fit well with Computer Science.
   - Assume \(P(E|\text{CS}) = 0.8\).

3. **Conditional probability \(P(E|\neg H)\)**:
   - The probability of Adam's personality in any field other than CS might be similar, depending on how broadly we define the fields.
   - Assume \(P(E|\neg \text{CS}) = 0.1\).

Using the values:
\[ P(H|E)_\text{CS} = \frac{P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{P(E)} \]

### Business Administration

1. **Prior probability \(P(H)\)**:
   - Assume \(P(\text{BA}) = 0.20\) (Also a fairly popular field, but less expected for Adam's personality).

2. **Conditional probability \(P(E|H)\)** (probability of Adam's personality given that he is in BA):
   - Traits like compassion and empathy may fit somewhat, but puzzle-solving and deep interest in nature might be less relevant.
   - Assume \(P(E|\text{BA}) = 0.4\).

3. **Conditional probability \(P(E|\neg H)\)**:
   - Use the same general probability for other fields.
   - Assume \(P(E|\neg \text{BA}) = 0.1\).

Using the values:
\[ P(H|E)_\text{BA} = \frac{P(E|\text{BA}) \cdot P(\text{BA})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.20}{P(E)} \]

### Comparison and Normalization

Without \(P(E)\), we derive a relative comparison:

- For Computer Science:
\[ \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{P(E)} = 0.20 \]
- For Business Administration:
\[ \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.20}{P(E)} = 0.08 \]

We can normalize these probabilities relatively here:
- Total relative probability = 0.20 + 0.08 = 0.28

\[ P(H|E)_\text{CS} = \frac{0.20}{0.28} \approx 0.71 \]
\[ P(H|E)_\text{BA} = \frac{0.08}{0.28} \approx 0.29 \]

Here is the formatted result:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.71,
  "business administration": 0.29
}
```

These values indicate that based on Adam's personality, he is more likely to be enrolled in Computer Science compared to Business Administration. Note that these are relative probabilities based on the assumptions and given data.
