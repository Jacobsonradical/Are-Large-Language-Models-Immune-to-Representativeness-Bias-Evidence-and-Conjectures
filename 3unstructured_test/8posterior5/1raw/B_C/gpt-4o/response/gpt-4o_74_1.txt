To apply Bayes' Rule, follow these steps:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that a student was enrolled in a given field. 
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in a specific field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in a specific field.

We will then use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's denote the fields briefly as follows:
- BA: Business Administration
- CS: Computer Science

### Assumptions:
1. Assume a rough estimate for \( P(H) \) (the base rates for students enrolling in those fields).
2. Estimate \( P(E|H) \) based on how well the personality sketch aligns with each field.
3. Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) based on how likely students in *any other* field might exhibit the given personality sketch.

#### 1. Prior probabilities \( P(H) \):
- For simplification purposes, let's assume:
  - \( P(BA) = 0.2 \)
  - \( P(CS) = 0.2 \)

#### 2. Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):
- Business Administration:
  - Generally, BA students have strong people skills and may not necessarily possess strong empathy for animals or enjoy puzzles to the same degree.
  - Therefore, \( P(E|BA) \) might be relatively low: let's say 0.1.
  
- Computer Science:
  - Given Adam's interest in nature, puzzles, and abstract concepts, this personality aligns well with a typical CS student who often enjoys abstract thinking and solving complex problems.
  - Thus \( P(E|CS) \) might be relatively high: let's say 0.6.

#### 3. Probability of the evidence \( P(E) \):
This is \( \sum\limits_{H}(P(E|H) \times P(H)) + \sum\limits_{\neg H}(P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H)) \).
  - For simplicity, assume remaining fields collectively have \( P(E|\neg H) \) relatively uniform at 0.2 with total collective base rate 0.6
  - Thus, \( P(E) \approx  0.1 \times 0.2 + 0.6 \times 0.2 + 0.2 \times 0.6 = 0.02 + 0.12 + 0.12 = 0.26 \) 

### Calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field:
- **Business Administration**:
  \[
  P(BA|E) = \frac{P(E|BA) \times P(BA)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.26} \approx 0.077
  \]

- **Computer Science**:
  \[
  P(CS|E) = \frac{P(E|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(E)} = \frac{ 0.6 \times 0.2}{0.26} \approx 0.462
  \]

So the final result in the specified format is:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.077,
  "computer science": 0.462
}
```
