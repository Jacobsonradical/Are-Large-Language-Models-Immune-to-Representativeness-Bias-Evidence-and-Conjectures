To answer this question using Bayes' rule, we need to compute \( P(H|E) \), the probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch \( E \).

Bayes' rule is stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence.

Given we don’t have specific numerical probabilities, we’ll use qualitative reasoning to estimate these values.

### For Computer Science

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Computer Science. Given it's a common field for graduate students with high intelligence and an interest in abstract concepts, let's estimate this as relatively high, say 0.3.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability that Adam's personality sketch fits someone in Computer Science. His intelligence and puzzle-solving interest fit well, but his deep love for nature and animals might not be as common. Let's estimate this as 0.4.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability that Adam's personality sketch fits someone not in Computer Science. Given the diversity of fields and his specific interests in nature and animals, let's estimate this as 0.6.

Now we can compute:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.4 \cdot 0.3 = 0.12 \]

### For Business Administration

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration. It's a common field, but less so for individuals with his personality sketch. Let's estimate this as 0.2.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability that Adam's personality fits Business Administration. Given his quiet nature, empathy, and love for animals, this field seems less likely. Let's estimate this as 0.1.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability that Adam's personality fits someone not in Business Administration. More likely given his specific interests, let's estimate this as 0.7.

Now we can compute:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

Given these qualitative assessments, we normalize the values to find the actual probabilities.

### Normalization

To normalize the probabilities:

1. Calculate total unnormalized probability: \( 0.12 + 0.02 = 0.14 \).
2. Normalize each value:
   - For Computer Science: \( \frac{0.12}{0.14} \approx 0.857 \).
   - For Business Administration: \( \frac{0.02}{0.14} \approx 0.143 \).

So, the final results are:

{
  "computer science": 0.857,
  "business administration": 0.143
}

This ranking reflects the higher likelihood of Adam being enrolled in Computer Science compared to Business Administration, based on the provided personality sketch.
