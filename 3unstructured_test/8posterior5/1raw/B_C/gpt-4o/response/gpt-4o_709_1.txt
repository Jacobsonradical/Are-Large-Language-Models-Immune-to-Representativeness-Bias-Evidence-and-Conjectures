Given the information about Adam's personality and interests, I'll make judgments about the probabilities involved for both business administration and computer science.

### Business Administration

**P(H):** This is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration. Since he has a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication, and high intelligence, it could be probable, but his strong curiosity about nature and deep love for animals might make other fields more likely. I will assign P(H) = 0.1 as a conservative estimate.

**P(E|H):** This is the probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is enrolled in business administration. The alignment of Adam’s personality with business administration is moderate as his traits such as high intelligence and understanding of hard work fit, but his curiosity about nature and love for animals are less typical for this field. I'll assign P(E|H) = 0.2.

**P(E|\neg H):** This is the probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is not enrolled in business administration. This includes all other possible fields. Given his alignment with other fields (e.g., biology, environmental science), we will estimate this as P(E|\neg H) = 0.8.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assuming P(E) for simplicity,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.8} = 0.025 \]

### Computer Science

**P(H):** This is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science. Given his attributes like high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and love for solving puzzles, this field is more likely. I will assign P(H) = 0.2.

**P(E|H):** This is the probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is enrolled in computer science. The traits align well with the field of computer science. I would use P(E|H) = 0.5.

**P(E|\neg H):** This is the probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is not enrolled in computer science. Given his alignment with other fields like biology, environmental science, etc., I’ll estimate P(E|\neg H) = 0.6.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assuming P(E) for simplicity,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.6} = 0.167 \]

So, the final probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.025,
  "computer science": 0.167
}
