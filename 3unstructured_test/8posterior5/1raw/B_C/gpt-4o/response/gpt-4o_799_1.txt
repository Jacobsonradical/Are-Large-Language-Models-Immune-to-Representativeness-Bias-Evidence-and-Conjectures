To apply Bayes' rule and compute \( P(H|E) \), let's first break down the problem into its components:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a certain field, which we'll assume to be the same because we are not given additional prior information.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in a certain field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in that certain field.

Bayes' Rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is constant across different fields, the relative probabilities \( P(H|E) \) can be compared using the numerator \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

### Assigning Probabilities

1. **Business Administration:**

   - \( P(H_{BA}) \): Let's assume a neutral prior, \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.5 \)
   - \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): Generally, business administration students may not have a close association with nature, animals, or solving puzzles. Therefore, we will estimate a lower likelihood, say \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \): I will estimate this as average for another field, say \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.3 \).

2. **Computer Science:**

   - \( P(H_{CS}) \): Let's assume a neutral prior, \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.5 \)
   - \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Computer science students often have an affinity for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, which fits well with Adam's description. Therefore, let's estimate this as higher, say \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.7 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \): Again, we will estimate this as average for another field, \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.3 \).

Using these probabilities:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

For Business Administration:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.5 = 0.05 \]

For Computer Science:

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto 0.7 \cdot 0.5 = 0.35 \]

Finally, normalizing these to sum to 1:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.05}{0.05 + 0.35} = \frac{0.05}{0.4} = 0.125 \]

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.35}{0.05 + 0.35} = \frac{0.35}{0.4} = 0.875 \]

Thus, the results are:

{
  "business administration": 0.125,
  "computer science": 0.875
}
