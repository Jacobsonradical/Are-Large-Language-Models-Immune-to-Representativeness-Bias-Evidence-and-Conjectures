Let's break down the problem using Bayes' Theorem, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing evidence \( E \) given that \( H \) is false.

Given that the total doesn't need to add up to 1 and there are other potential fields of study, let's proceed with reasonable assumptions to estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). 

For business administration:
- \( P(H) \): Business administration programs are common for graduate students, but Adam's personality sketch doesn't strongly align with typical traits emphasized in business administration. Let's say \( P(H) \) is relatively low, around 0.1.
- \( P(E|H) \): The traits described in Adam's sketch (curiosity about nature, love for animals, intelligence, empathy) are not particularly aligned with what is typically emphasized in business administration. Let's assume \( P(E|H) \) is low, around 0.1.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given that there are other fields where Adam's traits would be more common, let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) \) is moderate, around 0.4.

For computer science:
- \( P(H) \): Computer science programs are also common among graduate students, and Adam’s intelligence and aptitude for solving puzzles suggest a decent fit. Let's assume \( P(H) \) is moderate, around 0.2.
- \( P(E|H) \): High intelligence and problem-solving skills are somewhat aligned with computer science, though the love for nature and animals is less directly relevant. Let's assume \( P(E|H) \) is moderate, around 0.3.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Considering Adam's traits, they may still be found in other fields more oriented toward nature and empathy. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) \) is around 0.4.

Using Bayes' Theorem, the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) can be estimated for each field:

1. Business Administration:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

\( P(E) \) is the normalization term ensuring probabilities sum, but since specific values aren’t critical for comparison and given \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \), a rough normalization can be assumed. 

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.01}{P(E)} \]

Without exact normalization, this will be a low value.

2. Computer Science:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.06}{P(E)} \]

Again, this appears higher than Business Administration’s estimate.

Assuming \( P(E) \) denotes some common comparison for refinement:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

Expressing a higher likelihood for the traits aligning with Computer Science, yet aware exact \( P(E) \) isn't explicitly defined, Computer Science trumps Business Administration given the provided sketch and practical assumptions.
