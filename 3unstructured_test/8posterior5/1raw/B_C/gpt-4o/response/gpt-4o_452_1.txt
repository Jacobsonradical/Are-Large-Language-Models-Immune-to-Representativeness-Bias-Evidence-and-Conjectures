Sure, let's break this down.

Given:
- \( E \) denotes the personality sketch of Adam.
- \( H \) denotes the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
- \( H_1 \) = Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( H_2 \) = Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( \neg H \) denotes that Adam was enrolled in a field other than the one specified in \( H \).

To find \( P(H|E) \), we use Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
However, since \( P(E) \) is common for all hypotheses, we primarily need to compare:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H)P(H) \]

Let's estimate the values:

### Computer Science
**P(H1):** (Prior probability Adam was in computer science)
- Computer science is a relatively common field, especially for individuals of high intelligence and with an interest in solving puzzles.
- Let's assign a moderately high prior, \( P(H1) \approx 0.3 \).

**P(E|H1):** (Probability of E given H1)
- High intelligence, solving puzzles, abstract thinking, and genuine curiosity can be strong indicators for computer science, though it doesn't directly relate to warmth, empathy, and love for animals.
- Let's assign a moderate likelihood, \( P(E|H1) \approx 0.4 \).

**P(E|\neg H1):** (Probability of E given not H1)
- Given the broad characteristics, the sketch might fit other fields just as well or better.
- Let's assign a likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H1) \approx 0.6 \).

### Business Administration
**P(H2):** (Prior probability Adam was in business administration)
- Business administration usually involves leadership, teamwork, and practical applications more than solving puzzles and understanding nature.
- Let's assign a lower prior, \( P(H2) \approx 0.1 \).

**P(E|H2):** (Probability of E given H2)
- The personality traits of warmth, empathy, and appreciation for hard work might be good indicators, but the love for nature, solving puzzles, and abstract thinking are less indicative.
- Let's assign a low likelihood, \( P(E|H2) \approx 0.2 \).

**P(E|\neg H2):** (Probability of E given not H2)
- Similar to above, as there are multiple fields that might fit the personality sketch better.
- Let's assign \( P(E|\neg H2) \approx 0.8 \).

### Using Bayes' Theorem
#### Computer Science
\[ P(H1|E) \propto P(E|H1)P(H1) \]
\[ P(H1|E) \approx 0.4 \times 0.3 = 0.12 \]

#### Business Administration
\[ P(H2|E) \propto P(E|H2)P(H2) \]
\[ P(H2|E) \approx 0.2 \times 0.1 = 0.02 \]

### Final Answers
By comparing the proportional values:
