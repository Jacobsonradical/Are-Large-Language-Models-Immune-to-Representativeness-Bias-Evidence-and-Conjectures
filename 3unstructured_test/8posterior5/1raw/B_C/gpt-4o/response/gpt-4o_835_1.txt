To determine the likelihood that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or computer science, given his personality sketch \( E \), we will apply Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule can be formulated as:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Given the fields, let's denote:
- \( H_1 \): Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( H_2 \): Adam was enrolled in computer science.

Let's evaluate \( P(H_1|E) \) and \( P(H_2|E) \).

### Business Administration
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H_1) \)**:
   - Business administration is a common field, but probably less aligned with Adam's personality traits focusing on nature, animals, and intelligence in abstract concepts.
   - Let's assign \( P(H_1) \) to be moderately typical: \( P(H_1) = 0.05 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_1) \)**:
   - Many aspects of Adam's personality, such as a love for nature and animals, strong empathy, and quiet demeanor, do not strongly correlate with the common traits expected for a business administration student.
   - Assign a low value: \( P(E|H_1) = 0.02 \).

3. **Complementary Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_1) \)**:
   - Given that there are many fields of study, many might better align with Adam's traits than business administration.
   - Adjust accordingly: \( P(E|\neg H_1) = 0.10 \).

### Computer Science
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H_2) \)**:
   - Computer science is a field where abstract thinking is crucial. Given Adam's intelligence and love for puzzles, this field seems reasonably likely.
   - Assign a somewhat higher prior: \( P(H_2) = 0.20 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_2) \)**:
   - Strong alignment with Adam's high intelligence, enjoyment of puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts.
   - High value: \( P(E|H_2) = 0.70 \).

3. **Complementary Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_2) \)**:
   - Many other fields (like natural sciences) may also fit well.
   - Adjust slightly lower: \( P(E|\neg H_2) = 0.30 \).

### Applying Bayes' Rule
- For business administration:
\[
P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.02 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)}
\]

- For computer science:
\[
P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.70 \cdot 0.20}{P(E)}
\]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant and can be ignored for relative comparisons:

Normalization factor:
\[
P(E) \propto P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)
\]
\[
P(E) \approx (0.02 \cdot 0.05) + (0.70 \cdot 0.20)
\]
\[
P(E) \approx 0.001 + 0.14 = 0.141
\]

Final comparisons:

- For business administration:
\[
P(H_1|E) \approx \frac{0.001}{0.141} \approx 0.007
\]

- For computer science:
\[
P(H_2|E) \approx \frac{0.14}{0.141} \approx 0.993
\]
