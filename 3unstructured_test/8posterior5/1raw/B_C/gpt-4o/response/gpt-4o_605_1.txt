To use Bayes' Theorem to compute the probability Adam was enrolled in a specific field, given his personality sketch, we'll need to determine the following probabilities:

- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood of the evidence (the personality sketch) given that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likelihood of the evidence given that Adam was not enrolled in the field.

Bayes' Theorem can then be expressed as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be determined by summing over all possible fields using the law of total probability.

Assumptions:
- For simplicity, let's assume that \( P(H) = 0.1 \) for any given field as a rough initial prior, given that there are many graduate fields.
- We can subjectively estimate \( P(E|H) \) based on how well the personality sketch fits a student in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) might be estimated similarly by considering the likelihood of the evidence across all other fields.

### Business Administration
- \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): The sketch suggests a strong empathy and appreciation for hard work. This might align moderately with Business Administration.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \): The sketch fits reasonably well into various other fields. Let's assume:
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.2 \)

### Computer Science
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): The sketch indicates high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, and an enjoyment of puzzles, all of which fit well with Computer Science.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.6 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \): The evidence fits less well overall in non-CS fields but still moderately for fields requiring high intelligence.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.3 \)

Now let's compute \( P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \) and \( P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \) using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

### Calculation for Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.3 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.18} = \frac{0.03}{0.21} \approx 0.143 \]

### Calculation for Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.1}{0.6 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.27} = \frac{0.06}{0.33} \approx 0.182 \]

So the probabilities are:

\{
  "business administration": 0.143,
  "computer science": 0.182
\}
