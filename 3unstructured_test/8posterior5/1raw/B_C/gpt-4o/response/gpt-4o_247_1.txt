To solve this, we need to apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll need to estimate the following probabilities:
1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam's personality traits given that he is enrolled in a given field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam’s personality traits given that he is not enrolled in a given field.
4. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of Adam’s personality traits.

Let's start by making some educated guesses:

### Computer Science
**P(H) - Prior Probability:** \
The probability of any given student being in computer science. This is generally a popular graduate field but not overwhelmingly so. Let's assume 10%.

\[ P(H)_{CS} \approx 0.10 \]

**P(E|H) - Probability of personality given computer science:** \
Computer Science tends to attract students who are intelligent, good with puzzles, and understand abstract concepts, which aligns well with Adam's personality.

\[ P(E|H)_{CS} \approx 0.80 \]

**P(E|\neg H) - Probability of personality given not computer science:** \
Adam's traits are somewhat common in other fields related to intelligence and problem-solving but not necessarily as prevalent.

\[ P(E|\neg H)_{CS} \approx 0.30 \]

### Business Administration
**P(H) - Prior Probability:** \
Business Administration is also a common graduate field. Let's assume a similar prior to maintain consistency.

\[ P(H)_{BA} \approx 0.10 \]

**P(E|H) - Probability of personality given business administration:** \
Business Administration would require empathy and the ability to solve problems, yet the connection isn't as strong as it is with Computer Science.

\[ P(E|H)_{BA} \approx 0.50 \]

**P(E|\neg H) - Probability of personality given not business administration:** \
These personality traits are likely less common in Business Administration compared to the broader non-business fields.

\[ P(E|\neg H)_{BA} \approx 0.40 \]

### Calculation

We'll use Bayes' Rule to find \( P(H|E) \).

#### For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{P(E|H)_{CS} \cdot P(H)_{CS}}{P(E)_{CS}} \]

*Assuming \( P(E) \) is equally likely across all fields (i.e., normalizing factor):*
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.10}{0.80 \cdot 0.10 + 0.30 \cdot (1 - 0.10)} \]

\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.27} \]

\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \approx 0.23 \]

#### For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{P(E|H)_{BA} \cdot P(H)_{BA}}{P(E)_{BA}} \]

*Assuming \( P(E) \) is equally likely across all fields (i.e., normalizing factor):*
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.50 \cdot 0.10}{0.50 \cdot 0.10 + 0.40 \cdot (1 - 0.10)} \]

\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.05}{0.05 + 0.36} \]

\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.05}{0.41} \approx 0.12 \]
