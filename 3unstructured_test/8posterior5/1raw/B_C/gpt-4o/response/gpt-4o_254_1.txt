To apply Bayes' rule and compute \( P(H|E) \), we need to estimate the relevant probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a certain field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): Probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is in a certain field \( H \).
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not in that certain field \( H \).

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( P(E) \) can be thought of as a normalizing constant, which ensures that the probabilities sum up to 1 when considering all possible fields of study. For simplicity, we might not compute this directly and instead provide relative probabilities.

Let's assess these probabilities for both "computer science" and "business administration":

### Computer Science
1. \( P(H) \) (computer science)
    - Computer science is a common field, so let's assume a moderate prior. 
    \[ P(H)_{cs} = 0.2 \]

2. \( P(E|H) \) (computer science)
    - Adam is high in intelligence, enjoys solving puzzles, and understands abstract concepts, which align well with computer science traits. 
    \[ P(E|H)_{cs} = 0.8 \]

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \)
    - Adam's traits are somewhat general but also present in other fields. 
    \[ P(E|\neg H)_{cs} = 0.4 \]

Using Bayes' rule (relative):
\[ P(H|E)_{cs} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{0.8 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8} \approx 0.5 \]

### Business Administration
1. \( P(H) \) (business administration)
    - Business administration is also a common field. 
    \[ P(H)_{ba} = 0.2 \]

2. \( P(E|H) \) (business administration)
    - Adam's strong understanding of hard work and empathy could align, but he doesn't show explicit traits commonly associated with business administration such as leadership or finance skills.
    \[ P(E|H)_{ba} = 0.4 \]

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \)
    - Adam fits better in other fields rather than business administration.
    \[ P(E|\neg H)_{ba} = 0.5 \]

Using Bayes' rule (relative):
\[ P(H|E)_{ba} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.8} \approx 0.1 \]

Finally, the relative probabilities for Adam being in each field based on the given personality sketch are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

Note that these are relative probabilities and don't sum to 1 because we are only considering two of potentially numerous fields.
