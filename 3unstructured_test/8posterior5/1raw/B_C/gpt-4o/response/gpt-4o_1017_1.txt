Sure, let's use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that Adam was enrolled in each field based on his personality sketch. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that there are other fields besides computer science and business administration, we will still provide some reasonable estimates.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being in a specific field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality given that he is in a specific field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality given that he is not in a specific field.
4. **P(E)**: The overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch (normalizing factor, can be skipped for relative comparison).

### Estimations and Reasoning:

#### Computer Science:

- **P(H)**: Let's assume the prior probability that any graduate student is in computer science is relatively high because it’s a popular field. We might estimate this around 0.2 (20%).
- **P(E|H)**: Adam's strong intelligence, appreciation for abstract concepts, and interest in solving puzzles align well with computer science. Estimate this high, about 0.8 (80%).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Given Adam's interests and personality, outside of computer science, these traits are less specific but still somewhat common. Estimate this around 0.3 (30%).

#### Business Administration:

- **P(H)**: The prior probability of being in business administration may be slightly lower since it's a different skill set than what Adam’s personality suggests. Estimate this around 0.1 (10%).
- **P(E|H)**: Although some traits like high intelligence and empathy might fit business administration, others like love for animals and curiosity about nature do not as much. Estimate this lower, about 0.2 (20%).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Relative to business administration, other fields would match Adam’s personality better. Estimate this around 0.4 (40%).

#### Compute P(H|E) using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We can omit \( P(E) \) as we're comparing relative probabilities.

##### For Computer Science:
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) \propto P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) = 0.8 \times 0.2 = 0.16 \]

##### For Business Administration:
\[ P(\text{BA}|E) \propto P(E|\text{BA}) \cdot P(\text{BA}) = 0.2 \times 0.1 = 0.02 \]

### Normalize Probabilities:

\[ \text{Total} = 0.16 + 0.02 = 0.18 \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.16}{0.18} \approx 0.89 \]
\[ P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.18} \approx 0.11 \]

### Final Answer:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.89,
  "business administration": 0.11
}
```

Please note that the values are relative probabilities, and the total could indeed be 1.0 when considering only these two fields. If considering additional fields, these values may change accordingly.
