To estimate the probabilities given the personality sketch of Adam, we'll use Bayes' Theorem, which is stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we do not know \(P(E)\), we'll focus on estimating relative probabilities instead of absolute values.

Here are our assumptions and the steps involved:

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**: This is the likelihood of Adam being in a specific field without any additional information. Given the general popularity of fields and the context of graduate studies, we might make educated guesses. Let's assume:

   - \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.2 \)
   - \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.3 \)

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: This is the likelihood of having the given personality sketch if Adam is in a specific field. 

   - For business administration, interests in solving puzzles, nature, abstract concepts, and strong empathy might be less directly associated with typical business administration traits, but it could be reasonably possible.
     Let's say: \( P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.2 \)
   
   - For computer science, interests in solving puzzles, nature, and understanding abstract concepts fit well with typical traits of students in this field.
     Let's estimate: \( P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.6 \)

3. **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)**: This is the likelihood of having the personality sketch if Adam is not in that specific field. This can be tricky without additional context, but we can assume it considers a broad array of other fields where the sketch might fit. Let's generalize:

   - For business administration, let's assume \( P(E|\neg\text{business administration}) = 0.4 \)
   - For computer science, let's assume \( P(E|\neg\text{computer science}) = 0.3 \)

Now apply Bayes' Theorem:

### Business Administration

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same across both fields for comparison purposes:

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) \propto P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) \]

Using our values:

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.2 = 0.04 \]

### Computer Science

\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) \propto P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) \]

Using our values:

\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) \propto 0.6 \cdot 0.3 = 0.18 \]

### Normalize for Comparison

To normalize the probabilities for comparison between these fields, we convert them into relative probabilities:

- For business administration: \( \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.18} \approx 0.18 \)
- For computer science: \( \frac{0.18}{0.04 + 0.18} \approx 0.82 \)

Based on these calculations, the relative probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": 0.18,
  "computer science": 0.82
}
