In order to compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we will use Bayes' rule, which is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To perform the calculations, we need to make some estimations for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Since we don't have exact statistics, these values will be based on logical reasoning about the fit between Adam's personality sketch and each field.

1. **Field: Business Administration**
   - **Hypothesis (H): Adam was enrolled in Business Administration.**
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that any given graduate student might be in Business Administration (assuming a balanced but non-uniform distribution of fields). Let's assume:
     \[ P(H)_{BA} = 0.2 \]
   - \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam having the described personality if he is in Business Administration.
     - Strong empathy and warm heart might be advantageous in business, especially in roles like HR, but this is not a major indicator.
     - Curiosity about nature and puzzles might be less relevant.
     - Love for animals might not be particularly relevant.
     - We estimate \( P(E|H) \) to be relatively low:
     \[ P(E|H)_{BA} = 0.2 \]
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam having the described personality if he isn’t in Business Administration.
     - Assuming the other fields might not align better either or average match:
     \[ P(E|\neg H)_{BA} = 0.3 \]

   Using Bayes' rule:
   \[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.2 \times 0.2}{0.3} \approx 0.1333 \]

2. **Field: Computer Science**
   - **Hypothesis (H): Adam was enrolled in Computer Science.**
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that any given graduate student might be in Computer Science. Let's assume:
     \[ P(H)_{CS} = 0.3 \]
   - \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam having the described personality if he is in Computer Science.
     - Curiosity about nature and puzzles may translate to a curiosity about systems and solving problems, fitting well with Computer Science.
     - High intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication will fit strong alignment.
     - We estimate \( P(E|H) \) to be higher:
     \[ P(E|H)_{CS} = 0.5 \]
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam having the described personality if he isn’t in Computer Science.
     - Assuming not a specific misalignment:
     \[ P(E|\neg H)_{CS} = 0.4 \]

   Using Bayes' rule:
   \[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.5 \times 0.3}{0.4} \approx 0.375 \]

**Results**:
{
  "business administration": 0.1333,
  "computer science": 0.375
