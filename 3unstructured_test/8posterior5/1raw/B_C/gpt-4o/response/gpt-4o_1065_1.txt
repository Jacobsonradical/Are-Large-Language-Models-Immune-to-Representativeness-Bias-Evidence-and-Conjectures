To solve this, we need to make reasonable guesses based on the personality sketch of Adam. 

Firstly, let's state what’s given:
- Personality Sketch (E): Adam is curious about nature and plants, quiet, enjoys puzzles, empathetic, loves animals, intelligent, and good at understanding abstract concepts.

Considering the fields of business administration and computer science, we now need to judge P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|¬H). Here is how they can be assessed:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - P(H): Let's assume the probability that any random graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in business administration is approximately 0.2 (20%).
   - P(E|H): Given Adam’s traits, it seems less likely as business administration often requires extroversion and networking skills. Let’s assume 0.1.
   - P(E|¬H): The probability that Adam has such traits if he’s not in business administration is likely higher, since quite a few of his traits align more with other fields such as science-related fields. Let's assume this to be 0.4.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - P(H): Let's assume the probability that any random graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in computer science is approximately 0.15 (15%).
   - P(E|H): Given Adam’s interest in puzzles and intelligence, this seems moderately likely. Let's assume this to be 0.6.
   - P(E|¬H): The probability that someone not in computer science has these traits can be considered broader among many other possible fields. Let’s assume this to be 0.3.

Next, we use Bayes' rule to compute P(H|E):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Let’s compute these step-by-step:

1. **Business Administration**:
   \[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.1 \times 0.2 + 0.4 \times (1 - 0.2)} \]
   \[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.32} \]
   \[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.02}{0.34} \approx 0.0588 \]

2. **Computer Science**:
   \[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.6 \times 0.15}{0.6 \times 0.15 + 0.3 \times (1 - 0.15)} \]
   \[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.255} \]
   \[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.09}{0.345} \approx 0.2609 \]

Using these calculations, we get:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0588,
  "computer science": 0.2609
}
```
