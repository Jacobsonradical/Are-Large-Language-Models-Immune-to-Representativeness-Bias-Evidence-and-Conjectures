To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific information about the graduate student population, we'll have to make some educated guesses:

1. **P(H)** - The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in each field. 
2. **P(E|H)** - The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in each specific field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)** - The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in each specific field.

Let's make some hypothetical reasonable assumptions to calculate these:

### Computer Science:
- **P(HCS):** Let's assume the probability of a graduate student being in Computer Science is around 0.2 (20%).
- **P(E|HCS):** Adam has high intelligence and enjoys solving puzzles, which aligns with computer science. However, his strong empathy and love for nature and animals is less typical for this field. Let's estimate this at 0.3.
- **P(E|\neg HCS):** This is trickier, but let's assume a reasonable estimate of 0.2 given the mixed alignment of personal traits with this field.
  
### Business Administration:
- **P(HBA):** Let's assume the probability of a graduate student being in Business Administration is around 0.15 (15%).
- **P(E|HBA):** Adam's strong empathy and understanding of hard work could align well with business administration, but his deep interest in nature and solving puzzles doesn't fit as well. Let's estimate this at 0.25.
- **P(E|\neg HBA):** Again, letâ€™s assume a reasonable value of 0.2.

Now let's use Bayes' rule for each hypothesis.

**For Computer Science:**

\[ P(HCS|E) = \frac{P(E|HCS) \cdot P(HCS)}{P(E)} \]

The denominator \( P(E) \) is common for both comparisons, so we can ignore it for relative comparisons and use a normalization factor later.

\[ P(HCS|E) \propto 0.3 \times 0.2 = 0.06 \]

**For Business Administration:**

\[ P(HBA|E) = \frac{P(E|HBA) \cdot P(HBA)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(HBA|E) \propto 0.25 \times 0.15 = 0.0375 \]

If we normalize the values:

\[ P(HCS|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.0375} \approx 0.615 \]

\[ P(HBA|E) = \frac{0.0375}{0.06 + 0.0375} \approx 0.385 \]

Here's the answer in the requested format:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.615,
  "business administration": 0.385
