To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to follow these steps:

1. Define the prior probability \( P(H) \), which is the initial probability of Adam being enrolled in each field.
2. Estimate the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), which is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
3. Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \), which is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in that field.
4. Use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \), which is the probability of Adam being enrolled in the field given his personality sketch.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Assumptions and estimates:
- The prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field are difficult to determine precisely, so we'll assume equal priors for simplicity. This means \( P(H) \) for each field is the same, reflecting no initial bias towards any field.
- For \( P(E|H) \), we need to consider Adam's attributes and how well they match typical profiles of students in each field.
- For \( P(E|\neg H) \), we estimate the likelihood of observing the personality sketch in fields other than the specified ones.

Letâ€™s make some estimations (note these are subjective and based on general knowledge):

### Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**
   - Assume equally probable for both fields: \( P(H) = 0.5 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**
   - Computer Science students may exhibit curiosity, high intelligence, problem-solving skills, and an appreciation for hard work. However, quiet demeanor and strong empathy might not be universal. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) as 0.4.

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**
   - If Adam is not in Computer Science, he could still possess a similar personality sketch for other fields due to the general traits. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) as 0.2.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.5}{(0.4 \cdot 0.5) + (0.2 \cdot 0.5)} = \frac{0.2}{0.2 + 0.1} = \frac{0.2}{0.3} \approx 0.67 \]

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**
   - Assume equally probable for both fields: \( P(H) = 0.5 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**
   - Business Administration students typically value leadership, social skills, and may have empathy, but Adam's quiet and puzzle-loving nature might be less common. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) as 0.2.

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**
   - If Adam is not in Business Administration, he could still possess a similar personality sketch for other fields. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) as 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.5}{(0.2 \cdot 0.5) + (0.3 \cdot 0.5)} = \frac{0.1}{0.1 + 0.15} = \frac{0.1}{0.25} = 0.4 \]

Therefore, the results are as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.67,
  "business administration": 0.4
}
```

These values provide a rough estimate of Adam's likelihood of being enrolled in each field based on his personality sketch.
