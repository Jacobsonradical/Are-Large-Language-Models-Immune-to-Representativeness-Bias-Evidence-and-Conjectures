To estimate the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field of study given his personality sketch (E), we'll use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given he is in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given he is not in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch, which can be derived from:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]

Given the lack of detailed statistical data, I'll make some reasonable estimations based on typical graduate student populations and the alignment of Adam's personality with these fields.

1. **Business Administration:**
    - \( P(H) \), the prior probability that Adam is in Business Administration, might be less than a STEM field but still significant. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
    - \( P(E|H) \), the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch if he is in Business Administration, might be lower given his strong interest in nature, puzzles, and animals. Business Administration students are generally more focused on economics, management, and strategy. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \), the probability of having this personality sketch given he is not in Business Administration, can be seen as a baseline for non-business fields. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

We can plug in these values and derive \( P(E) \), but since \( P(E) \) will be the same across different fields and just serve as a normalization factor, we can directly estimate:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \times P(H) = 0.2 \times 0.1 = 0.02 \]

2. **Computer Science:**
    - \( P(H) \), the prior probability that Adam is in Computer Science, is generally high because many graduate students are in this field. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
    - \( P(E|H) \), the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch if he is in Computer Science, aligns well due to his interest in puzzles and abstract concepts. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.6 \).
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \) can remain the same as it represents the baseline assumption. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Again, normalizing using \( P(E) \):

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \times P(H) = 0.6 \times 0.2 = 0.12 \]

Given these estimations, we can summarize the probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.12
}
```

These values suggest that, based on the personality sketch, Adam is more likely to be in Computer Science than Business Administration.
