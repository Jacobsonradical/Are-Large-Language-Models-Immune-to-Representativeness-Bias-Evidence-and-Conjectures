Sure, let's break it down step by step for each field. We'll evaluate the probabilities based on the given personality sketch, keeping in mind Bayes' rule \[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}. \] We'll estimate:

- \( P(H) \): The baseline probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he's enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he’s not enrolled in that field.

Here, I'll make some reasonable assumptions based on general knowledge and then compute \( P(H|E) \).

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: The baseline probability that Adam is in business administration is moderate, let's say \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15%).

2. **P(E|H)**: Given the sketch, it’s less likely a business administration student would have such a deep love for nature and puzzles, which are more common in sciences.
   - Let's say \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \) (10%).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing this personality sketch in general if he's not enrolled in business administration is likely higher:
   - Let’s say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.25 \) (25%).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}, \]
where we approximate:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1-P(H)). \]

Let’s calculate:
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.15) + (0.25 \times 0.85) = 0.015 + 0.2125 = 0.2275. \]

Then:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.15}{0.2275} = \frac{0.015}{0.2275} \approx 0.0659. \]

### Computer Science

1. **P(H)**: The baseline probability that Adam is in computer science is reasonable, so let’s say \( P(H) = 0.2 \) (20%).

2. **P(E|H)**: Given the sketch, Adam’s high intelligence, love for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts align quite well with computer science.
   - Let's say \( P(E|H) = 0.6 \) (60%).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing this personality sketch if he's not enrolled in computer science is moderate:
   - Let’s say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \) (30%).

Using Bayes' Rule, similarly:
\[ P(E) = (0.6 \times 0.2) + (0.3 \times 0.8) = 0.12 + 0.24 = 0.36. \]

Then:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.2}{0.36} = \frac{0.12}{0.36} = 0.3333. \]

Combining these results, we get:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0659,
  "computer science": 0.3333
}
