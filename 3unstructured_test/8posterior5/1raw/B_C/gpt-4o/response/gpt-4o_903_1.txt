Let's use Bayes' rule, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability of H given E.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of E given H.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of H.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of observing E.

To find \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we'll estimate the required probabilities based on our knowledge of these fields and the personality sketch of Adam.

### Business Administration

1. **P(H):** Estimate the general probability that any graduate student is in business administration. Let's assume it is fairly common, say \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15%).
2. **P(E|H):** The probability that a business administration student would have the personality traits described. Business administration students might have empathy, dedication, and high intelligence, but a deep love for nature, plants, and animals might be less common. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.05 \) (5%).
3. **P(E|\neg H):** The probability that any other graduate student (not in business administration) would have those traits. Since the traits align more with scientific and environmental fields, we might estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.15 \) (15%).

### Computer Science

1. **P(H):** Estimate the general probability that any graduate student is in computer science. Given the high demand and popularity of the field, assume \( P(H) = 0.25 \) (25%).
2. **P(E|H):** The probability that a computer science student would have the personality traits described. Computer science students often have high intelligence, puzzle-solving abilities, and might love nature and animals as a hobby. Estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.10 \) (10%).
3. **P(E|\neg H):** The general probability for other fields, as discussed above. Since these traits strongly align with natural sciences, estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.15 \) (15%).

Using Bayes' rule:

### Business Administration

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be calculated as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.05 \cdot 0.15) + (0.15 \cdot 0.85) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.0075 + 0.1275 = 0.135 \]

So,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.15}{0.135} = \frac{0.0075}{0.135} \approx 0.0556 \ (5.56\%) \]

### Computer Science

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Using same \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.10 \cdot 0.25) + (0.15 \cdot 0.75) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.025 + 0.1125 = 0.1375 \]

So,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.10 \cdot 0.25}{0.1375} = \frac{0.025}{0.1375} \approx 0.1818 \ (18.18\%) \]

Thus, the final results are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0556,
  "computer science": 0.1818
}
