Let's think through the problem step by step. We need to estimate and compare the posterior probabilities for Adam being enrolled in computer science and business administration as we analyze the sketch of his personality and background.

### Given:
- E: Personality sketch of Adam.
- H: Hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in a specific field (either computer science or business administration).
- P(H): Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- P(E|H): Likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- P(E|¬H): Likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.

### Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, in a comparative analysis between the fields, the calculation of the normalization constant \( P(E) \) would be common and hence will cancel out when comparing the relative probabilities. Therefore, our focus here is on \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for each field. 

### Analysis:

1. **Computer Science:**

   **Prior Probability (P(H)):**  
   Let’s assume the prior probability that any given student might be in computer science. For simplicity, let's set a prior probability of around 10% (0.1) since computer science is quite popular among graduate fields.

   **Likelihood (P(E|H)):**  
   Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts, he exhibits traits that could fit well with computer science. Let's assign a higher likelihood because of his aptitude in abstract thinking and problem-solving, say 0.3.

   **Likelihood of E given not H (P(E|¬H)):**  
   This is harder to define explicitly, but let’s assume that the likelihood of finding someone with these traits who does not do computer science might be lower, say 0.2.

2. **Business Administration:**

   **Prior Probability (P(H)):**  
   For business administration, let’s set a prior probability of 10% as well (0.1).

   **Likelihood (P(E|H)):**  
   The traits specific to Adam do not strongly align with the usual profiles expected of a business administration student. Someone interested in nature, plants, and animals with strong empathy and warm heart might fit less with typical business administration profiles. We may set this to 0.05.

   **Likelihood of E given not H (P(E|¬H)):**  
   Similarly, the likelihood of finding someone with Adam's personality profile in non-business fields might align with more creative or research-oriented fields, not the business route. We set this to 0.15.

Let's calculate the proportional terms ignoring the normalization factor for comparison.

### Calculation:

For **Computer Science**:
\[ P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.3 \cdot 0.1 = 0.03 \]

For **Business Administration**:
\[ P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.05 \cdot 0.1 = 0.005 \]

Based on these calculations:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.03,
  "business administration": 0.005
}
```

Therefore, based on these values, Adam is more likely to be enrolled in computer science compared to business administration, given his personality sketch.
