To apply Bayesian analysis, we need to define the probabilities:

1. \(P(H)\) - The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
2. \(P(E|H)\) - The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in a specific field.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\) - The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in the specific field.

Then, we can calculate \(P(H|E)\) - The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch.

Let's assume reasonable priors for a graduate student in the U.S.:

1. \(P(H_{CS}) = 0.2\) - About 20% of graduate students are in computer science.
2. \(P(H_{BA}) = 0.1\) - About 10% of graduate students are in business administration.

Now, estimate \(P(E|H)\) and \(P(E|\neg H)\):

- For Computer Science:
  - \(P(E|H_{CS})\): Adam's traits such as high intelligence, enjoying solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts fit well with computer science, which often requires such skills. However, other traits like a warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals might be less directly related to the field.
  
    Let's estimate \(P(E|H_{CS})\) around 0.5.
  
  - \(P(E|\neg H_{CS})\): Given that computer science is one of many fields, let's assign the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch outside of computer science as 0.3.
  
- For Business Administration:
  - \(P(E|H_{BA})\): Adamâ€™s empathy and appreciation for hard work align well with roles in business administration, often requiring interaction, team management, and understanding others. However, his interests in nature, puzzles, and abstract concepts are not as directly aligned.
  
    Let's estimate \(P(E|H_{BA})\) around 0.3.
  
  - \(P(E|\neg H_{BA})\): Given the variety of other fields that might fit Adam's traits better, let's assign the likelihood of observing his personality sketch outside of business administration as 0.5.

Now apply Bayes' theorem:

- For Computer Science:

\[
P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \cdot P(\neg H_{CS})}
\]

\[
= \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.5 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8}
\]

\[
= \frac{0.1}{0.1 + 0.24}
\]

\[
= \frac{0.1}{0.34} \approx 0.294
\]

- For Business Administration:

\[
P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \cdot P(\neg H_{BA})}
\]

\[
= \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.3 \cdot 0.1 + 0.5 \cdot 0.9}
\]

\[
= \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.45}
\]

\[
= \frac{0.03}{0.48} \approx 0.063
\]

Thus, using the above computations, we have:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.294,
  "business administration": 0.063
}
```
