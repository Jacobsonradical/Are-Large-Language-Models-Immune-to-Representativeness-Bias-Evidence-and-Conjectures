To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in computer science and business administration, we use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is not in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the evidence, which can be simplified using the law of total probability.

Firstly, let’s estimate \( P(H) \) based on general observations about graduate programs in the U.S.:
- Computer science is a highly popular field, so \( P(\text{computer science}) \) might be estimated reasonably higher.
- Business administration is also popular but appeals to different interests and skills that may not align well with Adam's personality sketch.

We’ll consider arbitrary but reasonable prior probabilities for simplicity:
- \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.1 \)

Next, we need to consider \( P(E|H) \), i.e., how well Adam’s personality matches with students commonly found in those fields:
- Computer science students often exhibit high intelligence, problem-solving skills, and interest in abstract concepts, which matches Adam well.
  Thus, \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \) could be relatively high, say \( 0.7 \).
- Business administration might not align as closely with Adam's interest in nature, animals, and empathy, so \( P(E|\text{business administration}) \) could be relatively lower, say \( 0.2 \).

Then, \( P(E) \) (the overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \)), by law of total probability, is calculated considering the complement of each field.
- \( P(E|\neg \text{computer science}) \) = 0.3 
- \( P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) \) = 0.7

We do not need exact \( P(E) \) to compare \( P(H|E) \), only to ensure consistency.

Let's calculate those:

For Computer Science:
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

To compare fairly, we drop \( P(E) \) as it cancels:
- \[P(\text{computer science}|E) \propto 0.7 \cdot 0.2 = 0.14\]
- \[P(\text{business administration}|E) \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.1 = 0.02 \]

Totaling:
\[ \propto 0.14 (computer science) \]
\[ \propto 0.02 (business administration) \]

Normalizing these to use comparative values:
- Computer Science: \[ \frac{0.14}{0.14+0.02} = \frac{0.14}{0.16} \approx 0.875 \]
- Business Administration: \[ \frac{0.02}{0.14+0.02} = \frac{0.02}{0.16} \approx 0.125 \]

Thus:
