To determine the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to establish \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be calculated using:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For simplification, let's assume the prior probability \( P(H) \) of Adam being in each field is initially equal unless otherwise stated.

### Business Administration:
1. **Prior, \( P(H) \):**
   - We assume there's a relatively equal distribution among various fields.
   - Let's assume \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.05 \) (as business administration is a common field but not heavily aligned with the given personality traits).

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \):**
   - The likelihood of the personality traits fitting a business administration student is lower compared to other fields such as environmental studies or biology due to the high empathy and love for nature.
   - Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.1 \).

3. **Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   - For all other fields excluding business administration, the likelihood of having these traits might be higher as they align more with fields like biology, ecology, etc.
   - Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.5 \). 

### Computer Science:
1. **Prior, \( P(H) \):**
   - Similarly, assume \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.05 \).

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \):**
   - Computer science can align with high intelligence and problem-solving, but love for nature and animals is less relevant.
   - We estimate \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.1 \).

3. **Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \approx 0.5 \), similar to business administration as it accounts for other fields.

### Calculations:
Let's compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field.

1. **Business Administration:**
\[ 
P(E)_{BA} = P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \cdot P(\neg H_{BA}) \\
P(E)_{BA} = 0.1 \cdot 0.05 + 0.5 \cdot 0.95 = 0.005 + 0.475 = 0.48 
\]
\[ 
P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.05}{0.48} \approx 0.0104 
\]

2. **Computer Science:**
\[ 
P(E)_{CS} = P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \cdot P(\neg H_{CS}) \\
P(E)_{CS} = 0.1 \cdot 0.05 + 0.5 \cdot 0.95 = 0.005 + 0.475 = 0.48 
\]
\[ 
P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.05}{0.48} \approx 0.0104 
\]

Given the above estimates and computations, both calculated posterior probabilities are quite low, suggesting that neither business administration nor computer science is a strong fit based on the given personality traits of Adam.

Hence the probabilities can be summarized as:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0104,
  "computer science": 0.0104
}
```
