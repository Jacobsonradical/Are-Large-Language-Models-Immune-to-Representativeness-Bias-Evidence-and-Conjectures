To use Bayes' theorem, we need to estimate the following for each hypothesis \( H \):

1. \( P(H) \) - Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the particular field.
2. \( P(E|H) \) - Probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in the particular field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - Probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in the particular field.

We're interested in determining \( P(H|E) \), the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch \( E \), using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the sketch, Adam's characteristics appear to align more closely with fields that involve understanding nature, abstract concepts, or work requiring empathy and dedication. Less fitting would be fields that focus primarily on business and administrative tasks or technical computer programming without these elements.

### Computer Science
1. **\( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \)**: Prior probability of a student enrolling in computer science. Let's assume a generic value, for example, \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.2 \).
2. **\( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \)**: Probability Adam has the observed characteristics given he's in computer science. Some attributes like intelligence and appreciation for hard work fit, but empathy and love for nature might be less directly related. Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.3 \).
3. **\( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \)**: Probability of the personality sketch given Adam is not in computer science. Given the same \( \neg H_{\text{CS}} \) spans many other fields, we estimate \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.7 \).

### Business Administration
1. **\( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \)**: Prior probability of a student enrolling in business administration. Let's assume a generic value, for example, \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1 \).
2. **\( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \)**: Probability Adam has the observed characteristics given he's in business administration. Attributes like intelligence and appreciation for hard work might somewhat fit, but love for nature and animals might be less relevant. Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.2 \).
3. **\( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \)**: Probability of the personality sketch given Adam is not in business administration. Given the same \( \neg H_{\text{BA}} \) spans many other fields, we estimate \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.8 \).

Finally, we normalize \( P(E) \) using the Law of Total Probability, but since we don't specify it we'll focus on the relative ratios:

\[
\begin{align*}
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) & = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \propto 0.3 \cdot 0.2 = 0.06 \\
P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) & = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.1 = 0.02
\end{align*}
\]

Thus, relative probabilities are:

\[
\begin{align*}
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) & = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.02} = 0.75 \\
P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) & = \frac{0.02}{0.06 + 0.02} = 0.25
\end{align*}
\]

Therefore, the Bayes-inferred probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.25
}
```
