To tackle this problem using Bayes' rule, we need to calculate \( P(H|E) \), where \( H \) is the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in a specific field of study, and \( E \) is the evidence given by Adam's personality sketch.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here's how we break it down:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The initial probability that Adam is in that specific field without any given evidence.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) assuming hypothesis \( H \) is true.
3. **Marginal Likelihood \( P(E) \)**: The probability of observing the evidence regardless of the hypothesis. 

For simplicity, we'll assume that \( P(H) \) for each field is reasonably estimated at an equal base rate and will assign rough probabilities based on general knowledge of graduate fields.

Now let's make reasonable estimates based on the personality sketch:

### 1. Computer Science

- **P(H)**: Knowing the broad interest in computer science, we can give a rough prior probability of about 0.2 (20%).
- **P(E|H)**: Computer science might attract people who enjoy solving puzzles, have high intelligence and understand abstract concepts. However, the warm heart, love for animals, and appreciation of hard work may be less defining. Let's estimate around 0.7.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Given that people studying other fields also can have a warm heart, love for animals, etc., letâ€™s estimate it around 0.6.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

### 2. Business Administration

- **P(H)**: Business Administration is also a common field. We can assign a prior probability of about 0.2 (20%).
- **P(E|H)**: Business Administration students might less frequently align with a warm heart and deep love for nature and animals. Let's estimate around 0.3.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Staying the same as above, 0.6.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

We will ignore \( P(E) \), the marginal probability, for relative comparison since it would cancel out in the final ratio between fields:

\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.6} \approx 0.233 \]
\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.6} \approx 0.1 \]

Thus:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.233,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These values provide a relative measure of probability, indicating that based on the given personality sketch, Adam is somewhat more likely to be in computer science than in business administration.
