To evaluate \( P(H|E) \), the probability Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch, we'll use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll assess each component for business administration and computer science:

1. **Business Administration**
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in business administration. Let's assume it's a popular field but less so compared to certain STEM fields. We assign a moderate prior, say \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in business administration. Since the personality sketch emphasizes empathy, hard work, and understanding abstract concepts, it somewhat aligns but isn't a perfect fit. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the personality sketch given he is not in business administration. Considering many other fields may better fit his described traits, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \).

2. **Computer Science**
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in computer science. This is a very popular field, so let's set \( P(H) = 0.25 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in computer science. His traits of intelligence, solving puzzles, understanding abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work align well with computer science. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the personality sketch given he is not in computer science. Given his traits, it might be lower when considering the broad range of other fields. Let's assign \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

Now, we compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using these estimates:

1. **Business Administration**
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} 
   = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} 
   = \frac{0.045}{P(E)}
   \]

2. **Computer Science**
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} 
   = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.25}{P(E)} 
   = \frac{0.175}{P(E)}
   \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a common denominator, we just compare the numerators directly:

\[
\frac{P(H|E, \text{business administration})}{P(H|E, \text{computer science})} = \frac{0.045}{0.175}
\]

Evaluating this ratio:

\[
P(H|E, \text{business administration}) = 0.045 \text{ (relative scale)}
\]
\[
P(H|E, \text{computer science}) = 0.175 \text{ (relative scale)}
\]

To express these as probabilities:

\[
P(H|E, \text{business administration}) = \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.175} \approx 0.2045
\]
\[
P(H|E, \text{computer science}) = \frac{0.175}{0.045 + 0.175} \approx 0.7955
\]

Thus, our final probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2045,
  "computer science": 0.7955
}
```
