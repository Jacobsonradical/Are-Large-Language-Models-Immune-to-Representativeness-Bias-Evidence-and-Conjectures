To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \), we need to estimate the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \), where \( \neg H \) represents the negation of hypothesis \( H \). We will then use Bayes' Rule which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

This can be rewritten to focus on the ratio between probabilities:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H)P(H) \]

For each field, we need to make some reasonable assumptions based on the information provided about Adam.

### Computer Science (CS)

1. \( P(H) \) - Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in Computer Science.
   - Given that CS is a common field for high-intelligence individuals interested in puzzles and abstract concepts, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.3 \).

2. \( P(E|H) \) - Likelihood of observing Adam's personality given he is in Computer Science.
   - Adam's love for puzzles and high intelligence fit well. However, strong empathy and a deep love for animals are less characteristic. Thus, let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \).

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - Likelihood of observing Adam's personality given he is not in Computer Science.
   - Given the diversity of fields, a personality such as Adam's could fit reasonably well in many other areas, but perhaps less so in technical fields not involving nature much. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

### Business Administration (BA)

1. \( P(H) \) - Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in Business Administration.
   - Business Administration (MBA) attracts a variety of personalities, and let's say it is less likely for someone with Adam's characteristics (high empathy for nature) to choose MBA. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

2. \( P(E|H) \) - Likelihood of observing Adam's personality given that he is in Business Administration.
   - Adam's warm heart and strong empathy could fit well in establishments focusing on ethical or green businesses. Still, his interest in nature and puzzles is less typical here. So, let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - Likelihood of observing Adam's personality given that he is not in Business Administration.
   - As previous, given Adamâ€™s characteristics, \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

### Posterior Calculation

Using Bayes' Theorem, we are interested in \( P(H|E) \propto P(E|H)P(H) \):

#### Computer Science:
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) \propto P(E|\text{CS})P(\text{CS}) = 0.4 \times 0.3 = 0.12 \]

#### Business Administration:
\[ P(\text{BA}|E) \propto P(E|\text{BA})P(\text{BA}) = 0.2 \times 0.1 = 0.02 \]

To simplify, we normalize these probabilities so their sum is 1.

Sum of unnormalized posterior probabilities:
\[ 0.12 + 0.02 = 0.14 \]

Normalized probabilities:
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = 0.12 / 0.14 \approx 0.857 \]
\[ P(\text{BA}|E) = 0.02 / 0.14 \approx 0.143 \]

### Final Answer:

  "computer science": 0.857,
  "business administration": 0.143
