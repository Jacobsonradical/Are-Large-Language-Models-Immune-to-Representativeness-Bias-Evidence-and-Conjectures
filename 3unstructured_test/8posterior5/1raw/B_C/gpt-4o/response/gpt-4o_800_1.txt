To assess the probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for Adam being enrolled in computer science or business administration, let's consider the details provided in his personality sketch \( E \):

- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
- He enjoys solving puzzles.
- He has a strong empathy and a deep love for animals.
- He has high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts.
- He appreciates hard work and dedication.

From this information, we can make the following judgments:

### For Computer Science:
- P(H): Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Let's assume a baseline prior. In the U.S., computer science is a common graduate field, so we might assign a value of around 0.15 (15%).
- P(E|H): Given that Adam is in computer science, the probability of observing \( E \). Computer science students generally have high intelligence, solve puzzles, and understand abstract concepts, but they might not necessarily have a genuine curiosity about nature or a deep love for animals. A reasonable estimation might be 0.4 (40%).
- P(E|\neg H): Given that Adam is not in computer science, the probability of observing \( E \). Nature, empathy, and love for animals might point towards life sciences or ecology. Let's assume a cumulative value summing to 0.6 (60%) for non-computer science fields which might better fit Adam's profile.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.15}{0.4 \times 0.15 + 0.6 \times 0.85} = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.51} = \frac{0.06}{0.57} \approx 0.105
\]

### For Business Administration:
- P(H): Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Business administration is also a common graduate field, so let's use a baseline value of 0.15 (15%).
- P(E|H): Given that Adam is in business administration, the probability of observing \( E \). Business administration might align less well with his curiosity about nature and love for animals, though intelligence and appreciation for hard work align well. A reasonable estimation might be 0.3 (30%).
- P(E|\neg H): Assuming the same 0.6 for non-business administration fields.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.15}{0.3 \times 0.15 + 0.6 \times 0.85} = \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.51} = \frac{0.045}{0.555} \approx 0.081
\]

So the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field, given his personality sketch, are:

{
  "computer science": 0.105,
  "business administration": 0.081
}
