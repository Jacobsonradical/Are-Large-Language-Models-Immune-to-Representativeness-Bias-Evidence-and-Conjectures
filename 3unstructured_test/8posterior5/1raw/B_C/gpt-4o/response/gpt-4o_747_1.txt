To assess the probabilities for the hypotheses that Adam was enrolled in either "business administration" or "computer science," I'll first evaluate the necessary components: the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Then, I'll apply Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \).

### Business Administration
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
   - Let's assume that the prior probability of a graduate student enrolling in business administration is moderate, say around 0.1 (since many students opt for this field, but it doesn't strongly align with Adam's described interests).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   - The personality sketch of Adam includes attributes such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy, which are not typically associated with business administration. Let's assume this makes \( P(E|H) \) quite low, say 0.01.

3. **Complementary Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   - The probability that a person with Adam's characteristics is in some other field that matches his personality better (such as biology, environmental science, etc.) should be relatively high. Let's assume this is 0.3.

### Computer Science
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
   - Let's assume that the prior probability of a graduate student enrolling in computer science is also moderate, say around 0.15 (considering the high interest in this field).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   - The personality sketch highlights Adam's intelligence and comfort with abstract concepts, which are aligned with computer science to some extent. Let's assume \( P(E|H) \) is moderate, say 0.1.

3. **Complementary Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   - The probability that someone with Adam's characteristics is not in computer science but in a field that better fits his personality (like environmental science, biology, etc.) should also be significant. Let's assume this is around 0.2.

### Applying Bayes' Rule
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

#### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01 \cdot 0.1}{0.01 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot (1 - 0.1)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.001}{0.001 + 0.27} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.001}{0.271} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0037 \]

#### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{0.1 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot (1 - 0.15)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.015}{0.015 + 0.17} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.015}{0.185} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.081 \]

### Final Probabilities
