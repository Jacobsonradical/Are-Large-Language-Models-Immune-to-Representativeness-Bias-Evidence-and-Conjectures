To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the fields of business administration and computer science given the personality sketch (E) of Adam, we need to consider the following probabilities:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field without any other information.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the personality sketch (E) given that he was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the personality sketch (E) given that he was not enrolled in that field.

Let's make some reasonable assumptions and estimate these probabilities based on Adam's personality traits:

### Business Administration

- \( P(H) \): Business administration is a common graduate field, but it is unlikely given Adam's personality traits focused on nature and abstract concepts.
  - Estimated \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.1 \) (10%)

- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of having the personality sketch matching Adam's interest in nature and puzzles if he was studying business administration.
  - Estimated \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.05 \) (5%)

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The overall probability of having Adam's personality sketch in general, which could be higher considering the diversity of graduate fields.
  - Estimated \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.3 \) (30%)

### Computer Science

- \( P(H) \): Computer science is a common field, and Adam's high intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts fit well.
  - Estimated \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.2 \) (20%)

- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of having Adamâ€™s personality sketch if he was studying computer science, considering his intelligence and abstract thinking.
  - Estimated \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.7 \) (70%)

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Same as before, the general probability of the personality sketch.
  - Estimated \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.3 \) (30%)

Now, using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We approximate \( P(E) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

### Business Administration:
\[ P(E)_{BA} = P(E|H_{BA})P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA})(1 - P(H_{BA})) \]
\[ P(E)_{BA} = (0.05 \times 0.1) + (0.3 \times 0.9) = 0.005 + 0.27 = 0.275 \]

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) P(H_{BA})}{P(E)_{BA}} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.1}{0.275} \approx 0.018 \]

### Computer Science:
\[ P(E)_{CS} = P(E|H_{CS})P(H_{CS}) + P(E|\neg H_{CS})(1 - P(H_{CS})) \]
\[ P(E)_{CS} = (0.7 \times 0.2) + (0.3 \times 0.8) = 0.14 + 0.24 = 0.38 \]

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) P(H_{CS})}{P(E)_{CS}} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.2}{0.38} \approx 0.368 \]

So, our final results are:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.018,
  "computer science": 0.368
}
```
