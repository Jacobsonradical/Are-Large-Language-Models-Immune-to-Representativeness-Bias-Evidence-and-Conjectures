To evaluate the probabilities asked, we will be using Bayes' theorem, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the particular field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch (which can be derived but is constant across our comparisons).

Given that Adam has certain characteristics, we can make educated estimations for each of the probabilities involved.

### Computer Science
1. **\( P(H) \)**: This is the prior probability of a graduate student in the U.S. studying computer science. Given the popularity of the field, let's assume it's moderately high.
2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is studying computer science. Adam's traits of solving puzzles and high intelligence fit well with a computer science student, so let's assume this is also moderately high.
3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is the probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is not studying computer science. Given his traits, which also align with other fields like biology or environmental science, this probability could be moderately high but less than \( P(E|H) \).

### Business Administration
1. **\( P(H) \)**: This is the prior probability of a graduate student in the U.S. studying business administration. It's a common field, so let's assume a moderate probability.
2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is studying business administration. Although intelligence and appreciation for hard work fit, the key traits around nature, plants, and animals are less common for business administration, so this probability could be moderate to low.
3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is the probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is not studying business administration. As before, it should be moderately high due to the alignment with other fields.

Now, let's use these insights to estimate \( P(H|E) \) qualitatively.

### Estimations
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

These values are estimated based on the qualitative assessments mentioned above. They suggest that Adam is more likely to be in fields that match his personality traits more closely, such as those involving nature, puzzles, and abstract thinking. Hence, while we've given some values, it should be noted that they are hypothetical and meant to help make a comparative judgment between the fields.
