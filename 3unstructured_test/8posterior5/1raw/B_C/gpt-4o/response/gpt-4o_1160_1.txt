To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need the following probabilities for each field (computer science and business administration):

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability Adam is enrolled in a field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in that field.

Bayes' Rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here is the structured approach to solve the problem:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): Let's assume the probability that any given graduate student is in computer science is 0.15 (15%).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Considering Adam's traits, a high intelligence and an ability to understand abstract concepts align well with computer science. However, the curiosity about nature and love for animals are less typical but not unheard of. We might estimate this as 0.3.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): This would be the probability of Adam's traits given he is in another field. Since many fields value intelligence and curiosity about nature, but not all have a direct fit, let's assume 0.2.

   Using Bayes' Rule:
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.15}{P(E)} \]

2. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H) \): Let's assume the probability that any given graduate student is in business administration is 0.10 (10%).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Business Administration doesn't typically require a deep love for nature and animals, nor does it directly value quietness and empathy. Therefore, let's estimate this as 0.05.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Since other non-business fields might accommodate such traits, let's estimate this at 0.25.

   Using Bayes' Rule:
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.10}{P(E)} \]

\( P(E) \) can be complex to calculate directly without knowing more specific information, but for simplicity, we'll use a normalization approach to approximate the Bayes' rule computations. The exact values would usually involve more precise accounting for all fields of study:

{
  "computer science": \(\frac{0.3 \times 0.15}{0.3 \times 0.15 + 0.05 \times 0.1} \approx \frac{0.045}{0.05} \approx 0.9 \),
  "business administration": \(\frac{0.05 \times 0.1}{0.3 \times 0.15 + 0.05 \times 0.1} \approx \frac{0.005}{0.05} \approx 0.1 \)
}

So the result is approximately:

{
  "computer science": 0.9,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

Note: The values provided in the above example are simplified and approximate for this hypothetical scenario. In a real-world case, all values would require more precise data to more accurately calculate the probabilities.
