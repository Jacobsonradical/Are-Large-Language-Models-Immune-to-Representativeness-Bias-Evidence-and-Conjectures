To answer the question, let's break down the values required for Bayes' rule for each field.

1. **P(H): The probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field.**
2. **P(E|H): The probability of the personality sketch if Adam was enrolled in the given field.**
3. **P(E|\neg H): The probability of the personality sketch if Adam was not enrolled in the given field.**

### Business Administration

- **P(H):** Business administration is a common graduate field, but less likely for someone with Adam's specific personality traits.
  - Assume P(H) = 0.1

- **P(E|H):** Personality traits like "genuine curiosity about nature," "love for animals," and "solving puzzles" are not typically associated with business administration.
  - Assume P(E|H) = 0.05

- **P(E|\neg H):** The personality sketch could likely fit many other fields more strongly than business administration.
  - Assume P(E|\neg H) = 0.25

### Computer Science

- **P(H):** Computer science is a reasonably common graduate field, and Adam has traits like high intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles which fit well with this field.
  - Assume P(H) = 0.2

- **P(E|H):** The personality traits are more likely to be associated with computer science.
  - Assume P(E|H) = 0.3

- **P(E|\neg H):** The personality could also fit other fields, but we assume this field stands out more than business administration.
  - Assume P(E|\neg H) = 0.2

Now let's use Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)\]

### Calculations for Business Administration

- P(E) for business administration:
  \[ P(E) = (0.05 \cdot 0.1) + (0.25 \cdot 0.9) \]
  \[ P(E) = 0.005 + 0.225 \]
  \[ P(E) = 0.23 \]

- P(H|E):
  \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{0.23} \]
  \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.23} \]
  \[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0217 \]

### Calculations for Computer Science

- P(E) for computer science:
  \[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.2) + (0.2 \cdot 0.8) \]
  \[ P(E) = 0.06 + 0.16 \]
  \[ P(E) = 0.22 \]

- P(H|E):
  \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.22} \]
  \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.22} \]
  \[ P(H|E) \approx 0.2727 \]

Therefore, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0217,
  "computer science": 0.2727
}
```
