To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given the personality sketch \( E \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following quantities for each hypothesis \( H \):

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in the field.

Then, Bayes' rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, we can assess \( P(H|E) \) relative to these fields without computing \( P(E) \).

Let's begin with some reasonable assumptions based on the personality sketch and common characteristics of the fields:

1. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H) \): Let’s assume the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration is moderate, say 0.2.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam having these traits while being enrolled in business administration might be low, given that business studies prioritize other skills more prominently. Let's assume 0.1.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of these traits if Adam wasn't in business administration is higher, say 0.4.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): Let’s assume the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science is moderate, say 0.2.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam having these traits while being enrolled in computer science is higher, as interests in nature, solving puzzles, and high intelligence align well with a field focused on complex problem-solving. Let’s assume this to be 0.3.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of these traits if Adam wasn't in computer science is moderate, say 0.3.

Using these values:

For **business administration**:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

For **computer science**:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.3 \cdot 0.2 = 0.06 \]

Relative probabilities:

After normalizing (just for clarity):

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.06} = \frac{0.02}{0.08} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.02 + 0.06} = \frac{0.06}{0.08} = 0.75 \]

Now, returning this in the required format:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.25,
  "computer science": 0.75
}
