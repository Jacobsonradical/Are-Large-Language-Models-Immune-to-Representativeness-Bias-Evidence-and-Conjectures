Given the information, let's analyze the probabilities for Adam being enrolled in computer science and business administration.

### Computer Science
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science. Let's assume it's common for graduate students to enroll in Computer Science, but not overwhelmingly so. We can estimate this as 0.2 for now.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in Computer Science. Adam's attributes include high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts, which align well with computer science. However, his love for nature, plants, and animals is less directly related. Still, it's possible for a computer science student to have these interests. We can estimate this value as 0.4.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is NOT enrolled in Computer Science. Since these attributes can fit a variety of fields, this probability might be higher. Let's estimate this as 0.6.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \(P(E)\) is constant across different hypotheses, we focus on the numerator:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H)P(H) = 0.4 \times 0.2 = 0.08 \]

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration. It's common but probably less common than Computer Science. Let's estimate this as 0.15.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in Business Administration. Some aspects like high intelligence and empathy could fit, but others like strong interest in nature and animals are less typical. Let's estimate this as 0.3.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The same as before, 0.6.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H)P(H) = 0.3 \times 0.15 = 0.045 \]

### Normalizing Probabilities
To get normalized probabilities:
\[ \text{Total} = 0.08 + 0.045 = 0.125 \]

Then:

\[
P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.125} \approx 0.64
\]
\[
P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.125} \approx 0.36
\]

### Conclusion
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.64,
  "business administration": 0.36
}
```

These values suggest that, given Adam's personality sketch, he is more likely to be enrolled in a Computer Science program than in a Business Administration program, though both fields remain plausible options.
