To apply Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the relevant probabilities for each field of study:

1. **P(H): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.**
2. **P(E|H): The probability of observing E given that Adam is enrolled in that field.**
3. **P(E|¬H): The probability of observing E given that Adam is not enrolled in that field.**

We'll then use Bayes' rule to calculate \(P(H|E)\):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we do not have \(P(E)\) (the probability of observing E regardless of field), the results will be relative and not absolute probabilities. 

### Assumptions:

1. **P(H):** The prior probability can be estimated based on the general popularity of the fields.
2. **P(E|H):** The likelihood that Adam's personality attributes match with students in that field.
3. **P(E|¬H):** The likelihood that Adam's personality attributes would match with students not in that field, estimated, say, based on the general student population.

**Estimates for Business Administration:**
- P(H): Business Administration is quite popular, let's estimate it at 0.2.
- P(E|H): Business Administration students often have empathy and appreciation for hard work, but attributes like a deep love for animals and curiosity about nature might be rarer. Let's estimate it at 0.3.
- P(E|¬H): If Adam were not in Business Administration, other fields might also create similar profiles, but since we need a broad contrast, let's estimate this at 0.1.

**Estimates for Computer Science:**
- P(H): Computer Science is also very popular, let's estimate it at 0.3.
- P(E|H): Attributes like high intelligence and puzzle-solving are common in Computer Science. However, empathy and love for nature might be less common. Let's estimate it at 0.4.
- P(E|¬H): Given that other fields might similarly align with many of the characteristics, let's estimate it at 0.2.

Now let's calculate \( P(H|E) \):

For **Business Administration**:
- \(P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{(0.3 \cdot 0.2) + (0.1 \cdot 0.8)} \approx \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.08} = \frac{0.06}{0.14} \approx 0.4286\)

For **Computer Science**:
- \(P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{(0.4 \cdot 0.3) + (0.2 \cdot 0.7)} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.14} = \frac{0.12}{0.26} \approx 0.4615\)

So, the conditional probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.4286,
  "computer science": 0.4615
}
```

These values indicate a slightly higher likelihood that Adam might be enrolled in Computer Science given the personality sketch, though both fields remain quite plausible.
