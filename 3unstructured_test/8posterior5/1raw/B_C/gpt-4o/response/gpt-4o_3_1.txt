To apply Bayes' Rule effectively, let's first break down the components:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in each field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in each field.
- \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field given the personality sketch \( E \).

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**:
    - The percentage of U.S. graduate students in business administration is relatively high.
    - Let's assume prior probability \( P(H) = 0.2 \) or 20%.

2. **P(E|H)**:
    - Given the characteristics, business administration students are less likely to fit the profile.
    - Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.05 \) or 5%.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**:
    - The probability of this personality sketch across other fields (outside business administration) might include many science-related fields that fit better.
    - Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.15 \) or 15%.

### Computer Science

1. **P(H)**:
    - The percentage of U.S. graduate students in computer science is also quite significant.
    - Let's assume prior probability \( P(H) = 0.2 \) or 20%.

2. **P(E|H)**:
    - Given the characteristics, computer science students may fit the profile reasonably well.
    - Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \) or 30%.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**:
    - The probability of this personality sketch across fields aside from computer science.
    - Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.05 \) or 5%.

### Bayes' Rule

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of \( E \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H)) \]

Let's calculate for each field:

#### Business Administration

\[ P(E) = (0.05 \cdot 0.2) + (0.15 \cdot 0.8) = 0.01 + 0.12 = 0.13 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.2}{0.13} = \frac{0.01}{0.13} \approx 0.077 \]

#### Computer Science

\[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.2) + (0.05 \cdot 0.8) = 0.06 + 0.04 = 0.1 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.1} = \frac{0.06}{0.1} = 0.6 \]

### Result

Based on our calculations, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.077,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

Note: These probabilities are based on estimated values and the assumptions made here for illustrative purposes. The actual probabilities may differ.
