To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch using Bayes' theorem, we need to assess three probabilities:

1. P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
2. P(E|H): The likelihood of the evidence given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. P(E|¬H): The likelihood of the evidence given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Given the nature of Adam's interests and traits, we can make informed estimates:

**Prior Probability (P(H)):**
Let's assume there are many fields Adam could be studying as a graduate student. For simplicity, we can estimate the prior probability that Adam is in the agricultural and veterinary science field. Let’s assume it’s a moderately likely field given his interests:
P(H) ≈ 0.2 (or 20%)

**Likelihood (P(E|H)):**
Given that Adam has a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, and he is a high-intelligence individual who appreciates hard work and dedication, it's quite likely that he would be in an agricultural or veterinary science program:
P(E|H) ≈ 0.8 (or 80%)

**Likelihood Not H (P(E|¬H)):**
For the likelihood of the evidence given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, considering there are many fields where these traits could still be applicable (e.g., biology, environmental sciences), but perhaps to a lesser extent, we might estimate:
P(E|¬H) ≈ 0.3 (or 30%)

**Bayes' Rule:**
Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Where \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) \).
  
Substituting the values:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{0.8 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8}
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.16}{0.16 + 0.24}
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.16}{0.4} = 0.4
\]

Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4
}
