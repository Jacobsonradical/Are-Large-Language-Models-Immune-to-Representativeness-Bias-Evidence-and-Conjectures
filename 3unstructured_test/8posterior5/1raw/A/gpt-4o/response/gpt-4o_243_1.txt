To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to assign reasonable probabilities for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) based on the provided personality sketch and the field of "agricultural and veterinary science."

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in "agricultural and veterinary science."
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of the evidence given that Adam was enrolled in "agricultural and veterinary science."
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of the evidence given that Adam was not enrolled in "agricultural and veterinary science."

Assumptions:

1. \( P(H) \): Since "agricultural and veterinary science" is a relatively niche field, we might assume a small prior probability. Let's consider \( P(H) = 0.05 \).

2. \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's strong affinity for nature, animals, and his warm, empathetic personality, it seems highly probable that he could be in "agricultural and veterinary science." So, we'll assign a high probability here, \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): This is the probability of Adam's personality traits while not being in "agricultural and veterinary science." Although these traits could fit other fields, they might not be as likely. Thus, we can assign a moderate probability, \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

Now, applying Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where 
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

First, calculate \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.045 + 0.19 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.235 \]

Now, calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.235} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.235} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.191 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in "agricultural and veterinary science" given his personality traits is approximately 0.191.
