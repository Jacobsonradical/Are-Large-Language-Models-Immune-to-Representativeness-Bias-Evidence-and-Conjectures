To compute \( P(H|E) \), we first need to establish the values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Given:

1. \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
2. \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

We will start with educated guesses for these probabilities and then apply Bayes' theorem.

### Step-by-step Estimation:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
   Considering Adamâ€™s interest in nature, plants, and animals, these traits align well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. However, the field is relatively niche, so let's assume a moderate prior probability.

   \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \)
   
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   Given Adam's traits, it is highly likely that someone with his personality would pursue agricultural and veterinary science.

   \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \)
   
3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   These traits, while fitting for agricultural and veterinary science, could also fit other fields (like biology, environmental science, psychology). Thus, there's a non-trivial chance of observing \( E \) even if Adam isn't in agricultural and veterinary science.

   \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \)
   
4. **Normalization Factor \( P(E) \):**
   \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing \( E \), computed as:
   
   \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \)
   
   \( P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) \)
   
   \( P(E) = 0.16 + 0.24 \)
   
   \( P(E) = 0.4 \)
   
5. **Posterior Probability \( P(H|E) \):**

   Using Bayes' theorem:
   
   \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \)
   
   \( P(H|E) = \frac{(0.8 \cdot 0.2)}{0.4} \)
   
   \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.16}{0.4} \)
   
   \( P(H|E) = 0.4 \)

Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is:
