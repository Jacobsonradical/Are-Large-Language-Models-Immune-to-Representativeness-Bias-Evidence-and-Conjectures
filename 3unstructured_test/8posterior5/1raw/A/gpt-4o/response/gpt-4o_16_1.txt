To calculate the probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science (denoted as H), given his personality sketch (denoted as E), we will use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here’s the step-by-step evaluation for each term:

1. **\( P(H) \): Prior Probability**
   - This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Since we have no specific data, let's assume a generic prior probability based on the fact that there are many fields of study. If we assume there could be roughly 10 different fields he might be enrolled in, we could assign a prior probability of \( \frac{1}{10} = 0.1 \).

2. **\( P(E|H) \): Likelihood**
   - This is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Given Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, these traits align very well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. Let’s assume a high likelihood, for example, \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \): Likelihood under alternative hypothesis**
   - This is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in some other field.
   - While some of these traits could be shared with other fields, the specific combination of curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals is less common in other fields. Let’s assume a moderate likelihood here, for example, \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

4. **\( P(E) \): Total Probability of \( E \)**
   - This is the total probability of the personality sketch \( E \).
   - Using the law of total probability:
     \[
     P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
     \]
     Plugging in the numbers:
     \[
     P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) = 0.09 + 0.18 = 0.27
     \]

Now, plug into Bayes' rule to find \( P(H|E) \):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{0.27} = \frac{0.09}{0.27} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.333
\]

Hence, the calculated probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is approximately 0.333.
