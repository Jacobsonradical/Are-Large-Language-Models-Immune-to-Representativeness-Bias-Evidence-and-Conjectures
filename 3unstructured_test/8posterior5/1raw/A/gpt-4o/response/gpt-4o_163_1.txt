To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \) - The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
2. \( P(E|H) \) - The likelihood of observing E given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - The likelihood of observing E given that Adam was **not** enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
4. \( P(E) \) - The overall probability of observing E, which can be computed as \( P(H)P(E|H) + P(\neg H)P(E|\neg H) \).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assumptions and reasoning:

- \( P(H) \): Let's assume that the probability of a random graduate student being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is 0.05 (5%). This is a rough estimate given the diversity of fields but let’s use it as a prior probability.
- \( P(E|H) \): Given that Adam has a warm heart, strong empathy, a deep love for animals, and enjoys solving puzzles, it's reasonable to assume that these characteristics align well with someone in agricultural and veterinary science. Thus, we might assign a high value, say, 0.8 (80%).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): These characteristics could also be found in other fields, so let’s reasonably estimate a lower probability compared to \( P(E|H) \). Suppose we assign this a middle value like 0.3 (30%).

Now, let's compute \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(H)P(E|H) + P(\neg H)P(E|\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.05 \times 0.8 + (1 - 0.05) \times 0.3 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.285 = 0.325 \]

Finally, using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.325} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.325} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.123 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.123 (or 12.3%).
