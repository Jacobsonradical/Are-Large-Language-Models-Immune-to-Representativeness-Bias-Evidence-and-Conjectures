To determine P(H|E), which is the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given the personality sketch E, we use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to estimate the following probabilities:
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing the personality sketch E if Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of observing the personality sketch E if Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
4. **P(E)**: The total probability of observing the personality sketch E.

Given the information from the personality sketch:

- P(H): Assigning a reasonable prior probability, assuming Adam could be enrolled in any field, we might estimate P(H) ≈ 0.1, as agricultural and veterinary science would be a common field for someone with his interests in nature and animals.

- P(E|H): Considering the personality sketch matches well with someone in agricultural and veterinary science (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, understanding of hard work), we can assign a high probability, P(E|H) ≈ 0.9.

- P(E|\neg H): This is the probability of observing the personality sketch if Adam were not in agricultural and veterinary science. Given that the sketch could fit other fields but not as perfectly, we might estimate P(E|\neg H) ≈ 0.3.

- P(E): This is the total probability of the personality sketch, which can be calculated as:
  \[ P(E) = P(E|H) P(H) + P(E|\neg H) P(\neg H) \]
  Substituting the known values:
  \[ P(E) = (0.9 \times 0.1) + (0.3 \times 0.9) \]
  \[ P(E) = 0.09 + 0.27 \]
  \[ P(E) = 0.36 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.1}{0.36} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.36} \]
\[ P(H|E) ≈ 0.25 \]

Hence, concluding the answer:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.25"
}
