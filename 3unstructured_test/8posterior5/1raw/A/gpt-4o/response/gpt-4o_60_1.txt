To estimate the probability that Adam was enrolled in "agricultural and veterinary science" given his personality sketch, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote:

- \( H \) : Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( E \) : The personality sketch of Adam.

Bayes' Theorem formula is:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch given Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch given Adam is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the personality sketch. This can be expanded using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

To compute these probabilities, we need reasonable estimates:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume around 5% (0.05) of graduate students are in this field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's interest in nature, empathy, and love for animals, there's a high likelihood, say 0.8, that he fits the profile for this field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): Considering these personality traits might be somewhat common among various other fields but not as perfectly matched, we can estimate 0.2.

Let's compute \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.19 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.23 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.17 \]

Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.17.
