To calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to assess \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) first.

Given:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Our goal is to estimate \( P(H|E) \), the probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Let's assign plausible values to these probabilities:

- **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that a graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This is likely to be a relatively low probability because there are many fields a graduate student could be in. Let's estimate \( P(H) \) as 0.05 (5%).

- **\( P(E|H) \)**: The probability that Adam's personality sketch matches if he is indeed enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his genuine curiosity about nature, plants, love for animals, and empathy, it's highly probable that his personality reflects someone in this field. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) as 0.8 (80%).

- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability that Adam's personality sketch matches if he is enrolled in any other field. While these traits could be found in people in other fields, they might not be as predominant. Thus, let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) as 0.1 (10%).

Now, let's compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.8 \times 0.05 + 0.1 \times 0.95} = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.095} = \frac{0.04}{0.135} \approx 0.296 \]

So the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.296.
