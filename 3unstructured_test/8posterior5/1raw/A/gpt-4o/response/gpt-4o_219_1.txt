To calculate \( P(H|E) \) (the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch), we apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Given the personality sketch, Adam has characteristics that closely align with someone who may be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, such as a love for nature and animals, curiosity about plants, and empathy. Here are the estimations:

- \( P(H) \): Let's assume the prior probability \( P(H) \) that a graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is relatively low but not extremely rare. We can set this to 0.05 (5%).

- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that someone in agricultural and veterinary science has these characteristics is quite high. We can estimate this as 0.8 (80%) given the strong alignment with the personality sketch.

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that someone not in agricultural and veterinary science has these characteristics is lower but not negligible. Let's estimate this at 0.2 (20%).

- \( P(E) \): This is the overall probability of the personality sketch, which can be calculated by combining the probabilities of \( H \) and \( \neg H \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.95 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.19 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.23 \]

Now, using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.04}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.174 \]

Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, given his personality sketch, is approximately 0.174 (or 17.4%).
