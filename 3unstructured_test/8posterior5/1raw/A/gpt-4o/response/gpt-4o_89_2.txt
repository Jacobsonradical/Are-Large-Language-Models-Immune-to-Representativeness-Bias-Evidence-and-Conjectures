To compute \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the following probabilities:
- \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \(P(E|H)\): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of how to estimate these probabilities and apply Bayes' rule:

### 1. Estimate \(P(H)\)
Let's assume the prior probability \(P(H)\) that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science based on general statistics. Since graduate programs can vary widely, we need an assumption. For simplicity, let's assume 5% of graduate students choose agricultural and veterinary sciences.

So, \(P(H) = 0.05\).

### 2. Estimate \(P(E|H)\)
Given Adam's personality sketch (genuine curiosity about nature, love for plants and animals, empathy, etc.), it is highly suggestive he might be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Thus, this probability should be high. Let's estimate it as \(P(E|H) = 0.8\).

### 3. Estimate \(P(E|\neg H)\)
Given that Adam's personality sketch could also fit other fields (e.g., environmental science, biology, etc.), \(P(E|\neg H)\) should not be negligible. Letâ€™s estimate \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.2\).

### 4. Apply Bayes' Rule
Bayes' Rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be computed as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.19 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.23 \]

Now compute \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{(0.8 \cdot 0.05)}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.174 \]

Therefore, the probability \(P(H|E)\) that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, given his personality sketch, is approximately 0.174.
