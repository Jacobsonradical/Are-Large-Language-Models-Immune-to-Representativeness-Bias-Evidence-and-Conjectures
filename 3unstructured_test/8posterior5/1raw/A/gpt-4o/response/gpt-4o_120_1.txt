Let's break down the components necessary to apply Bayes' Rule to this problem:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Without specific data, we'll assume an equal likelihood among all possible graduate fields, but we'll slightly favor fields related to Adam's interests due to his background in nature, plants, and animals. Let's assume P(H) = 0.05 (5%).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing E given H (that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science). Given Adam's personality sketch, this seems pretty high, since his interests align well with this field. We'll estimate P(E|H) to be 0.7 (70%).

3. **P(E|~H)**: The probability of observing E given not H (that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science). Considering his interests might also fit well in other related sciences (biology, environmental science, etc.), we'll estimate this to be somewhat significant but lower. Let's assume P(E|~H) = 0.3 (30%).

Now let's use Bayes' Rule to calculate P(H|E):

Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|~H) \cdot P(~H) \]

First, calculate \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.7 \times 0.05) + (0.3 \times (1 - 0.05)) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \times 0.05) + (0.3 \times 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.035 + 0.285 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.32 \]

Next, calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.05}{0.32} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.035}{0.32} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.109375 \]

So, P(H|E) is approximately 0.11.
