To solve this problem, we need to estimate the probabilities involved and apply Bayes' rule accordingly. Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **P(H): Prior Probability**  
This is the probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science without any additional information. Let’s assume that the probability of a graduate student being enrolled in this field is relatively low compared to other fields. Let’s set P(H) to be 0.05.

2. **P(E|H): Likelihood**  
This is the probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Considering Adam's characteristics — a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, empathy, and intelligence — these align well with the field's attributes. Let’s assume P(E|H) is relatively high, say 0.7.

3. **P(E|¬H): Evidence Probability under the negation of H**  
This is the probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Since these characteristics can be found in various other fields too (e.g., biology, environmental science, psychology), we’ll set P(E|¬H) to be moderately high but lower than P(E|H). Let’s assume P(E|¬H) is 0.2.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.035 + 0.19 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.225 \]

Thus,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{0.225} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.035}{0.225} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.156 \]

So the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.156.

Therefore, the answer is:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.156"
