To address the problem, we need to consider the given information about Adam and evaluate the probabilities accordingly.

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Given:
- E: Personality sketch of Adam.
- H: Hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Let's proceed step by step:

### Step 1: Estimate P(H)
Given the limited context, let’s assume a uniform probability over various possible fields of study that a graduate student might be enrolled in. To simplify, we assume there are 10 possible fields (though in reality there are more). This gives:

\[ P(H) = \frac{1}{10} = 0.1 \]

### Step 2: Estimate P(E|H)
Adam's personality traits include:
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
2. Strong empathy and love for animals.
3. High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts.
4. Appreciation for hard work and dedication.

These traits align quite well with characteristics typically associated with someone in the field of agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore:

\[ P(E|H) \] could be high, let’s assume \(0.8\).

### Step 3: Estimate P(E|¬H)
\( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the same personality sketch but assuming Adam is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. While his traits could apply to other fields (like biology or environmental science), they may not be as strong a fit as in agricultural and veterinary science.

Let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \) for simplification; since the probability that someone in another random field still fits this description is lower but not negligible.

### Step 4: Compute P(H|E) using Bayes' Rule
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.18 = 0.26 \]

Now plug in the values:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.3077 \]

Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately \(0.3077\).
