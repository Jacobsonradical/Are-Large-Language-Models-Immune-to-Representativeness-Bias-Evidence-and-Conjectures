To make an intelligent guess, let's analyze the given information in the context of the field "agricultural and veterinary science":

1. P(H): This is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Since we don't have specific data about Adam's enrollment distribution among various graduate fields, we'll assume a uniform distribution. Given the numerous possible fields of study, let's say there are roughly 20 common fields. So:

\[
P(H) = \frac{1}{20} = 0.05
\]

2. P(E|H): This is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's love for nature, animals, and his empathy, it's quite plausible. Let's give this a high value, say:

\[
P(E|H) = 0.7
\]

3. P(E|\neg H): This is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Since other fields also attract empathetic individuals who love nature and animals, but perhaps to a lesser extent than agricultural and veterinary science, this value should be lower. Let's assume:

\[
P(E|\neg H) = 0.3
\]

Using Bayes’ Rule, we can compute:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

Let's compute \(P(E)\):

\[
P(E) = (0.7 \times 0.05) + (0.3 \times (1 - 0.05)) = 0.035 + 0.285 = 0.32
\]

Now, we can find \(P(H|E)\):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.05}{0.32} = \frac{0.035}{0.32} ≈ 0.109
\]

So the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.109.
