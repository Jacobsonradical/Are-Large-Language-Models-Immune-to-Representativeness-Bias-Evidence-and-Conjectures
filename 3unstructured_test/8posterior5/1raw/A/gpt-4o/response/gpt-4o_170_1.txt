Sure, let's break this down step by step.

1. **P(H)** - The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science as a field of study.

Given that Adam has a strong connection with nature, plants, and animals, let's assume the base prior probability could be higher than average due to these traits. However, without concrete numbers, we'll estimate it as a moderate probability. Let's denote this as 0.2 (20%).

2. **P(E|H)** - The probability of the evidence given that Adam was studying agricultural and veterinary science.

Given the evidence that Adam has a love for animals, nature, and plants, enjoys solving puzzles, and has a high intelligence, it strongly correlates with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. Hence, P(E|H) will be quite high. We might estimate this to be around 0.8 (80%).

3. **P(E|¬H)** - The probability of the evidence given that Adam was not studying agricultural and veterinary science.

While a love for animals, nature, and plants is strongly suggestive of agricultural and veterinary science, these traits can also be found in other fields such as biology, environmental science, etc. Considering this, P(E|¬H) might be moderate. Let's estimate it around 0.2 (20%).

Now we apply Bayes' rule to find P(H|E):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be derived using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

So, using the given values:

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.2) + (0.2 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.16 + 0.16 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.32 \]

Now, applying Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{0.32} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.16}{0.32} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.5 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given the evidence is 0.5 (50%).

Here is the answer in the required format:
