To compute \( P(H|E) \), we can use Bayes' rule, which is stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

For simplicity, let's assume some reasonable values based on the given personality sketch:

1. **Estimate \( P(H) \):**
   Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Since this field highly aligns with the given personality sketch (interest in nature, plants, empathy for animals), this could be relatively high. Let's assume:
   
   \( P(H) = 0.3 \)
   
2. **Estimate \( P(E|H) \):**
   Likelihood that Adam has the described personality traits given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science. This likelihood is high given the nature of the field. Let's assume:
   
   \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \)
   
3. **Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   Likelihood that Adam has the described personality traits given that he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Given that many other fields exist, and they may not align so closely with Adam's traits, this is likely lower. Let's assume:
   
   \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \)
   
4. **Compute \( P(E) \):**
   Total probability of the evidence \( E \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.3) + (0.2 \cdot 0.7) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.27 + 0.14 = 0.41 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.3}{0.41} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.27}{0.41} \approx 0.6585 \]
