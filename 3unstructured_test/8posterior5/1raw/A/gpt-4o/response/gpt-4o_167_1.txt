To calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch \( E \), we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For the sake of simplicity, let's consider the following assumptions:
1. \( P(H) \) - The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume that an average U.S. university has about 100 graduate programs, and while there may be some variation, we might estimate that 1 in 50 graduate students could be in this field, so let's assign \( P(H) = 0.02 \).
2. \( P(E|H) \) - The probability of observing the personality sketch given that the person is in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's empathy, love for animals, curiosity about nature, and other relevant traits, this seems quite high. Assume \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - The probability of observing the personality sketch given that the person is NOT in agricultural and veterinary science. While these traits could fit various fields, they are probably less common collectively in other fields. Assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \). 

4. \( P(E) \) - The total probability of observing the personality sketch. We can compute this as follows:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.9 \cdot 0.02 + 0.1 \cdot 0.98 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.018 + 0.098 = 0.116 \]

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.02}{0.116} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.018}{0.116} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.155 \] (rounded to three decimal places)

So, here is the answer presented in the requested format:
