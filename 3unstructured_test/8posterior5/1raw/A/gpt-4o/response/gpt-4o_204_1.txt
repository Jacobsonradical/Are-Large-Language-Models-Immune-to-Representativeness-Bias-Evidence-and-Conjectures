To estimate \( P(H|E) \), we need to compute the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the marginal likelihood \( P(E) \). 

Let's denote specific values based on Adam's personality sketch and the appropriate likelihoods:

1. \( P(H) \) - The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
2. \( P(E|H) \) - The probability of the given personality sketch if H is true (i.e., if Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science).
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - The probability of the given personality sketch if H is not true (i.e., if Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science).

### Estimates:
1. \( P(H) \): This is the prior probability that any random graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's estimate it as 0.1 (This is just a broad estimate; actual values could be different).

2. \( P(E|H) \): Considering Adam has a deep love for animals, genuine curiosity about nature and plants, and strong empathy, these traits fit well with someone enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's estimate it at 0.7.

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): Even if Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science, his traits such as empathy, high intelligence, and love for animals and puzzles could fit other fields such as psychology, biology, or environmental science. So, this is relatively high as well. Let's estimate it at 0.4.

### Calculations using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where,
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Given that \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.9 \),

\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.1) + (0.4 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.07 + 0.36 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.43 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' Rule,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.43} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.07}{0.43} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.1628 \]

Therefore, the probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.1628.
