To answer the question, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch, which we can compute using the law of total probability:
  \[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Assumptions and estimates (since exact probabilities are not given):
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume this is \(0.05\) (5%).
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's personality sketch, the likelihood that he is in agricultural and veterinary science. Based on his love for nature, plants, animals, and empathy, let's assume a high probability of \(0.9\) (90%).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam having the same personality sketch if he wasn't in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his broad interests and personality traits which could fit other fields, let's assume \(0.2\) (20%).

Now let's calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.9 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.95 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.045 + 0.19 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.235 \]

Finally, using Bayes' theorem to find \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.235} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.235} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.1915 \]

So the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.1915.
