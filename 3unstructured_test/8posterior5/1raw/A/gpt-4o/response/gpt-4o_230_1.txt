To estimate the probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given the personality sketch \( E \), we need to assess the following probabilities:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Let's break this down:

1. **\( P(H) \)**: The prior.
   - In the general population of graduate students, the proportion enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is relatively low. Let's estimate it to be around 0.05 (5%).

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood of observing personality sketch \( E \) given enrollment in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Given Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, and genuine curiosity about nature, these traits are highly compatible with someone enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. We can consider this probability to be high, say around 0.8.

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The likelihood of observing personality sketch \( E \) given Adam is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - While these traits are favorable for agricultural and veterinary science, they are also somewhat likely in other fields (e.g., biology, environmental science). Thus, let's estimate this to be around 0.3.

Now, we use Bayes' rule: \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \).

Where \( P(E) \) can be computed as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

First, calculate \( P(\neg H) \):
\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95 \]

Then, we calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.3 \cdot 0.95) = 0.04 + 0.285 = 0.325 \]

Finally, we calculate \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.325} = \frac{0.04}{0.325} \approx 0.123 \]

Thus, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given the personality sketch \( E \) is approximately 0.123:
