To answer this question, we need to use Bayes' theorem to compute the probability \( P(H|E) \), which is the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch \( E \). Bayes' theorem states:

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) * P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

We need to estimate the following probabilities:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability that Adam has the described personality sketch given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability that Adam has the described personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|\neg H) * P(\neg H) \), we can derive \( P(E) \) once we have the other probabilities.

Assuming some reasonable estimates:
- \( P(H) \): Let's assume the prior probability of being a graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science is 0.05 (since it's a specific field and not as common as others).
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's personality traits (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals), it seems highly likely he would fit well in this field. Let's assign this a high value of 0.7.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): For fields outside agricultural and veterinary science, Adam's traits may be less strongly aligned. Let's assign a lower value, perhaps 0.1.

Using these estimates, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ 
P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|\neg H) * P(\neg H) 
\]
\[ 
P(E) = (0.7 * 0.05) + (0.1 * 0.95) 
\]
\[ 
P(E) = 0.035 + 0.095 
\]
\[ 
P(E) = 0.13 
\]

Now, we compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) * P(H)}{P(E)} 
\]
\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{(0.7 * 0.05)}{0.13} 
\]
\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{0.035}{0.13} 
\]
\[ 
P(H|E) \approx 0.269 
\]

Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.269.
