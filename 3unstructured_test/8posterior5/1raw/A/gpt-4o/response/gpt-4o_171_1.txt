Given the personality sketch E of Adam and the field hypothesis H, we need to estimate P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|\neg H), and then use Bayes' Rule to compute P(H|E). Let's walk through this logically:

1. **Prior Probability P(H):** The probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume the probability of Adam choosing this field is reasonable, say 0.1.

2. **Likelihood P(E|H):** The probability of observing the personality traits E given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Since Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, a deep love for animals, and values hard work, it's highly likely that these traits align with the field. Let's assign a high probability, such as 0.8.

3. **Likelihood P(E|\neg H):** The probability of observing the personality traits E given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. While these traits might fit other fields, they may not do so as well. Let's assign a lower probability compared to P(E|H), such as 0.3.

4. **Bayes' Rule Calculation:**

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Substitute the values:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot (1 - 0.1)} \]

Calculate:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.27} = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \approx 0.2286 \]
