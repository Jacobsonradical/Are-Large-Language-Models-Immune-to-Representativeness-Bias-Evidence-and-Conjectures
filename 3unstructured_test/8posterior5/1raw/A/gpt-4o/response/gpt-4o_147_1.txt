To determine the probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science (denoted as \( H \)), given his personality sketch \( E \), we can use Bayes' Rule.

The formula for Bayes' Rule is:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

I'll estimate the values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) based on the information provided:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This can be estimated based on the number of graduate students in this field in comparison to other fields. Let us assume \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \) (10%).

2. **P(E|H)**: The conditional probability that Adam has the given personality sketch, assuming he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his love of nature, animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work, it is likely that his personality aligns well with this field. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The conditional probability that Adam has the given personality sketch, assuming he is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. While these personality traits could pertain to other fields, they are less strongly aligned compared to the field of agricultural and veterinary science. We might assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

4. **P(E)**: The total probability of the personality sketch \( E \). This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.18 = 0.26 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \approx 0.3077 \]

Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, given his personality sketch, is approximately 0.3077. Rounding this to two decimal places gives us:
