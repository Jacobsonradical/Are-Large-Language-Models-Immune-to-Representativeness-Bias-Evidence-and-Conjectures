To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). However, since we don't have exact values, we will need to estimate them. Let's go through the reasoning and assign reasonable values for each probability, and then compute the posterior probability.

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - \( P(H) \), the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, can be considered low since this is a specific field among many possible ones. Let's assume an arbitrary but reasonable value for this:
   - \( P(H) = 0.05 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - \( P(E|H) \), the probability of the evidence given this hypothesis, is likely high. If Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science, it makes sense for him to be curious about nature, love animals, have empathy, and appreciate hard work. Let's assign a high probability:
   - \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \)

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \), the probability of the evidence given that Adam is not in this field, is somewhat moderate because while his traits are not exclusively aligned with this field, they are common in other fields too. Let's assign a moderate value:
   - \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \)

4. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**:
   - \( P(E) \), the overall probability of the evidence, can be calculated using the law of total probability. However, for simplicity in this context, we will avoid direct calculation of \( P(E) \) by understanding that it encompasses both the scenarios where \( H \) is true and where \( H \) is not true.
   
Using these values, we apply Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

But \( P(E) \) can be expanded using the law of total probability:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

Substituting the values we assigned:

\[
P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95)
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.045 + 0.19 = 0.235
\]

Now we compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.235} = \frac{0.045}{0.235} \approx 0.191
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given the personality sketch is approximately 0.191.
