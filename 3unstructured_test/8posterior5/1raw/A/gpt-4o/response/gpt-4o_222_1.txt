Sure, let's analyze the probabilities involved to determine the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

1. **Prior Probability P(H):**
   - Given no specific data on popular graduate fields, a reasonable prior is that the probability Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is not particularly high but not negligible either. Let's assume a generic small prior:
     - P(H) ≈ 0.05

2. **Likelihood P(E|H):**
   - If Adam were studying agricultural and veterinary science, it would align very well with his strong empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature and plants. Therefore:
     - P(E|H) would be quite high, let's estimate ≈ 0.8

3. **Likelihood P(E|¬H):**
   - If Adam were not studying agricultural and veterinary science, other fields might still match parts of his personality sketch, but perhaps not as strongly. Therefore:
     - P(E|¬H) would be lower, let's estimate ≈ 0.3

Now, applying Bayes’ Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \)

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.05) + (0.3 \times 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.285 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.325 \]

Now calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.325} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.325} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.123 \]

So the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.123.
