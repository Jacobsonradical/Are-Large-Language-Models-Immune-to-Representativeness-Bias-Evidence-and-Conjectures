Given the personality sketch of Adam, we need to assess different probabilities to use Bayes' theorem effectively. Here's how we can approach the computation for the field of agricultural and veterinary science:

### Step-by-Step Probabilities Assessment:

1. **P(H) - Prior Probability**:
   - This is the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science before considering his personality sketch. Let's assume there's no strong bias towards any particular field, so we might give a general prior probability, say 0.1 (or 10%).

2. **P(E|H) - Likelihood**:
   - This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his deep love for animals, curiosity about nature, and a heart for dedication, this field seems very fitting. Therefore, we might assign a high probability, say 0.9 (or 90%).

3. **P(E|¬H) - Probability of Evidence under the Negation of Hypothesis**:
   - This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he were not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his characteristics, there are certainly other fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology where similar traits might be observed. This doesn't confirm the absence of the said traits outside the field but simply gives a measure. We might assign a probability, say 0.3 (or 30%) considering his traits are quite likely but not necessarily limited to agricultural and veterinary science.

### Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|¬H) \times P(¬H) \)

So, let's calculate:

- \( P(H) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \)
- \( P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.9 \)
- \( P(E|¬H) = 0.3 \)

\[ P(E) = (0.9 \times 0.1) + (0.3 \times 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.09 + 0.27 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.36 \]

Now,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.1}{0.36} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.36} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is 0.25 (or 25%).
