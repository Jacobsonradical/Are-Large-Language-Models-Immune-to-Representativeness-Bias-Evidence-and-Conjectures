To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch \(E\), we will use Bayes' rule.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given Adam was in this field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given Adam was not in this field.
- \( P(\neg H) \) is the complement of \( P(H) \), i.e., the probability that Adam was not in this field.

Assuming that there is no specific information that makes this field more or less probable compared to other fields, we might reasonably set \(P(H)\) to a uniform distribution. For simplicity, let us assume \(P(H) = 0.1\) and \(P(\neg H) = 0.9\).

Given the information:
- Adam has a deep love for animals and has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication, which aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science.
- Adam's interest in nature and plants also aligns well with this field.

Therefore:
- \(P(E|H)\) should be high, let's assign \(P(E|H) = 0.9\).
- For \(P(E|\neg H)\), while these traits might be common in other fields, let’s assume they are less strongly aligned, thus \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.3\).

Using Bayes’ rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.1}{0.9 \times 0.1 + 0.3 \times 0.9} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.27} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.36} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.25 \]

Therefore, based on this calculation:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.25"
}
