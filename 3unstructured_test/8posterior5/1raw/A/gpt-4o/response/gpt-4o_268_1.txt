To answer this question, let's first consider the probabilities involved.

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Since Adam was a graduate student in the U.S., it's not overwhelmingly common for students to be in this field relative to other fields. Let's estimate this probability.
    - P(H) = 0.05 (assuming it is not a very common field among all possible graduate studies).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing E (the personality traits and sketch of Adam) given that H (Adam is an agricultural and veterinary science student) is true. Given Adam's love for nature, animals, and high empathy, this field seems like a strong fit.
    - P(E|H) = 0.8 (high likelihood given the match between his personality and the field).

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing E given that H is not true, i.e., Adam is not an agricultural and veterinary science student. His personality traits could fit into some other fields, but the match isn’t as strong.
    - P(E|¬H) = 0.2 (lower likelihood as the traits specifically align well with agricultural and veterinary science).

Now apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of E:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot (1 - P(H)) \]

Calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.05) + (0.2 \times 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.19 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.23 \]

Now calculate \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.1739 \]

So, the value is approximately 0.174.
