To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have specific numerical values, we'll make qualitative judgments to estimate these probabilities:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This is the initial probability of Adam being in the field of agricultural and veterinary science before considering his personality sketch. Given that this is a relatively popular field but not the most common, let's assume \( P(H) \) is moderately likely, say around 0.1.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of Adam having the described personality sketch given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science. Considering that his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work highly align with this field, let's assume this is quite high, say around 0.8.

3. **Evidence \( P(E \mid \neg H) \)**: This is the probability of Adam having the personality described in E given that he is NOT in agricultural and veterinary science. Although his personality might fit into various fields, the specific combination of traits aligns strongly with agricultural and veterinary science. However, let’s assume it’s moderately likely to occur out of many possible graduate fields, so we set it around 0.3.

To compute \( P(E) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.27 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.35 \]

Now we can compute \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.35} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.2286 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.23.
