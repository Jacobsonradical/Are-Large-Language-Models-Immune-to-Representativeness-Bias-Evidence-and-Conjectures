Let's apply Bayesian inference to find the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\), given the personality sketch of Adam.

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**:
   - Let's denote the probability that Adam was enrolled in "agricultural and veterinary science" as \(P(H)\).
   - Without prior information, we might assume a uniform distribution across possible fields for graduate students. However, given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants and love for animals, we might assign a slightly higher likelihood to "agricultural and veterinary science".
   - For the sake of calculation, let us assign a slightly higher prior probability for \(P(H)\), say \(0.1\).

2. **Probability of Evidence Given Hypothesis \(P(E|H)\)**:
   - Given that Adam exhibits strong empathy, a deep love for animals, and a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, it is quite likely he fits a personality sketch for someone in "agricultural and veterinary science".
   - Therefore, we might estimate \(P(E|H) = 0.8\).

3. **Probability of Evidence Given Not Hypothesis \(P(E|\neg H)\)**:
   - Assessing the likelihood of Adam fitting his personality sketch while not being in "agricultural and veterinary science", we might consider that individuals in other scientific fields (like biology, environmental science, etc.) might also share similar traits, though less likely.
   - Let’s conservatively estimate \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.3\).

4. **Bayes' Theorem Calculation**:
   - We use Bayes' Theorem:  
     \[
     P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
     \]  
     where \(P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)\).  
 
5. **Calculating \(P(E)\)**:  
   \[
   P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) = 0.08 + 0.27 = 0.35
   \]

6. **Computing \(P(H|E)\)**:  
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.35} = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \approx 0.2286
   \]

Thus, we conclude:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.2286
}
```

This suggests that given Adam’s personality sketch and our assumptions, there is approximately a 22.86% probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
