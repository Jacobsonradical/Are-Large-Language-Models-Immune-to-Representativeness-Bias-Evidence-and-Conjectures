To determine \( P(H|E) \), the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch \( E \), we need to consider several factors:

1. **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of Adam having the personality sketch provided that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of Adam having the personality sketch provided that he was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
4. **\( P(E) \)**: The total probability of Adam having the personality sketch \( E \).

### Initial Assumptions:

1. **\( P(H) \)**: This probability could be estimated based on general statistics about the proportion of students enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume that this field is less commonly chosen than others. For the sake of this computation, let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.05 \).

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: Given that Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, plants, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work, it strongly aligns with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume this probability is high, say \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This probability represents the chance of having the given personality sketch if Adam is not in the agricultural and veterinary science field. While curiosity about nature, animals, and hard work could be present in other fields, it's less specific. Letâ€™s assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \).

### Applying Bayes' Rule:

Bayes' Rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H)) \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.19 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.23 \]

Now calculating \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.04}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.1739 \]

Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science based on the given personality sketch is approximately 0.174.
