Sure, let's reason through this step by step based on the information given:

- **P(H):** This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science without any additional information. Given that Adam is a graduate student in the U.S., let's assume a moderate prior that he might be in agricultural and veterinary science.
  
- **P(E|H):** This is the probability of observing the personality traits described in E given that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, and his understanding of hard work, it seems reasonably high.

- **P(E|\neg H):** This is the probability of observing E if Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. While his traits could apply to other fields, they seem particularly suited to agricultural and veterinary science, so this probability is moderate but lower than P(E|H).

Let's assign reasonable values based on these observations:

- P(H) might be around 0.1
- P(E|H) might be around 0.8
- P(E|\neg H) might be around 0.2

Using Bayes' Rule, we get:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \)

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) = 0.08 + 0.18 = 0.26 \]

Now we can compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.26} \approx \frac{0.08}{0.26} \approx 0.3077 \]

So, the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is approximately 0.31.
