Sure, let's go through the process step-by-step.

1. **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume that there are many fields Adam could have been enrolled in, but agricultural and veterinary science is reasonably common given his interests.
   - Let’s arbitrarily assign a prior probability of 0.1 for Adam being in this field.

2. **P(E|H)**: This is the probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam’s strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, this is reasonably high.
   - We can assign this probability as 0.8.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: This is the probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. While it is still probable that someone from a different field might share these traits, it would not be as strong as within the agricultural and veterinary science field.
   - Let’s assign this probability as 0.2.

Now, we can apply Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be expanded using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Substituting in our known values:
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.18 = 0.26 \]

Now, we can compute \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.08}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.3077 \]

So, we approximate that the probability Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality traits is roughly 0.308.
