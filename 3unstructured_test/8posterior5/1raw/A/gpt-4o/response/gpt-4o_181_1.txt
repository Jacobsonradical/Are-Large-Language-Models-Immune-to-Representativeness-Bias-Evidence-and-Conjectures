To calculate the probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need the following probabilities:

- \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \(P(E|H)\): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he was *not* enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Given Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, the hypothesis \( H \) (Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science) is consistent with his personality traits. Therefore:

1. **Estimate \( P(H) \) - the prior probability**: This could reasonably be set in a moderate range since it’s a specific field but aligned with Adam's interests.
2. **Estimate \( P(E|H) \) - probability of the personality traits given enrollment in agricultural and veterinary science**: Given Adam’s interest in animals and nature, we would anticipate a high probability.
3. **Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) - probability of the personality traits given not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science**: While someone with a deep love for nature and animals could be in various other fields, it’s less likely to find all these traits together in many non-related fields.

For qualitative estimation let's assume:
- \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \): A moderate initial assumption about the likelihood of being in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \): High, given the alignment of Adam's traits with the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \): Lower since such a concentration of relevant traits is less likely in unrelated fields.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.3}{0.8 \cdot 0.3 + 0.2 \cdot 0.7} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.24}{0.24 + 0.14} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.24}{0.38} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.6316 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.63.
