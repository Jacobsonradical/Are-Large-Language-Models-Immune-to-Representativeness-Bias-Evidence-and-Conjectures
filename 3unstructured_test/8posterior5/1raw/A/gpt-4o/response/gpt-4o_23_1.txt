To solve this problem through Bayes' theorem, we need to estimate the probabilities mentioned. Here are the estimates and calculations:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Since many graduate fields exist, we'll assume a uniform prior for simplification. If there are about 10 common graduate fields, P(H) â‰ˆ 0.1.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was indeed enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Given Adam's traits align closely with qualities valued in agricultural and veterinary science (curiosity about nature, love for animals, intelligence in understanding abstract concepts), we can consider P(E|H) to be quite high, say approximately 0.8.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in a different field.
   - While these traits could exist in other fields, they might not align as perfectly as they do with agricultural and veterinary science. Let's estimate P(E|\neg H) to be lower, about 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule to compute P(H|E):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.27 = 0.35 \]

Now, substitute P(E) back into Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.35} = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \approx 0.229 \]

Thus, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.229.
