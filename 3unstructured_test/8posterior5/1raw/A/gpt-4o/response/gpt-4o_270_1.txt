Let's evaluate each of the probabilities and then compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule.

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This is the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science as a graduate student, irrespective of his personality sketch. Without specific data on the distribution of graduate students across different fields, a reasonable estimate might be quite low. However, given his strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, a slightly higher probability might be reasonable. Let's estimate it as 0.1.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and other relevant traits, these characteristics seem quite consistent with the field. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. While these traits could still be consistent with students in other fields, such as biology or environmental science, they might be less strongly aligned. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

4. **Prior Probability \( P(\neg H) \)**: This is simply \( 1 - P(H) = 0.9 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
where
\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

Plugging in the values:
\[
P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) = 0.08 + 0.18 = 0.26
\]

Thus,
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.26} \approx \frac{0.08}{0.26} \approx 0.3077
\]

So, the updated probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.3077.

Here is the final answer in the requested format:
