Let's break down the probabilities step by step.

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given no specific information about the distribution of graduate students across different fields:
   - Let's assume that graduate fields are equally likely.
   - Suppose there are about 10 broad fields (arbitrary number for simplicity). The prior probability for any given field would therefore be approximately 1/10.

   So, P(H) = 0.1.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Given Adam's strong love for animals, his genuine curiosity about nature and plants, and empathy, it is highly consistent with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Hence, let's assume a high value, say 0.9.

3. **P(E|Â¬H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Adam's traits could also be consistent with other fields of study (environmental science, biology, etc.), but it might be less likely compared to P(E|H).

   Let's say this probability is moderate, say 0.4.

Based on Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) * P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|\neg H) * P(\neg H) \]

First, calculate P(E):
\[ P(E) = (0.9 * 0.1) + (0.4 * 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.09 + 0.36 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.45 \]

Now, compute P(H|E):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 * 0.1}{0.45} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.45} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.2 \]

So the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.2.
