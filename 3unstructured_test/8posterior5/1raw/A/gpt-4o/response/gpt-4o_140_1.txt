To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need the following probabilities:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Given the personality sketch describing Adam's deep love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, and intelligence, these traits align well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science.

1. **Estimate \( P(H) \):**
   - Agricultural and veterinary science is a specific field, so we might consider this to be relatively rare among all possible graduate fields. Let's estimate \( P(H) \approx 0.05 \) (5%).

2. **Estimate \( P(E|H) \):**
   - Given that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science, the probability of him having this personality sketch should be quite high. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.7 \) (70%).

3. **Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   - If Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science, the probability of him having such a personality sketch could be common across other fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology but less so in fields unrelated to nature or animals. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \) (20%).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) \) is computed using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \times 0.05) + (0.2 \times 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.035 + 0.19 = 0.225 \]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.05}{0.225} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.035}{0.225} \approx 0.156 \]

Thus, the final probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.156.
