To calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to define and estimate:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch of Adam given that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch of Adam given that he was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
  
Bayes' Rule states:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
\]

Here are the estimates:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a random graduate student in the U.S. was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume this probability is relatively low since agricultural and veterinary science isn't one of the most common graduate fields. Suppose it to be \( 0.02 \).

- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the personality sketch given enrollment in agricultural and veterinary science should be high because Adam's interests and characteristics align closely with what one might expect from someone studying in this field. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Although his characteristics can fit into other fields, the fit would be less strong. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.05 \).

Now we can calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.02}{0.7 \cdot 0.02 + 0.05 \cdot 0.98}
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.014}{0.014 + 0.049} = \frac{0.014}{0.063}
\]

\[
P(H|E) \approx 0.222
\]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.222.
