To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the marginal likelihood \( P(E) \) which can be broken down into \( P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \).

1. **P(H):** This would be the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science as a graduate student in the U.S. Without specific statistics, let's assume a prior probability based on reasonable context. We'll estimate it as 0.1.

2. **P(E|H):** This is the probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was indeed enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, this seems quite likely. Let's estimate it to be 0.8.

3. **P(E|\neg H):** This is the probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. While empathy, intelligence, and love for animals could fit other fields, it might be less likely when compared to agricultural and veterinary science. We'll estimate this to be 0.2.

4. **P(E):** This is the marginal probability of observing E, and it can be calculated as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.1) + (0.2 \times 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.18 = 0.26 \]

Now apply Bayes' rule to find \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.26} = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \approx 0.3077 \]

Therefore, using these estimates, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.3077.
