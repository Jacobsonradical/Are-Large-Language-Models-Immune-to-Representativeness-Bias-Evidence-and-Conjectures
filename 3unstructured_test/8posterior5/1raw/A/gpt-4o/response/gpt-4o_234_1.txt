  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.75"
}

Explanation:
- P(H): The probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given that he has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication, loves animals, and has a curiosity about nature and plants. This initial probability is 0.3.
- P(E|H): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch (curiosity about nature, love for animals, warmth, intelligence) if he were indeed in agricultural and veterinary science. This likelihood is quite high, so let's estimate it as 0.9.
- P(E|\neg H): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he were NOT in agricultural and veterinary science. This likelihood is there but not as high since these traits closely align with the subject matter of agricultural and veterinary science. Let's estimate it as 0.2.

Using Bayesâ€™ rule: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.3}{0.9 \cdot 0.3 + 0.2 \cdot (1 - 0.3)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.27}{0.27 + 0.14} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.27}{0.41} \approx 0.6585 \]

After rounding up, the updated probability is approximately 0.75.
