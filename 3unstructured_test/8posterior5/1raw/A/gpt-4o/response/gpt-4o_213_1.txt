To apply Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \), and use them to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \).

Given:
- P(H): Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- P(E|H): Probability of having observed the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- P(E|\neg H): Probability of having observed the personality sketch E given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
  
Now let's assess these probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that any given graduate student might be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Considering the many fields of study available, let's estimate a modest prior.
   - Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \) (as a rough estimate).

2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is indeed enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Given his love for nature, plants, and animals, it is quite probable that Adam would exhibit these qualities if he were in this field.
   - We can estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \) (high likelihood).

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Even if he is not in this specific field, his interests and traits could still be present in other related fields (biology, environmental science, etc.).
   - We can estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \) (moderate but lower likelihood compared to \( P(E|H) \)).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.05) + (0.2 \times 0.95) = 0.04 + 0.19 = 0.23 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.23} = \frac{0.04}{0.23} \approx 0.174 \]

So, the computed probability is approximately 0.174.
