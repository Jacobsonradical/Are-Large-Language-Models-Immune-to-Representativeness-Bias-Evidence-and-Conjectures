To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we will use Bayes' Rule.

Given:
- \( E \): Personality sketch of Adam
- \( H \): Hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science

We need the following probabilities:
- \( P(H) \)
- \( P(E|H) \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \)

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Estimate \( P(H) \)**: This is the prior probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume this is \( 0.05 \) (5%), based on general distribution of fields among graduate students.

2. **Estimate \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of Adam's personality traits, given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Considering his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy, it seems highly likely that he would fit well in this field. Let's assume \( 0.7 \).

3. **Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is the probability of Adam's personality traits, given that he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Given that these traits can also align with other fields like environmental science, biology, or psychology, let's assume \( 0.2 \).

### Applying Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.035 + 0.19 = 0.225 \]

Now, calculate \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{0.225} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.035}{0.225} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.156 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality traits is approximately 0.156 (15.6%).
