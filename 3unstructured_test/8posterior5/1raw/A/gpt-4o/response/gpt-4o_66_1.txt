To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch (E), we will use Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule is formulated as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality traits (E) given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality traits (E) given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the personality traits (E), and can be calculated using the law of total probability: \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

For the purpose of this estimation, let's provide reasonable assumptions for these prior and likelihood probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): Considering the broad range of fields a graduate student might be enrolled in, let's assign a low prior probability such as 0.05 (5%).
2. \( P(E|H) \): Given that Adam has a deep love for animals, a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, and an appreciation for dedication and hard work, these traits strongly align with someone likely to be in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's conservatively estimate this as 0.8.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): For other fields, while these personality traits are beneficial, they might not be as strongly indicative. We might estimate this as 0.3.

Next, calculate the total probability \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.3 \cdot (1 - 0.05) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.285 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.325 \]

Now use Bayes' rule to find \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.325} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.325} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.123 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality traits is approximately 0.123, or 12.3%.
