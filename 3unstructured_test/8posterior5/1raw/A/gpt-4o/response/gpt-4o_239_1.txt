Sure, I'll walk through the calculations using the given information and apply Bayes' rule.

Let \( H \) denote the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Given:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch.

We want to find \( P(H|E) \), the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's reason about the values:

1. **P(H):** Since Adam was a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021, let's assume that the probability of a graduate student being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is fairly low. I will estimate this value as around 0.05 (5%).

2. **P(E|H):** Adam’s personality sketch (E) fits well with someone who would be interested in agricultural and veterinary science because of his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication. Let's estimate this probability as high, say 0.8 (80%).

3. **P(E|\neg H):** This is the probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. While his traits can fit various fields, they may be less likely outside agricultural and veterinary science. Estimating this value cautiously as 0.2 (20%).

Now we need to compute \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.05) + (0.2 \times 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.19 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.23 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.04}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.174 \]

So, the resulting probability is:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.174"
}

Thus, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.174 or 17.4%.
