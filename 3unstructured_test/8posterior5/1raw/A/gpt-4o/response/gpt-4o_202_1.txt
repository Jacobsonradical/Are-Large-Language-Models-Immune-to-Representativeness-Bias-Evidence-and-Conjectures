Let's break down the calculation using Bayes' Rule.

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Since this is a rather niche field, we might assume a low prior probability, but not too low considering Adam’s interests. Let's assume P(H) is around 0.05 (5%).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's described curiosity about nature and love for animals, this field fits well with his personality sketch. Let's assume P(E|H) is high, around 0.8 (80%).

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. While his personality could fit other fields, the specific leanings towards nature and animals make it less likely to fit equally well with most other fields. Let's assume P(E|¬H) is moderate, around 0.2 (20%).

4. **P(E)**: The overall probability of observing the personality sketch E, which can be calculated using the law of total probability.
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|¬H)P(¬H) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.05) + (0.2 \times 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.19 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.23 \]

5. **P(H|E)**: The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, calculated using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.1739 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.174. In the requested format:
