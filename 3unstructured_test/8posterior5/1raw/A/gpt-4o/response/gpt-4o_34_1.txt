Given E, the personality sketch of Adam, we need to compute P(H|E) using Bayes' Rule for the field of agricultural and veterinary science.

We'll establish some reasonable assumptions for P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|\neg H):

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   Let's assume there's a modest representation of graduate students in this field compared to all possible fields. So, we might assign:
   \( P(H) = 0.05 \) (5%)

2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood that Adam exhibits the traits described in E given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science.
   Given Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, genuine curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work, these traits align well with someone in agricultural and veterinary science. So, we might assign:
   \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \) (80%)

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood that Adam exhibits the traits described in E given that he is not in agricultural and veterinary science.
   While these traits are quite specific to the field, they can also be common in other fields related to nature, puzzles, or animals. We'll assume:
   \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \) (20%)

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Here, \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \):

\[
P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.05) + (0.2 \times 0.95) = 0.04 + 0.19 = 0.23
\]

Now, compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.23} = \frac{0.04}{0.23} \approx 0.174
\]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given the personality sketch is approximately 0.174 or 17.4%.
