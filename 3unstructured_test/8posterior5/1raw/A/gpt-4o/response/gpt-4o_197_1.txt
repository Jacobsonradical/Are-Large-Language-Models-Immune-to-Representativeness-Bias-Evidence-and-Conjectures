To evaluate the probability that Adam was enrolled in the field of agricultural and veterinary science (H) given his personality sketch (E), we'll follow these steps:

1. **Estimate P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field of agricultural and veterinary science.
2. **Estimate P(E|H):** The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in this field.
3. **Estimate P(E|Â¬H):** The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in this field.
4. **Compute P(H|E) using Bayes' Rule:**

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

Since \(P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)\), we can use this to normalize the probability.

**Assumptions and estimates:**

1. **P(H) - Prior probability:**
   - Let's assume the prior probability that a graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science is relatively low, given the multitude of other fields. For simplicity, let's approximate it as 0.05.
   
2. **P(E|H) - Likelihood:**
   - The personality sketch aligns well with someone in agricultural and veterinary science (interest in nature, plants, animals, etc.). Let's estimate this probability to be relatively high, say 0.7.

3. **P(E|\neg H) - Likelihood for other fields:**
   - While Adam's traits could fit other fields, they are specifically well-suited for agricultural and veterinary science. Let's estimate this probability lower, around 0.2.

Now, we compute:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ = (0.7 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95) \]
\[ = 0.035 + 0.19 \]
\[ = 0.225 \]

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{0.225} \]
\[ = \frac{0.035}{0.225} \]
\[ \approx 0.156 \]

So the probability that Adam was enrolled in the field of agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is about 0.156, or approximately 15.6%.
