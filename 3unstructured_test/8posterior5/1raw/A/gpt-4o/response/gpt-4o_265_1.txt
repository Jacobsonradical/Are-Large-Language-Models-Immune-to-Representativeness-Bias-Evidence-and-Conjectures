To use Bayes' Rule to compute the probability P(H|E), we need to know certain values:
- P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- P(E|H): The probability of observing personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- P(E|\neg H): The probability of observing personality sketch E given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Since we do not have exact numerical values, I'll make reasonable estimates based on the provided personality sketch and general knowledge:
- P(H): Since there are many fields a graduate student could be enrolled in, let's assume a prior probability. Let's say there are 100 possible fields of study. Hence, P(H) ≈ 0.01.
- P(E|H): The sketch of Adam aligns well with traits suitable for agricultural and veterinary science. Hence, P(E|H) will be relatively high, let's assume P(E|H) ≈ 0.7.
- P(E|\neg H): The personality traits given could fit students from various other fields as well, albeit to a lesser extent. Hence, P(E|\neg H) might reasonably be lower, let's assume P(E|\neg H) ≈ 0.1.

Now, we can compute P(E):
\[P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)\]

\[P(E) = 0.7 \cdot 0.01 + 0.1 \cdot 0.99\]

\[P(E) = 0.007 + 0.099\]

\[P(E) = 0.106\]

Finally, apply Bayes' Rule:
\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.01}{0.106}\]

\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.007}{0.106}\]

\[P(H|E) ≈ 0.066\]

Therefore, the computed probability is:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.066"
