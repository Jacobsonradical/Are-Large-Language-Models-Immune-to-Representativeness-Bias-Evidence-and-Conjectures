To solve this problem using Bayes' rule, we need to determine the probabilities of each component:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the evidence (E) given that Adam was enrolled in this field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the evidence (E) given that Adam was not enrolled in this field.

We will then calculate \( P(H|E) \), which is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given the evidence (E).

Let's assume:
- \( P(H) = 0.05 \) (assuming 5% of students in graduate programs are in agricultural and veterinary science).
- \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \) (since Adam's traits such as a love for animals and nature, and empathy, align well with agricultural and veterinary science).
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \) (since these traits are less commonly found in people enrolled in other fields).

Bayes' rule is stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Calculate \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.7 \times 0.05) + (0.2 \times 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.035 + 0.19 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.225 \]

Now, calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.05}{0.225} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.035}{0.225} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.156 \]

So the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is approximately 0.156.

Here is the answer in the required format:
