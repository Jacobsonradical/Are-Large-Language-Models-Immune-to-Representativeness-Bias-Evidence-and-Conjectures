To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given the personality sketch E, we'll follow these steps:

1. Assess the prior probability \( P(H) \). This is the initial probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science before considering his personality sketch.
2. Assess the likelihood \( P(E|H) \). This is the probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. Assess \( P(E|\neg H) \). This is the probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
4. Apply Bayes' Rule to find \( P(H|E) \).

Firstly, given that agricultural and veterinary science is a relatively specialized field, let's make some educated assumptions for the probabilities:
- \( P(H) \): Assuming the probability of any given graduate student being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is moderately low due to its specialist nature. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work, it is highly probable that his personality sketch fits well with someone in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Considering that Adam's personality traits could lead him to several fields that value intelligence and empathy, let's estimate a moderately lower probability for his traits fitting with other fields. Assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Now, using Bayesâ€™ Rule:

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
\]

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{(0.9 \cdot 0.05) + (0.3 \cdot 0.95)}
\]

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.285}
\]

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.33}
\]

\[ 
P(H|E) \approx 0.136
\]

Therefore, the probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.136.
