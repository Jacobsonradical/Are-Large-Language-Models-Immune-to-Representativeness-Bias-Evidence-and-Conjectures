To solve this, we need to estimate the probabilities based on the given information and then use Bayes' theorem to compute \( P(H|E) \), the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch.

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume that, in general, the likelihood of a graduate student being enrolled in this field is relatively low compared to all possible fields. I'll estimate \( P(H) \) at around 0.05.

2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy, it's reasonable to consider these traits fitting well within this field. I'll estimate \( P(E|H) \) at 0.8.

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is NOT enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Since there are many other fields he could be in, and while intelligence, curiosity, and empathy can be somewhat generic, the specific mix of these traits with a love for nature and animals is less common in other fields. I'll estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) at 0.1.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence, which can be calculated as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Now calculating:
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.05) + (0.1 \times 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.095 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.135 \]

So:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.135} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.135} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.296 \]

Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.296.
