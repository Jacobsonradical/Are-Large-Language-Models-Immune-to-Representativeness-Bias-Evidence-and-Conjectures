To evaluate the probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch \( E \), using Bayes' rule, we must first consider:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in this field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in this field.
  
We can then calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the nature of the field and Adam's personality sketch:
- \( P(H) \): Without additional specific context, we might assume a moderately low prior probability. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Given that Adam has a deep love for animals, enjoys solving puzzles, and has strong empathy, it is reasonable to assume a high likelihood of him fitting well in this field. Assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): If Adam was not in this field, given his interests and traits, he might still exhibit similar personality aspects but not specifically fit into agricultural and veterinary science. Assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

Now, let's compute \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H)) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.18 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.26 \]

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.308 \]

Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.308.
