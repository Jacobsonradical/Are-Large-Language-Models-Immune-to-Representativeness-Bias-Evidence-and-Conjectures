Let's break it down using Bayes' rule:

**Bayes' Rule** states that:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given the personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch.

We need to estimate the probabilities:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Without specific information, let's assume a somewhat reasonable prior. Graduate students can be in a variety of fields, but let's say we estimate this to be around 0.1 (10%).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work, it seems highly likely he would fit in this field. Let's estimate this to be high, approximately 0.8 (80%).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was not in agricultural and veterinary science. While the traits do fit many fields, they are particularly strong in agricultural and veterinary science. However, fields like biology or environmental science may also show similar probability. Therefore, let's assume this to be 0.2 (20%).

4. **P(E)**: The overall probability of the personality sketch. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.18 = 0.26 \]

Now, using Bayesâ€™ Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{(0.8 \cdot 0.1)}{0.26} = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \approx 0.3077 \]

So the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.3077 or about 30.77%.

Here's the answer in the required format:
