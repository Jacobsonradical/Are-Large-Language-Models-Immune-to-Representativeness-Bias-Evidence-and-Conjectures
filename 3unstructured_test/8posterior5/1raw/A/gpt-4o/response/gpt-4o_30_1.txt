Sure, let's break this down step by step using Bayes' rule:

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here's what each term represents:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E) \): The total probability of observing the personality sketch E.

Let's assign some reasonable values based on the narrative:

1. **P(H)**: Given the information that Adam has a deep love for nature, plants, and animals, it's slightly more likely than average that he could be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, but it's still uncertain. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

2. **P(E|H)**: If Adam were enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, it would make sense for him to have the described personality traits. So, this probability should be quite high. Let's assign \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: If Adam were not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, he could still exhibit these traits, but it would be less likely than if he were in this field. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

4. **P(E)**: The total probability of observing the personality sketch E can be found using the law of total probability.
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.2 + 0.1 \cdot 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.16 + 0.08 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.24 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{0.24} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.16}{0.24} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{2}{3} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.67 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given the described personality sketch is approximately 0.67.
