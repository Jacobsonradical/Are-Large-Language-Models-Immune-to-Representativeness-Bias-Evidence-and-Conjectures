To address the question, we will use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is formulated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

I'll estimate the probabilities as follows:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given that there are many fields of study, let's assume this probability is modest.
   
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was in agricultural and veterinary science. Since agricultural and veterinary science involves a lot of interaction with nature, animals, and plants, which align well with Adam's personality, this probability will be high.
   
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not in agricultural and veterinary science. Adam's traits could be applied to several other fields like biology, environmental science, etc., so this probability can also be reasonably high but lower compared to \( P(E|H) \).

Let's estimate these values:

1. **P(H)** (Prior Probability for agricultural and veterinary science): 0.05 (5%)
2. **P(E|H)** (Probability of sketch given it is agricultural and veterinary science): 0.8 (80%)
3. **P(E|\neg H)** (Probability of sketch given it is not agricultural and veterinary science): 0.15 (15%)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{(0.8 \times 0.05) + (0.15 \times 0.95)}
\]

Calculating the numerator:

\[
0.8 \times 0.05 = 0.04
\]

Calculating the first term in the denominator:

\[
0.8 \times 0.05 = 0.04
\]

Calculating the second term in the denominator:

\[
0.15 \times 0.95 = 0.1425
\]

The denominator:

\[
0.04 + 0.1425 = 0.1825
\]

Now, the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.1825} \approx 0.219
\]

Therefore, the final probability is approximately 0.219 or 21.9%.

Here is the answer in the required format:
