To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the marginal likelihood \( P(E) \). The formula for Bayes' rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since the exact values of \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E) \) are not explicitly given, we need to make educated estimates based on the information provided about Adam and the characteristics of the field in question.

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This is the probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, without any additional information. Given the variety of fields a graduate student might choose, let's assume the prior probability is reasonably small but not negligible. Let's estimate \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of observing the personality sketch of Adam given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Considering Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, it's highly compatible with this field. Therefore, let's estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \).

3. **Marginal Likelihood \( P(E) \)**: This is the probability of observing the personality sketch of Adam across all possible fields he could be enrolled in. Given that Adam's characteristics might fit several fields but especially well with agricultural and veterinary science, we could estimate this as being somewhat lower. Let's estimate \( P(E) \approx 0.3 \).

Using these estimates in Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.3} \approx 0.267 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.267.
