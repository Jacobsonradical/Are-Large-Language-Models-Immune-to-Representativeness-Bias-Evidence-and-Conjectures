Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This is the initial probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Without any given specific data, we'll assume that each field has an equal chance. Since there are many possible fields of study, we'll estimate \( P(H) \) to be somewhat low, say 0.05 (5%).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is studying agricultural and veterinary science. Given his love for nature, plants, animals, and empathy, this field aligns closely with his traits. Therefore, we might assign a high probability here, say 0.8 (80%).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is the probability of observing Adamâ€™s personality sketch given that he is *not* enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. While his traits match well with other fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology, it's less likely that his personality sketch would fit as well with fields completely unrelated to nature and animals. So, let's assign a somewhat lower probability, say 0.3 (30%).

4. **Posterior Probability \( P(H|E) \)**: Finally, we use Bayes' rule to compute this.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.3 \cdot 0.95} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.285} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.325} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.123 \]

Thus, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.123, or 12.3%.

So, the answer in the requested format would be:

  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.123
