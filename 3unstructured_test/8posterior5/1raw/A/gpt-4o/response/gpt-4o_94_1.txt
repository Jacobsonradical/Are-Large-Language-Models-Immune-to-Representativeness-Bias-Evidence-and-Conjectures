Sure, let's evaluate the needed probabilities for the field "agricultural and veterinary science". 

Given the personality sketch of Adam, let's assign probabilities:

1. **P(H)**: The probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science without any additional information. This is just a rough estimate as we need to consider the overall likelihood of this field among graduate students. A reasonable estimate might be 0.05, considering there are many fields of study.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam having the described personality traits given that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, these traits align closely with someone in this field. We'll assign a high value, such as 0.8.

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of Adam having the described personality traits given that he was NOT enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. While these traits could occur in other fields, they are less aligned. Let’s estimate this as 0.1 since fewer other fields directly match all his traits so closely.

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to estimate \( P(E) \), the total probability of the evidence. This is found using the Law of Total Probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.1 \cdot 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.095 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.135 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.135} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.135} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.296 \]

Thus, the probability that Adam was enrolled in "agricultural and veterinary science" given his personality sketch is approximately 0.296.
