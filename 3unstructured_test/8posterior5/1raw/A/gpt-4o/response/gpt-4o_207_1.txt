To compute \(P(H|E)\) for Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, we'll need to estimate the probabilities involved. 

Given:
- \(H\): Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- We need to estimate \(P(H)\), which is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \(E\): The personality sketch of Adam.
- \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood of having the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The likelihood of having the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
  
In real-life situations, these probabilities would come from empirical data, but in the absence of specific data, we will make reasonable qualitative estimates for these probabilities based on the described personality traits and the field of study.

Since we need to estimate these probabilities, typical assumptions might be as follows:

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**: 
   - Assuming the proportion of graduate students enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is relatively low compared to other fields. Let's estimate \(P(H)\) at 0.05 (5%).

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: 
   - Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, these traits are highly aligned with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. Let's estimate \(P(E|H)\) at 0.8 (80%).

3. **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)**: 
   - These characteristics could also suit other fields (e.g., biology, environmental science) but may not be as directly aligned. Estimating this broadly, let's say \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.1\) (10%).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
Where \(P(E)\) can be derived from:
\[ 
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
= (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.1 \cdot 0.95)
= 0.04 + 0.095
= 0.135
\]

So,
\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.135}
= \frac{0.04}{0.135}
\approx 0.296
\]

Hence, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given the personality sketch is approximately 0.296 or 29.6%.
