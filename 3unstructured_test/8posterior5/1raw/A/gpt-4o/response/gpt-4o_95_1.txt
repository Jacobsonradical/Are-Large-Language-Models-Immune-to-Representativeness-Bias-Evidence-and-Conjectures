  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.75"

Explanation:
1. **P(H) - Prior Probability**: Given Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals, the prior probability that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science would be relatively high. Let's assume P(H) = 0.4.

2. **P(E|H) - Likelihood**: If Adam was indeed enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, the personality sketch makes sense as it aligns well with the field's requirements and interests. So, we'd assume a high probability, perhaps P(E|H) = 0.9.

3. **P(E|\neg H) - Likelihood of Evidence given Not H**: If Adam were not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, the personality traits could still fit several other fields. But considering the specificity of the traits toward nature and animals, let's assume a lower probability, say P(E|\neg H) = 0.2.

Now, we apply Bayes' theorem to calculate P(H|E):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

So,

\[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.4) + (0.2 \cdot 0.6) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.36 + 0.12 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.48 \]

Finally,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.4}{0.48} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.36}{0.48} \]
\[ P(H|E) ≈ 0.75 \]

So, P(H|E) ≈ 0.75.
