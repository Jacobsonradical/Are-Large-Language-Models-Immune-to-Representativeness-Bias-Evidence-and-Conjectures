To compute \( P(H|E) \), we need to employ Bayes' theorem, which is stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Using the fields of agricultural and veterinary science for Adam, let's go through the necessary steps:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
4. **P(E)**: The total probability of observing Adam's personality sketch, which can be computed using the law of total probability.

Let's make reasonable estimations based on the given information:

- **P(H)** (Probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science): Since there are many possible fields of graduate study, let's assume a moderate prior, say 0.05.

- **P(E|H)** (Probability of the personality sketch given enrollment in agricultural and veterinary science): Given Adam's strong interest in nature, animals, and hard work, it's likely that this field aligns very well with his personality sketch. Thus, let's assign a high probability, say 0.80.

- **P(E|\neg H)** (Probability of the personality sketch given enrollment in non-agricultural and veterinary science fields): This includes all other fields. Given that Adam's personality and interests are quite specific (nature, plants, animals), fields outside agricultural and veterinary science are less likely to strongly correspond. Letâ€™s assign a lower probability, say 0.20.

- **P(E)** (Total probability of observing the personality sketch E):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.05) + (0.20 \cdot 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.19 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.23 \]

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.05}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.174 \]

Therefore, the calculated probability is approximately 0.174.
