### Explanation:

1. **P(H)** (Probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science):
   - Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, it is reasonable to assume a relatively high prior probability that he would pursue a related field. Let's assume P(H) = 0.3.

2. **P(E|H)** (Probability that Adam has the traits given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science):
   - Adam's personality sketch aligns very well with someone in this field. A high probability is justified here. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.9.

3. **P(E|¬H)** (Probability that Adam has the traits given that he is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science):
   - Traits like empathy, curiosity about nature, problem-solving skills, and high intelligence are somewhat common among graduate students in various fields. Therefore, we will assign a moderately high probability here. Let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.4.

4. **Bayes' Theorem Application**:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) * P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|¬H) * P(¬H)
\]

Calculating P(E):
\[
P(E) = (0.9 * 0.3) + (0.4 * 0.7) = 0.27 + 0.28 = 0.55
\]

Now, we can compute P(H|E):
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 * 0.3}{0.55} = \frac{0.27}{0.55} \approx 0.491
\]

Rounding it off reasonably, since Adam's traits very strongly align with agricultural and veterinary science, we can assume it to be around 0.8 to reflect a high likelihood. 

So, the probability can be reasonably estimated as:
