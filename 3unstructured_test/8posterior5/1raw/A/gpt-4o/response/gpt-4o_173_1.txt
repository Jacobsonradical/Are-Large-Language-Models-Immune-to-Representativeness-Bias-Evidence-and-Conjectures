To solve this using Bayes' Rule, we first need to define the following probabilities:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Let's assume:
- \( P(H) \): The prior for any specific field Adam might be in. With many possible graduate fields, let’s conservatively put this at 0.05, implying that each of the 20 potential fields has an equal likelihood.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality traits if he was in agricultural and veterinary science, which should be quite high given his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. Let's assign this a value of 0.7.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality traits if he was in any field other than agricultural and veterinary science. There are many fields that could still fit his profile but less perfectly. Let’s set this at 0.1.

Given these probabilities, we can apply Bayes’ Rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

We know that:
\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

Substitute in our values:
\[
P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.95
\]

\[
P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.05) + (0.1 \cdot 0.95) = 0.035 + 0.095 = 0.13
\]

So Bayes’ Rule gives us:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{0.13} = \frac{0.035}{0.13} \approx 0.269
\]

Hence, the answer is:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.269
}
