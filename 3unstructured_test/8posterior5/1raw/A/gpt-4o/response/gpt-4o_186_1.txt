To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given the personality sketch E, we will use Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch.

Let's break this down step-by-step.

1. **Define \( P(H) \): The prior probability**
   Assume the probability that a graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is \(P(H) = 0.1\) (or 10%). This is an assumption and should be based on statistical data for accuracy in real scenarios.

2. **Define \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch given enrollment in agricultural and veterinary science**
   Given the personality sketch, Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, and love for animals closely align with characteristics relevant to agricultural and veterinary science. We can estimate \(P(E|H) = 0.7\) (or 70%).

3. **Define \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch given enrollment in a different field**
   Assuming that similar characteristics might be somewhat common but less so in other fields, we can estimate \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.3\) (or 30%).

4. **Compute \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing the personality sketch**
   Using the law of total probability:
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) = 0.07 + 0.27 = 0.34
   \]

5. **Apply Bayes' theorem to find \( P(H|E) \)**
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.34} \approx 0.2059
   \]

Thus, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.2059, or 20.59%.
