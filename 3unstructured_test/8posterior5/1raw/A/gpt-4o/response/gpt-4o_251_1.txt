Let's break down the given problem step-by-step in order to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule.

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - We need to assume a prior probability for Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Without additional prior information, a common practice is to assume a uniform prior across all possible fields. However, considering the sketch's details, Adam's interests might make enrollment in agricultural and veterinary science slightly more likely than random, but we will still assume a moderately high prior given his characteristics.
   - Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Given that Adam is in the agricultural and veterinary science field, the probability that he exhibits the described personality traits.
   - Given his love for animals and nature, it is highly likely that someone in this field would have these characteristics. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - The probability that Adam exhibits these traits if he is not enrolled in the agricultural and veterinary science field.
   - While some of the traits could fit other fields, the combination of love for animals, nature, and empathy leans heavily towards agricultural and veterinary science. For other fields, these traits might be present but less common compared to this specific field.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

4. **Posterior Probability \( P(H|E) \)**:
   - Bayes' rule: 
     \[
     P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
     \]
   - Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing \( E \):
     \[
     P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
     \]
   - \( \neg H \) is the hypothesis that Adam is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science:
     \[
     P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.8
     \]
   - Let's calculate \( P(E) \):
     \[
     P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.2) + (0.4 \cdot 0.8) = 0.18 + 0.32 = 0.5
     \]
   - Finally, using Bayes' rule:
     \[
     P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.2}{0.5} = \frac{0.18}{0.5} = 0.36
     \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given the personality sketch \( E \) is:
