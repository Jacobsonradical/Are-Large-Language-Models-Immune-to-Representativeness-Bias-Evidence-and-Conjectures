Let's follow these step-by-step guidelines to calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule.

Firstly, recall Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.

We need to decide on reasonable probability values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

### Judging the Probabilities:

1. **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's suppose that the likelihood of being enrolled in any given field is roughly equal among the many fields of graduate study. There are many possible fields, so suppose there are around 20 fields. Thus:
\[ P(H) \approx \frac{1}{20} = 0.05 \]

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given he is in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation of nature, it seems quite likely he could be in this field:
\[ P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \]

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. While his traits could fit other fields, the likelihood is lower without the direct link to animals and nature. Given he could be in any other field:
\[ P(E| \neg H) \approx 0.2\]

### Calculating \( P(E) \):

Using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E| \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.95 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.19 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.23 \]

### Applying Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.1739 \]

Thus, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.1739.
