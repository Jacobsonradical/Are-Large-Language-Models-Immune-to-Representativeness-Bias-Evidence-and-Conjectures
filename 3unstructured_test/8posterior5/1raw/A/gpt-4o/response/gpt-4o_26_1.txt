Let's break down the probabilities and apply Bayes' Rule step-by-step.

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   Since we do not have specific data, we'll assume that the probability of Adam being in any graduate field is uniform. Let's denote this as P(H) = 0.1, assuming there are 10 broadly defined graduate fields.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   Given Adam's love for nature, plants, animals, solving puzzles, and having strong empathy, it seems quite plausible he could be in this field. We can assign a high probability here. Let's estimate P(E|H) = 0.9.

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   Although his traits could align with other fields too (like biology, environmental science, or psychology), they are less specifically aligned compared to agricultural and veterinary science. Thus, we can estimate this as lower. Let's estimate P(E|¬H) = 0.3.

Now let's use Bayes' Rule to compute P(H|E):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the evidence and can be computed as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

Let’s plug in the numbers:

\[ P(E) = (0.9 \times 0.1) + (0.3 \times 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.09 + 0.27 = 0.36 \]

Now, compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.1}{0.36} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.36} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.25.
