To determine the probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science (denoted as H) in 2021, given his personality sketch E, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. We will follow this structure:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the characteristics given that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the characteristics given that Adam is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the characteristics, which can be derived from \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Let's assign estimated values:

1. **P(H)**: Prior probability of being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Given Adam's interests and personality, the probability might be relatively moderate. We estimate \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \).

2. **P(E|H)**: Probability of Adam having these characteristics if he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - These personality traits strongly align with someone in agricultural and veterinary science. We estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability of Adam having these characteristics if he is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - While these characteristics could fit other fields like environmental science or biology, they might be less common in non-related fields. We estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \).

4. **P(\neg H)**: Probability of not being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. 
   - This is \( 1 - P(H) \).
   - \( P(\neg H) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7 \).

5. **P(E)**: Total probability of observing these characteristics.
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
   \]
   \[
   P(E) = 0.9 \cdot 0.3 + 0.4 \cdot 0.7 = 0.27 + 0.28 = 0.55
   \]

Finally, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.3}{0.55} \approx \frac{0.27}{0.55} \approx 0.491
\]

So, the probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.491.
