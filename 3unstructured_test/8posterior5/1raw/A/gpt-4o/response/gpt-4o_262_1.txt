To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science (H) given the personality sketch (E), we first need to estimate the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

We'll use these values to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's assign reasonable estimates to these probabilities based on the provided personality sketch.

1. \( P(H) \): Suppose the prior probability that any graduate student in the U.S. is in agricultural and veterinary science is around 5% (0.05).
2. \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's personality sketch, particularly his love for nature, plants, and animals, there is a high probability that such traits fit well with someone enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's set this probability at 0.7.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): For other fields, although these traits may be present, they might not align as strongly with the curriculum. Let's estimate this at 0.2.

Now, compute \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot (1 - 0.05)) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.035 + 0.19 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.225 \]

Now, compute \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{0.225} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.035}{0.225} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.156 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.156, or 15.6%.
