To apply Bayes' rule and compute the probability \( P(H|E) \), we need to estimate the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

To simplify, let's make some reasoned assumptions based on the information provided:

- \( P(H) \): Since agricultural and veterinary science is a specific field and considering other fields Adam could be enrolled in, let's assume a moderate prior probability, such as 0.1.
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's strong affinity for animals, nature, and empathy, this personality sketch fits well within agricultural and veterinary science. So, let's assume \( P(E|H) \) to be fairly high, around 0.8.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): These traits could be applicable to other fields as well, although perhaps not to the same extent. Let's assume the probability of observing the personality sketch given Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is moderate, say 0.3.

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Now we compute:

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.27 = 0.35 \]

Then:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.35} = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \approx 0.229 \]

So, the answer is:
