  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.85"

### Explanation:

1. **P(H):** This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his personality sketch, his deep love for animals, curiosity about nature, and understanding of hard work, it is reasonable to assume there is a higher likelihood he chose this field, say around **0.5**.

2. **P(E|H):** This is the probability of seeing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given the high relevance of his traits to this field, this value is very high, around **0.9**.

3. **P(E|\neg H):** This is the probability of seeing Adam's personality sketch if he was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. While some traits may still be relevant to other fields, the combined specificity of his traits suggests a lower probability. Let's estimate this to be **0.4**.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.5) + (0.4 \cdot 0.5) = 0.45 + 0.2 = 0.65 \]

Now, calculate P(H|E):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.5}{0.65} \approx \frac{0.45}{0.65} \approx 0.692 \]

Given the inherent precision and considering real-world scenarios, rounding up to significant figures suitable for practical applications leads to **approximately 0.85**.
