To apply Bayes' rule, we first need to estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). These probabilities will be used to compute \( P(H|E) \).

1. **Step 1: Estimating \( P(H) \)**
   - \( P(H) \): Let's assume the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Since there are many possible fields Adam could be in, we might assume a low prior probability for any specific field.
   - Let's set \( P(H) = 0.05 \).

2. **Step 2: Estimating \( P(E|H) \)**
   - \( P(E|H) \): This is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
   - Given the described personality traits of Adam, his genuine curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, it is highly probable that these traits match well with someone in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
   - Let's set \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).

3. **Step 3: Estimating \( P(E|\neg H) \)**
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): This is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
   - While these traits could apply to other fields as well, the specifics about plants, animals, and nature suggest it is less likely but not impossible that such a personality could belong to a non-related field.
   - Let's set \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

Now, we can use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where \( P(E) \) is determined by:
\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95)
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.035 + 0.19
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.225
\]

Now, compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{0.225}
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.035}{0.225}
\]
\[
P(H|E) \approx 0.156
\]

Therefore, the probability that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science given the personality sketch is approximately 0.156.
