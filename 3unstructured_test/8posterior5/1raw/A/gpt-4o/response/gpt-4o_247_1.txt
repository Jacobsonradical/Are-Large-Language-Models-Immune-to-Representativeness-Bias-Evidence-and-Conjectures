Sure, let's calculate the values step-by-step.

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. One might assume that graduate students are relatively evenly distributed across various fields, but given Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, let's assume a somewhat higher prior probability for this field.

    - Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given that his interests align very well with this field, this probability is likely high.

    - Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Since his interests could align with some other fields as well, but perhaps not as strongly, this probability could be somewhat lower.

    - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

4. **P(\neg H)**: The complement of \( P(H) \), which is the probability that Adam is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

    - \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.8 \).

Using Bayes' Rule to compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence, calculated as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

So,

\[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.18 + 0.24 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.42 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.2}{0.42} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.18}{0.42} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.4286 \]

So the probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given the personality sketch is approximately 0.43.
