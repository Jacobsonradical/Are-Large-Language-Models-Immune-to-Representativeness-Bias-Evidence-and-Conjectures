To determine the probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the initial probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Hereâ€™s how we can estimate these probabilities:

1. **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Assuming no initial bias towards any particular field and equal likelihood across multiple fields, we might set this at around 1/10 (0.1), but it can depend on the total number of possible fields.

2. **P(E|H):** The probability of the evidence (E) given the hypothesis (H). Given the personality traits and interests described (interest in nature, plants, animals, strong empathy, understanding hard work and dedication), this probability can be reasonably high, say 0.8.

3. **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of the evidence (E) given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This would depend on how likely it is that someone with these traits is in any other field. Given how specific the traits are to agricultural and veterinary science, we might estimate this lower, say 0.2.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to calculate \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.1) + (0.2 \times 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.18 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.26 \]

Now, plug in the values:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.26} = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \approx 0.3077 \]

Thus, the probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.3077.
