To answer the question about the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021 based on his personality sketch, we'll use Bayes' Rule. 

Bayes' Rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's define the probabilities:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence \(E\) (personality sketch) given that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence \(E\) given that Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the evidence \(E\).

We assume values for these probabilities based on the information given and typical background knowledge.

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Agricultural and veterinary science is a relatively niche field compared to other fields that a graduate student might be enrolled in. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Given his love for nature, plants, animals, and empathy, the likelihood that Adam's personality fits with agricultural and veterinary science is high. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

3. **Complementary Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of observing Adamâ€™s personality traits in a graduate field other than agricultural and veterinary science is likely lower but not negligible. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

4. **Overall Probability \( P(E) \)**: This is given by the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
So, \( P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.1) + (0.3 \times 0.9) = 0.08 + 0.27 = 0.35 \).

Now, apply Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.35} = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \approx 0.2286 \]
