Let's go through the details given and estimate the probabilities.

Firstly, we have to define each probability:
- P(H): The probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- P(E|H): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- P(E|\neg H): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Let's start with some reasonable estimates:

- **P(H)**: The probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume, given the wide range of potential graduate fields, this is relatively low but not negligible. Suppose we estimate it at 0.1.

- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. The sketch describes traits such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy, which are highly consistent with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. Let's estimate this at 0.8.

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. While the traits can be common among various fields, they are quite specific to agricultural and veterinary science. Let's estimate this at 0.2.

Now, to compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's calculate \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.18 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.26 \]

Now, substitute back into Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{(0.8 \cdot 0.1)}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.31 \]
