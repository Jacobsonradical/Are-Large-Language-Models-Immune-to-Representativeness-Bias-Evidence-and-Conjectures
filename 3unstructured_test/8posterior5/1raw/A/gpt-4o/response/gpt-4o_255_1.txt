To judge the probabilities related to Adam's enrollment in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch \( E \), we need to define the following probabilities:

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

We will also use Bayes' rule to find \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \), we simplify the equation to:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))} \]

For estimation purposes:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science as a graduate student in the U.S. Let's assume this value is moderate, say \( 0.1 \) (10%).

- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's personality traits—including a genuine curiosity about nature, a love for animals, and an understanding of hard work and dedication—it is likely that he matches the profile of someone in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's set this high, say \( 0.7 \) (70%).

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing these personality traits in someone not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This probability would be lower, say \( 0.3 \) (30%).

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{(0.7 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9)} 
= \frac{0.07}{0.07 + 0.27} 
= \frac{0.07}{0.34} 
\approx 0.206 
\]
