To apply Bayes' rule, we need to determine:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the evidence (Adam's personality and background) given that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of the evidence given that he was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
4. **P(H|E)**: The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch.

Here's how we might reason through these probabilities:

- **P(H)**: In the context of all possible graduate fields, the probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. While exact numbers might vary based on specific university demographics, we can assume this to be a minority of students, so let's estimate it as 0.05 (5%).

- **P(E|H)**: Given that Adam was in agricultural and veterinary science, his interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy would strongly align with this field. Let's assign a high probability to this, say 0.8.

- **P(E|¬H)**: Given that Adam was not in agricultural and veterinary science, while his personality traits also fit other fields (like biology, psychology, or environmental science), they don't fit those fields quite as perfectly. Let's assign this a moderate probability, say 0.2.

Now we use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be expanded as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

So,

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.05) + (0.2 \times 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.19 = 0.23 \]

Therefore,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.174 \]

Thus, the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \approx 0.174 \).
