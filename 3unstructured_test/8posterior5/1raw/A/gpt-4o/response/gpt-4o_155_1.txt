To answer the question according to the given format, let’s assess the probabilities step-by-step.

Given the personality sketch, we can reason as follows:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. 
   - While graduate students can choose from a wide variety of fields, let's say there are around 10 major fields of study Adam could have been involved in.
   - Without any additional information, we could assume each field has an equal prior probability.
   - Therefore, P(H) ≈ 1/10 = 0.1.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing E given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Given Adam’s genuine curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, it is highly likely he would choose this field.
   - Therefore, we can assign a high value to P(E|H), say 0.9.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing E given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - While these personality traits can match other fields, they are not as closely correlated with fields like engineering, computer science, etc.
   - Therefore, we might assign a moderate value to P(E|\neg H), say 0.3.

Using Bayes’ rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where P(E) can be computed as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.9 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9 \]

\[ P(E) = 0.09 + 0.27 = 0.36 \]

Now, compute P(H|E):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{0.36} = \frac{0.09}{0.36} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given the personality sketch is 0.25.
