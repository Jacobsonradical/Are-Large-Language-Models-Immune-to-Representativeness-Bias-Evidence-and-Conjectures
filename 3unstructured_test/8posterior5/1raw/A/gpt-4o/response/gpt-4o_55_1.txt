To solve this problem using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the following probabilities:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the evidence given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of the evidence given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
4. **P(H|E)**: The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given the evidence.

### Estimations

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that a graduate student could be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume this is not very high as there are a variety of fields of study, but not extremely low either. This could be generalized to around 0.05 (5%).

2. **P(E|H)**: Given that someone is studying agricultural and veterinary science, the likelihood that they would have a strong curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and an appreciation for dedication and hard work is relatively high. We might estimate this probability to be around 0.8 (80%).

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood of this evidence if Adam was not studying agricultural and veterinary science. Given that these traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, good at solving puzzles, high intelligence) could fit into several other fields such as biology, ecology, psychology, or even philosophy, this probability could be moderately high. We might estimate this to be around 0.3 (30%).

### Calculation with Bayes' Rule

Bayes' Rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \[P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)\]

\[
P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.3 \cdot 0.95)
\]

\[
P(E) = 0.04 + 0.285 = 0.325
\]

Now calculate \(P(H|E)\):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.325} = \frac{0.04}{0.325} \approx 0.123
\]

So the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given the evidence is approximately 0.123 (12.3%).
