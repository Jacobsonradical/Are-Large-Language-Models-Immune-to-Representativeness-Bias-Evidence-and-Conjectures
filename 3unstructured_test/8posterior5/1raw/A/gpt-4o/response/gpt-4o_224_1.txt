Let's denote:

- \( P(H) \) as the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \) as the probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) as the probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(H|E) \) as the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch E.

### Estimating the Values

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**
   - Given that Adam is a graduate student in the U.S. and considering the distribution of graduate students across various fields, let's assume the prior probability \( P(H) \) is relatively low but not negligible. A reasonable estimate might be around \( 0.05 \) (since agricultural and veterinary science is a specific field).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**
   - The personality sketch of Adam aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science, as this field often attracts individuals with a love for nature, plants, and animals. Also, empathy, curiosity about nature, and high intelligence are beneficial traits in this field.
   - Given this, \( P(E|H) \) should be relatively high. Let's estimate it at \( 0.8 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**
   - The personality sketch of Adam is also moderately compatible with other fields that require high intelligence and appreciation for hard work, such as environmental science, biology, psychology, etc.
   - However, it might be less likely for fields unrelated to nature, plants, or animals.
   - Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) at \( 0.2 \).

### Applying Bayes' Rule

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be expanded using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Plugging in the estimates:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{(0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.19} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.174 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.174.
