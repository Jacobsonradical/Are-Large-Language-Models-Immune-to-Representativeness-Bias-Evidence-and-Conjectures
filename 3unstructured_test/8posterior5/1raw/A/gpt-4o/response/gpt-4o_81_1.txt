Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. **P(H):** This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. We'll assume this is somewhat low because it's a specific field. I'll set this at 0.1 as a reasonable starting point.

2. **P(E|H):** This is the probability of observing the evidence E (Adam's personality sketch) if the hypothesis H (Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science) is true.

   Given Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, appreciation for hard work, and knowledge of nature, P(E|H) is likely quite high. Let's set this at 0.8.

3. **P(E|Â¬H):** This is the probability of observing evidence E if H is not true. Given that the traits described in E could be somewhat common, but not exclusive to agricultural and veterinary science, let's set this at 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.1) + (0.3 \times 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.27 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.35 \]

Now, applying Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.35} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.229 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given the personality sketch E is approximately 0.229.
