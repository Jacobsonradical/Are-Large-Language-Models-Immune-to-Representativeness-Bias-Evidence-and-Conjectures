Let's analyze the situation and quantify probabilities as requested.

1. **P(H):** This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given that there are many possible fields of study a graduate student could choose from, but considering Adam's strong interest in nature, animals, and plants, let's conservatively set this probability to 0.1 (assuming there are roughly 10 fields of equal likelihood which is a simplification).

2. **P(E|H):** This is the likelihood of observing the personality traits given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's interests and traits, it's quite likely that someone in this field would have such a personality. Let's assign this a high value, say 0.8.

3. **P(E|¬H):** This is the likelihood of observing the personality traits given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. While his traits could fit several fields (like biology, environmental science, etc.), they are less likely to align with fields unrelated to nature and animals. So, let's estimate this at 0.2.

Applying Bayes' Rule to compute P(H|E):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H)} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.18} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.3077 \]

So, presenting our answer in the desired format:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.3077"
}
