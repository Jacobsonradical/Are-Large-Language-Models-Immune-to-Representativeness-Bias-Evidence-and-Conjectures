To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given the personality sketch \( E \), we need to use Bayes' rule, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch \( E \).

Since \( P(E) \) can be computed as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's assign reasonable values to these probabilities based on the given information:

1. **\( P(H) \)**: Given no additional context about number of graduate students in each field, let’s assume the prior probability is evenly distributed across a broad range of fields. For simplicity, let’s assume \( P(H) \) to be 0.05 (5%).
2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's traits align well with an interest in agricultural and veterinary science. Curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, and love for animals strongly align with characteristics of students in this field. Let's assign this a high probability, say 0.9 (90%).
3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Adam’s traits could fit many other fields too, but perhaps less perfectly than agricultural and veterinary science. Let’s assign this a moderate probability, say 0.2 (20%).

Now we can calculate \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.045 + 0.19 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.235 \]

Finally, using Bayes’ rule to compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.235} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.235} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.191 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given the personality sketch is approximately 0.191, or 19.1%.
