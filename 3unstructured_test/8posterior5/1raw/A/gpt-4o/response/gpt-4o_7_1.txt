To calculate the probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given the personality sketch \( E \), we use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's break down the required probabilities:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This is the initial probability of the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science before any personality evidence. Since there are many fields of study a graduate student could be enrolled in, we can assume a low prior probability for any specific field. For the sake of this calculation, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability that Adam would display the characteristics described in E if he were enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work fit well with this field. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

3. **Likelihood for Complement \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability that Adam would display the characteristics described in E if he were **not** enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. The traits described could also reasonably fit students in other fields that involve understanding and empathy, such as psychology, biology, or social sciences, though perhaps not as strongly. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

4. **Evidence Probability \( P(E) \)**: This is the total probability of exhibiting the characteristics described in E. It can be computed using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.27 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.35 \]

Now, apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.35} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.229 \]

Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.229.
