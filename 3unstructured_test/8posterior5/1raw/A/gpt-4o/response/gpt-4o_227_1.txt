To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in "agricultural and veterinary science" given his personality sketch \( E \), we can use Bayes' rule. Let's denote:

- \( H \): Hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in "agricultural and veterinary science".
- \( \neg H \): Hypothesis that Adam was not enrolled in "agricultural and veterinary science".

According to Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

We need to estimate the following probabilities:

1. **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Let's assume that the percentage of graduate students in the U.S. enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is about 5%. So, \( P(H) = 0.05 \).

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of having the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Given Adam's strong empathy, deep love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants, and appreciation for hard work, it is likely that students in agricultural and veterinary science would exhibit these traits. Hence, \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of having the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - While these traits might be more common in students enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, they can also be found in students of other fields. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

Now, we calculate \( P(E) \):

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

\[
P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95) = 0.04 + 0.19 = 0.23
\]

Finally, we apply Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.23} \approx 0.174
\]

Hence, the probability that Adam was enrolled in "agricultural and veterinary science" given his personality sketch is approximately 0.174.
