Let's denote the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science as \( H_{AVS} \).

1. **\( P(H_{AVS}) \):** This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given that there are numerous fields of study in higher education, the prior probability might be relatively low. Let's assume \( P(H_{AVS}) = 0.05 \) (since it needs to be a small probability, but not so small that it dismisses his interest and empathy towards animals and nature).

2. **\( P(E|H_{AVS}) \):** This is the probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Adam's curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals strongly align with the attributes of someone studying in this field. Let's assume \( P(E|H_{AVS}) = 0.8 \).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \):** This is the probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. While it's still possible for him to have these traits and be studying in another field, it’s less likely compared to if he were in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) = 0.2 \).

Now, using Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H_{AVS}|E) \):

\[ 
P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)} 
\]

Where \( P(E) \) is given by:
\[ 
P(E) = P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) + P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \cdot P(\neg H_{AVS}) 
\]

Substituting the values:
\[ 
P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95) 
\]
\[ 
P(E) = 0.04 + 0.19 = 0.23 
\]

Now apply Bayes' rule:
\[ 
P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.23} 
\]
\[ 
P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.23} \approx 0.1739 
\]

So, the posterior probability \( P(H_{AVS}|E) \approx 0.1739 \).
