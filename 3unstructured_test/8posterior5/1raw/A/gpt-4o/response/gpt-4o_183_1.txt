To apply Bayes' theorem, we need to estimate three probabilities: P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|¬H), where H is the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Then, we calculate P(H|E).

1. **Prior Probability, P(H):** 
   - This is the probability that a randomly selected graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This can vary significantly by institution and country. For simplicity, let's assume that 1 in 50 graduate students is in this field, which gives us P(H) = 0.02.

2. **Likelihood, P(E|H):** 
   - This is the probability of observing the evidence, E (Adam's personality sketch), given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science. Considering Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, love for animals, and understanding appreciation for hard work, these traits align well with someone in this field. Let's assign a high probability of 0.8 to P(E|H).

3. **Probability of Evidence, P(E|¬H):**
   - This is the probability of observing the evidence, E, if Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Although Adam's personality sketch could fit other fields such as biology, environmental science, or any field where intelligence and empathy are valuable, it may not align as well with fields unrelated to nature or animals. Let's assume a moderate probability of 0.1 for P(E|¬H).

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
where:
\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|¬H) \times P(¬H)
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.02) + (0.1 \times 0.98) = 0.016 + 0.098 = 0.114
\]
Then:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.02}{0.114} = \frac{0.016}{0.114} \approx 0.1404
\]

Since we are asked to provide an answer between 0 and 1, we can round this to a reasonable estimate.
