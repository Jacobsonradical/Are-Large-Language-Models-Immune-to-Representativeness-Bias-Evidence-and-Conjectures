To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science (denoted by H) given his personality sketch E, we need to evaluate the following probabilities:

- P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- P(E|H): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- P(E|¬H): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- P(H|E): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given personality sketch E.

Let's designate some reasonable estimates for these probabilities based on the given sketch.

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science as a graduate student in the U.S. might be estimated at 0.05. This is based on general enrollment patterns in various fields.

2. **P(E|H)**: Adam's personality sketch indicates a strong interest and empathy towards animals, nature, and understanding of dedication and hard work, which aligns well with agricultural and veterinary sciences. We can estimate this at 0.8.

3. **P(E|¬H)**: Although Adam's personality could fit other fields, such as environmental science or any discipline requiring empathy and intelligence, the combination is less specific. We can estimate this at around 0.1.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Substitute the values:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.1 \cdot 0.95} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.095} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.135} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.296 \]

Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.296.
