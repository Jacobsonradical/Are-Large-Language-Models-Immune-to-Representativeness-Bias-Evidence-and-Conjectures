To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science based on his personality sketch, we start by estimating each of the following probabilities:

1. P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
2. P(E|H): The probability of observing Adam’s personality traits given that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. P(E|\neg H): The probability of observing Adam’s personality traits given that he was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Assumptions and estimates:
- P(H): We can assume a relatively low prior probability since agricultural and veterinary science is just one of many fields. Let's estimate this as 0.1.
- P(E|H): Given that his personality and interests align well with agricultural and veterinary science (e.g., interest in nature, plants, empathy, love for animals), we can estimate this as relatively high. Let's assume 0.8.
- P(E|\neg H): This is the probability that someone with his traits is not in this field, which might be moderately high due to the general nature of his traits overlapping with other fields. Let's estimate this as 0.3.

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E| \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Substituting the estimated values:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{(0.8 \times 0.1) + (0.3 \times 0.9)} \]

Calculating the values:

\[ \text{Numerator} = 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \]

\[ \text{Denominator} = (0.8 \times 0.1) + (0.3 \times 0.9) = 0.08 + 0.27 = 0.35 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \approx 0.2286 \]

Rounding to two decimal places:

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.23 \]

So, the answer is:
