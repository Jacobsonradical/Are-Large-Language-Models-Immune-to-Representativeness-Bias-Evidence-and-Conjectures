To tackle this problem, first, we'll break down each of the required probabilities to apply Bayes' rule correctly.

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume the prior probability is based on the general enrollment rate in this field among graduate students in the U.S. 
   - Let’s say approximately 5% of graduate students are in agricultural and veterinary science.
   So, P(H) = 0.05.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Adam’s curiosity about nature, love for animals, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work are traits commonly found in this field. Hence, P(E|H) is likely high.
   Let’s assume P(E|H) ≈ 0.8.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given that he is NOT in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - These traits might also be found in other fields that require dedication, intelligence, empathy, and interest in animals or nature (e.g., biology, environmental science). However, these traits might be less aligned compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
   Let's assume P(E|\neg H) ≈ 0.2.

Now, we apply Bayes' rule to compute P(H|E):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Plug in the values:
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.19 = 0.23 \]

Now compute P(H|E):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.04}{0.23} \approx 0.174 \]

So, the probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch E is approximately 0.174.
