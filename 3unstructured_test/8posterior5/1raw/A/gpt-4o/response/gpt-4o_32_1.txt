To solve this problem using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that the student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that the student is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

We'll use these probabilities to calculate \( P(H|E) \), the posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given the personality sketch \( E \).

1. **Estimating \( P(H) \)**:
   - Let's assume that, in a graduate student population in the U.S., about 5% of students are enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This figure is just an estimate and can vary, but we will assume it for our calculation.
   - Hence, \( P(H) = 0.05 \).

2. **Estimating \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - The personality traits given in \( E \) (genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, appreciation for dedication) align well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science.
   - We can assume a relatively high probability for \( P(E|H) \). For our purposes, we might estimate this to be around 0.8.
   
3. **Estimating \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability that someone not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science would still have these personality traits.
   - Traits like curiosity about nature, empathy, and intelligence can be common among graduate students from other fields as well. Hence, this probability might be relatively high but less than \( P(E|H) \). We might estimate this to be around 0.2.

Given these estimates:
- \( P(H) = 0.05 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \)

Now, using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.95 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.19 = 0.23 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.1739 \]

Therefore,
