Of course, let's break down the problem as follows:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

We will then use Bayes' rule, which is:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \), let's first consider assigning values to these probabilities:

1. **P(H):** The prior probability that a graduate student in the U.S. is studying agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume this probability is relatively low given the wide range of fields. An estimate might be around 0.05 (i.e., 5%).

2. **P(E|H):** The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature, let's assume this is high, around 0.8 (i.e., 80%).

3. **P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Given that his traits could fit into several other fields especially those related to nature or animals but not necessarily limited to them, let’s assume this is moderate, about 0.3 (i.e., 30%).

Next, we calculate the total probability of E, P(E):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.3 \cdot 0.95 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.285 = 0.325 \]

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.325} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.325} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.123 \]

Thus, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is:
