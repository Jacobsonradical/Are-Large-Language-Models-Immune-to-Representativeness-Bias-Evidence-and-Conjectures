Let's apply Bayes' theorem to compute \( P(H|E) \), the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch \( E \).

Bayes' Theorem is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence (personality sketch \( E \)) given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the same evidence given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the evidence.

To make the computation, we need to estimate these probabilities.

### Assumptions:

1. \( P(H) \): Let’s assume a prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Since this is quite a specific field and considering the number of potential fields in graduate studies, we might estimate:
   \[ P(H) = 0.1 \]

2. \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's traits (e.g., a love for nature, animals, and an appreciation for hard work), these align well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. Hence, let’s estimate:
   \[ P(E|H) = 0.7 \]

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): This is the probability of observing the same personality traits in someone not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. These traits are somewhat common and could be found in many fields, though perhaps slightly less so. Let’s estimate:
   \[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \]

4. \( P(E) \): This is a normalization factor which ensures the probabilities sum to 1. It is computed via the law of total probability:
   \[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
   
   \[
   P(E) = (0.7 \times 0.1) + (0.3 \times 0.9)
   \]
   \[
   P(E) = 0.07 + 0.27
   \]
   \[
   P(E) = 0.34
   \]

### Applying Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.1}{0.34}
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.07}{0.34}
\]
\[
P(H|E) \approx 0.206
\]
