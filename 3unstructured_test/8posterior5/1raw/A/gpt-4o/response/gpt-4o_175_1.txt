Let's decompose this step-by-step to reach the answer using Bayes' rule.

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam, a graduate student in the U.S., is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Since we have no specific information about the distribution of graduate students across fields:
   - Let's assume P(H) is fairly low, perhaps around 0.05 (since agricultural and veterinary science is a specialized field).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch E given that he is indeed studying agricultural and veterinary science. Based on his personality sketch (curiosity about nature, love for animals, high intelligence, empathy, etc.), it is highly consistent with someone in this field.
   - Let's assume P(E|H) is high, say 0.9.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch E given that he is not studying agricultural and veterinary science. While these traits might fit other fields too, they are less exclusively aligned with other fields.
   - Let's assume P(E|\neg H) is lower, say 0.2.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where,
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.045 + 0.19 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.235 \]

Now, calculating \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.235} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.235} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.191 \]

So, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is roughly 0.191.
