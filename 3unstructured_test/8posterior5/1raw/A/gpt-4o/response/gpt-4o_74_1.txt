To apply Bayes' Rule in this situation, we need to determine the following probabilities:

- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(H|E) \): Posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch.

Given the personality sketch of Adam, hereâ€™s an estimation:

1. **Prior probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Let's assume the proportion of graduate students enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in the U.S. is small. Let's assign an estimated probability of 0.05.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Given Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, enrolling in agricultural and veterinary science seems highly consistent with his personality. We can assign a high likelihood, such as 0.9.

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - Even if Adam wasn't enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, his traits like empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature and plants could still align with other fields (e.g., biology, environmental science). Given the broader range of fields that might attract someone with these traits, we should assign a moderate likelihood, such as 0.3.

Bayes' Rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Substitute the values:
\[ P(E) = 0.9 \cdot 0.05 + 0.3 \cdot 0.95 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.045 + 0.285 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.33 \]

Now, calculate \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.33} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.33} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.136 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.136.
