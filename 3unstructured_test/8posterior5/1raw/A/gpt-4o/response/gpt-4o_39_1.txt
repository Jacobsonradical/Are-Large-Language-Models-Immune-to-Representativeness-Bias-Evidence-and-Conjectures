To compute \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the values of \(P(H)\), \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E|\neg H)\). 

Let's denote:
- \(P(H)\) as the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field of agricultural and veterinary science.
- \(P(E|H)\) as the probability of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\) as the probability of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.
- \(P(E)\) as the total probability of observing the personality sketch \(E\).

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To make the calculation, we'll estimate these probabilities.

### Estimates
1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**:
   Let's assume that the prior probability \(P(H)\) is reasonably low, as there are many possible fields Adam could be studying. For estimation, let's take \(P(H) = 0.1\). This indicates a 10% chance that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science before knowing his personality traits.

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**:
   Given Adam’s traits: genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, etc., it is quite likely he would be in this field. Let’s assign a high probability: \(P(E|H) = 0.7\).

3. **Alternative Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)**:
   This is the probability of Adam having these traits and being in a different field. Adam's traits might also align with other science-related fields, hence let's assume \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.2\).

4. **Total Probability \(P(E)\)**:
   This can be computed using the law of total probability:
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
   \]
   \[
   P(E) = (0.7 \times 0.1) + (0.2 \times 0.9) = 0.07 + 0.18 = 0.25
   \]

### Application of Bayes' Rule
Substituting these values into Bayes’ rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.25} = \frac{0.07}{0.25} = 0.28
\]

### Result
Using Bayes' rule, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given the personality sketch \(E\) is:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.28"
}
