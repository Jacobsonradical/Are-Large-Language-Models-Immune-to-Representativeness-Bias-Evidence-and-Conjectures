To use Bayes' rule, we need to calculate \( P(H|E) \), the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science (H) given the personality sketch (E). 

Given the information:
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
  - Since many fields of study exist, let's assume a relatively low prior, say \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
- \(P(E|H)\) is the probability of observing the personality sketch given he is in agricultural and veterinary science.
  - Given the sketch's focus on plants, animals, nature, and related fields, this is likely high. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
- \(P(E|\neg H)\) is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
  - Since the sketch is somewhat specific to those interests but not exclusive, let's assume this is relatively lower but not negligible, say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.27 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.35 \]

Now,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.35} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.229 \]

Thus, the probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given the personality sketch is approximately 0.229.
