Let's go through the reasoning step by step:

1. **P(H): Prior Probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.**

   Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, it is reasonable to think he might be inclined to enroll in a field like agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assign a moderate prior probability considering the variety of fields a graduate student could enroll in:

   P(H) = 0.2

2. **P(E|H): Probability of the personality sketch E given the hypothesis H.**

   If Adam were enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, his interests and personality traits (nature, plants, animals, empathy, etc.) strongly correlate with the characteristics typically found in this field. Therefore, we can assign a high probability to this conditional:

   P(E|H) = 0.9

3. **P(E|\neg H): Probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.**

   Even if Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, it is possible for people in other fields (e.g., environmental science, biology, psychology) to share similar interests and traits. However, it would probably be less likely than if he were in agricultural and veterinary science:

   P(E|\neg H) = 0.3

4. **Calculating P(H|E) using Bayes Rule:**

   Bayes' Rule states that:

   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]

   First, we need to compute P(E):

   \[
   P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
   \]

   \[
   P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8)
   \]

   \[
   P(E) = 0.18 + 0.24 = 0.42
   \]

   Now we can compute P(H|E):

   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.2}{0.42}
   \]

   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.18}{0.42} \approx 0.4286
   \]

Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch:
