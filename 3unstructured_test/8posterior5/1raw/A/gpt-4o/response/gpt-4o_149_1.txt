To estimate the probabilities, let's break down the problem:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is not in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability of Adam being in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality traits.

For simplicity, we will estimate these probabilities subjectively based on the personality sketch and typical characteristics of someone in agricultural and veterinary science:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume the probability of a random graduate student being in this field is moderately low, say 0.05 (5%).

2. \( P(E|H) \): If Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science, it is highly likely he would have a love for nature, animals, and a strong appreciation for hard work. Let's estimate this as 0.8 (80%).

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): If Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science, he could still have these personality traits, but these traits are less specific to other fields. Let's estimate this as 0.15 (15%).

Now, applying Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) P(H) + P(E|\neg H) P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.8 \times 0.05 + 0.15 \times 0.95 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.1425 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.1825 \]

Thus,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.1825} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.1825} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.219 \]

So, the probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 21.9%.
