To solve the problem, we will use Bayes' theorem, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam’s personality sketch given that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch.

To simplify calculations, the formula can be adjusted as follows:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)} \]

Let's assign hypothetical values to each of these probabilities:

1. **P(H)**: Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
    - This can be estimated based on the general distribution of graduate students' fields of study. Suppose the chance is around 10%.
    - \( P(H) = 0.10 \)

2. **P(E|H)**: Probability of Adam having the personality traits described, given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science.
    - Given his interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy, it is likely high for someone in this field.
    - Let’s assume \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \)

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability of Adam having the personality traits described, if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science.
    - These traits may not be as common outside this field but can still be found in other fields like biology, environmental science, etc.
    - Let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \)

Now, compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.10}{0.7 \cdot 0.10 + 0.2 \cdot (1 - 0.10)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.07}{0.07 + 0.18} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.07}{0.25} \]

\[ P(H|E) = 0.28 \]

Now, let's format the answer as requested:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.28"
