Let's denote the relevant probabilities:

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- **P(H|E)**: The posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch.

Given the details in the personality sketch (E), let's estimate the probabilities:

1. **P(H)**: Since agricultural and veterinary science is a relatively niche field but not extremely rare, let's assign a moderate prior probability. For simplicity, let's estimate it around 0.1 or 10%.

2. **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy, these traits are highly compatible with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, we can assign a high probability, say 0.8 or 80%.

3. **P(E|¬H)**: While Adam's traits do strongly fit agricultural and veterinary science, they could still apply to other fields such as biology, environmental science, or even psychology. Therefore, we can assign a less high probability, say 0.2 or 20%.

Now, we use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the personality sketch E, which can be calculated as:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H)
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) = 0.08 + 0.18 = 0.26
\]

Then,

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.26} \approx 0.3077
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) can be approximated as 0.31 or 31%.
