To evaluate \( P(H|E) \), the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given the personality sketch \( E \), we need to estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). 

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This will vary, but let's assume the typical proportion of students enrolled in this field among all graduate programs is about 5%, or 0.05.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as his empathy and intelligence, it is quite likely that these traits fit well with someone in this field. Let's assign a high value, say 0.7.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. While these traits are not exclusive to this field and can be found in other fields, they are relatively specific. Let's assign this a moderate likelihood, say 0.2.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \times 0.05) + (0.2 \times 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.035 + 0.19 = 0.225 \]

Now, compute \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.05}{0.225} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.035}{0.225} = \frac{35}{225} \approx 0.156 \]

So the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given the personality sketch \( E \) is approximately 0.156.
