To calculate the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we need to assess the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood of the evidence given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science \( P(E|\neg H) \). After that, weâ€™ll compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule.

Given Adam's strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, these traits fit well with someone who might study agricultural and veterinary science.

### Prior Probability (\( P(H) \)):
Without specific statistics, we can assume a relatively low but non-negligible prior probability since agricultural and veterinary science is a specialized field. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).

### Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \)):
Given the traits described in E (interest in nature, plants, animals, and dedication), it is very likely that these traits would align with someone in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume this value to be high, say \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

### Likelihood of Evidence Not Given H (\( P(E|\neg H) \)):
These traits, while strongly aligned with agricultural and veterinary science, can also reasonably fit many other fields, such as biology, environmental science, and even non-scientific fields. Let's assign a moderate value to this, say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

### Bayes' Rule:
Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Calculating \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.3 \cdot 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.285 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.325 \]

Now, calculating \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.325} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.325} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.123 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality traits is approximately 0.123.
