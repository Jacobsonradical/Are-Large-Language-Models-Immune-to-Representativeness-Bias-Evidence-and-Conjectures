To solve this problem using Bayes' theorem, we need to consider the following:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

We can use these probabilities with Bayes' theorem to compute \( P(H|E) \), the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch \( E \).

Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be expanded using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's break this down:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
   - Given we have no initial information about Adamâ€™s likelihood of being in any particular field, we can assume a uniform prior probability distribution. Let's consider \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

2. **Conditional Probability \( P(E|H) \):**
   - Adam has characteristics consistent with someone interested in agricultural and veterinary science (e.g., curiosity about nature, love for animals, understanding of hard work). These traits are highly indicative of this field.
   - Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

3. **Conditional Probability \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   - For any other field, the probability that someone would have Adam's personality might still be significant but not as high as for agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

Now, we can compute \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.18 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.26 \]

Finally, we use Bayes' theorem to compute \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{8}{26} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.3077 \]

Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.3077.
