Let's analyze the information step-by-step.

1. **P(H)**: The probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science purely based on generic graduate student distribution. Assume equal probability for simplicity across all fields. For simplicity, letâ€™s assign a base probability P(H) = 0.1, considering there could be around 10 major fields of study.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the evidence given that Adam enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Since his personality sketch strongly aligns with traits beneficial in this field (a deep love for animals, curiosity about nature, warm heart, strong empathy), we can assign a fairly high value, say P(E|H) = 0.9.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the evidence given that Adam enrolled in a field other than agricultural and veterinary science. It is less likely, although not impossible, that such a personality would map onto other fields. Let's assign a moderate probability to reflect that, say P(E|\neg H) = 0.2.

Now using Bayes' Rule to calculate P(H|E):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.1}{(0.9 \times 0.1) + (0.2 \times 0.9)} 
= \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.18}
= \frac{0.09}{0.27}
= 0.333 
\]

Thus, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.333.
