To solve this, we need to apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here:
- \( H \) is the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( E \) is the evidence which is Adam's personality sketch.

Given the personality sketch, we can evaluate the probabilities as follows:

1. **P(H)**: This is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Since we don't have specific data, we can assume this field is one of many possible fields. Let's assume the prior probability is \(0.1\).

2. **P(E|H)**: This is the probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his curiosity about nature, a love for animals, and a warm heart, it's highly likely that this personality aligns with someone in this field. Let's estimate this probability to be fairly high at \(0.8\).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: This is the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Adam's traits could fit other fields, but it might be less likely compared to agricultural and veterinary science. Let's estimate this probability to be \(0.3\).

4. **P(E)**: This is the total probability of observing the personality sketch regardless of the field. Using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.1) + (0.3 \times 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.27 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.35 \]

Now, applying Bayes' rule to find \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.35} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.2286 \]

Thus, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.2286.
