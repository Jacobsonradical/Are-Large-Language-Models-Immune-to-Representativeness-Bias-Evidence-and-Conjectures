To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, I need to estimate the probabilities:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

***Estimating the probabilities:***

1. **P(H)**: This represents the prior probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Assuming uniform distribution across fields, let's estimate this to be around 0.1 (10%).

2. **P(E|H)**: This represents the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) if Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given the strong alignment with curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work in this field, let's estimate this to be high, around 0.7 (70%).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: This represents the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) if Adam is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given the specific interests mentioned, it's less likely but still possible he might be found in other fields related to nature or animals. Let's estimate this to be lower, around 0.3 (30%).

***Calculating \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule:***

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} 
\]

Where \( P(E) \) can be expanded using the law of total probability:
\[ 
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

So:

\[ 
P(E) = 0.7 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9 = 0.07 + 0.27 = 0.34 
\]

Then:

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.34} = \frac{0.07}{0.34} \approx 0.206 
\]

Thus, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.206.
