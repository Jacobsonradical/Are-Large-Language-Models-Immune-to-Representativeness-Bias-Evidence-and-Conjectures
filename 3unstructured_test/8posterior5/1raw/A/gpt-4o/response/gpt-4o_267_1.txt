To solve this, we'll evaluate the probabilities step-by-step and then use Bayes' Rule to compute \( P(H|E) \).

1. **Prior Probability (\( P(H) \))**:
   We need to estimate the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. For simplicity, let's assume that a graduate student could equally be enrolled in any of 10 different fields. Therefore, \( P(H) \approx \frac{1}{10} = 0.1 \).

2. **Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \))**:
   Given that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, the probability of observing his personality traits (curiosity about nature, appreciation for hard work, strong empathy for animals, etc.) seems quite high. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).

3. **Probability of Evidence given not H (\( P(E|\neg H) \))**:
   If Adam were not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, there are still many fields where his traits could fit well, though perhaps not as perfectly as in agricultural and veterinary science. Letâ€™s estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

4. **Using Bayes' Rule**:
   Bayes' Rule states:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   We need to calculate \( P(E) \):
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)
   \]
   \[
   P(E) = (0.7 \times 0.1) + (0.3 \times 0.9) = 0.07 + 0.27 = 0.34
   \]

   Now calculate \( P(H|E) \):
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.1}{0.34} = \frac{0.07}{0.34} \approx 0.206
   \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality traits and background is approximately 0.206 or 20.6%.
