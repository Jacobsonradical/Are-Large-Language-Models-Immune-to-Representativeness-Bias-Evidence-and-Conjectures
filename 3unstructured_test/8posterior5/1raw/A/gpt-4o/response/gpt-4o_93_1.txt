To calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

In this context:
- \( H \): Adam was enrolled in the field of agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( E \): The personality sketch of Adam.

To estimate the probabilities, let's break them down:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given no additional information about the distribution of students among different fields, we might assume a uniform distribution. However, considering that graduate students in agricultural and veterinary sciences might be less common than some other fields like business or engineering, let's assign a moderate prior. For simplicity, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his strong empathy, love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work, it's reasonable to assume that this personality sketch is quite compatible with a student in agricultural and veterinary science. This might be quite high, say \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. While his traits are suited for agricultural and veterinary sciences, they might also fit for several other fields like environmental science, biology, or psychology. Thus, this probability is not negligible but lower than \( P(E|H) \). Letâ€™s assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Now, we need to find \( P(E) \), which is the total probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \). This can be computed using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Substitute the values:

\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.27 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.35 \]

Finally, use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.35} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.229 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given the personality sketch is approximately 0.229.
