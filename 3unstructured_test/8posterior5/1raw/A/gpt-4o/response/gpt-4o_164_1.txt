To use Bayes' rule to find the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch \(E\), let's follow these steps:

Bayes’ rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of Adam having the personality sketch \(E\) given that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \(P(E)\) is the overall probability of Adam having the personality sketch \(E\).
- \(P(E|\neg H)\) is the likelihood of Adam having the personality sketch \(E\) given he was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

First, let's make educated assumptions for \(P(H)\), \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E|\neg H)\):

1. **\(P(H)\) (Prior Probability)**: 
   Let's assume the probability of a graduate student being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in general is about 0.05 (5%).

2. **\(P(E|H)\) (Likelihood)**: 
   Given Adam’s curiosity about nature, plants, love for animals, and empathy, these traits align very well with someone in the agricultural and veterinary science field. Thus, this probability should be high:
   We can assume \(P(E|H)\) to be around 0.8 (80%).

3. **\(P(E|\neg H)\) (Likelihood if not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science)**:
   Adam’s traits can also match other fields to some degree, like environmental science, biology, or psychology to name a few. So, while not as high as \(P(E|H)\), it wouldn't be negligible. We estimate \(P(E|\neg H)\) to be around 0.2 (20%).

Now, let's compute \(P(E)\):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.19 = 0.23 \]

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.23} \approx 0.1739 \]

Thus, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately \(0.174\).
