To answer the question, let's use Bayes' theorem to compute \( P(H|E) \) (the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch).

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.

### Assumptions:
1. \( P(H) \): We assume the prior probability \( P(H) \) for each field to be equally likely. Since there are many potential fields Adam could be enrolled in, we can consider a simple uniform distribution for the sake of simplicity. Let's assume there are 10 potential fields of study, so \( P(H) \) could be \( \frac{1}{10} = 0.1 \).

2. \( P(E|H) \): Based on Adam’s sketch, his traits align well with agricultural and veterinary science:
    - Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
    - Deep love for animals.

   We might consider \( P(E|H) \) to be high. Let's give it a value of 0.8.

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): This is the probability of the personality sketch occurring if Adam were in a different field. Given that some of Adam's traits could also be beneficial in other fields (e.g., biology, environmental science), this value is relatively lower than \( P(E|H) \). Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

4. \( P(E) \): This is the total probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch, regardless of the field he is enrolled in. It can be derived from the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
- \( P(H) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(\neg H) = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9 \)
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) = 0.08 + 0.18 = 0.26 \]

### Calculation:

Now, apply the values to Bayes’ theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.26} = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \approx 0.3077 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.3077.
