To compute the probability P(H|E) that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch E, we need to estimate the following probabilities:

1. P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
2. P(E|H): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. P(E|\neg H): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Given Adam's personality sketch, which includes a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, a deep love for animals, and empathy, it is reasonable to assume that these traits align well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science.

Here are the estimations:

1. P(H) (prior probability for agricultural and veterinary science): It is reasonable to assume that out of all possible fields of study, agricultural and veterinary science is one of many. Let's assume a moderate prior probability. Therefore, we'll estimate P(H) to be around 0.1.

2. P(E|H) (probability of observing the sketch given agricultural and veterinary science): Given that his traits strongly align with the field of agricultural and veterinary science, we'll consider this probability to be high. Let's estimate P(E|H) to be 0.7.

3. P(E|\neg H) (probability of observing the sketch given not agricultural and veterinary science): While his personality characteristics are quite specific to fields like agricultural and veterinary science, they could still be moderately consistent with other fields that involve nature, animals, and intellectual activities. Therefore, we estimate P(E|\neg H) to be around 0.3.

Now, we can use Bayes' rule to compute P(H|E):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{ P(E|H) \cdot P(H) }{ P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) } \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{ 0.7 \times 0.1 }{ (0.7 \times 0.1) + (0.3 \times 0.9) } \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{ 0.07 }{ 0.07 + 0.27 } \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{ 0.07 }{ 0.34 } \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.2059 \]

Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.206.
