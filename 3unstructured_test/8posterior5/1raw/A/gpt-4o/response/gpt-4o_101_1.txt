To calculate the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science (H) based on his personality sketch (E), we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the personality sketch, which can be found using \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Let's assign these probabilities based on reasonable assumptions from the sketch:

1. \( P(H) \): Let's assume the prior probability that a graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. For simplicity, we'll set this to 0.05 (5%).

2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch fits someone in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his love for nature, plants, and animals, and his appreciation for hard work and dedication, this probability is likely high. Let's set it to 0.8 (80%).

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch fits someone who is not in agricultural and veterinary science. While his personality traits can be found in other fields, they are particularly strong indicators for agricultural sciences. Let's estimate this at 0.2 (20%).

Now calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.95 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.19 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.23 \]

Now, calculate \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.04}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.1739 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.174 (or 17.4%).
