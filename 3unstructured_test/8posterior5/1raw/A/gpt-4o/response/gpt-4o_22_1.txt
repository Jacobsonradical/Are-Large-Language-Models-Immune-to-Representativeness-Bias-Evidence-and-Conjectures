Sure, let's estimate the required probabilities and then apply Bayes' Rule to compute \( P(H|E) \).

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Suppose we assume that about 5% (0.05) of graduate students are in this field. (This is an estimation and can vary depending on the specific context of the U.S. graduate school population.)

2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Considering Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work aligns very well with the field of agricultural and veterinary science, we could estimate this probability to be quite high. Let's assign it a value of 0.8.

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Adam's traits of empathy, high intelligence, and curiosity could be applicable to many other fields as well. Letâ€™s conservatively estimate this probability at 0.1.

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Let's plug in the values:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.8 \times 0.05 + 0.1 \times 0.95} \]

Calculate the numerator:

\[ 0.8 \times 0.05 = 0.04 \]

Calculate the denominator:

\[ 0.8 \times 0.05 + 0.1 \times 0.95 = 0.04 + 0.095 = 0.135 \]

Now divide:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.135} \approx 0.296 \]

Thus, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.296.
