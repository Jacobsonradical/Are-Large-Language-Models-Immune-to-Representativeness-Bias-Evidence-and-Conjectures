To apply Bayes' rule, we need to assess the probabilities of P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|\neg H) for the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Here’s the process:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let’s consider the proportion of students enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science among all fields. It’s not a broadly common field, so we might estimate it to be relatively low.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch E given the hypothesis H. Considering Adam’s traits—interest in nature, plants, animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work—these align very well with the field of agricultural and veterinary science.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that H is false (i.e., Adam is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science). Although Adam's traits might fit other fields like biology or environmental science, typically these exact characteristics are most strongly aligned with agricultural and veterinary science.

Assuming reasonable values:

- P(H) ≈ 0.05 (assuming 5% of graduate students are in agricultural and veterinary science)
- P(E|H) ≈ 0.8 (very high likelihood because the traits match closely with agricultural and veterinary science)
- P(E|\neg H) ≈ 0.1 (traits might fit elsewhere, but not as strongly)

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \)

First, calculate \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.1 \cdot 0.95) \\
          = 0.04 + 0.095 \\
          = 0.135 \]

Now, calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.135} \\
               = \frac{0.04}{0.135} \\
               \approx 0.296 \]

So the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is roughly 0.296.
