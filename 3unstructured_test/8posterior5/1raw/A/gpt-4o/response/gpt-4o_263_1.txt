To solve for \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to compute the probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

1. **\( P(H) \) - The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science:**
   - Without additional context, we would assume that Adam, as a graduate student, has an equal chance of being enrolled in any field. However, due to the nature of his personality sketch involving a deep love for animals and nature, the prior probability could be higher than average for this field. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \) (indicating a slightly higher likelihood).

2. **\( P(E|H) \) - The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he were enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science:**
   - Given that his traits align closely with interests typically found in this field (love for nature, animals, and understanding hard work), the probability \( P(E|H) \) would be quite high. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \) - The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he were not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science:**
   - His characteristics could still fit many other fields to varying extents, but likely to a lesser degree than agricultural and veterinary science. Hence, \( P(E|\neg H) \) would be lower. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
\]

Substituting in the assumed values:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{0.8 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8}
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.16}{0.16 + 0.24}
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.16}{0.40}
\]

\[
P(H|E) = 0.4
\]

Thus, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is 0.4.
