To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we'll follow these steps using Bayes' Theorem:

Bayes’ Theorem formula is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Let's make reasonable estimations for these probabilities based on the information provided:

1. **P(H)** - Prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Let's assume that agricultural and veterinary science is a moderately popular field among graduate students. For the purposes of hypothesis, let’s assume this to be around \( P(H) = 0.10 \) or 10%.

2. **P(E|H)** - Probability of having Adam’s personality traits given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Adam’s traits (interest in nature, love for animals, empathy, puzzle-solving skills) strongly align with the characteristics beneficial in agricultural and veterinary science. We can estimate this probability to be fairly high, say \( P(E|H) = 0.80 \) or 80%.

3. **P(E|\neg H)** - Probability of having Adam’s personality traits given that he is not in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Adam’s traits may also be relevant in other fields but perhaps not as strongly as in agricultural and veterinary science. We can reasonably estimate this to be lower, say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.30 \) or 30%.

To find \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.10) + (0.30 \cdot 0.90) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.27 \]

\[ P(E) = 0.35 \]

Now, apply Bayes’ Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.10}{0.35} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \]

\[ P(H|E) = 0.2286 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.23 or 23%.
