To solve the problem using Bayes' theorem, we need the following probabilities:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Without specific numerical values, we need to make educated guesses based on the information provided.

### Step 1: Estimate the Probabilities

1. **P(H)**: The probability of a graduate student being in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume this value (since it's a specialized field, it may not be very high). For simplicity, let's use \( P(H) = 0.1 \) as a rough estimate.

2. **P(E|H)**: Given that Adam is described with a curiosity about nature, plants, a love for animals, and a strong understanding of hard work, it's reasonable to assume a high likelihood that his personality fits the field of agricultural and veterinary science. So let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: This is the probability that Adam's personality sketch fits another field. Since his traits are relatively generic for scientifically inclined students (other fields like biology, environmental science etc. could fit these traits as well), we can assume a moderate value. Let's set \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

### Step 2: Apply Bayes' Theorem

Bayes' theorem is given as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)} {P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.27 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.35 \]

Substituting back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.35} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.229 \]
