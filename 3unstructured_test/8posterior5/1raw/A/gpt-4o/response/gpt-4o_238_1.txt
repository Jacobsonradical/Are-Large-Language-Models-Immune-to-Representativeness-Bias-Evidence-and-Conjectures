To solve this using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \), and then compute \( P(H|E) \) using the formula:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence (Adam's personality sketch) given that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence given that he was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the evidence, and it can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)
\]

Let's estimate each component:
1. \( P(H) \) (the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science): Suppose a reasonable prior for any specific field could be around 0.1 (given the many fields of study).
  
2. \( P(E|H) \) (the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science): Given his love for nature, animals, and empathy, this is likely quite high. Let's estimate this as 0.8.

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) (the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science): Although his traits are highly suitable for this field, they could also be present in students of other fields (e.g., biological sciences, environmental studies). Let's estimate this as 0.3.

4. \( P(E) \) (the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch):
   
\[
P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)
\]
\[
P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.1) + (0.3 \times 0.9)
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.08 + 0.27 = 0.35
\]

Now, apply Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.35}
\]
\[
P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.08}{0.35} \approx 0.229
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is approximately 0.229.
