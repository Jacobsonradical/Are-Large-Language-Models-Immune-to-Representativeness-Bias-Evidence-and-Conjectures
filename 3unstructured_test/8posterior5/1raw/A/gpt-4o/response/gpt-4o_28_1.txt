To calculate the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we can utilize Bayes' Theorem. Here's a breakdown of the steps involved:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
4. **P(H|E)**: The posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given the personality sketch E.

We can use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where \( P(E) \) can be expanded using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

**Assumptions and Reasoning:**

- Considering Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy, it is plausible to assume these traits align well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science.
- Let us assume the prior probability \( P(H) \) is reasonably moderate since it’s a specific field but not overly rare.
- The probability \( P(E|H) \) should be fairly high given how well the personality sketch matches typical traits needed in agricultural and veterinary science.
- The probability \( P(E|¬H) \) would reflect how likely such a personality sketch could emerge from someone in other fields. Given Adam’s specific traits, this might be lower as not all fields would strongly correlate with these traits.

Given these assumptions, we can assign values:

- P(H): 0.2 (There are many possible fields, 0.2 reflects a moderate prior)
- P(E|H): 0.8 (High since the traits match well with the field)
- P(E|¬H): 0.3 (Lower since the exact match of traits is less likely across all other fields)

Next, we compute \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) = 0.16 + 0.24 = 0.4 \]

Subsequently, the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{(0.8 \cdot 0.2)}{0.4} = \frac{0.16}{0.4} = 0.4 \]

Thus, the computed probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is:
