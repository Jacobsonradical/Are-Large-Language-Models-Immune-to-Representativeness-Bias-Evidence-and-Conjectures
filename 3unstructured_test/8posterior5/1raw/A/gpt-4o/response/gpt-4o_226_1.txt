To compute \( P(H|E) \) (the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch), we need to apply Bayes' rule. For the purposes of this exercise, we need to use some reasonable estimates for the probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Let's make some educated guesses:
- \( P(H) \) = Probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume this is 0.05 (5%).
- \( P(E|H) \) = Probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's strong affinity for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work, let's set this to 0.7 (70%).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) = Probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. While his traits could fit other fields, it's rarer, so let's estimate this as 0.1 (10%).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

where \( P(E) \) can be computed as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)\]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \times 0.05) + (0.1 \times 0.95)\]
\[ P(E) = 0.035 + 0.095\]
\[ P(E) = 0.13 \]

Now, calculate \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.05}{0.13} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.035}{0.13} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.269 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.269 (or 26.9%).
