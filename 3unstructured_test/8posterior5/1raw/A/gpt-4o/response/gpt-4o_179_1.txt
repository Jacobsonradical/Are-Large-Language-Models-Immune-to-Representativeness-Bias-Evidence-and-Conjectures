To compute the probability that Adam was studying agricultural and veterinary science (H) given his personality sketch (E), we'll use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

First, let's break down the components:

1. **P(H)**: Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Since we have no specific prior information, we'll assume a generic probability for any given field. Let's assume there are 10 commonly chosen fields by graduate students.

   \[ P(H) \approx \frac{1}{10} = 0.1 \]

2. **P(E|H)**: Probability of the evidence (E) given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his genuine curiosity about nature, plants, love for animals, and empathy, it is highly likely that his personality matches this field.

   \[ P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \]

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability of the evidence (E) given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. While his traits could align with some other fields, they are less likely to strongly overlap compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

   \[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \]

4. **P(E)**: Total probability of the evidence (E). This can be computed using the law of total probability:

   \[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
   \[ P(E) \approx (0.9 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) = 0.09 + 0.18 = 0.27 \]

Now, applying Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{0.27} = \frac{0.09}{0.27} \approx 0.333 \]

So, the probability that Adam was studying agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.333.
