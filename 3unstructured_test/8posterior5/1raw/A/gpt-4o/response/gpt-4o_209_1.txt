To use Bayes' rule to compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science based on his personality sketch, we first need to define our probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
4. \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given the personality sketch \( E \).

Let's define each step:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Without prior information specific to Adam's choices, we might assume a general, reasonable baseline. Let's assume \( P(H) \) is 0.1 (10%).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Adam's love for animals, nature, and plants fits well with this field. Let's assume \( P(E|H) \) is high, like 0.8.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. People with these traits might also be enrolled in fields like biology, environmental science, or another natural science. Thus, \( P(E|\neg H) \) might be relatively high but not as high as \( P(E|H) \). Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) \) is 0.4.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be expanded using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]

Substituting in the values:

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.1) + (0.4 \times 0.9) = 0.08 + 0.36 = 0.44 \]

Now, let's compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.44} \approx \frac{0.08}{0.44} = 0.1818 \]

So, the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \approx 0.1818 \).

Finally, in the specified format:
