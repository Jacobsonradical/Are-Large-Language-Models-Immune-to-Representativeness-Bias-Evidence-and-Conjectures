To calculate the probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need to judge the following probabilities:

**P(H)**: Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
**P(E|H)**: Probability of Adam exhibiting the personality traits given that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
**P(E|¬H)**: Probability of Adam exhibiting the personality traits given that he was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Let's make reasonable assumptions based on the attributes and personality traits provided:

1. **P(H)**: 
   - This is the prior probability of Adam being in agricultural and veterinary science. Assuming there are multiple fields of study he could have enrolled in, and given his characteristics, let's assume a moderate probability that aligns with his attributes.
   - Let’s estimate this value to be 0.10 (10%).

2. **P(E|H)**:
   - Given Adam’s genuine curiosity about nature and animals, it’s likely high that he would exhibit these traits if he were in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Let's set this probability fairly high, like 0.80 (80%).

3. **P(E|¬H)**:
   - Given Adam’s traits, there is still a reasonable chance he could exhibit these characteristics even if he were in a different field. Assuming there are several alternate fields he could be in:
   - Let’s estimate this value as 0.30 (30%).

We then use Bayes' rule to calculate P(H|E):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

First, to calculate P(E), we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Substituting the estimated values:

\[ P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.10) + (0.30 \cdot 0.90) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.27 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.35 \]

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.10}{0.35} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.229 \]

So the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, given his personality sketch, is approximately 0.229 (or 22.9%).
