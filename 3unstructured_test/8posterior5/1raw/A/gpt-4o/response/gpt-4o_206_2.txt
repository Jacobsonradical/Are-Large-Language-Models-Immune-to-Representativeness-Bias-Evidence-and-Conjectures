To compute \( P(H|E) \) where H is the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, we will use Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

First, let's define the probabilities:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume a reasonable prior probability - although this can vary widely, we'll assume a moderate value since it's a plausible field for someone with his interests.
   
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's curiosity about nature, his love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, this probability should be high.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Depending on other fields, this might be somewhat lower but still reasonably high because his characteristics could fit multiple fields.

Let's assume:
- \( P(H) = 0.2 \) (prior probability for agricultural and veterinary science)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \) (high probability that his traits match this field)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \) (lower probability his traits fit alternate fields, assuming some specificity)

We also need the total probability \( P(E) \) which is computed as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.2) + (0.2 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.16 + 0.16 = 0.32 \]

Now we use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{(0.8 \cdot 0.2)}{0.32} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.16}{0.32} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.5 \]

Putting this into the required format:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.5"
