To apply Bayes' rule and compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \), we need to consider the following components:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \).

Bayes' rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's make some reasonable assumptions for each probability:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being in agricultural and veterinary science could be assumed to be relatively low because not many people specialize in this field, but given his love for nature and animals, it could be higher than average. Let's say \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

2. \( P(E|H) \): Given that Adam was in agricultural and veterinary science, the likelihood of him having such a personality (love for nature and animals, empathy, intelligence) is very high. Thus, \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the same personality traits given that Adam was not in agricultural and veterinary science might be lower, but not negligible. Given his traits, he could also be in fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology. Let's say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

4. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) can be calculated as follows:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.09 + 0.27 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.36 \]

Now, we can compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{0.36} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.36} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality traits is 0.25.
