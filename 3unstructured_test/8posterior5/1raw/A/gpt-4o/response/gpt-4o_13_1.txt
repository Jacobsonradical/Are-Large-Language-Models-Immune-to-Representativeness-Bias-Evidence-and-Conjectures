To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following probabilities:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability that the personality sketch \( E \) matches someone who is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability that the personality sketch \( E \) matches someone who is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Bayes' rule is stated as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to assume some reasonable values for these probabilities based on the given description:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Let's assume that the prior probability of any given graduate field is equally likely. Given that there are numerous graduate fields, we might assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \) (assuming that there are approximately 10 major graduate fields for simplicity).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's strong interest in nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work, it is very likely that someone with Adam's personality would enroll in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Since other fields might also attract empathetic and intelligent individuals with an interest in puzzles, this probability should be lower than \( P(E|H) \). Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

4. **Marginal Probability \( P(E) \)**: This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.27 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.35 \]

Now applying Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.35} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.2286 \]

So, the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) is approximately 0.2286.
