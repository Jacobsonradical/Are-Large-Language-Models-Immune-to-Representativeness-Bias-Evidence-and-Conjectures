To calculate \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to know or estimate the following probabilities:
- \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \(P(E|H)\): The probability of the evidence given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of the evidence given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

1. **\(P(H)\)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Let's assume that among all fields of graduate study, agricultural and veterinary science is one of many choices. We can assume a base rate; for simplicity, we'll estimate this to be around 1/10 or 0.1.

2. **\(P(E|H)\)**: The probability of the evidence (E) given the hypothesis (H) is true.
   - Adam's personality traits and interests align well with agricultural and veterinary science (e.g., curiosity about nature, love for animals, high empathy). Given this alignment, let's estimate this probability as 0.9.

3. **\(P(E|\neg H)\)**: The probability of the evidence (E) given the hypothesis (\(\neg H\)) is false.
   - These traits could also be consistent with other fields, particularly those related to biology, environmental science, etc. However, since not all fields will match as well, let's conservatively estimate this to be 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Letâ€™s calculate it step-by-step:

\[ P(E) = (0.9 \times 0.1) + (0.3 \times 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.09 + 0.27 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.36 \]

Then:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.1}{0.36} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.36} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.25 \]
