To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science (denoted as H) given the personality sketch of Adam (denoted as E), we'll use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch, which can be calculated as \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   We need to assume a reasonable prior for Adam being in agricultural and veterinary science. Given that he is a graduate student in the U.S. without additional specific information, we might assume all fields are equally likely.
   Let's assume a balanced prior among likely fields:
   \[ P(H) = 0.1 \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   Given the personality sketch:
   - Genuine curiosity about nature and its plants
   - Deep love for animals
   These traits strongly align with agricultural and veterinary science.
   \[ P(E|H) = 0.9 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   For graduate students not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, these traits might still be present but are less likely without such a precise match:
   \[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \]

4. **Overall Probability \( P(E) \)**:
   \[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
   Given \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.9 \):
   \[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) \]
   \[ P(E) = 0.09 + 0.18 \]
   \[ P(E) = 0.27 \]

5. **Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(H|E) \)**:
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{0.27} \]
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.27} \]
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{1}{3} \]
   \[ P(H|E) = 0.333 \]
