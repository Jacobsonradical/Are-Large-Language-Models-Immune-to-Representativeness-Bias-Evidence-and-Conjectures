Sure, I can follow the specified format and provide the requested probabilities. Let's break this down step by step.

1. P(H): This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
2. P(E|H): This is the probability of the evidence (personality sketch) given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. P(E|¬H): This is the probability of the evidence given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
4. P(H|E): This is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given the personality sketch, calculated using Bayes' rule.

### Estimation of Probabilities:

- P(H): Since agricultural and veterinary science is a relatively niche field, let's assume a lower prior probability for this, say 0.05.
- P(E|H): Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and understanding/appreciation for hard work, these traits align well with someone in agricultural and veterinary science. This probability should be high. Let's estimate it at 0.8.
- P(E|¬H): Considering that these traits can still be found in students from other fields, but perhaps not as strongly, let's estimate this at 0.2.

### Applying Bayes' Rule:

Bayes’ Rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

Calculating P(E):
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.19 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.23 \]

Now, calculating P(H|E):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.174 \]
