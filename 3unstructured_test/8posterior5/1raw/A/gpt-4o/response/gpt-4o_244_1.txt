To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given the personality sketch E, we'll use Bayes' rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(H\): Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \(E\): The personality sketch of Adam.

We need to estimate:
- \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \(P(E|H)\): The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \(P(E)\): The total probability of the personality sketch, which can be calculated using the law of total probability.

#### Assumptions for Estimation
- **\(P(H)\)**: The base rate probability of choosing agricultural and veterinary science among all possible fields a graduate student could pursue. Let's assume this is \(0.05\) (a reasonable estimation, assuming there are many possible fields).
- **\(P(E|H)\)**: Given the strong alignment between the personality sketch and the characteristics likely favorable for someone in agricultural and veterinary science (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, etc.), let's assume this probability is \(0.8\).
- **\(P(E|\neg H)\)**: For students not in agricultural and veterinary science, these personality traits may still be present but with a lower frequency. Let's assume this probability is \(0.3\).
- **\(P(E)\)**: Using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
\[ = (0.8 \times 0.05) + (0.3 \times 0.95) \]
\[ = 0.04 + 0.285 \]
\[ = 0.325 \]

#### Applying Bayes' Rule
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.325} \]
\[ = \frac{0.04}{0.325} \]
\[ \approx 0.123 \]

So, the estimated probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, given the personality sketch, is approximately \(0.123\).
