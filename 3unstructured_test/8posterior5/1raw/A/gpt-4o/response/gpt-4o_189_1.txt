To solve this problem using Bayes' Rule, we will denote the following:

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- **P(H|E)**: The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch.

### Priors and Likelihoods:

1. **P(H)**: Let's assume that the probability of Adam being in agricultural and veterinary science is relatively low, as this is a more specialized field (e.g., 0.1).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam’s personality sketch given that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science would be high because his traits align with the field (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, etc.). Let's assign this a high likelihood (e.g., 0.8).

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of Adam’s personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This would be lower because not all other fields would fit as well with his qualities and interests (e.g., 0.3).

### Bayes' Rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H)
\]

Calculating **P(E)**:

\[
P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) = 0.08 + 0.27 = 0.35
\]

Now, we can compute **P(H|E)**:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.35} = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \approx 0.229
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability **P(H|E)**, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, is approximately 0.229.

Here's the answer in the requested format:
