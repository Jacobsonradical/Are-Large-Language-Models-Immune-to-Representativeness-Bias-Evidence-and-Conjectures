To assess the likelihood that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, we use Bayes' Rule. Here's the process step by step:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science without any other information. This value depends on the prevalence of this field among graduate students in the U.S. Let's assume a reasonable prior probability based on general statistics. We'll set it as a hypothetical average for common fields; for instance, let's assume it to be 0.05 (5%).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the evidence given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, high intelligence, and empathy, it strongly aligns with agricultural and veterinary science. Let's estimate this probability to be very high, say 0.8.

3. **P(E|Â¬H)**: The probability of the evidence given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This includes all other possible fields. Adam's interests and characteristics could also fit fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology. Let's estimate the average probability that someone with similar traits would be studying something else to be more common; say, 0.2.

4. **Bayes' Rule**: Computes the probability of H given E.
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   Where,
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
   \]
   \[
   P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95) = 0.04 + 0.19 = 0.23
   \]
   Thus,
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.23} = \frac{0.04}{0.23} \approx 0.174
   \]

Here is the final result:
