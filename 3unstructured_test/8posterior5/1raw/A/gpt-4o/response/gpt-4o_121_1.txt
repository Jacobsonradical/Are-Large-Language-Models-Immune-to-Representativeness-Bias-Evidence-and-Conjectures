Let's denote the relevant probabilities and compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule for the field of agricultural and veterinary science.

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in the U.S. as a graduate student.
   - Since we don't have any specific prior information, we can assume a general prior probability for graduate students to be enrolled in this field. For simplicity, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \). This is a somewhat arbitrary choice but reasonable given the many possible fields a graduate student could be in.

2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align well with the field of agricultural and veterinary science. Hence, we can assign a high probability to this: \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Although Adam's traits could align with various fields, they are particularly well-matched to agricultural and veterinary science. We can assume this probability to be moderate, as his traits are somewhat general but particularly fitting for the field in question. Let's set \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.9 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot (1 - 0.05)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.2 \cdot 0.95} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.19} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.235} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.1915 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science as a graduate student is approximately 0.1915.
