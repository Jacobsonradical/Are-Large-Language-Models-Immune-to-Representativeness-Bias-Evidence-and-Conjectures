Let's break down this problem using Bayes' Theorem, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need \( P(H|E) \), which is the probability Adam was enrolled in "agricultural and veterinary science" given his personality sketch \( E \).

1. **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in "agricultural and veterinary science".

   Given that Adam was a graduate student in the U.S. and we don't have specific data on the distribution of graduate students across different fields, we might reasonably estimate a low prior probability because "agricultural and veterinary science" is a specialized field. For simplicity, let's assign \( P(H) \) a value of 0.05 (5%).

2. **P(E|H)**: This is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in "agricultural and veterinary science".

   Since Adam has a deep love for animals, curiosity about nature, and an appreciation for hard work (which aligns with the agricultural and veterinary science), \( P(E|H) \) should be relatively high. Let's assign \( P(E|H) \) a value of 0.8 (80%).

3. **P(E|¬H)**: This is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in "agricultural and veterinary science".

   While Adam's traits might fit well in "agricultural and veterinary science", they could also fit in other fields like biology, environmental science, or even psychology to some extent. Thus, \( P(E|¬H) \) should be lower than \( P(E|H) \), but not incredibly low. Let's assign \( P(E|¬H) \) a value of 0.2 (20%).

4. **P(E)**: This is the total probability of observing the personality sketch, calculated as:

   \[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]
   
   Substituting the values:
   
   \[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95) = 0.04 + 0.19 = 0.23 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.23} \approx 0.1739 \]

So, we can express the probability \( P(H|E) \) in the required format as follows:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.1739"
}
