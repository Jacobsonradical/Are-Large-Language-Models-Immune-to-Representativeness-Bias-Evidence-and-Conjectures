To compute the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' Rule, we need to start with some subjective judgments about the prior probability \(P(H)\), the likelihood \(P(E|H)\), and the likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\). Here are the assumptions and calculations:

1. **P(H)**: Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Since we do not have specific data, we can use a uniform prior or a reasonable subjective probability. For this example, let's assume:

\[ P(H) = 0.1 \]

2. **P(E|H)**: Likelihood of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and understanding of hard work, it seems quite likely that he fits well into this field. So, let's assume:

\[ P(E|H) = 0.8 \]

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Likelihood of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam was NOT enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Considering Adam's traits could align with other fields (like biology, environmental science, etc.), this probability would be moderately high, though not as high as \(P(E|H)\). Let's assume:

\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.18} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.3077 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.3077.
