Sure, let's apply Bayes' Rule to this scenario. Bayes' Rule is stated as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assume:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the given personality sketch E, given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of the given personality sketch E, given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

To solve this, we need to make reasonable assumptions about these probabilities.

1. **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Without any additional information, we might assign a modest probability assuming a wide range of possible fields (e.g., letâ€™s assume 0.1).

2. **P(E|H):** The probability that Adam has the given personality sketch if he is in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's interests in nature, plants, and animals, this probability would be relatively high (e.g., 0.7).

3. **P(E|\neg H):** The probability that Adam has the given personality sketch if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. While other fields might suit elements of his personality, the close match to agricultural and veterinary science makes this lower (e.g., 0.2).

4. **P(E):** The total probability of the personality sketch E. This can be calculated as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.07 + 0.18 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.25 \]

Now applying Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.25} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.07}{0.25} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.28 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.28.
