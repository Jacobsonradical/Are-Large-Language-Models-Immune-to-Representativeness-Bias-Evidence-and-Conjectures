To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science (H) given his personality sketch (E) using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch would occur given that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch would occur given that he was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Finally, we use Bayes' rule to find \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) can be expanded using the law of total probability, it becomes:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For simplicity, let's assume the following values for the probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The fraction of graduate students enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's estimate this as 0.1 (10%).
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of someone with Adam’s personality sketch being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Considering his traits like genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and understanding of dedication, let's estimate this as 0.8 (80%).
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of someone with Adam’s personality sketch but not being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. While his traits could fit other fields, let's conservatively estimate this as 0.3 (30%).

Now we compute \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.1) + (0.3 \times 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.27 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.35 \]

Then we compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.35} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.229 \]
