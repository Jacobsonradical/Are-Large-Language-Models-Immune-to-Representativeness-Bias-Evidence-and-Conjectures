To solve for the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we first need to establish the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood of the evidence under the negation of the hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Given that \( H \) is the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Let’s assume:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This can be a general estimation subject to available demographic data, but for a rough estimation, let’s assume \( P(H) = 0.03 \) (3% -- since agricultural and veterinary sciences are specialized but not exceedingly common fields).
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam’s personality sketch fits if he is indeed enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam’s traits like a deep love for animals, curiosity about nature, high intelligence, and empathy, this is probably very high. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that Adam’s personality sketch fits if he is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. While some traits may fit other fields as well, the strong love for animals and empathy might be less common. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

Now we can use Bayes’ rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence, calculated as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \times 0.03) + (0.1 \times 0.97) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.021 + 0.097 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.118 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.03}{0.118} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.021}{0.118} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.178 \]

Therefore:
