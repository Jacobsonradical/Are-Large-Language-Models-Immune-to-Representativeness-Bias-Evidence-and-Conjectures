To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, we need to consider the available information: the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the probability of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H) \). We then use Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where \( P(E) \) can be expanded as:
\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

Let's make reasonable assumptions for these probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

1. **P(H)**: Probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume that 10% (0.10) of graduate students choose this field, a reasonable estimate.
2. **P(E|H)**: Probability of Adam's personality sketch E (his curiosity about nature, affection for animals, etc.) given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given the match with the personality traits, let's say this is quite high, around 0.80.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability of Adam's personality sketch E given that he is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. We assume this probability is lower since these traits are particularly indicative of someone in agricultural and veterinary science, maybe around 0.20.

Now, we can compute \( P(E) \):

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.80 \times 0.10 + 0.20 \times 0.90 = 0.08 + 0.18 = 0.26
\]

Now apply Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.80 \times 0.10}{0.26} \approx 0.3077
\]

Thus, the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.3077, or about 30.77%.
