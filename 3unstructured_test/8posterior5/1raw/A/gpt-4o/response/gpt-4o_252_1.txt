To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we'll use Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

To do this, we'll need estimates for:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E) \): The overall probability of Adam's personality sketch. This can be calculated using the law of total probability: \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Let's make reasonable assumptions for these probabilities based on Adam's personality sketch and the field he might be enrolled in:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a random graduate student in the U.S. is in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume this is around 0.05 (5%).

2. \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work, it's highly likely he fits this field. Let's assume this probability is high, around 0.9 (90%).

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): For a graduate student not in agricultural and veterinary science to have Adam's exact personality traits, it's less likely but still possible, given the general nature of some of the traits. Let's assume this probability is about 0.1 (10%).

Now let's compute \( P(E) \):

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

\[
P(E) = (0.9 \times 0.05) + (0.1 \times 0.95)
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.045 + 0.095
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.14
\]

Now we use Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.05}{0.14}
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.14}
\]
\[
P(H|E) \approx 0.321
\]

Thus, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.321 or 32.1%.

So the final answer in the required format is:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.321"
