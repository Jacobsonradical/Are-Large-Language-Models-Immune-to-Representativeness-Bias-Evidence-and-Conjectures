To solve this problem using Bayes' Rule, we'll need to estimate the values of \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). These probabilities are typically difficult to determine exactly without access to relevant data, but I'll estimate them based on reasonable assumptions.

1. **\( P(H) \) (the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science):**
   - Since there are many fields of study, let’s assume that the probability of any one particular field being the correct one is quite low. However, considering the personality sketch, agricultural and veterinary science is more likely than many other fields.
   - We'll estimate \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \) (since there are many fields, but this one fits quite well with his interests and personality).

2. **\( P(E|H) \) (the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science):**
   - Adam’s deep love for animals, understanding of plants, and appreciation for hard work align very well with this field.
   - We'll estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \) (the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science):**
   - While the characteristics could apply to other fields as well, it’s less likely to see this exact combination in many other fields compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
   - We’ll estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \).

Using Bayes' Rule, \( P(H|E) \) can be computed as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the evidence:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's compute \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot (1 - 0.1)) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.18 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.26 \]

Now, using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.3077 \]

So the conditional probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch \( E \) is approximately \( 0.3077 \).
