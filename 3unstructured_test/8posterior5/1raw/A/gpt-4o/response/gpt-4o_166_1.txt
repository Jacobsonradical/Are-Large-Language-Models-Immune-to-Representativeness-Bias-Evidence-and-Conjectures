To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the marginal likelihood \( P(E) \), where the marginal likelihood can be expanded as \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \).

Given the information, we need to make some reasonable assumptions about these probabilities. Let's proceed step-by-step:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
   Since we do not have any specific statistics about Adam's likelihood of enrolling in agricultural and veterinary science without the personality sketch, we'll assume a prior probability. For the sake of this example, let's assume this prior probability to be 0.1 (which means there's a 10% chance that an average graduate student might be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science).

   Let's set:
   \[
   P(H) = 0.1
   \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   Given that Adam has a deep love for animals, genuine curiosity about nature, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication, these traits align well with someone who might be studying agricultural and veterinary science. So, we will assume a high likelihood.
   
   Let's set:
   \[
   P(E|H) = 0.8
   \]

3. **Likelihood under the alternative hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   This reflects the probability of Adam's personality sketch if he is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his traits could also be suitable for other fields (e.g., biology, environmental science, etc.), we will assign a moderate probability.
   
   Let's set:
   \[
   P(E|\neg H) = 0.2
   \]

4. **Marginal Likelihood \( P(E) \):**
   Using the law of total probability:
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)
   \]
   where \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) \).

   Plugging in values:
   \[
   P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.1) + (0.2 \times 0.9) = 0.08 + 0.18 = 0.26
   \]

5. **Posterior Probability \( P(H|E) \):**
   Using Bayes' rule:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]

   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.26} = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \approx 0.3077
   \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.3077.
