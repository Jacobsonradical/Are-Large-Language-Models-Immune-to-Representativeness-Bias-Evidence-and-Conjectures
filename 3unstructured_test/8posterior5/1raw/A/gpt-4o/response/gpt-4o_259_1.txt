Let's break down the steps using Bayes' theorem. The theorem states that:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the context:

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam having the given personality sketch assuming he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam having the given personality sketch assuming he is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- **P(E)**: The overall probability of Adam having the given personality sketch.

Let's make reasonable assumptions for these probabilities based purely on the context.

1. **P(H)**: This depends on how common the field of agricultural and veterinary science is among graduate students, but let's assume it's reasonably uncommon:

\[ P(H) \approx 0.1 \]

2. **P(E|H)**: Considering Adam's described traits such as a love for nature, plants, and animals, this fits well with agricultural and veterinary science:

\[ P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \]

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: If Adam were not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, his personality sketch could suggest other fields that involve nature, animals, or abstract thinking (like biology, ecology, or even other sciences that require puzzle-solving skills), but it might be somewhat less likely:

\[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \]

Given these assumptions, we need \( P(E) \), the total probability of E:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8)(0.1) + (0.2)(0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.18 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.26 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.3077 \]

So, the probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.3077.
