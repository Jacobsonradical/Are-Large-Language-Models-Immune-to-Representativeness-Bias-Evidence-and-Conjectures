To determine \( P(H|E) \) (i.e., the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given the personality sketch \( E \)), we need to evaluate the individual probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

We'll use these to compute \( P(H|E) \) via Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence, calculated as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Since we are dealing with a qualitative analysis, we can assume reasonable values based on the context provided. Let's assume:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Suppose 5% of graduate students generally enroll in agricultural and veterinary science. \( P(H) = 0.05 \)
2. \( P(E|H) \): Given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, the personality sketch \( E \) (with its emphases on a love for nature, animals, and dedication) fits well. Let's assign a high probability, say \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, the probability of \( E \) is lower but not impossible since these traits might still appear in students enrolled in related fields (e.g., biology, environmental sciences). Let's assign a lower probability, say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

Now, we can compute \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.95 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.19 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.23 \]

Finally, using Bayes' Rule to compute \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.174 \]

Thus, based on the given information and assumptions,
