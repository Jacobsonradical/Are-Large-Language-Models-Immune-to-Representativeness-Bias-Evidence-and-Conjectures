To solve for \( P(H|E) \) where \( H \) is the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, using Bayes' rule, we need the following probabilities:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

### Estimates of Probabilities
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This is subjective, but considering the number of academic fields, we could reasonably estimate it to be low (given that there are many other potential fields):
   - Estimate: \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \)

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of having the given personality sketch if Adam were enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work, this seems quite high:
   - Estimate: \( P(E|H) \approx 0.7 \)

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of having the given personality sketch if Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. While his interests and traits could apply to other fields like biology, environmental science, etc., it's likely lower than if he were in agricultural and veterinary science:
   - Estimate: \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \)

### Applying Bayesâ€™ Rule
Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where 
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's calculate \( P(E) \) first:
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \times 0.1) + (0.2 \times 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.07 + 0.18 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.25 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.1}{0.25} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.07}{0.25} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.28 \]

Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.28.
