To estimate the values of \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \), we need to make some informed assumptions about the likelihoods, based on the given personality sketch (E) and the field in question (H). 

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that a random graduate student in the U.S. is studying agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume this is around 0.03 (3%).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality traits (E) given that Adam is indeed enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. The traits, namely curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and empathy, strongly align with this field. Let's estimate this value high, around 0.7 (70%).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the personality traits (E) given that Adam is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. These traits could apply to students in various fields, though less aligned with non-nature-focused ones. Let's estimate this value to be around 0.1 (10%).

Now, let's use Bayes' Rule to find \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

First, compute \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = 0.7 \cdot 0.03 + 0.1 \cdot 0.97 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.021 + 0.097 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.118 \]

Now, compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.03}{0.118} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.021}{0.118} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.178 \]

So, the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.178.
