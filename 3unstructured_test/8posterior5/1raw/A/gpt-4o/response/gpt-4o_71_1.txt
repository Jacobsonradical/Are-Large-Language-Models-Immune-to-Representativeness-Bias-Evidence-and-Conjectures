To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science (H), given the personality sketch (E), we need the following probabilities:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

We will also use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Note: Since \( P(E) \) is the total probability of E, P(E) can be broken down as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

1. **P(H)** (prior probability):
   - Let's assume that the probability of a randomly chosen graduate student being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is 0.05 (5%).

2. **P(E|H)** (likelihood):
   - Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for plants, animals, and high empathy, it is highly likely for a student in agricultural and veterinary science to exhibit these traits. Let’s assume this probability is 0.8 (80%).

3. **P(E|¬H)** (likelihood):
   - Given that Adam's traits can also be found in many other fields such as biology, environmental studies, psychology, etc. Let's assume this probability is 0.2 (20%).

Now let's calculate P(E):

\[ P(E) = (P(E|H) \cdot P(H)) + (P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.19 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.23 \]

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.1739 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.1739.
