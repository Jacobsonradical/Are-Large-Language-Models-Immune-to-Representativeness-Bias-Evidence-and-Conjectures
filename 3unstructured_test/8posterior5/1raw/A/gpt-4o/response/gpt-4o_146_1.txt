To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to know the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \) or in this case we will derive \( P(E|\neg H) \). The relationship is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be expanded using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

However, since we don't have specific numerical values for these probabilities, I'll make logical estimates based on the given personality sketch and the field of "agricultural and veterinary science".

- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \): Probability that Adam has traits E given he was in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability that Adam has traits E given he was not in agricultural and veterinary science.

### Step 1: Estimating Probabilities

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   Since this is a specific field among many possible ones a graduate student might choose, we might estimate a prior probability. Let's assume:

   \[ P(H) = 0.1 \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   Given Adam's traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, understanding and appreciation for hard work), there is a high probability he would fit well in agricultural and veterinary science:

   \[ P(E|H) = 0.8 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   These traits are not exclusive to agricultural and veterinary science, but they would appear less likely in other fields on average. Let's estimate:

   \[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \]

### Step 2: Calculating Posterior Probability

Now, let's use these values in the Bayes' Rule formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Where \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.9 \).

Substitute the values:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9} \]

Calculate the numerator:

\[ 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]

Calculate the denominator:

\[ 0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9 = 0.08 + 0.27 = 0.35 \]

Finally, divide the numerator by the denominator:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \approx 0.2286 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality traits is approximately 0.2286.
