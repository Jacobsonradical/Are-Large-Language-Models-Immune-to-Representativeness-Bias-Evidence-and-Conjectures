To calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). For simplicity, these probabilities will be estimated based on reasonable assumptions given the personality sketch of Adam.

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Considering the vast range of fields available for graduate study and not much specific evidence leaning towards this particular field, we will assume a moderate prior probability. Let's estimate \( P(H) \) to be 0.1.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam’s personality sketch if he was in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation of hard work align well with this field, making it reasonable to assume a high probability. Thus, we estimate \( P(E|H) \) to be 0.8.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam’s personality sketch if he was not in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - While Adam's characteristics could fit many other fields, the combination is less common and specific. Therefore, \( P(E|\neg H) \) should be lower. We estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) to be 0.3.

Now we use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
\]

Substituting values:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.27} = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \approx 0.229
\]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.229.
