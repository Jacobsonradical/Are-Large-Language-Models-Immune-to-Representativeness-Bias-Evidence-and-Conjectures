To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to estimate the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Let's estimate these probabilities:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Assuming a broad range of fields of study, let's estimate \( P(H) \) to be around 0.05 (because agricultural and veterinary science is one of many possible fields).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Given Adam’s deep love for animals, interest in nature and plants, and empathy, he fits well with the profile of someone in agricultural and veterinary science. We might estimate this probability to be relatively high, say 0.7.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Since these traits could also align with other fields (e.g., environmental science, biology, etc.), let's estimate this probability to be moderate, say 0.3.

Now, we use Bayes’ Rule to calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

To find \( P(E) \), we use the law of total probability:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)
\]

\[
P(E) = (0.7 \times 0.05) + (0.3 \times 0.95) = 0.035 + 0.285 = 0.32
\]

Now, applying Bayes' Rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.05}{0.32} = \frac{0.035}{0.32} \approx 0.109
\]

Therefore, the estimated posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.109.
