To estimate the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science (denoted as H), we can use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Let's break down the required probabilities:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that a graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Without specific data, we might estimate this to be a relatively low probability among the vast array of possible graduate fields, say around 0.05.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam would exhibit the described personality traits given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, and his empathy, this seems quite high. We might estimate this as 0.9.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that Adam would exhibit the described personality traits given that he is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. These traits are valuable in many fields but might not be as common in people not involved in nature-related fields. It could be moderately high but lower than P(E|H). Let's say 0.3.

Now, let's compute P(H|E):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.9 \cdot 0.05 + 0.3 \cdot (1 - 0.05)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.285} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.33} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.136 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, given his personality sketch, is approximately 0.136.
