To apply Bayes' Rule, we need to determine the values of P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|\neg H):

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume a prior probability of 0.05, reflecting that this is one potential field among many that a graduate student might choose.

2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing the given personality sketch E if Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Based on his curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and intelligence, this seems quite likely. Let's assign this a high probability, say 0.9.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of observing the given personality sketch E if Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. While these traits could certainly apply to students in other fields (like biology or environmental science), they might be less common in fields unrelated to nature and animals. Let's estimate this probability as 0.2.

Now, let's use Bayes' Rule to compute P(H|E):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's calculate P(E):

\[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.045) + (0.19) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.235 \]

Now, calculate P(H|E):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.235} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.235} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.191 \]

So, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.191.
