To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science (H) given his personality sketch (E), we use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch.

Assumptions:
1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability for being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that the personality traits fit with someone in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that the personality traits fit with someone not in agricultural and veterinary science.

Let's assign reasonable values:
1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Assume this is relatively low but not negligible. Let's say \( P(H) = 0.05 \).
2. \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's deep love for animals, curiosity about nature/plants, and empathy, these traits fit very well for someone in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's say \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of having these traits in fields other than agricultural and veterinary science. Since these traits can be found in other fields as well, this might be moderately likely. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

Now we calculate the overall probability \( P(E) \) using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.05) + (0.1 \times 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.095 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.135 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{(0.8 \times 0.05)}{0.135} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.135} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.296 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.296.
