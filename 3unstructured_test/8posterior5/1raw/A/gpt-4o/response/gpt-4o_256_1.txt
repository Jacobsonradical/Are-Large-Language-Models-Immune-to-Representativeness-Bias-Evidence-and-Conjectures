To apply Bayes' Rule, let's denote:

- \( H \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( E \) as the personality sketch of Adam.

We are interested in computing \( P(H|E) \), the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch. Bayes' Rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To apply this, we need to estimate:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch of Adam if he was indeed enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \): The total probability of observing the personality sketch, encompassing all possible fields of study.

Let's make estimations for these probabilities. Note that these values are illustrative and subject to interpretation based on available context:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   Let’s assume the prior probability that someone in a graduate program in the U.S. is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science could be estimated to be lower than other more common fields such as engineering or social sciences. We might guess around 0.05 (5%).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   Given the personality sketch, Adam's interests in nature, plants, animals, and his empathy align very well with agricultural and veterinary sciences. This might be estimated at around 0.8 (80%).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   For fields outside agricultural and veterinary sciences, Adam’s personality traits could still fit but may not be as perfectly aligned. Therefore, we might estimate this likelihood to be around 0.2 (20%).

Given these values:

1. \( P(H) = 0.05 \)
2. \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \)
3. \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \)

First, let's compute \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.95 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.19 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.23 \]

Now, using Bayes’ Rule, we can compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.1739 \]

Thus, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.174.
