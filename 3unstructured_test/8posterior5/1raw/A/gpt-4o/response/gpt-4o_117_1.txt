To answer the question, we will evaluate the probabilities \(P(H)\), \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E|\neg H)\), and then use Bayes' rule to compute \(P(H|E)\).

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**: This is the initial probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Since we do not have specific data on the distribution of graduate students across various fields, we can assume a uniform distribution as a baseline for simplicity. Letâ€™s assume there are about 10-20 potential fields, giving us \( P(H) \approx \frac{1}{15} \approx 0.067 \).

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: This is the probability of observing the evidence \(E\) given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Since Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, loves animals, and appreciates hard work and dedication, these characteristics strongly align with interests and qualities likely found in this field. Thus, \( P(E|H) \approx 0.7 \).

3. **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)**: This is the probability of observing the evidence \(E\) given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. While these traits can be found in other fields, they are particularly strong indicators for agricultural and veterinary science, so \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2\).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

First, calculate \(P(E)\):
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.067) + (0.2 \cdot (1 - 0.067)) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.0469 + 0.1866 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.2335 \]

Now, apply Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.067}{0.2335} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.0469}{0.2335} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.2009 \]

So the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.2009.
