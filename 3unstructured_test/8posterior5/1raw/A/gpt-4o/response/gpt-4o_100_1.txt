To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given the personality sketch \( E \), we need to use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of Adam having the personality sketch \( E \) given that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of Adam having the personality sketch \( E \) given that he was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of Adam having the personality sketch \( E \).

First, let’s establish some values for these probabilities:

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \):**
   - Given no specific information about the likelihood of Adam choosing this field over others, let's assume a hypothetical prior probability.
   - A reasonable assumption might be that the prior probability of any single field being chosen by a graduate student is relatively low. For simplicity, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \) (10%).

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \):**
   - Adam's interests and traits (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, knowledge of hard work) strongly align with studying agricultural and veterinary science.
   - We can estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \) (90%).

3. **Complementary likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   - Adam's traits may align with other fields (like biology or environmental science) but not as strongly as with agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \) (30%).

4. **Total Probability, \( P(E) \):**
   - This can be determined using the law of total probability:
     \[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
     \[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) = 0.09 + 0.27 = 0.36 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{0.36} = \frac{0.09}{0.36} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is 0.25 (25%).

Here's the answer in the required format:
