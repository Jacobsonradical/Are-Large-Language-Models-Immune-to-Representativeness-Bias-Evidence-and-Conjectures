To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \) - the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field of agricultural and veterinary science.
2. \( P(E|H) \) - the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in a field other than agricultural and veterinary science.

Bayes' Rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{ P(E|H) \cdot P(H) }{ P(E) } \]
where \( P(E) \) can be found using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's assign plausible values for these probabilities based on the given information:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   Since agricultural and veterinary science is a specialized field, we might assign a low prior probability to it, assuming it's not the most common field of study for graduate students.

   \[
   P(H) = 0.05
   \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and understanding of hard work align strongly with the field of agricultural and veterinary science. Thus, we can assign a high probability to \( P(E|H) \).

   \[
   P(E|H) = 0.85
   \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   The characteristics described might also be found in students of other related fields, though perhaps not as strongly. Thus, we assign a moderate probability to \( P(E|\neg H) \).

   \[
   P(E|\neg H) = 0.2
   \]

Now, we compute \( P(E) \):

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

\[
P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.95
\]

\[
P(E) = 0.85 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.95
\]

\[
P(E) = 0.0425 + 0.19 = 0.2325
\]

Finally, we use Bayes' Rule to compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{ P(E|H) \cdot P(H) }{ P(E) }
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{ 0.85 \cdot 0.05 }{ 0.2325 }
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{ 0.0425 }{ 0.2325 }
\]

\[
P(H|E) \approx 0.183
\]

So the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.183.
