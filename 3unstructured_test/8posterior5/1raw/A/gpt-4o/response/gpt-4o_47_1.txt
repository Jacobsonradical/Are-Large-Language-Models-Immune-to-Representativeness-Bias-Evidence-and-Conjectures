Certainly, let’s evaluate the probabilities for Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

1. **P(H) - Prior Probability**: This is the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science without any additional information. This depends on the distribution of graduate students across different fields. Since we have no specific data, we could assume a uniform distribution across all possible fields, though in reality, it might be slightly higher for agricultural studies because of his interests, let’s say: 
   \[
   P(H) \approx 0.1
   \]

2. **P(E|H) - Likelihood**: This is the probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his curiosity about nature, plants, strong empathy, and love for animals, it aligns very well with this field. So, 
   \[
   P(E|H) \approx 0.9
   \]

3. **P(E|\neg H) - Likelihood for Not H**: This is the probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given that he was *not* enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. The curiosity, empathy, intelligence, and love for animals could somewhat fit other fields but likely to a lesser extent. Therefore, 
   \[
   P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3
   \]

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
where,
\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]
Then,
\[
P(E) \approx (0.9 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) = 0.09 + 0.27 = 0.36
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{0.36} = \frac{0.09}{0.36} = 0.25
\]
