To solve this, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Specifically, we want to compute \( P(H|E) \), the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch. 

Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here: 
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in a field other than agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \), which can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Now, let's assign hypothetical probabilities based on our understanding:

1. **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume that about 5% (0.05) of graduate students are enrolled in this field:
   \[
   P(H) = 0.05
   \]

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he was in agricultural and veterinary science. Given that Adam has a strong interest in nature, empathy for animals, and an appreciation for hard work—traits that align well with this field—we can estimate this probability to be high, say 0.9:
   \[
   P(E|H) = 0.9
   \]

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he was in another field. While some traits like empathy and intelligence can be quite general, the specific interest in nature and animals might be less likely in other fields. Let's assume this to be moderately lower, say 0.2:
   \[
   P(E|\neg H) = 0.2
   \]

4. **\( P(E) \)**: Using the law of total probability:
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   P(E) = 0.9 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.95
   \]
   \[
   P(E) = 0.045 + 0.19 = 0.235
   \]

Finally, we compute \( P(H|E) \):
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.235}
\]
\[
P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.045}{0.235} \approx 0.191
\]

So the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.191.
