To solve this question using Bayes' rule, we'll follow these steps:

1. P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
2. P(E|H): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. P(E|¬H): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
4. P(H|E): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch.

For these probabilities, we'll use estimations based on the given personality sketch and characteristics:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability is how likely in general a graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let’s assume this probability to be relatively low, reflecting the actual proportions of graduate students in this field. Let's estimate it to be **0.05**.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam’s personality sketch given that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science should be relatively high because his interests and personality traits align well with what might be expected from students in that field. Let's estimate it to be **0.8**.

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of Adam’s personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. While his interests and traits could fit other fields (like biology, environmental science, or psychology), they are more specifically aligned with agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, this probability could be moderately high but less than P(E|H). Let’s estimate it to be **0.3**.

Now, using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H)} \]

where: 
- P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.95.

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.3 \cdot 0.95} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.285} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.325} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.123 \]

So, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch E is approximately 0.123.
