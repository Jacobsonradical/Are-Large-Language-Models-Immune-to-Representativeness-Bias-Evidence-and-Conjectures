To evaluate the probability that Adam was enrolled in the field of agricultural and veterinary science (H) given the personality sketch E, we can use Bayes' Rule. First, we should estimate the probabilities P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|\neg H).

- **Prior Probability P(H)**: This is the prior probability of being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Out of all graduate fields, let's assume there is a moderate representation for agricultural and veterinary science. Let P(H) = 0.1.

- **Likelihood P(E|H)**: Given H, the likelihood that Adam’s personality profile matches the typical traits expected for someone in agricultural and veterinary science (e.g., love for animals, curiosity about nature, understanding and appreciation for hard work, high intelligence) is quite high. Let P(E|H) = 0.8.

- **Likelihood P(E|\neg H)**: This is the probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. These characteristics can also be found in students of other fields, although possibly less commonly. Let’s estimate this as moderate. Let P(E|\neg H) = 0.3.

Now, we can use Bayes' Rule to compute P(H|E):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where,

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.27 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.35 \]

Therefore,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.35} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.229 \]

Thus,
