To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch \( E \), we will use Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Let's denote:
- \( H \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( E \) as the given personality sketch of Adam.

First, we need to estimate the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \):

1. **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. While this specific probability might vary by institution, let's assume that graduate fields are relatively evenly distributed. Given the wide range of possible graduate fields, a reasonable assumption for \( P(H) \) could be:

   \[
   P(H) \approx 0.05
   \]

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is indeed studying agricultural and veterinary science. Since Adam's sketch highly aligns with the qualities needed for this field (interest in nature, love for animals, empathy, and understanding hard work):

   \[
   P(E|H) \approx 0.8
   \]

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not studying agricultural and veterinary science. While these characteristics are beneficial in other fields, they are less consistently required. Thus, this probability is reasonably lower:

   \[
   P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.1
   \]

4. **\( P(E) \)**: The total probability of observing Adam's personality sketch. By the law of total probability:

   \[
   P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
   \]

   Using our estimates:
   
   \[
   P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.1 \cdot 0.95) = 0.04 + 0.095 = 0.135
   \]

Now, we apply Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{(0.8 \cdot 0.05)}{0.135} = \frac{0.04}{0.135} \approx 0.296
\]

Therefore, based on our estimates, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.296.
