To calculate the probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to assess the following:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Bayes' Rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For simplicity, we don't have exact values, but we can make reasonable assumptions based on the information provided.

1. \( P(H) \): Without any specific data, let's assume a uniform prior probability across various fields, so let's set \( P(H) \) to a moderate number, such as 0.1.

2. \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, and understanding of hard work, it's likely high that his personality aligns with this field. Let's assume \( P(E|H) \) to be around 0.9.

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): For other fields, such as engineering, humanities, etc., Adam's personality may somewhat align but not as closely. We'll assume \( P(E|\neg H) \) to be around 0.2.

For simplicity, using the numbers:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.9 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.09 + 0.18 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.27 \]

Now compute \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{0.27} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.27} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{1}{3} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.33 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.33.
