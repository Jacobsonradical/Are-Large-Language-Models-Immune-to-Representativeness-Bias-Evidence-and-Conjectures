To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to follow these steps:

1. Assign prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and \( P(\neg H) \).
2. Assign conditional probabilities \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \).
3. Use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \).

Let's denote:
- \( H \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( E \) as the personality sketch of Adam.

### Step 1: Assigning Prior Probabilities

Without specific information, we might assume that Adam, being a graduate student, could be enrolled in any field. If we consider a uniform distribution across a wide range of possible fields of study, we could assign a reasonable prior probability for \( P(H) \). However, given that agricultural and veterinary science is a relatively specific field not as common as some others (like business, engineering, etc.), we can assign a prior probability that reflects this.

Let's assume:
- \( P(H) \) = 0.05 (reflecting the specificity and less common nature of this field)
- \( P(\neg H) \) = 1 - \( P(H) \) = 0.95

### Step 2: Assigning Conditional Probabilities

Given the personality sketch \( E \), we need to consider how likely it is under \( H \) and \( \neg H \):

- \( P(E|H) \): Assuming someone in agricultural and veterinary science might naturally have a curiosity about nature and a love for animals, strong empathy, and high intelligence, we can assign a relatively higher probability for \( E \) given \( H \).
  
  Let's consider \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The personality traits described could still fit a person in various other fields (like biology, environmental science, etc.), but perhaps with a slightly lower probability given the strong match with agricultural and veterinary science.

  Let's consider \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

### Step 3: Computing the Posterior Probability

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

First, we compute \( P(E) \) using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.4 \cdot 0.95) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.38 = 0.42 \]

Now, apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.42} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.42} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.095 \] 

Thus, our computed probability is:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.095"
}

This means there is approximately a 9.5% chance that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch.
