To apply Bayes' rule, we need to understand and estimate the probabilities involved:

1. \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
2. \(P(E|H)\): The probability that Adam's personality sketch \(E\) would be true if he were enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability that Adam's personality sketch \(E\) would be true if he were not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
4. \(P(H|E)\): The posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch \(E\), which is what we are solving for using Bayes' rule.

### Estimations:

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**:
   - Let's assume that the probability any given graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is relatively low since it is a specialized field. Let's estimate it at 0.05, or 5%.

   \[
   P(H) = 0.05
   \]

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**:
   - The personality sketch of Adam shows a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, which aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science. Given this, let's assume a high likelihood, say 0.8, or 80%.

   \[
   P(E|H) = 0.8
   \]

3. **Probability of the Evidence \(P(E|\neg H)\)**:
   - Adam's traits could also fit other related fields like biology, environmental science, etc. Let's assume the probability that someone with Adam's interests is not in agricultural and veterinary science but has a similar personality sketch is about 0.1, or 10%.

   \[
   P(E|\neg H) = 0.1
   \]

### Applying Bayes' Rule:

Bayes' rule states:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where \(P(E)\) can be computed using the law of total probability:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

First, calculate \(P(E)\):

\[
P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.1 \cdot 0.95) = 0.04 + 0.095 = 0.135
\]

Now, compute \(P(H|E)\):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.135} = \frac{0.04}{0.135} \approx 0.296
\]

So, the posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 29.6%.
