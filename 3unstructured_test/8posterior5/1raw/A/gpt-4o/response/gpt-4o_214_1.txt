First, let's define the key probabilities:

- P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
  - Given no additional specific context, let's assume a baseline prior probability. This can be relatively low due to the wide range of possible graduate fields. Let's assume P(H) = 0.05.

- P(E|H): The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
  - Adam has a love for nature, animals, and a strong appreciation for hard workâ€”traits highly relevant to agricultural and veterinary science. Let's set this high, P(E|H) = 0.8.

- P(E|\neg H): The probability of observing personality sketch E given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
  - Adam's traits could also fit into other fields (e.g., biology, environmental science, etc.), so this probability should be lower. Let's assume P(E|\neg H) = 0.2.

We use Bayes' rule to compute P(H|E):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Substitute the values:

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.05) + (0.2 \times 0.95) = 0.04 + 0.19 = 0.23 \]

Now, compute P(H|E):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.23} = \frac{0.04}{0.23} \approx 0.174 \]

Thus:

  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.174"
