First, we need to estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) where \( H \) is the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in the field of agricultural and veterinary science.

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
   Given Adam’s love for nature, plants, and animals, it is reasonable to assign a higher prior probability for him being in this field. Let's estimate \( P(H) \) to be 0.3 (as many students could be in other fields).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   If Adam is indeed studying agricultural and veterinary science, it is highly likely that he would have enthusiasm for nature and animals. Therefore, we can estimate \( P(E|H) \) to be 0.9.

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   If Adam is not studying agricultural and veterinary science, there's still a chance he might have these personality traits, but given the specificity of these interests to the field, we will assign a lower probability. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) to be 0.2.

Now using Bayes’ rule to find \( P(H|E) \):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} 
\]
where 
\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[
P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.3) + (0.2 \cdot 0.7) 
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.27 + 0.14 = 0.41
\]

Thus,

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.3}{0.41} = \frac{0.27}{0.41} \approx 0.6585
\]

So the probability that Adam was enrolled in the field of agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.6585.
