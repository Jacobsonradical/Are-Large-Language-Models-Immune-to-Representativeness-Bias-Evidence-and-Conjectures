To calculate the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate several quantities:

1. \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
2. \(P(E|H)\): The probability of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
4. \(P(E)\): The total probability of observing the personality sketch \(E\).

Let's make some assumptions based on the information provided and reasonable estimations:

1. \(P(H)\): Suppose the prior probability that any given graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science is low. Let's assume it's 5%, or 0.05.
2. \(P(E|H)\): Adam's personality sketch aligns well with interests and traits common in agricultural and veterinary science (nature, plants, animals). Let's assume this is relatively high, around 0.6.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): There are other fields where such a personality can be prevalent. However, given the specificity, it might be less common. Let's set this at 0.2.

Now we use Bayes' rule to calculate \(P(H|E)\):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

To find \(P(E)\), we can use the law of total probability:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

Substituting our values:

\[
P(E) = (0.6 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95)
\]

\[
P(E) = 0.03 + 0.19 = 0.22
\]

Now we substitute back into Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.05}{0.22} = \frac{0.03}{0.22} \approx 0.136
\]

So, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.136.
