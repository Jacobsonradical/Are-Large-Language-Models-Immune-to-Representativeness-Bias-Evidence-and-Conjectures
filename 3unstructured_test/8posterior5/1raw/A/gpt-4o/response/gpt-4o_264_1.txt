Based on the given personality sketch of Adam and the Bayes rule, let's evaluate the probabilities.

**Step 1:** Assess `P(H)`, `P(E|H)`, and `P(E|¬H)`

- `P(H)`: The probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science without any other information. Given that there are numerous fields a graduate student could be enrolled in, let's assume `P(H)` to be relatively low, say `0.1` (10%).

- `P(E|H)`: The likelihood that Adam has the described personality sketch given he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Considering Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, this fits well, so `P(E|H)` might be high, let's say `0.8`.

- `P(E|¬H)`: The likelihood of Adam having this personality sketch if he is NOT enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. While possible, it might be less likely compared to if he were in the field, so let's tentatively assign it `0.2`.

**Step 2:** Apply Bayes' Rule to find `P(H|E)`

Bayes' Rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

Computing `P(E)`:
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.18 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.26 \]

Thus, `P(H|E)`:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.3077 \]

So, our calculated posterior probability is approximately 0.31 (rounded to 2 decimal places).
