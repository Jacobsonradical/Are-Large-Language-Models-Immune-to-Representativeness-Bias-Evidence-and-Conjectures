To estimate the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science based on his personality sketch, we need to use Bayes' rule. Here is the process:

1. **Estimate P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science without any additional information. For this example, let's assume a uniform prior distribution across different fields of study. If there are, say, 10 possible fields of study, then P(H) is 1/10 or 0.1.

2. **Estimate P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Considering Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy, which align well with this field, let's estimate this to be quite high, say 0.8.

3. **Estimate P(E|¬H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his interests align less obviously with other fields, let's estimate it to be lower, say 0.2.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where P(E) is the total probability of the evidence E:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.18 = 0.26 \]

Now, applying Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.26} = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \approx 0.3077 \]

Therefore,
