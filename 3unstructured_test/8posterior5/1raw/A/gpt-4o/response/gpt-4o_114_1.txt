To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) given the fields, we need to use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the field of agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the personality traits \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in this field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of the personality traits \( E \) if Adam is not enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E) \) can be calculated as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:

1. **Determine \( P(H) \)**:
   - A reasonable prior \( P(H) \) considering all graduate fields might be relatively low because there are many possible fields. Assume \( P(H) \) is around 0.05.

2. **Determine \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, and his empathy align well with characteristics seen in students in this field. Thus, \( P(E|H) \) might be quite high, say 0.8.

3. **Determine \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - Given the large number of possible fields, there could be certain fields that share similar traits to a lesser extent. Assume \( P(E|\neg H) \) is lower, maybe around 0.2.

Then the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) is calculated as follows:

\[ P(E) = (P(E|H) \cdot P(H)) + (P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.19 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.23 \]

Now, using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.174 \]

Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch \( E \) is approximately 0.174.
