To begin, let's define the terms more clearly:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood that the personality sketch (E) would be observed given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood that the personality sketch (E) would be observed given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
4. **P(H|E)**: The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given the personality sketch (E). This is what we aim to find using Bayes' rule.

**Using Bayes' Rule:**

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that exact data on prior probabilities (on Adam's choice of major, for example) is lacking and we must rely on some logical estimates:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given that this is a narrow field out of many possible fields, let’s assume the prior is relatively low but not negligible, so we estimate it at 0.05.

2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, this is high. We'll estimate this at 0.9.

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was not in agricultural and veterinary science. While it's possible to have this personality sketch in other fields like biology or environmental science, they might not fit perfectly. We estimate this at 0.1.

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \), we calculate:

\[ P(E) = (0.9 \times 0.05) + (0.1 \times 0.95) = 0.045 + 0.095 = 0.14 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 \times 0.05}{0.14} = \frac{0.045}{0.14} \approx 0.321 \]

So our estimated posterior probability is about 0.321.

Thus, our answer is:

  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.321
