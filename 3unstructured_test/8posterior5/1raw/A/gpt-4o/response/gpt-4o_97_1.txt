Sure, let's walk through the calculations using Bayesian inference. To do so, we'll need to:

1. Define our prior: \(P(H)\) - Probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science without any additional information.
2. Determine the likelihoods: \(P(E|H)\) and \(P(E|\neg H)\).
3. Use Bayes' Rule to compute \(P(H|E)\) - The probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch.

Let's assign some reasonable probabilities based on the information given:

1. **Prior \(P(H)\)**: Since agricultural and veterinary science is a relatively common field given Adam’s interests in nature, plants, and animals, let’s assume \(P(H) = 0.2\) (20%).

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: Given that Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, strong empathy, and a love for animals, it's very likely that someone in agricultural and veterinary science would fit this description. Let's assume \(P(E|H) = 0.9\) (90%).

3. **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)**: We need to consider how likely it is that Adam would have these traits if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Someone in a different field (e.g., engineering or business) might still have these traits, but it would be less likely since those traits are quite specific to agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.2\) (20%).

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

where \(P(E)\) can be found using the law of total probability:

\[P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)\]

First, calculate \(P(E)\):

\[P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.2) + (0.2 \cdot 0.8) = 0.18 + 0.16 = 0.34\]

Then, apply Bayes' Rule:

\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.2}{0.34} \approx \frac{0.18}{0.34} \approx 0.529\]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.529 (or 52.9%).
