To use Bayes' Theorem and deduce the value of \(P(H|E)\), which is the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given the personality sketch (E), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Estimate \(P(H)\)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science without considering the personality sketch.

2. **Estimate \(P(E|H)\)**: The probability of Adam having the given personality traits (E) if he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

3. **Estimate \(P(E|\neg H)\)**: The probability of Adam having the given personality traits (E) if he was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

4. **Bayes' Theorem**: Use these probabilities in Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' Theorem formula is:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

### Estimations:
1. **\(P(H)\)**: Suppose the probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is relatively low. For instance, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).

2. **\(P(E|H)\)**: Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, and his strong empathy, it's high that his personality fits someone in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

3. **\(P(E|\neg H)\)**: The given traits could be found in students in other fields, but they may be less common. Let's estimate it reasonably lower, say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

4. **\(P(\neg H)\)**: The probability that Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95 \]

### Calculation:
Now we need to compute \(P(E)\):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.19 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.23 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.04}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.174 \]

Thus, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.174.
