Sure, let's assess the probabilities step by step:

1. **P(H)** - The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given that there are many possible fields he could be enrolled in, let's assume for now it is 1 out of a large number (e.g., 20 fields), so P(H) = 1/20 = 0.05.

2. **P(E|H)** - The probability of E given H (i.e., if Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, how likely is the personality sketch). Given that his interest in nature, plants, strong empathy for animals, and understanding of hard work align well with agricultural and veterinary science, this probability is quite high, let's say 0.9.

3. **P(E|\neg H)** - The probability of E given not H (i.e., if Adam is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, how likely is the personality sketch). Since elements of his personality sketch could fit well with other fields like environmental science, biology, etc., but not as well, let's assign this a moderate value of 0.3.

We can use Bayes' rule to compute P(H|E):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

Calculating P(E):

\[
P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.05) + (0.3 \cdot 0.95) = 0.045 + 0.285 = 0.33
\]

Now, applying Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.33} \approx 0.136
\]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch E is approximately 0.136.
