To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the personality sketch \( E \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Letâ€™s assume reasonable values for these probabilities based on the information provided:

### Assumptions:

1. **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that a random graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. It is somewhat unlikely, considering the broad range of possible fields of study.
   - Let's assume: \( P(H) = 0.05 \).

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: The probability that Adam's personality sketch matches if he is in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his traits (interest in nature, love for animals, etc.), this is quite high.
   - Let's assume: \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability that Adam's personality sketch matches if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. The traits can also be common in other fields such as biology, environmental science, etc.
   - Let's assume: \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

4. **\( P(E) \)**: The total probability of the personality sketch \( E \), which can be calculated using the law of total probability:
   - \[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
   - \[ P(E) = (0.7 \times 0.05) + (0.1 \times 0.95) \]
   - \[ P(E) = 0.035 + 0.095 \]
   - \[ P(E) = 0.13 \]

### Calculation:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.05}{0.13} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.035}{0.13} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.2692 \]

Given our assumptions, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.2692 or 26.92%.
