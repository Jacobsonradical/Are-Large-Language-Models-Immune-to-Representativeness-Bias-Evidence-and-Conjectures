To solve this problem using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the following probabilities:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(H|E) \): The probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, which we will compute using Bayes' rule.

### Estimations:
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Let's assume there isn't a strong reason to lean towards any particular field of study without additional information. If we consider the assumption that Adam could equally likely be in any of a large number of fields, \( P(H) \) might be roughly in the small range.
   - For simplicity, let's estimate \( P(H) = 0.05 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Adam's personality sketch includes a deep love for animals, a strong empathy, and an appreciation for hard work, which align well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. Hence, this probability should be relatively high.
   - Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.75 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - For students not in agricultural and veterinary science, it’s less likely but still possible to have similar traits such as empathy and curiosity about nature (traits that are not exclusive to agricultural and veterinary science). However, considering these traits match better with agricultural and veterinary science than with most other fields, this probability should be lower.
   - Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.20 \).

### Computing \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule:

Bayes' Rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Substituting the estimated values:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.75 \cdot 0.05}{0.75 \cdot 0.05 + 0.20 \cdot (1 - 0.05)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.0375}{0.0375 + 0.20 \cdot 0.95} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.0375}{0.0375 + 0.19} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.0375}{0.2275} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.165 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.165.
