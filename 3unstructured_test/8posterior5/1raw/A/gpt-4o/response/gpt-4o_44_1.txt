To calculate the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science (H) given his personality sketch (E), we will use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch, which can be derived from \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

### Assigning Probabilities

1. **\( P(H) \)**:
   - The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume that among all possible fields, this has a moderate likelihood. For simplicity, we'll assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**:
   - The likelihood of observing Adam's personality given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his deep love for nature, animals, and empathy, this seems highly consistent. We might set \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - The likelihood of observing Adam's personality given that he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. His traits could fit other fields, but perhaps not as strongly. Let's set \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

4. **\( P(E) \)**:
   - The total probability of observing Adam's personality. Given our assumptions:
   \[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
   \[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) \]
   \[ P(E) = 0.16 + 0.24 = 0.4 \]

### Calculating \( P(H|E) \)

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{0.4} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.16}{0.4} = 0.4 \]

Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is 0.4.
