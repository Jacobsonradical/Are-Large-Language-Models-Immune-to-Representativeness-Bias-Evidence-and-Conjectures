Let's break this down step-by-step. To utilize Bayes' theorem, we need to evaluate the following probabilities:

1. P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   
2. P(E|H): The probability that Adam's personality sketch corresponds with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science.
   
3. P(E|¬H): The probability that Adam's personality sketch corresponds with someone not studying agricultural and veterinary science.

4. P(H|E): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch.

Given Adam's deep connection with nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, agricultural and veterinary science seems like a good fit. However, without specific background statistics, I'll provide a general estimation.

### Estimations

1. **P(H) - The prior probability**
   Since there are many fields of study, let's assume the prior probability for any specific field (like agricultural and veterinary science) is low. We might estimate it around 0.05 (or 5%).

2. **P(E|H) - The probability of the evidence given the hypothesis**
   Given the personality sketch, it aligns quite well with the agricultural and veterinary science field. We might estimate this around 0.7 (or 70%).

3. **P(E|¬H) - The probability of the evidence given the hypothesis is false**
   Adam's personality traits might fit other fields as well, especially those related to science, nature, or empathetic disciplines. Thus, the probability is lower but still significant. We might estimate this around 0.2 (or 20%).

### Applying Bayes' Theorem

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

Let's calculate P(E) first:

\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.035 + 0.19 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.225 \]

Now, calculate P(H|E):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{0.225} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.035}{0.225} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.156 \]

### Conclusion

So, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.156 (or 15.6%).
