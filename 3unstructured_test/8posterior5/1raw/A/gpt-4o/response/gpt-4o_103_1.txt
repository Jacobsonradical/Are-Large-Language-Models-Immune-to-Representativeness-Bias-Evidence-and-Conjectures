Below is the calculation for P(H|E) using the given information and Bayes rule:

1. **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Since we don't have specific data, we'll assume a uniform prior over possible fields of study. However, this can vary based on your assumptions. Let's assume a prior of 0.1 as a plausible estimate that Adam might be in this field among a range of possible fields.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the evidence given that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his characteristics—genuine curiosity about nature, a love for animals, and appreciation for hard work—these match well with this field. Let's estimate this probability to be 0.8 because the traits align well.

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of the evidence given that Adam is **not** in agricultural and veterinary science. This needs to consider the probability of the same traits appearing in other fields of study. Since his traits could also fit reasonably well in several other fields, like biology, environmental science, etc., we can estimate this to be 0.3.

4. **Using Bayes Rule:**

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is calculated as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) = 0.08 + 0.27 = 0.35 \]

Now, applying Bayes Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.35} = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \approx 0.229 \]

So, the value is approximately 0.229.
