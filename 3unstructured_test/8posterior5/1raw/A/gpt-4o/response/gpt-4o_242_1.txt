To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate the following probabilities:
1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam having the given personality sketch if he were enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam having the given personality sketch if he were not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Then we can use Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))} \]

Let's estimate these probabilities based on the given personality sketch and the general population:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Considering the diversity of fields available for graduate studies in the U.S., the prior probability that any randomly selected graduate student is studying agricultural and veterinary science might be moderate. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - If Adam is studying agricultural and veterinary science, it is very likely he has an appreciation for nature, animals, and possibly possesses empathy and hard work traits. This fits well with our sketch.
   - We can estimate \( P(E|H) \) to be relatively high, say 0.8.

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - If Adam is not studying agricultural and veterinary science, there could still be other fields where curiosity about nature, empathy, intelligence, and love for animals are common traits (e.g., biology, environmental science, psychology).
   - We can estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) to be moderate, say 0.4.

Now, plug these values into Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.4 \cdot 0.9} \]

Calculate:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.36} = \frac{0.08}{0.44} \approx 0.182 \]
