First, let's assess the probabilities:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Since we don't have prior information, we can reasonably assume the prior probability is the same for any field. Suppose there are N fields, P(H) could be roughly 1/N. For simplicity, let's assume there are 10 possible fields, so P(H) ≈ 0.1.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing E given Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Based on the personality sketch, agricultural and veterinary science aligns well with Adam's characteristics (curiosity about nature, love for animals, appreciation for hard work). Let's estimate this probability to be high, say 0.8.

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing E given Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. While some of Adam's characteristics might apply to other fields, the match is likely less strong. Let's estimate this probability to be relatively low, say 0.3.

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be computed using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Given that \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) \), we have:

\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot (1 - 0.1) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.27 = 0.35 \]

Now compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.35} = \frac{0.08}{0.35} = \frac{8}{35} \approx 0.229 \]

So the probability \( P(H|E) \) is approximately 0.229.
