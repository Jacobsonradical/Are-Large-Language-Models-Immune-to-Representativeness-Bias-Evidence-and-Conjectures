To calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' theorem, we go through the following steps:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

First, let's define the components:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.

Next, let's make educated estimates for these probabilities considering Adam's personality traits and interests.

1. \( P(H) \): This depends on the general likelihood of someone being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science among all possible fields of graduate study. Let's assume that it's not very common but also not very rare. We can estimate a prior probability of 0.1 for Adam being in this field.

2. \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's deep love for animals, curiosity about nature, and strong empathy, if he were enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, this would fit very well. Let's give this a high probability of 0.9.

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): This is the probability of observing Adam's traits assuming he is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. While his traits could be consistent with other fields such as biology or environmental science, they are less specific. Let's estimate this probability at 0.3.

4. \( P(E) \): This is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality traits, which combines all possible fields. Since \( P(E) \) can be computed from:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.9 \times 0.1 + 0.3 \times 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.09 + 0.27 = 0.36 \]

Now, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.1}{0.36} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.36} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.25 \]

So the probability that Adam was studying agricultural and veterinary science given his personality traits is 0.25.

Here is the answer in the specified format:
