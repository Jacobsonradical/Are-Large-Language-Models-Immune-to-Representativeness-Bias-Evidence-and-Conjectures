To compute \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the prior probability \(P(H)\), the likelihood \(P(E|H)\), and the marginal likelihood \(P(E)\), which can be expressed in terms of \(P(E|H)\) and \(P(E|\neg H)\).

Let's denote:
- \(H\) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \(E\) as the personality sketch of Adam.

### Estimating Probabilities

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**:
   - If we assume that the probability of a graduate student enrolling in agricultural and veterinary science is relatively low compared to other fields, let's assign \(P(H) = 0.05\).

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**:
   - Given the personality sketch of Adam (curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals), it aligns well with fields like agricultural and veterinary science. Hence, let's assign \(P(E|H) = 0.8\).

3. **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)**:
   - For \(P(E|\neg H)\), we need to consider how likely it is for someone with his personality traits to be not in agricultural and veterinary science. Since these traits are moderately common in other fields, \(P(E|\neg H)\) should be lower than \(P(E|H)\). Let's assign \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.2\).

### Applying Bayes' Rule

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \(P(E)\) is the total probability of the evidence, given by:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

First, compute \(P(E)\):
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.19 = 0.23 \]

Now, compute \(P(H|E)\):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.174 \]

### Conclusion
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.174"
