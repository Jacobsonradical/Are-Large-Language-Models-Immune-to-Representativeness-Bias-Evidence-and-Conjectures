To apply Bayes' rule, we need to calculate \( P(H|E) \), which is the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch (denoted as \( E \)).

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

While we do not have exact values, we can make reasonable assumptions based on the given information.

1. \( P(H) \) (Prior Probability): This is the prior probability that a randomly chosen graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's arbitrarily assume that the proportion of graduate students in this field is approximately 0.05 (5%).

2. \( P(E|H) \) (Likelihood): Given the personality sketch which aligns well with characteristics suitable for agricultural and veterinary science (interest in nature, plants, animals, empathy), a high likelihood is reasonable. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) (Likelihood given not in the field): The characteristics in the personality sketch could be present in students from other fields as well, just at a lower probability. Let's reasonably assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

4. \( P(E) \) (Total Probability of E): Using the law of total probability,
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H)) \]
\[ = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.95 \]
\[ = 0.04 + 0.19 \]
\[ = 0.23 \]

Now, we can compute \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.23} \]
\[ ≈ \frac{0.04}{0.23} \]
\[ ≈ 0.1739 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is approximately 0.174.
