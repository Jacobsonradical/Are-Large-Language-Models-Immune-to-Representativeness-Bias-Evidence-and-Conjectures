Sure, I will follow the format you requested. Let's break down the given problem:

- P(H) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science before considering the personality sketch E.
- P(E|H) is the probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- P(E|¬H) is the probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Given Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, his love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work, it seems quite plausible that he might be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. However, we need to set some reasonable values for these probabilities.

1. **P(H)**: Without additional context, we might assign a moderate prior probability that Adam is enrolled in this field. Let's assume 0.2 (20%).

2. **P(E|H)**: Given his personality traits, let's assume these traits are highly consistent with someone who would be enrolled in this field. Let's choose a high probability, say 0.8 (80%).

3. **P(E|¬H)**: If Adam were not in this field, there are many other fields he could be in that might still align with his personality traits, but let's assume the probability is lower. We might choose something like 0.4 (40%).

To compute P(H|E) using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is computed as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.16 + 0.32 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.48 \]

Now:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{0.48} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.16}{0.48} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{1}{3} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.333... \]

Thus, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given the personality sketch is approximately 0.33 (33%).
