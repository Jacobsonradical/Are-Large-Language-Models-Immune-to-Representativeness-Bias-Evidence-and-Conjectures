Let's analyze the given information to compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in "agricultural and veterinary science" based on his personality sketch, using Bayes' rule.

Given:
- E ↦ Personality sketch of Adam
- H ↦ Hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in "agricultural and veterinary science"
- \( P(H) \) ↦ Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in "agricultural and veterinary science"
- \( P(E|H) \) ↦ Probability of sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in "agricultural and veterinary science"
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) ↦ Probability of sketch E given that Adam was not enrolled in "agricultural and veterinary science"

Applying Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Determine \( P(H) \) (Prior probability):**
   This prior probability depends on the general likelihood of a graduate student being enrolled in "agricultural and veterinary science". For simplicity, let's assume:
   
   \[ P(H) = 0.05 \]
   
2. **Determine \( P(E|H) \) (Likelihood):**
   Adam's personality sketch matches well with someone who might be enrolled in "agricultural and veterinary science" given his love for nature, plants, animals and his strong empathy. Hence:
   
   \[ P(E|H) = 0.9 \]
   
3. **Determine \( P(E|\neg H) \) (Likelihood of E given not H):**
   We consider that Adam's traits might apply to other fields as well, though perhaps not as strongly. For example, fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology might also attract individuals with these traits:
   
   \[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \]
   
4. **Calculate \( P(E) \):**
   Using the law of total probability:
   
   \[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
   
   Substituting the known values:
   
   \[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.05) + (0.3 \cdot 0.95) = 0.045 + 0.285 = 0.33 \]
   
5. **Calculate \( P(H|E) \) (Posterior probability):**
   
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.33} \approx 0.136 \]
   
Rounding to an appropriate number of significant figures:

\[ P(H|E) = 0.14 \]
