To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' theorem, we need the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Let's assign reasonable values to these probabilities based on common assumptions and information provided:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a graduate student was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in the U.S. Given the diversity of graduate programs, let's assume it to be relatively low, say around 0.05.

2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch if he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his attributes (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy), this is likely quite high. We could assign this a value of around 0.8.

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch if he was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Since his traits can also fit well with other fields like biology, environmental science, etc., this might be moderately high. We could assign this a value of around 0.3.

Using these values:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.3 \cdot 0.95} \]

Calculating the denominator:

\[ 0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.3 \cdot 0.95 = 0.04 + 0.285 = 0.325 \]

Now, calculating \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.325} = \frac{4}{32.5} \approx 0.123 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) is approximately 0.123.
