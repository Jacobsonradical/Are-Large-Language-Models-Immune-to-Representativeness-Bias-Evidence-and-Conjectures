Sure! Let's break this down using Bayes' rule.

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability, or the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science without knowing his personality sketch. This would be based on general enrollment statistics, but let's assume it's 0.05 (this represents a guess that 5% of graduate students might be in this field).

2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood, or the probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, quiet demeanor, and empathy, it is quite high. Let's say this is 0.8.

3. **P(E|Â¬H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was NOT enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Since his characteristics align well with many fields but especially strongly with agricultural and veterinary science, this probability is lower. Let's assume this to be 0.2.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
\]

Let's compute the values:

1. \( P(H) = 0.05 \)
2. \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \)
3. \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \)
4. \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.95 \)

Now,

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.95}
\]

Calculate the numerator and the denominator:

- Numerator: \( 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04 \)
- Denominator: \(0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.95 = 0.04 + 0.19 = 0.23 \)

So,

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.23} \approx 0.1739 
\]

Based on these calculations, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.1739 or 17.39%.
