To estimate \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to first judge the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the probability of \( E \) given not \( H \), \( P(E|\neg H) \). Bayes' rule is given by:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

However, for comparative purposes, we'll only need the numerator since \( P(E) \) is common for both fields and can be treated as a normalizing constant. We primarily focus on relative probabilities.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Agricultural and veterinary science is a specialized field but not uncommon for someone with high intelligence, a deep love for animals, and an interest in nature. Let's assume a moderately low probability because it’s specific but aligned with Adam's interests.
   - \( P(H_{\text{agricultural}}) = 0.1 \) (not a rare choice, but not the most common either).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Given Adam's personality sketch, being in agricultural and veterinary science makes a lot of sense, as his natural curiosity, empathy for animals, and intelligence align perfectly with this field.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural}}) = 0.9 \) (highly likely).

3. **Probability of Evidence \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - This is the likelihood that Adam’s personality sketch matches our expectations if he’s not in agricultural and veterinary science. Given that people with these traits could follow many paths (e.g., environmental science, biology), this probability should reflect that.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural}}) = 0.2 \) (given that there are many other fields that align with interest in nature and animals).

Using Bayes’ rule (simplified form focusing on numerators):

\[
P(H_{\text{agricultural}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{agricultural}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural}})
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{agricultural}}|E) \propto 0.9 \times 0.1 = 0.09
\]

### Business Administration:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Business administration is a very common graduate field and has a high prior probability in general, but less aligned with Adam’s described personality.
   - \( P(H_{\text{business}}) = 0.3 \) (since it's a common choice but less fitting for someone with a strong nature and animal focus).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Adam’s personality sketch has a poor fit with business administration. His empathy and curiosity about nature do not align well with the typical traits we might expect in this field.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) = 0.05 \).

3. **Probability of Evidence \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - This is similar to earlier as it’s the catch-all for other fields fitting the description.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}}) = 0.2 \).

Using Bayes’ rule (again focused on numerators):

\[
P(H_{\text{business}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}})
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{business}}|E) \propto 0.05 \times 0.3 = 0.015
\]

### Conclusion:

\[
\text{Total (for normalization, but not needed for this instruction)} = 0.09 + 0.015 = 0.105
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{agricultural}}|E) \approx \frac{0.09}{0.105} = 0.857
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{business}}|E) \approx \frac{0.015}{0.105} = 0.143
\]

However, as noted, our answer does not need to sum to 1 due to unspecified probabilities for other fields. Thus:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.857,
  "business administration": 0.143
}
```
