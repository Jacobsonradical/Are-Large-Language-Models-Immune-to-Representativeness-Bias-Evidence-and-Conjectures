To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate prior probabilities \( P(H) \), likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihoods \( P(E|\neg H) \) for the hypotheses. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since the total probability \( P(E) \) is the same for both hypotheses and it's the normalization factor, we can compare \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) directly for the purposes of ranking the hypotheses.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

#### Prior Probability (\( P(H) \))
Let's assume the prior probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is moderate, as this field is one of the less common fields.

* Estimated \( P(H) \) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.1

#### Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \))
Given Adam's personality traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants: High relevance
- Strong empathy and love for animals: High relevance
- Quiet and enjoys puzzles: Moderately relevant
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts: Moderately relevant
- Strong appreciation for hard work: Relevant

Given these traits align strongly with agricultural and veterinary science, we'll estimate a high likelihood:

* Estimated \( P(E|H) \) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.8

#### Likelihood (\( P(E|\neg H) \))
For fields other than agricultural and veterinary science, these personality traits might still appear but are less specific. 

* Estimated \( P(E|\neg H) \) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.2

### Business Administration

#### Prior Probability (\( P(H) \))
Assuming business administration is a common field of study, we assign a higher prior probability:

* Estimated \( P(H) \) for Business Administration: 0.3

#### Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \))
Given Adam's personality traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants: Low relevance
- Strong empathy and love for animals: Low relevance
- Quiet and enjoys puzzles: Moderately relevant
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts: Moderately relevant
- Strong appreciation for hard work: Relevant

These traits don't particularly align well with business administration, so we'll estimate a lower likelihood:

* Estimated \( P(E|H) \) for Business Administration: 0.2

#### Likelihood (\( P(E|\neg H) \))
For fields other than business administration, these personality traits might appear less relevant as well.

* Estimated \( P(E|\neg H) \) for Business Administration: 0.4

### Computing \( P(H|E) \)

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \cdot 0.3 = 0.06 \]

Therefore, compared to each other, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08,
  "business administration": 0.06
}
```
