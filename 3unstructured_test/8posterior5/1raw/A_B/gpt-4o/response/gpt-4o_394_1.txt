To solve this problem using Bayes' theorem, we need to figure out the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch. We will denote the fields as \( H_1 \) for agricultural and veterinary science and \( H_2 \) for business administration. Let \( E \) be the personality sketch of Adam.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H_i | E) = \frac{P(E | H_i) \cdot P(H_i)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(H_i) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in field \( H_i \), \( P(E | H_i) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in field \( H_i \), \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch occurring, and \( P(H_i | E) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in field \( H_i \) given the personality sketch.

### Assumptions and Estimates:
- \( P(H_1) \): The prior probability of Adam being in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(H_2) \): The prior probability of Adam being in business administration.
- \( P(E | H_1) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E | H_2) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is in business administration.
- \( P(E | \neg H_1) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E | \neg H_2) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is not in business administration.

Given the sketch of Adam:

1. Adam's characteristics (love for nature, animals, empathy, intelligence, appreciation for hard work, and puzzles) seem more aligned with agricultural and veterinary science than business administration.
2. We might assign a higher probability of observing Adam's personality traits in someone studying agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration.

Let's quantify the probabilities:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1):
- \( P(H_1) \): Assume a modest assumption that the proportion of students in agricultural and veterinary science is 0.05 (5%).
- \( P(E | H_1) \): Given the personality sketch highly matches this field, we could estimate this probability to be high, say 0.9.
- \( P(E | \neg H_1) \): There are many other fields not related to this sketch, so this could be lower, say 0.3.

### Business Administration (H2):
- \( P(H_2) \): Assume a higher general proportion of students in business, say 0.2 (20%).
- \( P(E | H_2) \): The traits do not match strongly, so we set this lower, perhaps 0.1.
- \( P(E | \neg H_2) \): There are still many other fields not related to business but matching the sketch, so analogously, we might set this value to around 0.4.

Using these estimates, we calculate:
\[ P(\neg H_1) = 1 - P(H_1) = 0.95 \]
\[ P(\neg H_2) = 1 - P(H_2) = 0.8 \]

Let's also calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E | H_1) P(H_1) + P(E | \neg H_1) P(\neg H_1) \]
\[ P(E)_{\text{agri}} = 0.9 \times 0.05 + 0.3 \times 0.95 = 0.345 \]

\[ P(E) = P(E | H_2) P(H_2) + P(E | \neg H_2) P(\neg H_2) \]
\[ P(E)_{\text{business}} = 0.1 \times 0.2 + 0.4 \times 0.8 = 0.34 \]

Lastly, using Bayes' theorem:
### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{P(E | H_1) P(H_1)}{P(E)_{\text{agri}}} = \frac{0.9 \times 0.05}{0.345} \approx 0.1304 \]


### Business Administration:
\[ P(H_2 | E) = \frac{P(E | H_2) P(H_2)}{P(E)_{\text{business}}} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.34} \approx 0.0588 \]

Now we round these to a reasonable decimal place and present them within the range [0, 1]:

  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.13,
