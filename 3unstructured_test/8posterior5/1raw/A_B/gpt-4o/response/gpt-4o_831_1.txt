To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to assess the following:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that the personality sketch \( E \) matches if Adam is in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that the personality sketch \( E \) matches if Adam is not in that field.

We'll use these in Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we are only asked for relative probabilities, we can ignore \( P(E) \). The relative posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) will be proportional to \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

### Estimations:

1. **Business Administration**
   - \( P(H_{BA}) \): Assume there's a moderate number of graduates in business administration relative to all fields.
   - \( P(H_{BA}) \approx 0.1 \)
   - \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): The personality sketch does not strongly align with typical traits of business students, who might be more oriented towards economics, finance, or management.
   - \( P(E|H_{BA}) \approx 0.1 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \approx 0.6 \) (since the personality sketch may fit better in non-business fields).

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   -  \( P(H_{AVS}) \): There are fewer graduate students in this specific field compared to more general fields like business.
   -  \( P(H_{AVS}) \approx 0.05 \)
   -  \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \): The personality sketch strongly aligns with traits such as curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals.
   -  \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \approx 0.8 \)
   -  \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \approx 0.4 \) (since these specific traits are less common in other fields).

Using Bayesâ€™ rule in a proportional form:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

### Calculations:

1. **Business Administration**
   \[
   P(H_{BA}|E) \propto P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) = 0.1 \cdot 0.1 = 0.01
   \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   \[
   P(H_{AVS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04
   \]

### Results:
{
  "business administration": "0.01",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.04"
}
