To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). We then use the formula:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
\]

Since this problem is more qualitative and doesn't provide exact numbers, I will make reasoned assessments for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for both fields. Then I'll use these values to find \( P(H|E) \).

### Business Administration

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that a student is enrolled in business administration. Let's assume a moderate general probability since business administration is a common graduate field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability that if Adam is in business administration, he has the personality sketch provided. Given Adam's interests and traits, business administration doesn't seem very likely. 
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability that someone with his personality sketch is not in business administration, which could be reasonably high since such personalities are less common in business administration.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that a student is in agricultural and veterinary science. This field is less common but still significant.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability that if Adam is in this field, he has the personality sketch provided. Given his love for nature, animals, empathy, and academic prowess, this is very likely.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability that someone with his personality sketch is not in this field, which might be lower since his interests align well with this field.

Given this, let's assign qualitative probabilities and compute:

**Business Administration:**

- \( P(H) \): 0.2 (moderate prior probability)
- \( P(E|H) \): 0.1 (low probability as personality traits donâ€™t align well)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): 0.8 (high likelihood his personality sketch applies elsewhere)

\[
P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.1 \times 0.2 + 0.8 \times 0.8} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.64} = \frac{0.02}{0.66} \approx 0.03
\]

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

- \( P(H) \): 0.1 (lower prior probability since this field is less common)
- \( P(E|H) \): 0.9 (high probability given personality traits)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): 0.3 (low to moderate likelihood the personality applies to other fields)

\[
P(H|E)_{\text{AVS}} = \frac{0.9 \times 0.1}{0.9 \times 0.1 + 0.3 \times 0.9} = \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.27} = \frac{0.09}{0.36} = 0.25
\]

So the computed posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.03,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.25
}
```
