To compute the probabilities using Bayes' Rule, we'll start with estimating \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field.

### Business Administration

- \( P(H_{BA}) \): The prior probability that a random graduate student is studying business administration.
  Let's assume a moderate value based on general enrollment statistics. Suppose \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.15 \).

- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is studying business administration.
  Adam's interest in nature, puzzles, empathy, and love for animals doesn't strongly align with typical traits needed for business administration. Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.05 \).

- \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not studying business administration.
  We need an estimate based on other possible fields. Suppose there is some broader alignment; hence, \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.30 \).

Applying Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \cdot P(\neg H_{BA}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.05 \cdot 0.15) + (0.30 \cdot 0.85) = 0.0075 + 0.255 = 0.2625 \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.15}{0.2625} \approx 0.0286 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- \( P(H_{AVS}) \): The prior probability that a random graduate student is studying agricultural and veterinary science.
  Let's assume a moderate value based on general enrollment statistics. Suppose \( P(H_{AVS}) = 0.10 \).

- \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is studying agricultural and veterinary science.
  Adamâ€™s love for nature, animals, warmth, and empathy strongly align with this field. Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{AVS}) = 0.90 \).

- \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not studying agricultural and veterinary science.
  We use prior assumptions as averaged likelihoods for other fields, \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) = 0.25 \).

Applying Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) + P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \cdot P(\neg H_{AVS}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.90 \cdot 0.10) + (0.25 \cdot 0.90) = 0.09 + 0.225 = 0.315 \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.90 \cdot 0.10}{0.315} \approx 0.2857 \]
