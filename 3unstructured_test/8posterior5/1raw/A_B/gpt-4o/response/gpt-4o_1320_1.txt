To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to first estimate the following:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \), given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \), given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.
- Bayes' rule: \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \)

Here, we won't explicitly compute \( P(E) \), the marginal probability of \( E \), since it cancels out in the normalized posterior.

Given the personality sketch of Adam, we can make some reasoned estimates based on how well his characteristics align with the typical characteristics of students in these fields.

### Business Administration
#### Estimations:
- **P(H):** Let's assume a prior probability that any graduate student is equally likely to be in any given field. For simplicity, we say \( P(H_{\text{business admin.}}) \approx 0.2 \) (this is a guess and can vary).
- **P(E|H):** The sketch indicates curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy, which are less aligned with business administration. Let's assign a lower probability here, say \( P(E|H_{\text{business admin.}}) \approx 0.1 \).
- **P(E|\neg H):** For all fields other than business administration, which are more aligned with Adam's described traits, we assume a higher probability: \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business admin.}}) \approx 0.9 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
#### Estimations:
- **P(H):** Assuming equal likelihood for simplicity as before, \( P(H_{\text{agri. & vet. science}}) \approx 0.2 \).
- **P(E|H):** The sketch perfectly matches traits often found in students of agricultural and veterinary sciences. Thus, \( P(E|H_{\text{agri. & vet. science}}) \approx 0.8 \).
- **P(E|\neg H):** For fields other than agricultural and veterinary science, the probability of observing the sketch is lower. Letâ€™s say, \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agri. & vet. science}}) \approx 0.2 \).

### Calculation:
#### Business Administration:
\[
P(H_{\text{business admin.}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business admin.}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business admin.}})}{P(E|H_{\text{business admin.}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business admin.}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{business admin.}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{business admin.}})}
\]
\[
= \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.9 \cdot 0.8} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.72} = \frac{0.02}{0.74} \approx 0.027
\]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[
P(H_{\text{agri. & vet. science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agri. & vet. science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agri. & vet. science}})}{P(E|H_{\text{agri. & vet. science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agri. & vet. science}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{agri. & vet. science}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{agri. & vet. science}})}
\]
\[
= \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{0.8 \cdot 0.2 + 0.2 \cdot 0.8} \approx \frac{0.16}{0.16 + 0.16} = \frac{0.16}{0.32} = 0.5
\]

Thus, the calculated probabilities will be:

{
  "business administration": 0.027,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5
}
