To solve this, we need to use Bayes' theorem which is defined as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we have two fields of study (agricultural and veterinary science, and business administration), we'll estimate the probabilities as follows:

Let's denote:
- \( H_1 \) to be the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( H_2 \) to be the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in business administration.

Without loss of generality, let's assume \( P(H_1) \) and \( P(H_2) \) to be equal initially, as a starting point for our priors since we don't have concrete data about the overall distribution of graduate students across different fields.

\[ P(H_1) = P(H_2) = 0.5 \]

Next, we need to estimate \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \):

Given Adam’s genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and traits such as empathy, it seems more likely for him to be in a field related to agricultural and veterinary science rather than business administration.

So we might estimate:
- \( P(E|H_1) \approx 0.8 \) because his personality sketch aligns well with this field.
- \( P(E|H_2) \approx 0.2 \) because his personality sketch doesn't align well with this field.

Now, \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of the evidence being observed given he is not in the specific field. This can be a bit more complex to nail down since \(\neg H\) includes many other fields. But for simplicity, let’s equalize those probabilities with the complement constraints:

- \( P(E|\neg H_1) \approx 0.2 \) which considers he could be in a different field but with lesser congruence.
- \( P(E|\neg H_2) \approx 0.8 \) which considers he could be in a different field more congruent with the given personality.

Next, we calculate each field using Bayes rule:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E|\neg H_1) \cdot P(\neg H_1) \]

Assuming \(\neg H\) encompasses other fields, 
\[ P(E|\neg H_1) \approx 0.8 \]

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.5) + (0.2 \cdot 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Hence,
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

2. **Business Administration:**

\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.5) + (0.8 \cdot 0.5) = 0.1 + 0.4 = 0.5 \]

Hence,
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = 0.2 \]

The results can be formulated as:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
