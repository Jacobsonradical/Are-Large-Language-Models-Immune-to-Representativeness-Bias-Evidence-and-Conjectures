To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule for Adam being a graduate student in business administration and agricultural and veterinary science, we need to assess the following:

1. **Base Rate Probability: \( P(H) \) for each field**
2. **Likelihood of Evidence given the Hypothesis: \( P(E|H) \)**
3. **Likelihood of Evidence given the Negation of the Hypothesis: \( P(E|\neg H) \)**

For simplicity, I'll use hypothetical values. These should ideally be based on real statistics and domain knowledge.

Let's start with the following assumptions:

1. **Base Rate Probability: \( P(H) \)**
   - Business Administration: \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.2 \)
   - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.05 \)

2. **Likelihood of Evidence given the Hypothesis: \( P(E|H) \)**
   - Given Adam's personality sketch, it is less likely that he is in business administration: \( P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.05 \)
   - Given Adam's personality sketch, it is highly likely that he is in agricultural and veterinary science: \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.7 \)

3. **Likelihood of Evidence given the Negation of the Hypothesis: \( P(E|\neg H) \)**
   - With no specific lean towards business administration characteristics, let's assume \( P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) = 0.1 \)
   - For fields other than agricultural and veterinary science, we'd assume \( P(E|\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.2 \)

### Using Bayes' Rule:

Bayes' rule is:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

#### For Business Administration:
\[ P(E) = (0.05 \times 0.2) + (0.1 \times 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.01 + 0.08 = 0.09 \]

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.2}{0.09} \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.09} \approx 0.111 \]

#### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \times 0.05) + (0.2 \times 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.035 + 0.19 = 0.225 \]

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.05}{0.225} \]
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.035}{0.225} \approx 0.156 \]

### Final Summary:
Based on the calculations, the probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": "0.111",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.156"
}
