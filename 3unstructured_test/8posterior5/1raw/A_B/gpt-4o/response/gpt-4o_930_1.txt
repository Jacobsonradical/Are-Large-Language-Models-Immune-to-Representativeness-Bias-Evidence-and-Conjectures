First, let's outline the relevant probabilities for each field:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - **P(H_b)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration. Given that Business Administration is a common field of study, let's estimate a moderate prior probability for this hypothesized field, say 0.2.
   - **P(E|H_b)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in Business Administration. Given his traits, this is somewhat unlikely, as business administration is not typically associated with a love for nature or animals. Let's estimate it to be 0.1.
   - **P(E|\neg H_b)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in Business Administration. This is higher, as there are many other fields that align more naturally with his traits, like agricultural and veterinary science or environmental science. Let's estimate it to be 0.4.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **P(H_a)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. This field directly aligns with Adam's interest in nature, animals, and his warm-hearted nature. Let's estimate a higher prior probability for this field, say 0.3.
   - **P(E|H_a)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is high, considering his strong interest in nature, plants, and animals. Let's estimate it to be 0.8.
   - **P(E|\neg H_a)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is moderate because other fields could still potentially explain his traits. Let's estimate it to be 0.2.

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

But, since we have multiple hypotheses, we'll compute the likelihood part, and we assume that:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_b) \cdot P(H_b) + P(E|H_a) \cdot P(H_a) + P(E|\neg H_b \cap \neg H_a) \cdot P(\neg H_b \cap \neg H_a) \]

For simplicity, we'll just focus on comparing the relative posteriors for the two given fields.

### Business Administration

\[ P(H_b|E) = \frac{P(E|H_b) \cdot P(H_b)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.8 \cdot 0.3} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.24} = \frac{0.02}{0.26} \approx 0.0769 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

\[ P(H_a|E) = \frac{P(E|H_a) \cdot P(H_a)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.3}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.8 \cdot 0.3} = \frac{0.24}{0.02 + 0.24} = \frac{0.24}{0.26} \approx 0.9231 \]

So, our final probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": 0.0769,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.9231
}
