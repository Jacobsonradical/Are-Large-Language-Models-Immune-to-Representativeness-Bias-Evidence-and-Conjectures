Sure, let's evaluate these parameters step by step based on the provided personality sketch of Adam.

### Hypothesis Setup:
- Let H1 be the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- Let H2 be the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in business administration.

### Probabilities for Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1):
- **P(H1)**: The general probability that a graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This is largely dependent on how many students enroll in this field relative to others. Let's assume P(H1) = 0.05 (5% as a rough general estimate).
- **P(E|H1)**: The probability of the given personality sketch E, given that Adam is indeed in agricultural and veterinary science. Considering his love for nature, animals, and empathy, this field aligns very well with his interests and personality. Let's assume P(E|H1) = 0.9 (90%).
- **P(E|¬H1)**: The probability of the given personality sketch E, given that Adam is NOT in agricultural and veterinary science. Since the sketch strongly emphasizes traits and interests that fit well with agricultural and veterinary science, it's less likely for someone with this exact personality sketch to be in another field. Let's assume P(E|¬H1) = 0.2 (20%).

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1) + P(E|¬H1) \cdot P(¬H1) \]

Here, P(¬H1) = 1 - P(H1) = 0.95.

So,
\[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95) = 0.045 + 0.19 = 0.235 \]

Therefore,
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.235} \approx 0.191 \]

### Probabilities for Business Administration (H2):
- **P(H2)**: The general probability that a graduate student is enrolled in business administration. This field typically has a higher enrollment rate. Let's assume P(H2) = 0.2 (20%).
- **P(E|H2)**: The probability of the given personality sketch E, given that Adam is in business administration. Adam's personality traits and interests don't strongly align with typical business admin traits. Let's assume P(E|H2) = 0.1 (10%).
- **P(E|¬H2)**: The probability of the given personality sketch E, given that Adam is NOT in business administration. Since there are many fields other than business administration and agricultural/veterinary science, let's assume it’s moderately likely for someone with this personality to be in another field. Let's assume P(E|¬H2) = 0.3 (30%).

Using Bayes’ Rule:

\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2) + P(E|¬H2) \cdot P(¬H2) \]

Here, P(¬H2) = 1 - P(H2) = 0.8.

So,
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) = 0.02 + 0.24 = 0.26 \]

Therefore,
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.26} \approx 0.077 \]

Based on these calculations, the final probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.191,
  "business administration": 0.077
}
