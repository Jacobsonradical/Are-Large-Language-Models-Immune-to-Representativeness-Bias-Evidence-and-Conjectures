To use Bayes' Theorem for our calculation, we need to determine the following:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that the personality sketch \( E \) is true given that Adam was enrolled in the field \( H \).
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that the personality sketch \( E \) is true given that Adam was not enrolled in the field \( H \).

Given the personality sketch, let's estimate these probabilities:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H = agricultural and veterinary science)
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Assuming 2021 U.S. graduate fields, agricultural and veterinary science is less common but a viable option for someone passionate about nature and animals.
   - Let's set \( P(H_{agricultural}) = 0.05 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Adam's empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature align well with this field.
   - We can assume \( P(E|H_{agricultural}) = 0.9 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - Adam's traits are not as strongly aligned with other fields where nature and animals are less involved.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{agricultural}) = 0.1 \).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Substituting values:

\[ P(H_{agricultural}|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.9 \cdot 0.05 + 0.1 \cdot (1 - 0.05)} \]

\[ P(H_{agricultural}|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.095} \]

\[ P(H_{agricultural}|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.14} \approx 0.321 \]

### Business Administration (H = business administration)
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Business administration is a popular field for graduate students.
   - Let's set \( P(H_{business}) = 0.2 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Adam’s traits like empathy, puzzle-solving, and appreciation for hard work could fit business administration, but not as strongly as the agricultural field.
   - We can assume \( P(E|H_{business}) = 0.3 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - These traits could fit almost any field, but since business is broad and less specific to Adam’s known interests, other fields may be equally likely.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{business}) = 0.4 \).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Substituting values:

\[ P(H_{business}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot (1 - 0.2)} \]

\[ P(H_{business}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.32} \]

\[ P(H_{business}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.38} \approx 0.158 \]

The results are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.321,
  "business administration": 0.158
}
