To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the following values for each field:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.
4. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing the personality sketch. For simplicity, we can calculate this implicitly for each field.

Bayes’ rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant that will be the same for both fields, we can focus on calculating the numerator for each case and comparing them.

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): Business administration is a common field among graduate students. Let's assume a moderate prior probability, say 0.2 (20%).
- \( P(E|H) \): The personality sketch of Adam does not strongly align with typical traits associated with business administration students, who might be more focused on economics, management, or analytics rather than nature, empathy, and abstract concepts related to nature. Let’s give this a fairly low value, say 0.1 (10%).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given the personality traits and the fact that they are common traits in other fields, this should be relatively high, say 0.7 (70%).

Using Bayes' rule (not accounting for the normalizing constant):
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H)P(H) = 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): Agricultural and veterinary science is less common than business administration but aligns well with Adam's interests and traits. Let’s assume a lower prior probability, say 0.05 (5%).
- \( P(E|H) \): The personality sketch is strongly aligned with this field; interest in nature, plants, animals, and appreciation for hard work are highly relevant. Let’s give this a high value, say 0.9 (90%).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given these traits are not as common in other fields, let’s reasonably estimate this to be lower, say 0.5 (50%).

Using Bayes' rule (not accounting for the normalizing constant):
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H)P(H) = 0.9 \times 0.05 = 0.045 \]

### Normalizing to get the probabilities
To normalize these values, we sum them up and divide each by the total:

\[ \text{Total} = 0.02 + 0.045 = 0.065 \]

Therefore:
\[ P(\text{business administration} | E) = \frac{0.02}{0.065} \approx 0.3077 \]
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science} | E) = \frac{0.045}{0.065} \approx 0.6923 \]

So, the values in the required format are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3077,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6923
}
```
