To solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem, we have to compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis (H being a specific field, in this case). Bayes' Theorem is given as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:

- \( P(H) \): Prior probability of H (Adam choosing a specific field without knowing the personality sketch E).
- \( P(E|H) \): Probability of E given H (the likelihood of the personality sketch given H is true, i.e., Adam enrolled in that specific field).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of E given not-H (the likelihood of the personality sketch given Adam did not enroll in that specific field).

To keep things manageable, we'll make some reasonable assumptions:

- \( P(H) \): We'll assume the prior probabilities are evenly distributed without specific prior knowledge. As there are numerous fields Adam could have enrolled in, we'll assign a nominal value of \( P(H) = 0.1 \) for simplicity (given the absence of concrete prior probabilities).
- \( P(E|H) \): We estimate how likely Adam's personality sketch fits with the given field's profile.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): We estimate how likely Adam's personality fits with the other fields excluding the given one.

Let's now estimate these values for each hypothesis:

### Business Administration

- \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): People in business administration might not predominantly have the curiosity about nature, a warm heart, and a deep empathy for animals. Likely low, let’s assume \( 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \): This represents how likely Adam's personality fits with other fields excluding business administration. Given his strong empathy and love for nature/animals, this is relatively higher. Let's suppose \( 0.3 \).

Using these estimates, \( P(E) \) does not need to be computed explicitly as we are comparing ratios.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \): This aligns well with Adam’s interests and personality. Fairly high, say \( 0.7 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \): This is the likelihood of the personality fitting other fields. Since Adam’s personality is fitting quite well here, it would be lower relatively. Let’s assume \( 0.2 \).

Now, let’s calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each:

\[
P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)}
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}})}{P(E)}
\]

Comparing the ratios:

- Business Administration:

\[
P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1 \cdot 0.1 = 0.01
\]

- Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[
P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.7 \cdot 0.1 = 0.07
\]

Normalizing these (note that we're comparing the values proportionally):

\[
\begin{pmatrix}
\text{Business Administration} : &  0.1 \\
\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science} : & 0.7 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\]

So, the values based on the proportionality are roughly:

\[
\{
  "business administration": 0.125,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.875
\}
\]

This suggests that, given Adam's personality sketch, he is significantly more likely to be enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science than in Business Administration.
