To find the probabilities of \( P(H|E) \) for each field \( H \) given the personality sketch \( E \), we can use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since \( P(E) \) is common for both hypotheses, it will cancel out when comparing \( P(H|E) \) for different fields:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Now, let's estimate the probabilities.

### Business Administration
1. **Initial assumption \( P(H_{BA}) \)**: This can be considered low, as we're not given enough background to assume that students are generally enrolled in business administration. Let’s estimate \( P(H_{BA}) \) as 5%.
2. **Probability P(E|H_{BA})**: Given the traits of Adam, it's unlikely that someone interested in nature, plants, animals, and empathy would choose business administration. Let’s estimate this probability as very low, around 0.05.
3. **Probability \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \)**: Given there could be many other fields of study which fit Adam’s traits better, let’s estimate this higher, around 0.95.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **Initial assumption \( P(H_{AVS}) \)**: This probability is higher because the field directly aligns with Adam's interests and personality traits. Let’s estimate \( P(H_{AVS}) \) as 10%.
2. **Probability \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \)**: Given the direct match with the field, this is high. Let’s estimate this as 0.95.
3. **Probability \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \)**: For other fields, Adam's traits might be less relevant or less of a match. Let’s assume this as lower, around 0.30.

Using the simplified form of Bayes' rule:

### Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) = 0.05 \cdot 0.05 = 0.0025 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) = 0.95 \cdot 0.10 = 0.095 \]

Since these are proportional values, we can see that Agricultural and Veterinary Science is significantly more likely given Adam's personality sketch.

Thus, the answers would be:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0025,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.095
}
