In order to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science or business administration, we first need to identify and estimate the probabilities:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This is the initial probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field before considering the personality sketch.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam is enrolled in the specific field.
3. **Complementary Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is the probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam is not enrolled in the specific field.

We will assume some reasonable estimates for these values based on the given information.

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   Let's assume a prior probability of Adam being in this field to be 0.1 (10%), considering the broad range of graduate fields.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   Given Adam's love for nature, plants, animals, and a warm heart, there's a strong likelihood that he fits well in this field.
   Let's assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.7 \).

3. **Complementary Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   Given that these traits can be present in other fields, but are less specifically aligned, we might set this lower.
   Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \).

### For Business Administration:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   Considering the diversity of graduate business programs, let's assume a prior probability to be 0.2 (20%).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   Given Adam’s traits, it seems less likely that he fits without specific business-centric traits.
   Let’s assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \).

3. **Complementary Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   Given that these traits may fit better in other fields, this probability will be higher.
   Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
\]

#### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.7 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.07}{0.07 + 0.18} = \frac{0.07}{0.25} = 0.28
\]

#### For Business Administration:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.32} = \frac{0.02}{0.34} \approx 0.059
\]

Thus, the computed probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.28,
  "business administration": 0.059
}
```
