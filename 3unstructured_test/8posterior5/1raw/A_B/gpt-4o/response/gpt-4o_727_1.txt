Given the information about Adam's personality sketch \( E \) and the hypotheses \( H \) about his field of study, we need to employ Bayes' Rule to compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field.

Bayes' Rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

While we don't have specific numerical values, we can still make educated guesses about relative probabilities based on the given personality traits and the nature of each field of study.

1. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H) \): This would be the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in Business Administration.
     - Let's assume a lower prior given Adam’s traits do not strongly suggest business.
     - Hypothetical P(H) value: 0.1
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam's traits given he is in Business Administration.
     - His traits suggest more of a scientific disposition rather than business management.
     - Hypothetical P(E|H) value: 0.2
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam's traits given he is not in Business Administration.
     - Adam’s traits align more with scientific fields.
     - Hypothetical P(E|\neg H) value: 0.8
   - \( P(E) \): The overall probability of Adam's traits.
     - The total probability that sums up the relevant components.
     - Let's assume a hypothetical value of 0.4 for illustration.

   Thus, for Business Administration:
   \[
   P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.4} = \frac{0.02}{0.4} = 0.05
   \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): This would be the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in Agriculture and Veterinary Science.
     - Given his traits, this field seems more likely.
     - Hypothetical P(H) value: 0.4
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam's traits given he is in Agriculture and Veterinary Science.
     - Strong alignment with his curiosity about nature, empathy, and appreciation for hard work.
     - Hypothetical P(E|H) value: 0.8
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam's traits given he is not in Agriculture and Veterinary Science.
     - Given his traits align better with his field.
     - Hypothetical P(E|\neg H) value: 0.6
   - \( P(E) \): Using the same hypothetical value for illustration.
     - Assume 0.4 for consistency with the earlier calculation.
   
   Thus, for Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
   \[
   P(H|E)_{AVS} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.4}{0.4} = \frac{0.32}{0.4} = 0.8
   \]

Putting these values into the required format:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```
