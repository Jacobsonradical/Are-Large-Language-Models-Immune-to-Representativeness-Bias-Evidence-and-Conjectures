Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where 

- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability of Adam being in a specific field given E,
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing E given that Adam is in that specific field,
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in that specific field,
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing E.

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields, we do not need to calculate it explicitly, only need the ratio of \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for different hypotheses.

### Business Administration

- **P(H)**: Business administration is a relatively common field of study among graduate students. Without specific data, we might assume a moderate prior probability (e.g., 0.2).

- **P(E|H)**: The personality sketch of Adam suggests a deep interest in nature, empathy, and love for animals. These traits are not strongly indicative of a business administration program, which typically focuses on management, finance, and organizational skills. We might assume a low value here (e.g., 0.1).

- **P(E|\neg H)**: This is how likely we would observe E generally, without Adam being in business administration. Given Adam's traits, we might say this has a moderate likelihood across other fields (e.g., 0.5).

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.02}{P(E)} \]


### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)**: Given Adam's traits, this field seems a strong match. The prior probability might be assumed higher for an individual with his interests (e.g., 0.3).

- **P(E|H)**: The traits described in the personality sketch perfectly align with the field of agricultural and veterinary science. Thus, we could assume a very high value (e.g., 0.9).

- **P(E|\neg H)**: As before, this is the general likelihood of E, without specifically being related to agricultural and veterinary science, so, still moderate (e.g., 0.5).

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} = \frac{0.27}{P(E)} \]

Now, combining the proportional values:

\[ P(E) \propto 0.02 + 0.27 = 0.29 \]

So we can normalize them:

\[
P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.02/0.29} = \approx 0.069
\]

\[
P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.27/0.29} = \approx 0.931
\]

Providing the answer:

  "business administration": 0.069,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.931
