To compute \( P(H|E) \), we will use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):** This is the general likelihood of a student being in a particular field prior to considering the personality sketch \( E \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** This is the probability that the personality sketch \( E \) would describe a student in a given field \( H \).

3. **Complementary Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):** This is the probability that the personality sketch \( E \) would describe a student not in a given field \( H \).

4. **Posterior Probability \( P(H|E) \):** This is the probability that a student is in a given field \( H \) given the personality sketch \( E \).

Let's assign some intuitive approximate values:

### Business Administration

- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
  Since in the U.S., business administration is a common field of study, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
  The personality traits described (curiosity about nature, love for animals, etc.) do not typically align well with business administration. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

- **Complementary Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
  This is harder to judge since it requires an average over all other fields. We will assume that the personality traits are more likely in other fields. Let's set \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
  This field is less common compared to business administration but fits well with the personality sketch. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).

- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
  The personality traits described highly align with agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).

- **Complementary Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
  As above, this should be an average likelihood of the personality sketch matching any other field. Let's set \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

### Calculations

Now we apply Bayes' theorem to find \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to compute \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For **business administration**:
\[ P(E) = 0.1 \times 0.2 + 0.3 \times (1 - 0.2) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.24 = 0.26 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0769 \]

For **agricultural and veterinary science**:

\[ P(E) = 0.7 \times 0.05 + 0.3 \times (1 - 0.05) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.035 + 0.285 = 0.32 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.05}{0.32} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.1094 \]

Putting it all together:
