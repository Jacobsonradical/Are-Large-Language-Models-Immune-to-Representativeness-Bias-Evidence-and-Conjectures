To apply Bayes' Theorem, we need to consider the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the normalizing factor, which involves \( P(E) \). However, since we are only comparing the relative probabilities for two fields, the absolute values for the normalizing factor can be disregarded. The formula we'll use is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we're only comparing the relative likelihoods, we'll skip computing \( P(E) \) and just compare \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

1. **P(H):** This is the prior probability that Adam would be studying Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
   - Let's assume P(H) = 0.1 (10%), considering it to be a less common but quite relevant field given his interests.

2. **P(E|H):** This is the probability of observing Adam's characteristics if he is indeed studying Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
   - Given Adam's love for nature, animals, and empathy, P(E|H) is likely to be high.
   - Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.9 (90%).

3. **P(E|¬H):** This is the probability of observing Adam's characteristics if he is not studying Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
   - Given other fields could also align with his traits, but less so, let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.3 (30%).

**Business Administration**

1. **P(H):** This is the prior probability that Adam would be studying Business Administration.
   - Presumably, a more common field, but less related to his interests. Let's assume P(H) = 0.05 (5%).

2. **P(E|H):** This is the probability of observing Adam's characteristics if he is indeed studying Business Administration.
   - His interests don't align well with business administration. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.1 (10%).

3. **P(E|¬H):** This is the probability of observing Adam's characteristics if he is not studying Business Administration.
   - Given the wide range of other possible fields he could be in, let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.5 (50%).

Using these values, we compute \( P(H|E) \) for both fields:

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.09 \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.05 = 0.005 \]

Now, relative probabilities:

\( P(H|E) \text{ for Agricultural and Veterinary Science} \):
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{Agri}} \approx 0.09 \]

\( P(H|E) \text{ for Business Administration} \):
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{Business}} \approx 0.005 \]

Expressing these in the expected format:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.9,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```
