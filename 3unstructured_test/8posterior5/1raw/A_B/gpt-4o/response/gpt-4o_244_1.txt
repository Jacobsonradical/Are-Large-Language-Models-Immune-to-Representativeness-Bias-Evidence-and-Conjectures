To estimate the probabilities, let's break down the given data:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in this field. Graduate programs in agricultural and veterinary science are relatively less common than programs in more general fields like business administration. Let’s assign a moderate prior probability, say 0.1.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the characteristics E given that Adam is in this field. Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, this fits well. Thus, let’s assign a high likelihood, say 0.8.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the characteristics E given that Adam is not in this field. Considering the multitude of other fields Adam could be interested in, the probability might be moderately lower. Let’s assign a lower likelihood, say 0.3.
   
   Using Bayes' Rule:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.27} = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \approx 0.228
   \]

2. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in this field. Graduate programs in business administration are quite common. Let's assign a higher prior probability, say 0.3.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the characteristics E given that Adam is in this field. This field does not strongly align with his interests in nature and animals. Therefore, the likelihood is lower, say 0.2.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the characteristics E given that Adam is not in this field. Given the broader range of fields he might fit into, let’s assign a higher likelihood, say 0.6.
   
   Using Bayes' Rule:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{0.2 \cdot 0.3 + 0.6 \cdot 0.7} = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.42} = \frac{0.06}{0.48} = 0.125
   \]

Summarizing the results in the required format:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.228,
  "business administration": 0.125
