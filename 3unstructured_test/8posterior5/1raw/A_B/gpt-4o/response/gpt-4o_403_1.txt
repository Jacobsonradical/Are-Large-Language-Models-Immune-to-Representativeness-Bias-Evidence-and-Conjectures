Let's denote E as the personality sketch of Adam given in the description.

### For Business Administration:
- **P(H_business):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration is relatively low given his personality traits. Graduate students in Business Administration usually have different interests compared to Adam's traits. Let's assume \( P(H_{business}) = 0.05 \).

- **P(E|H_business):** The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch if he was indeed enrolled in Business Administration is quite low. People in this field generally might not exhibit such a strong love for nature and animals. Let's set \( P(E|H_{business}) = 0.1 \).

- **P(E|\neg H_business):** The probability of observing Adam's personality if he was *not* enrolled in Business Administration is higher, as his traits align more with other fields, such as those related to nature and animals. Let's say \( P(E|\neg H_{business}) = 0.8 \).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H_{business}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{business}) \cdot P(H_{business})}{P(E|H_{business}) \cdot P(H_{business}) + P(E|\neg H_{business}) \cdot P(\neg H_{business})} \]

\[ P(H_{business}|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.05}{0.1 \times 0.05 + 0.8 \times 0.95} \]

\[ P(H_{business}|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.76} \]

\[ P(H_{business}|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.765} \approx 0.0065 \]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- **P(H_ag_vet):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is relatively high given his personality traits. Let's assume \( P(H_{ag\_vet}) = 0.25 \).

- **P(E|H_ag_vet):** The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch if he was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is high. His love for nature, empathy, and understanding of hard work align well with this field. Let's set \( P(E|H_{ag\_vet}) = 0.9 \).

- **P(E|\neg H_ag_vet):** The probability of observing Adam's personality if he was not enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is somewhat lower, as fewer fields would align so well with his traits. Let's say \( P(E|\neg H_{ag\_vet}) = 0.4 \).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H_{ag\_vet}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{ag\_vet}) \cdot P(H_{ag\_vet})}{P(E|H_{ag\_vet}) \cdot P(H_{ag\_vet}) + P(E|\neg H_{ag\_vet}) \cdot P(\neg H_{ag\_vet})} \]

\[ P(H_{ag\_vet}|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.25}{0.9 \times 0.25 + 0.4 \times 0.75} \]

\[ P(H_{ag\_vet}|E) = \frac{0.225}{0.225 + 0.3} \]

\[ P(H_{ag\_vet}|E) = \frac{0.225}{0.525} \approx 0.4286 \]
