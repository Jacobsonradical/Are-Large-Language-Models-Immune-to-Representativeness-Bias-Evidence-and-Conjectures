To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule for each field of study given the personality sketch \( E \), we use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we're interested in relative comparisons and not absolute probabilities, we omit \( P(E) \) and focus on computing the numerator \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for each field. 

#### 1. Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): Let's assume a generic prior probability for business administration graduate students, say \( 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability that Adam has the given personality sketch if he is a business administration student is likely low, considering his curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals. Let's set this to \( 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The complement probability, assuming Adam does not enroll in business administration, would be higher given his interests align more with other fields. Let's assume \( 0.9 \).

#### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science 
- \( P(H) \): Let's assume a generic prior probability for agricultural and veterinary science graduate students, say \( 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability that Adam has the personality sketch if he is in this field is quite high, given his love for nature, animals, and empathy. We'll assume \( 0.8 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The complement probability, assuming Adam does not enroll in agricultural and veterinary science, is lower since his traits are well-aligned with this field. Let's assume \( 0.2 \).

Now applying Bayes' rule:

1. **Business Administration:**
\[ \text{Numerator} = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ \text{Numerator} = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \]

Relative probabilities given the evidence \( E \) (before normalization):
- \( P(H|E) \) for Business Administration: 0.02
- \( P(H|E) \) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.08

By comparing these values, we can see that Adam is more likely to be enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science given his personality sketch.

Final result:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08
}
