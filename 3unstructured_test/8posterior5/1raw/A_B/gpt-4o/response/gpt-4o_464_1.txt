To address this problem, we apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's first assess each of the probabilities needed.

1. **Business Administration (H1)**

- **P(H1)**: Prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in Business Administration. Assuming business administration is one of many fields and based on general knowledge about the relative popularity of business administration courses, let's set this to about 0.15.
- **P(E|H1)**: Probability that Adam's personality fits those enrolled in Business Administration. Given Adam's traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals), this seems relatively low. Let's assign a value of 0.05.
- **P(E|\neg H1)**: Probability that Adam's personality fits if not in Business Administration. Given the diverse range of fields, and how some fields like science are a better fit for his traits, let's assign this a higher value of 0.30.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H2)**

- **P(H2)**: Prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given how fewer students might be in this field relative to business administration, let's set this at 0.05.
- **P(E|H2)**: Probability that Adam's personality fits those enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Based on Adam's interests and traits, this is quite high. Let's assign it a value of 0.70.
- **P(E|\neg H2)**: Probability that Adam's personality fits if not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Since this personality also fits well within some scientific fields but not universally, let's assign a value of 0.20.

Given these values, we'll compute \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' Theorem:

1. **For Business Administration:**

\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1)}{P(E)} \]
Given we don't need \(P(E)\), we focus on the numerator and relative values:
\[ P(H1|E) \propto P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1) = 0.05 \cdot 0.15 = 0.0075 \]

2. **For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2)}{P(E)} \]
Again focusing on the numerator:
\[ P(H2|E) \propto P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2) = 0.70 \cdot 0.05 = 0.035 \]

Now we'll compute the normalized values for these hypotheses:

\[ \text{Normalization constant } = 0.0075 + 0.035 = 0.0425 \]

\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.0075}{0.0425} \approx 0.1765 \]
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.035}{0.0425} \approx 0.8235 \]

Thus, the results in the required format are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1765,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8235
}
```
