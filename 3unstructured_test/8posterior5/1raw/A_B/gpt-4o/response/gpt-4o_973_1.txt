To apply Bayes' rule, we need to reason about the probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field hypothesis \( H \). The hypotheses in question are:

- \( H_{\text{business administration}} \): Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} \): Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

### Business Administration
- \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Business administration is a common field among graduate students, so let's assume \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \approx 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in business administration. Adam's attributes do not strongly align with typical business administration traits (e.g., strong interest in nature and animals). Let's set \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \approx 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business administration}}) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not in business administration. We can assume there are other fields where his traits are more likely to fit better, so \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business administration}}) \approx 0.3 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}})}{P(E)} \]

\( P(E) \) is a constant and can be factored out when comparing hypotheses, so we do not need its exact value:
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This is a less common graduate field compared to business administration, so let's set \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \approx 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in this field. Adam's traits (interest in nature, animals, and empathy) strongly align with this field, so \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \approx 0.8 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not in this field. This is generally lower because his traits fit well with agricultural and veterinary science, so \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \approx 0.2 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})}{P(E)} \]

Again, \( P(E) \) is a constant:
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \]

### Normalizing the Probabilities
To compare these results, it's often useful to normalize them, but since this isn't required, we can provide them as is:

{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08
}

This indicates that, based on Adam's personality sketch, it is more likely he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration.
