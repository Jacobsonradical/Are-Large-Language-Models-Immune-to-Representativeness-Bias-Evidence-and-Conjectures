To calculate the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' theorem, we need to estimate the following:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is in the given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam is in the field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam is in any field except the given one.
4. Use Bayes' theorem: \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \)

Since \( P(E) \) (the total probability of evidence \( E \)) is the same for both fields, it will cancel out in the relative comparison, so we only need the product \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

### Business Administration:
- \( P(H) \): Assuming a lower prior probability because Adam's personality sketch does not strongly align with traits typically associated with Business Administration.
  - Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability that Adam would have this personality sketch if he were in Business Administration is relatively low.
  - Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam having this personality sketch given that he's not in Business Administration.
  - This is quite likely higher because the sketch aligns with other fields more closely.
  - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.9 \)

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- \( P(H) \): It's more likely given Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals.
  - Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.4 \)
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam having this personality sketch if he's in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is high.
  - Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam having this personality sketch given that he's not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
  - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \)

Now, using Bayes' theorem:

### Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = 0.01 / P(E) \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.4}{P(E)} = 0.32 / P(E) \]

### Normalization and Proportional Comparison:
Considering the normalization for an easier comparison, the relative weight of each is:
\[ \text{Business Administration}: 0.01 \]
\[ \text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}: 0.32 \]

So, the unnormalized resulting probabilities are:

\[
{
  "business administration": 0.01,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.32
}
\]


The total does not add up to 1 because these aren't normalized probabilities, just relative strengths of \( P(H|E) \).
