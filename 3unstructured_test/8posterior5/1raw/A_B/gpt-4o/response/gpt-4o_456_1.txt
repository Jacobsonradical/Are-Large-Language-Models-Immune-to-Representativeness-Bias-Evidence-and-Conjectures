Sure, let's use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probabilities given the personality sketch of Adam.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that the hypothesis \( H \) is true given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability that the evidence \( E \) is true given that the hypothesis \( H \) is true.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence \( E \).

Let's consider the two fields provided:

### Business Administration
1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: Let's assume that the general likelihood of a graduate student being enrolled in business administration is approximately 0.15 (15%).
2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: The personality sketch does not particularly align with typical traits often associated with business administration students (e.g., interest in nature, empathy, animals). Therefore, this might be low, say 0.05.
3. **Probability of Evidence, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The evidence would likely be more common in some other fields, for which we might estimate this to be relatively high, let's say 0.9.

Now, we calculate using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.05 \times 0.15}{0.05 \times 0.15 + 0.9 \times (1 - 0.15)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} \approx \frac{0.0075}{0.0075 + 0.765} \approx \frac{0.0075}{0.7725} \approx 0.0097 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: Assume the likelihood of a graduate student being in agricultural and veterinary science is approximately 0.05 (5%).
2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: The personality sketch strongly aligns with typical traits associated with agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, this could be quite high, say 0.9.
3. **Probability of Evidence, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The evidence would be less common in most other fields, so let's say this is relatively low, perhaps 0.3.

Now, we calculate using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E)_{AgVet} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.9 \times 0.05}{0.9 \times 0.05 + 0.3 \times (1 - 0.05)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{AgVet} \approx \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.285} \approx \frac{0.045}{0.33} \approx 0.136 \]

Combining these, we get:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0097,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.136
}
