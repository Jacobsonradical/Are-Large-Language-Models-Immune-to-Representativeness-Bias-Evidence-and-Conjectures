To solve this problem using Bayes' rule, let's break down the important components:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given the negation of the hypothesis \(\neg H \).
4. \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in the given field, given the evidence \( E \).

For the fields of "agricultural and veterinary science" and "business administration", let's assume the following basic probabilities for simplicity:

- \( P(H) \) for "agricultural and veterinary science" (P(H_ag)) 
- \( P(H) \) for "business administration" (P(H_ba))

We assign reasonable values based on general assumptions:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H_ag)**:
   - \( P(H_ag) \): Let's assume this to be higher since Adam seems to have a genuine curiosity in nature and animals.
   - \( P(E|H_ag) \): High, because Adam's interests and personality traits align well with this field.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_ag) \): Lower, because his traits less typically match other fields.

2. **Business Administration (H_ba)**:
   - \( P(H_ba) \): Let's assume a moderate prior because it's a common field but not especially aligned with Adam's interests.
   - \( P(E|H_ba) \): Low, as Adam's personality doesn't strongly align with typical business administration interests.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_ba) \): Higher, because Adam's traits could fit better in various other fields, but not necessarily business administration.

Now assign some values:

For "agricultural and veterinary science":
- \( P(H_ag) = 0.2 \) (relatively higher, given his interest in nature and animals)
- \( P(E|H_ag) = 0.9 \) (high, since his attributes fit well)
- \( P(E|\neg H_ag) = 0.4 \) (assumes other fields that don't align as well)

For "business administration":
- \( P(H_ba) = 0.1 \) (lower, as interests don't align as closely)
- \( P(E|H_ba) = 0.2 \) (low likelihood, personality not fitting strong)
- \( P(E|\neg H_ba) = 0.7 \) (because his traits would likely better fit other fields)

Now, apply Bayes' rule \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \) for each:

Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- \( P(H_ag|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \)

Business Administration:
- \( P(H_ba|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \)

Since \( P(E) \) can be complex to estimate and common across both calculations:
Let's simplify comparisons assuming a normalized scenario.

Finally,

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.2}{0.9 \cdot 0.2 + 0.2 \cdot 0.1 + ...} \approx 0.69 \),
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.9 \cdot 0.2 + 0.2 \cdot 0.1 + ...} \approx 0.03 \)
