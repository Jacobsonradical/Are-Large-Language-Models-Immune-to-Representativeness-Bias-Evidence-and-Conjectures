To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field based on the given personality sketch, let's use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll need to estimate the probabilities for these terms:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam's personality traits (E) would be observed if he were in a given field (H).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that Adam's personality traits (E) would be observed if he were not in the given field.
4. The denominator \( P(E) \) will be the normalization factor, which we actually don't need to calculate since we're interested in comparing between fields.

### Hypotheses:

- H1: Adam is in business administration.
- H2: Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science.

### Prior Probabilities (P(H)):
Let's assign a very basic prior assuming equal likelihood initially among different fields. For simplicity, let’s assume a very simplified uniform prior across both fields.

\[ P(H1) = P(H2) = 0.5 \] (as a naive approximation)

### Likelihoods (P(E|H)):

- **Business Administration (H1)**:
- P(E|H1): Adam's traits include a love for nature, animals, and abstract problem-solving, which may not be highly typical but possible in business administration. Therefore, it is low.
\[ P(E|H1) = 0.1 \]

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H2)**:
- P(E|H2): Adam's traits align very well with studying agricultural and veterinary sciences.
\[ P(E|H2) = 0.8 \]

### Complement Likelihoods (P(E|¬H)):

For non-business administration fields, Adam's traits may still be moderately likely because many other fields value abstract problem-solving, nature, and animals, such as biological sciences, environmental science, etc.
\[ P(E|\neg H1) = 0.7 \]

For non-agricultural and veterinary science fields, the same reasoning applies but to a lesser extent.
\[ P(E|\neg H2) = 0.3 \]

### Applying Bayes' Theorem:

We compute the posterior probabilities (P(H|E)):

- **Business Administration**:
\[
P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1)}{P(E)} 
\]
Since \( P(E) \) is the same for all hypotheses, let’s compare the numerator:

\[
P(H1|E) \propto P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1) 
= 0.1 \times 0.5 
= 0.05
\]

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[
P(H2|E) = \frac{P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2)}{P(E)} 
\]
Since \( P(E) \) is the same for all hypotheses, let’s compare the numerator:

\[
P(H2|E) \propto P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2) 
= 0.8 \times 0.5 
= 0.4
\]

Thus, normalizing these values:

\[
P(H1|E) = \frac{0.05}{0.05 + 0.4} \approx 0.111
\]
\[
P(H2|E) = \frac{0.4}{0.05 + 0.4} \approx 0.889
\]

So, our probabilities should be:

\[
{
"business administration": "0.111",
"agricultural and veterinary science": "0.889"
}
\]
