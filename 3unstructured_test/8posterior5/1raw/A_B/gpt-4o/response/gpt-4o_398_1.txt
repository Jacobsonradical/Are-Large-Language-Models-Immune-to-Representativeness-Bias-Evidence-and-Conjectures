To calculate the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to determine the relevant probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Bayes' Rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalization factor that ensures the probabilities sum up to 1 across all possible hypotheses, we will focus on the relative calculations.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

**Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
Given Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, empathy for animals, and understanding of hard work, it's reasonable to assume that he might be less common but still very suitable for a field like agricultural and veterinary science. This domain aligns well with his interests and characteristics, so we might assign a reasonably high prior probability, say \( P(H) = 0.3 \).

**Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
If Adam were in agricultural and veterinary science, his love of nature and animals, combined with his empathy and intelligence, would strongly support this. Thus, \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).

**Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
Assuming \(\neg H\) represents all other fields excluding agricultural and veterinary science, the likelihood of Adam's characteristics being observed is lower but still possible. We might set \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.3}{(0.9 \times 0.3) + (0.1 \times 0.7)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.27}{0.27 + 0.07} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.27}{0.34} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.794 \]

### Business Administration

**Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
Adam's characteristics, such as empathy and understanding hard work, might be less directly related to a business administration field. We might assign a lower prior probability, say \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

**Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
If Adam were in business administration, while empathy and understanding hard work could be relevant, his deep love for animals and nature might be less pertinent. Thus, \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).

**Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
Assuming \(\neg H\) for business administration includes all other fields, the likelihood might still be around \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.15 \).

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{(0.2 \times 0.1) + (0.15 \times 0.9)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{(0.02 + 0.135)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.155} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.129 \]

So, the results are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.794,
  "business administration": 0.129
}
