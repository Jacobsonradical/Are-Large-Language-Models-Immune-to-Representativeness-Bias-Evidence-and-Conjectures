To use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \), we need to have values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Let's denote:

- \( H_{ag} \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( H_{ba} \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( \neg H_{ag} \) as the hypothesis that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( \neg H_{ba} \) as the hypothesis that Adam was not enrolled in business administration.

### Hypothesis: Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H_{ag})**: The prior probability that a random graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This is relatively low because it is a less common field compared to others.
   
   \( P(H_{ag}) = 0.05 \) (assumed for illustration purposes)

2. **P(E|H_{ag})**: The probability that Adam has the given personality sketch \( E \) given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, this is relatively high.
   
   \( P(E|H_{ag}) = 0.8 \) (again, assumed)

3. **P(E|\neg H_{ag})**: The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This would be lower than \( P(E|H_{ag}) \) because not all fields require or attract people with these traits.
   
   \( P(E|\neg H_{ag}) = 0.1 \) (assumed lower due to the specificity of the traits to this field)

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ 
P(H_{ag}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{ag}) \cdot P(H_{ag})}{P(E)}
\]
Where \( P(E) = P(E|H_{ag}) \cdot P(H_{ag}) + P(E|\neg H_{ag}) \cdot P(\neg H_{ag}) \)

\[
P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.05) + (0.1 \times 0.95) = 0.04 + 0.095 = 0.135
\]

\[
P(H_{ag}|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.135} \approx \frac{0.04}{0.135} \approx 0.296
\]

### Hypothesis: Business Administration

1. **P(H_{ba})**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration. This is relatively higher since business administration is a common field.
   
   \( P(H_{ba}) = 0.15 \) (assumed for illustration purposes)

2. **P(E|H_{ba})**: The probability that Adam has the personality sketch \( E \) given that he is enrolled in business administration. This is likely lower because the traits described are less common in business administration students.
   
   \( P(E|H_{ba}) = 0.2 \) (assumed)

3. **P(E|\neg H_{ba})**: The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in business administration. This is a little higher in this case because the field does not rule out students with those traits entirely.
   
   \( P(E|\neg H_{ba}) = 0.15 \) (assumed slightly higher due to general employability)

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ 
P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{ba}) \cdot P(H_{ba})}{P(E)}
\]
Where \( P(E) = P(E|H_{ba}) \cdot P(H_{ba}) + P(E|\neg H_{ba}) \cdot P(\neg H_{ba}) \)

\[
P(E) = (0.2 \times 0.15) + (0.15 \times 0.85) = 0.03 + 0.1275 = 0.1575
\]

\[
P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.15}{0.1575} \approx \frac{0.03}{0.1575} \approx 0.191
\]

### Final Answer

\[
\{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.296,
  "business administration": 0.191
\}
\]
Please note that the prior probabilities and the conditional probabilities were assumed for illustration purposes and should ideally be based on actual statistical data for more accurate results.
