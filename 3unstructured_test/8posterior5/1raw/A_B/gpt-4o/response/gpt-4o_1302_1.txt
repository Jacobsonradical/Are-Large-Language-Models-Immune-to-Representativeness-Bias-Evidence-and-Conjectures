Sure, let's start by defining the components needed to use Bayes' rule:

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**: The initial probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field before considering the personality sketch \(E\).
2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam was enrolled in the field.
3. **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam was not enrolled in the field.
4. **Posterior Probability \(P(H|E)\)**: The probability that Adam was enrolled in the field given the personality sketch \(E\).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) \) can be computed as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For simplicity, we assume that:
- \( P(H) \) and \( P(\neg H) \) are reasonable prior probabilities based on general graduate field distributions.

Now, let's make reasonable estimates based on the personality sketch for each field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)**: Let’s assume a moderate initial probability, say 0.2, because this field directly aligns with Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals.
- **P(E|H)**: Given the direct alignment with Adam's interests, let's assign a high likelihood, say 0.8.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: For all fields other than agricultural and veterinary science, the probability of observing such a matching personality sketch might be lower. Let’s estimate this at 0.1.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.2}{(0.8 \times 0.2) + (0.1 \times 0.8)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.16}{0.16 + 0.08} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.16}{0.24} = 0.67 \]

### Business Administration

- **P(H)**: Let’s assume a lower initial probability, say 0.1, because his personality sketch does not strongly suggest an interest in business administration.
- **P(E|H)**: Given the weaker alignment with Adam's interests, let’s assign a lower likelihood, say 0.2.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing such a personality sketch outside of business administration is higher. Let’s estimate this at 0.8.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{(0.2 \times 0.1) + (0.8 \times 0.9)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.72} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.74} \approx 0.027 \]

So the answers are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.67,
  "business administration": 0.027
}
```
