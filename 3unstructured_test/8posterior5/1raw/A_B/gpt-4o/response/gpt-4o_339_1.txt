To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \), we need to make some reasonable assumptions about the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Given that we have limited information, these will be approximations.

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration should be moderate compared to other graduate fields.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability that if he is in Business Administration, he has the described personality sketch, is relatively low. Business Administration typically attracts individuals who are more focused on economics, management, and less on nature and animals.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: This would be the probability of having such a personality sketch if he is not in Business Administration, which is higher than \( P(E|H) \) because many other fields, especially those related to nature and animals, are more fitting.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: The prior probability should be reasonably high since it's a well-defined field for someone with an interest in nature, plants, and animals.
- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is very high.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of having such a personality sketch if he is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is lower because other fields might not align as closely with his interests.

Given this, we roughly estimate:

### Probability Estimations
**Business Administration**:
- \( P(H) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.7 \) 

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.02}{P(E)} \]

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
- \( P(H) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \)  

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} = \frac{0.27}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) remains consistent as the normalization constant, it will cancel out when comparing relative probabilities.

### Results:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.27
}
```

Thus, based on the provided personality sketch, Adam is significantly more likely to be enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science than in Business Administration.
