We need to determine the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the fields "agricultural and veterinary science" and "business administration" given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam using Bayes' rule. To do this, we first need to estimate the probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is constant for both hypotheses, we'll focus on the numerators and normalize at the end if necessary.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: The prior likelihood of a student being in agricultural and veterinary science as a graduate field in the U.S. is moderate since it is a specialized but not the most common field.
   - Let's assume \( P(H) \) = 0.1.

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's attributes (interest in nature, love for animals, empathy), this field seems very closely aligned with his personality.
   - Let's assign a high value to \( P(E|H) \) = 0.9.

3. **Complementary Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch fitting a random, non-agricultural and veterinary science student is lower.
   - Let’s estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) = 0.3.

Applying Bayes' rule:

\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{(0.9 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot (1 - 0.1))} 
         = \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.27} 
         = \frac{0.09}{0.36} 
         = 0.25.\]


### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: The prior likelihood of a student being in business administration as a graduate field in the U.S. is higher as it is a common field.
   - Let's assume \( P(H) \) = 0.2.

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam’s attributes (focus on nature, puzzles, empathy), it does not align very well with typical business administration traits.
   - Let's assign a lower value to \( P(E|H) \) = 0.1.

3. **Complementary Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch fitting a random, non-business administration student is higher, as it better matches fields not related to business.
   - Let’s estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) = 0.4.

Applying Bayes' rule:

\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{(0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.4 \cdot (1 - 0.2))} 
         = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.32} 
         = \frac{0.02}{0.34} 
         = \approx 0.059.\]
