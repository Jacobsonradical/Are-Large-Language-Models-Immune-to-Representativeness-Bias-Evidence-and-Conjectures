To estimate the probabilities of Adam's graduate field based on his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since \(P(H|E)\) depends on \(P(E)\), which is constant and could be complex to calculate without additional information, we will compare the relative likelihoods \( P(H|E) \) for the two fields provided.

### 1. Business Administration

- \( P(H) \): This is the prior probability that Adam would choose business administration. It's relatively common but not strongly aligned with Adam's personality sketch, which shows more affinity towards nature and animals.
  
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is enrolled in business administration. Given his love for nature and animals, the probability is quite low, as business administration students typically do not focus on these areas.

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is NOT enrolled in business administration. Given his interests, this would be higher since his traits fit better in other fields such as agricultural and veterinary science.

Estimated values:
\[ P(H) \approx 0.2 \]
\[ P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.9 \]

Using approximate relative likelihoods:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- \( P(H) \): This is the prior probability that Adam would choose this field. It's less common overall but fits very well with Adam's interests and personality traits.
  
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his strong empathy, love for animals, and deep curiosity about nature, this field is a very good fit, so the probability is high.

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is NOT enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his specific interests, it would be reasonably high if he were in some other related field, but lower compared to enrolling directly in this field.

Estimated values:
\[ P(H) \approx 0.1 \]
\[ P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \]

Using approximate relative likelihoods:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.09 \]

### Revised Relative Probabilities

After normalizing within our limited scope:

We compare the two results to normalize them:

- Business Administration: \( 0.02 \)
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( 0.09 \)

Given these simplified ratios:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.18,  // 0.02 / (0.02 + 0.09)
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.82  // 0.09 / (0.02 + 0.09)
}
```

These values don't have to add up to exactly 1 because we're only considering relative probabilities for the provided fields, and other fields exist.
