Sure, let's go through the calculations step-by-step before providing the final answers.

### Definitions
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he was enrolled in that field.
- **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he was not enrolled in that field.

### Step-by-Step Evaluation
1. **Prior Probability (P(H)) Evaluation**:
   - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Moderate likelihood given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals.
   - **Business Administration**: Generally low prior probability considering Adam's personality traits which do not strongly align with typical business administration interests.

2. **Probability of Traits Given Enrollment (P(E|H))**:
   - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: High likelihood because the field aligns well with Adam's love for nature and animals.
   - **Business Administration**: Low likelihood as traits like quietness, strong empathy for animals, and love for nature do not typically align with business administration.

3. **Probability of Traits Given Not Enrollment (P(E|¬H))**:
   - Difficult to precisely calculate without information about other fields, but we can assume:
     - For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**, the probability would be average since there are other fields that might attract such personalities.
     - For **Business Administration**, the probability would be reasonably high since many fields unrelated to business might have similar characteristics.

### Bayes’ Rule
Bayes’ rule formula: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, we'll assume \(P(E)\) (the overall probability of the evidence) to be the same across the two fields for a comparative analysis.

### Final Calculation & Answer

Let’s make some assumed estimations for the probabilities:
- \( P(H_{\text{agriculture}}) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{business}}) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agriculture}}) = 0.9 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agriculture}}) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}}) = 0.8 \)

Finally, we calculate \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H_{\text{agriculture}}|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.3}{0.9 \times 0.3 + 0.5 \times 0.7} = \frac{0.27}{0.27 + 0.35} = \frac{0.27}{0.62} \approx 0.435 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{0.2 \times 0.1 + 0.8 \times 0.9} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.72} = \frac{0.02}{0.74} \approx 0.027 \]

Thus:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.44,
  "business administration": 0.03
}
```

These values suggest it is much more likely that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration, given his personality sketch.
