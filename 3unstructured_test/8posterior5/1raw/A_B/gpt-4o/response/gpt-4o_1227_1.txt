To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule states that:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) * P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For the purpose of simplicity and because \(P(E)\) would remain constant in relation to both hypotheses, we can ignore \(P(E)\) and focus on the proportion between \(P(E|H) * P(H)\) for each hypothesis. Here are the assumptions for each probability:

### Business Administration (BA)

- **P(H_BA)**: The probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in business administration. Suppose this value is relatively common, say 0.15.
- **P(E|H_BA)**: The probability that a graduate student in business administration has Adam's personality sketch. Given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, this might be lower. Let's assume 0.05. 
- **P(E|\neg H_BA)**: The probability that a graduate student not enrolled in business administration has Adam's personality sketch. This could be higher due to the match with fields like agricultural and veterinary science. Assume 0.15.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS)

- **P(H_AVS)**: The probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Suppose this value is less common, say 0.1.
- **P(E|H_AVS)**: The probability that a graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science has Adam's personality sketch. Given the strong alignment with Adamâ€™s interests and traits, this might be quite high. Let's assume 0.7.
- **P(E|\neg H_AVS)**: The probability that a graduate student not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science has Adam's personality sketch. This could be lower due to less relevance with other fields. Assume 0.1.

Using these values:
- For Business Administration:
  \[
  P(H_BA|E) = \frac{P(E|H_BA) \times P(H_BA)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.05 \times 0.15}{P(E)} = \frac{0.0075}{P(E)}
  \]

- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
  \[
  P(H_AVS|E) = \frac{P(E|H_AVS) \times P(H_AVS)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.7 \times 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.07}{P(E)}
  \]

When comparing these:
\[
\frac{P(H_AVS|E)}{P(H_BA|E)} = \frac{0.07 / P(E)}{0.0075 / P(E)} = \frac{0.07}{0.0075} \approx 9.33
\]

This shows \(P(H_AVS|E)\) is much larger than \(P(H_BA|E)\).

For actual probabilities normalized to simpler scales, let's put subjective values based on proportions:

- **Business Administration**:
  \[
  P(H_BA|E) \approx 0.1
  \]

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  \[
  P(H_AVS|E) \approx 0.8
  \]

Here's the format as requested:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These values are illustrative and show that given Adam's personality sketch, it is far more probable for him to be in the Agricultural and Veterinary Science field than in Business Administration.
