Based on the personality sketch of Adam, we can make educated guesses about the probabilities concerning these fields of study. Let's break down the thinking process.

1. **For Business Administration:**
    - **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration. Business administration is a common graduate program, so without additional info, let's assume P(H) = 0.1.
    - **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is in business administration. Traits like a genuine curiosity about nature, a deep love for animals, and strong empathy are less typical for someone in business administration, but not impossible. So, I would put this lower, around 0.2.
    - **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch if he is not in business administration. Given the traits, this is higher because these could align more naturally with many other fields such as environmental science, biology, etc. So, I would estimate this to be around 0.8.
  
    By Bayes' theorem: 
    \[
    P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
    \]
    \[
    P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.8 \cdot 0.9}
    \]
    \[
    P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.72} \approx 0.027
    \]

2. **For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
    - **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's interests, it's reasonable to assume this field might align well with his traits, so let's say P(H) = 0.05.
    - **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is in agricultural and veterinary science. This is quite high given his love for animals, nature, and puzzles, so I would estimate this to be around 0.8.
    - **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. While these traits also align with fields like environmental science or biology, let's set this at 0.5 as these fields might generally be good fits.

    By Bayes' theorem: 
    \[
    P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
    \]
    \[
    P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.5 \cdot 0.95}
    \]
    \[
    P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.475} \approx 0.078
    \]

Thus, the approximate posterior probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": 0.027,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.078
}
