To determine the likelihood that Adam was enrolled in the specified fields, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Let’s go through the information provided and assign probabilities accordingly.

### Important Definitions:
- \( H_{\text{ag}} \): Hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( H_{\text{ba}} \): Hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( E \): Personality sketch of Adam.

### Given Probabilities:
- \( P(H_{\text{ag}}) \): Prior probability that any randomly chosen graduate student was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021.
- \( P(H_{\text{ba}}) \): Prior probability that any randomly chosen graduate student was enrolled in business administration in 2021.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{ag}}) \): Probability of Adam’s personality traits given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) \): Probability of Adam’s personality traits given that he is enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{ag}}) \): Probability of Adam’s personality traits given that he is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{ba}}) \): Probability of Adam’s personality traits given that he is not enrolled in business administration.

### Conditional Probabilities:
Based on Adam's personality traits, we can reasonably estimate:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{ag}}) \): High, because his love for nature, animals, and his empathetic disposition aligns well with this field. We assume a high value, e.g., 0.8.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{ag}}) \): Lower, as those characteristics are less prevalent outside this specific field. We assume a value, e.g., 0.2.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) \): Lower, as the personality traits described are less typical for someone in this field. We assume a lower value, e.g., 0.2.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{ba}}) \): Higher relative to P(E|H_{\text{ba}}), as Adam’s traits are more common in non-business students. We assume a value, e.g., 0.6.

### Prior Probabilities:
We use approximate priors for graduate fields to be judicious but don't need exact numbers.

- \( P(H_{\text{ag}}) \): Let’s assume a moderate likelihood for agriculture and vet science, e.g., 0.1.
- \( P(H_{\text{ba}}) \): Business administration would have a higher base rate, e.g., 0.3. 

### Bayes Rule Calculation:
\( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \)

We approximate \( P(E) \):
\( P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{ag}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ag}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{ag}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{ag}}) \)
\( P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) = 0.08 + 0.18 = 0.26 \)

Similarly for business administration:
\( P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.3) + (0.6 \cdot 0.7) = 0.06 + 0.42 = 0.48 \)

Now apply Bayes’ Rule:
- For agricultural and veterinary science:
  \( P(H_{\text{ag}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{ag}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ag}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.26} \approx 0.3077 \)

- For business administration:
  \( P(H_{\text{ba}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ba}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{0.48} \approx 0.125 \)

Thus, the answer can be given as:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3077,
  "business administration": 0.125
}
```
