To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, you'll need an estimate of \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Given the information provided about Adam, we can hypothesize the following judgments:

For **business administration**:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of being a graduate student in this field. Business administration is a common field, but does not align closely with Adam's interests in nature, animals, and puzzles.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is in business administration, which may be low since his traits do not strongly align with this field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is NOT in business administration, incorporating all other fields.

For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of being a graduate student in this field. Given Adam's interests and empathy towards animals, this field is a potential strong fit.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is in agricultural and veterinary science, which is likely high.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is NOT in agricultural and veterinary science, covering all other fields.

The calculations of \( P(H|E) \) through Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, let's assign rough estimates based on qualitative analysis:

{
  "business administration": 
  \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \)
  \( P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \)
  \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.8 \)

  **Calculation**:
  \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.3}{(0.2 \times 0.3 + 0.8 \times 0.7)} \approx 0.097 \)

  Result: approx \(0.097\)
}

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 
  \( P(H) \approx 0.05 \)
  \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \)
  \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.15 \)

  **Calculation**:
  \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{(0.8 \times 0.05 + 0.15 \times 0.95)} \approx 0.219\)
  
  Result: approx \(0.219\)
}

So, based on these qualitative estimates, we have the following probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.097,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.219
}
