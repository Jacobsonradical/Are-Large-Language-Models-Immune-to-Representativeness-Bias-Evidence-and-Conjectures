To compute the likelihood that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields based on the personality sketch using Bayes' rule, we will assign some hypothetical probabilities. 

Let's break down the symbols:

- \(P(H)\): Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the specified field.
- \(P(E|H)\): Likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in the specified field.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): Likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in the specified field.
- \(P(H|E)\): Posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the specified field given the personality sketch.

Starting with some reasonable assumptions:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- \(P(H)\): Let's assume a moderate probability for Adam to be in this field due to its direct relevance to his interests in nature, plants, and animals. Let's assign this a probability of 0.3.
- \(P(E|H)\): Given that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science, the likelihood of observing his personality sketch seems high due to the specific relevance. We might assign this a probability of 0.9.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The likelihood of observing his personality sketch if he is not in this field might be lower. We can assign this a probability of 0.2.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))} \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.3}{0.9 \cdot 0.3 + 0.2 \cdot 0.7} = \frac{0.27}{0.27 + 0.14} = \frac{0.27}{0.41} \approx 0.6585 \]

### Business Administration:
- \(P(H)\): This field seems less relevant to Adam's interests and personality sketch. Let's assume a lower probability, say 0.1.
- \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood of observing his personality sketch given that he is in business administration might be lower. We might assign this a probability of 0.2.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The likelihood of observing his personality sketch if he is not in business administration might be higher. We can assign this a probability of 0.8.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))} \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.8 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.72} = \frac{0.02}{0.74} \approx 0.0270 \]

Therefore, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6585,
  "business administration": 0.0270
}
