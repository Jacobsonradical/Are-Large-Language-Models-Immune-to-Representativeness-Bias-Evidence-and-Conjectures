To answer the question, we need to use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \), the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch \( E \). Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) normalizes the probabilities, it does not need to be explicitly calculated for a comparative analysis between different fields. We assume some rough estimations for these probabilities to make a judgment.

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability of being enrolled in Business Administration. Let's assume it is relatively common (e.g., 0.2 or 20%).
- \( P(E|H) \): Probability of personality sketch \( E \) given enrollment in Business Administration. Given that Business Administration does not particularly align with his interests and attributes (i.e., nature, animals, puzzles), this might be low (e.g., 0.1 or 10%).
- \( P(E| \neg H) \): Probability of personality sketch \( E \) given not being enrolled in Business Administration. Considering there are many other fields where this sketch fits better, this has to be higher (e.g., 0.8 or 80%).

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \approx 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability of being enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. This is less common than business but plausible given Adam's traits (e.g., 0.1 or 10%).
- \( P(E|H) \): Probability of personality sketch \( E \) given enrollment in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. It aligns very well with his curiosity about nature and love for animals (e.g., 0.9 or 90%).
- \( P(E| \neg H) \): Probability of personality sketch \( E \) given not being enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Still, fairly wide, as many fields can match the personality traits (e.g., 0.3 or 30%).

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \approx 0.9 \times 0.1 = 0.09 \]

### Conclusion
Given the above analysis, the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in each field given his personality sketch can be judged as follows (normalized for comparison):

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.09
}
