To compute \(\mathbf{P(H|E)}\) for each of the given fields using Bayes' Rule, we need three pieces of information for each hypothesis (\(H\)):
1. \(\mathbf{P(H)}\): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
2. \(\mathbf{P(E|H)}\): The probability of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
3. \(\mathbf{P(E|\neg H)}\): The probability of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.

Bayes' Rule is given by:
\[ \mathbf{P(H|E)} = \frac{\mathbf{P(E|H)} \cdot \mathbf{P(H)}}{\mathbf{P(E)}} \]
where,
\[ \mathbf{P(E)} = \mathbf{P(E|H)} \cdot \mathbf{P(H)} + \mathbf{P(E|\neg H)} \cdot \mathbf{P(\neg H)} \]

### Calculations and Reasoning

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **\(\mathbf{P(H)}\)**: The probability that Adam was enrolled in this field, based on general graduate enrollment statistics.
  - Let’s assume it is \(\mathbf{0.05}\) (since the field is relatively specialized compared to others).

- **\(\mathbf{P(E|H)}\)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he was enrolled in this field.
  - Given Adam’s interests in nature, plants, and animals, his empathy, and appreciation for hard work, this fits very well. Let’s set it at \(\mathbf{0.8}\).

- **\(\mathbf{P(E|\neg H)}\)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he was not enrolled in this field.
  - Since many fields other than agricultural and veterinary science could still align with some of Adam's traits, let’s estimate it at \(\mathbf{0.2}\).

Using these values:
\[ \mathbf{P(E)} = (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95) = 0.04 + 0.19 = 0.23 \]

\[ \mathbf{P(H|E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.23} = \frac{0.04}{0.23} \approx 0.174 \]

#### Business Administration
- **\(\mathbf{P(H)}\)**: The probability that Adam was enrolled in this field, based on general graduate enrollment statistics.
  - Let’s assume it is \(\mathbf{0.15}\) (as business administration is a more common field).

- **\(\mathbf{P(E|H)}\)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he was enrolled in this field.
  - Considering that business administration doesn’t align as closely with Adam's interests in nature and animals, let’s set it at \(\mathbf{0.1}\).

- **\(\mathbf{P(E|\neg H)}\)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he was not enrolled in this field.
  - This could be similar to the estimation for agricultural and veterinary science, so let’s use \(\mathbf{0.2}\).

Using these values:
\[ \mathbf{P(E)} = (0.1 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) = 0.015 + 0.17 = 0.185 \]

\[ \mathbf{P(H|E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{0.185} = \frac{0.015}{0.185} \approx 0.081 \]

### Results

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.174,
  "business administration": 0.081
}
```

These values reflect the posterior probabilities that Adam was enrolled in these respective fields, given his personality sketch.
