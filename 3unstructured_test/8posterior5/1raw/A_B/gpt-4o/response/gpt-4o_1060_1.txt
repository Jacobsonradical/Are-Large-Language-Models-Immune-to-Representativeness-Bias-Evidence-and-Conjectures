Let's go through the process step-by-step. For each field, we need to estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Then, we'll use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \), which is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch \( E \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Assuming limited prior information, let's use a moderate value. I'll assume prior probabilities are roughly equal across various graduate fields, so I'll use 0.1 for simplicity.
- **P(E|H):** The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given he's in this field. Given his love for nature, plants, and animals, and his intelligence, this field seems very aligned with his interests. I'll set this high, say 0.8.
- **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of observing these traits given he's not in this field. Considering there are many other fields where curiosity about nature, empathy, and intelligence might play a role, I'll estimate this to be moderate, say 0.2.

Now, using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, \( P(E) \) is common for all fields and can be considered as a normalizing factor. For relative comparison, we can simplify and consider the ratio:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]

### Business Administration
- **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration. Using the same prior assumptions, I'll use 0.1 for simplicity.
- **P(E|H):** The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given he's in this field. This doesnâ€™t align strongly with Adam's characteristics like love for animals and nature, but intelligence and problem-solving might be useful. I'll set this relatively low, say 0.2.
- **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of observing these traits given he's not in this field. More likely to observe these traits outside business administration, so I'll keep 0.2 the same.

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.1 = 0.02 \]

### Results in Normalized Format
To provide the normalized posterior probabilities, we consider the sum of all calculated probabilities and normalize accordingly. The total is:
\[ 0.08 + 0.02 = 0.10 \]

Thus:
\[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.10} = 0.8 \]
\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.10} = 0.2 \]
