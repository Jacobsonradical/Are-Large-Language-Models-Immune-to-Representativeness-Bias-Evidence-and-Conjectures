To compute the probabilities using Bayes' rule, we'll start by gathering our initial thoughts:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field. Without specific demographic data about the proportion of students in each field, we will assume a uniform prior, so P(agricultural and veterinary science) and P(business administration) are both equal initially. Let's assume each has a prior probability of 0.1 for simplicity.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in the field. This measures how well Adam's characteristics match with students typically found in each field.
    - **Agricultural and veterinary science**: Given his love for nature, plants, and animals, the probability that E fits H is very high. Let's assign P(E|H) = 0.8.
    - **Business administration**: Matching the traits with business administration, it is less likely but not entirely dismissive. Adam's empathy and intelligence might still fit, but his deep love for nature is not a classic fit. We'll assign P(E|H) = 0.2.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in the field. This is more challenging because it encompasses all other fields. As an estimate:
    - For agricultural and veterinary science, if Adam wasn't in this field, other science/nature-related fields would still make this fit likely. Let's assign P(E|\neg H) = 0.2.
    - For business administration, we assume there's still a small probability he could have these traits in other fields too. Let's assign P(E|\neg H) more generically, let's say 0.5.

Now, using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
- \( P(H) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.9 \)

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) = 0.08 + 0.18 = 0.26 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.26} = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \approx 0.3077 \]

For **business administration**:
- \( P(H) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.9 \)

\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.5 \cdot 0.9) = 0.02 + 0.45 = 0.47 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.47} = \frac{0.02}{0.47} \approx 0.0426 \]

So, the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in those fields given his personality sketch can be approximated as:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3077,
  "business administration": 0.0426
}
```
