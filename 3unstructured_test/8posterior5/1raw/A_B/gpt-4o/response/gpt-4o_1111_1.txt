To use Bayes' rule, we need to assess the probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field. Here's the step-by-step calculation for each field:

1. **Business Administration (BA)**
    - **\( P(H_{BA}) \)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration. A rough estimate could be the general proportion of graduate students in business administration versus other fields. Let's assume \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.2 \).
    - **\( P(E|H_{BA}) \)**: The likelihood of Adam having his personality traits given that he is studying business administration. Business administration is typically not strongly associated with nature, plants, or animals, so let's assume \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.05 \).
    - **\( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \)**: The likelihood of Adam having his personality traits given that he is not studying business administration. This would be influenced by the probability of his personality traits across all other fields, which seems higher than if he were in business administration. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.8 \).

    Using Bayes' rule:
    \[
    P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \cdot P(\neg H_{BA})}
    \]
    \[
    P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.2}{0.05 \cdot 0.2 + 0.8 \cdot 0.8} \approx \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.64} \approx \frac{0.01}{0.65} \approx 0.015
    \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS)**
    - **\( P(H_{AVS}) \)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Considering the specific focus, let's assume \( P(H_{AVS}) = 0.1 \).
    - **\( P(E|H_{AVS}) \)**: The likelihood of Adam having his personality traits given that he is studying Agricultural and Veterinary Science. His traits are very compatible with this field. Let's assume \( P(E|H_{AVS}) = 0.9 \).
    - **\( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \)**: The likelihood of Adam having his personality traits given that he is not studying Agricultural and Veterinary Science. This would be similar to our earlier \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \approx 0.6 \).

    Using Bayes' rule:
    \[
    P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) + P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \cdot P(\neg H_{AVS})}
    \]
    \[
    P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{0.9 \cdot 0.1 + 0.6 \cdot 0.9} \approx \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.54} \approx \frac{0.09}{0.63} \approx 0.143
    \]

Thus, based on the outlined estimations, the values are:

{
  "business administration": 0.015,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.143
}
