First, let's outline the process:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field. Without additional demographic data on graduate fields of specialization, it is reasonable to assume that both fields have a somewhat equal chance among various fields, but we can consider that agricultural and veterinary science might slightly edge out due to Adam's personality sketch.

2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in a particular field. Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy strongly suggest that he would be likely to be in agricultural and veterinary science rather than business administration.

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in a particular field.

Let's assign reasonable estimates for these probabilities.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: Higher likelihood because of the alignment with nature and animals:
   - P(H) = 0.3

2. **P(E|H)**: Adam's traits strongly align with this field:
   - P(E|H) = 0.8

3. **P(E|¬H)**: Adam's traits are less likely if he is not in this field, but still possible for other related fields:
   - P(E|¬H) = 0.2

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.3) + (0.2 \cdot 0.7) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.24 + 0.14 = 0.38 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.3}{0.38} \]
\[ P(H|E) ≈ 0.63 \]

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: Lower likelihood given Adam's personality traits:
   - P(H) = 0.1

2. **P(E|H)**: Adam's traits are less likely in business administration:
   - P(E|H) = 0.1

3. **P(E|¬H)**: Other fields have more likelihood to align with Adam's traits:
   - P(E|¬H) = 0.3

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.01 + 0.27 = 0.28 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.28} \]
\[ P(H|E) ≈ 0.036 \]

Based on the above calculations, we have:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.63,
  "business administration": 0.036
}
```
