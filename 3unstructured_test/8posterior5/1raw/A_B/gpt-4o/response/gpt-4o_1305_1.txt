Sure, let's break it down step by step using Bayes' Theorem. We know the following relationships:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a certain field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of Adam having the given personality sketch assuming he was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of Adam having the given personality sketch.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of Adam having the personality sketch assuming he was not in that field.

**Estimating the probabilities:**

For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
- Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \) (in the context that it's one specialized field among many).
- Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \) because the traits align well with interests in nature, animals, and empathy.
- Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) \) is lower, maybe \( 0.2 \).

For **business administration**:
- Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
- Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \) because some traits like intelligence and appreciation for hard work can align, but not necessarily traits related to nature and animals.
- Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \).

Since directly computing \( P(E) \) involves summing over all possible fields, we can just use it as the normalizing constant to compare the two fields. 

**Calculating \( P(H|E) \)**:

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

For business administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \]

Comparing these ratios (and ignoring \( P(E) \) for normalization):

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.08}{P(E)} \]

For business administration:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} = \frac{0.03}{P(E)} \]

Normalizing the results:

Total = 0.08 + 0.03 = 0.11

Normalized probabilities:

Agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.11} \approx 0.727 \]

Business administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.11} \approx 0.273 \]

Thus, in the required format:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.727,
  "business administration": 0.273
}
```
This suggests that, given Adam's personality sketch, it is more likely that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration.
