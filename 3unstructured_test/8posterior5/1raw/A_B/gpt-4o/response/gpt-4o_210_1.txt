Let's consider each hypothesis individually:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his interest in nature, plants, and animals, let's assume a relatively moderate prior probability:
     - P(H) = 0.3
   - **P(E|H)**: This is the probability that Adam's personality sketch fits given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. His attributes strongly match this field:
     - P(E|H) = 0.9
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: This is the probability that Adam's personality sketch fits given that he is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given the generality of some of his traits, it's possible he could fit other fields as well, though not as strongly:
     - P(E|\neg H) = 0.2

   Using Bayes' Rule:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.3}{0.9 \cdot 0.3 + 0.2 \cdot 0.7} = \frac{0.27}{0.27 + 0.14} = \frac{0.27}{0.41} \approx 0.6585
   \]

2. **Business Administration**:
   - **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Based on the given personality sketch, this does not seem like a very likely field for Adam:
     - P(H) = 0.1
   - **P(E|H)**: This is the probability that Adamâ€™s personality sketch fits given that he is enrolled in business administration. His personality traits do not strongly align with the typical attributes associated with this field:
     - P(E|H) = 0.1
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: This is the probability that Adam's personality sketch fits given that he is not enrolled in business administration. As before, he could fit other fields:
     - P(E|\neg H) = 0.3

   Using Bayes' Rule:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.1 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.27} = \frac{0.01}{0.28} \approx 0.0357
   \]

Thus, the results are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6585,
  "business administration": 0.0357
}
