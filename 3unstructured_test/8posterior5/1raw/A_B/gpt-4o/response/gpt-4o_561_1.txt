First, let's judge the probabilities and then use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probabilities.

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
1. **P(H):** The probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Assuming that this field accounts for a certain percentage of all graduate fields (let's say 5% or 0.05), but considering his interests and qualities, we can give it a higher initial probability such as 0.2.

2. **P(E|H):** The probability of observing the personality traits E given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy, this probability would be reasonably high, say 0.8.

3. **P(E|¬H):** The probability of observing the personality traits E given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Considering that these specific traits align quite well with agricultural and veterinary science, this probability might be lower, say 0.2.

### For Business Administration:
1. **P(H):** The probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Assuming that business administration accounts for a larger percentage of all graduate fields (let's say 20% or 0.2), but his personality traits do not align well with this field, we might reduce this initial probability, say 0.1.

2. **P(E|H):** The probability of observing the personality traits E given that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Given his specific traits, this probability would be relatively low, say 0.1.

3. **P(E|¬H):** The probability of observing the personality traits E given that Adam was not enrolled in business administration. Since these traits do not align well with business administration, it might be higher, say 0.3.

### Applying Bayes' Rule:

P(H|E) = [ P(E|H) * P(H) ] / [ P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|¬H) * P(¬H) ]

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
P(H|E) = [ 0.8 * 0.2 ] / [ 0.8 * 0.2 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.2) ]
        = 0.16 / [ 0.16 + 0.2 * 0.8 ]
        = 0.16 / [ 0.16 + 0.16 ]
        = 0.16 / 0.32
        = 0.5

For **Business Administration**:
P(H|E) = [ 0.1 * 0.1 ] / [ 0.1 * 0.1 + 0.3 * (1 - 0.1) ]
        = 0.01 / [ 0.01 + 0.3 * 0.9 ]
        = 0.01 / [ 0.01 + 0.27 ]
        = 0.01 / 0.28
        = 0.0357 (approximately 0.036)

### Final Answers:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.036
}
