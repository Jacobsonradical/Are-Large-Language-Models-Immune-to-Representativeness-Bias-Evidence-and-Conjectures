To answer your question, we'll use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.

We are given no specific numbers, so we will need to make some plausible assumptions based on typical characteristics of graduate students in these fields.

### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H):** This is the prior probability that Adam is in this field. Let's assume that this field attracts a reasonable fraction of students but not the majority. So we might estimate \( P(H) \) at approximately \(0.05\).

- **P(E|H):** The personality sketch aligns strongly with characteristics we might expect in this field (e.g., love for nature, animals, and understanding of dedication). Let's set this high, say \(0.7\).

- **P(E|\neg H):** This is the chance of having a personality sketch like Adam's if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Considering that not all other fields demand such specific traits, we'll estimate this somewhat lower, at \(0.1\).

### 2. Business Administration

- **P(H):** This is the prior probability that Adam is in this field. Business administration might attract a larger number of students. Let’s estimate it at \(0.10\).

- **P(E|H):** The personality sketch does not strongly align with the usual characteristics required for business administration which often focuses on leadership, management, and organizational skills. Let’s set this lower, at \(0.2\).

- **P(E|\neg H):** This is the chance of having a personality sketch like Adam's if he is not in business administration. Considering Adam’s traits are more fitted to other academic fields, we'll estimate it higher than the prior, say \(0.15\).

### Bayesian Calculation

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H) = 0.05 \]
\[ P(E|H) = 0.7 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \]
\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95 \]

\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.05) + (0.1 \cdot 0.95) = 0.035 + 0.095 = 0.13 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{0.13} \approx 0.269 \]

For business administration:
\[ P(H) = 0.10 \]
\[ P(E|H) = 0.2 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.15 \]
\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90 \]

\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.10) + (0.15 \cdot 0.90) = 0.02 + 0.135 = 0.155 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.10}{0.155} \approx 0.129 \]

So we would have:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.269,
  "business administration": 0.129
}
```
