To utilize Bayes' rule to find the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to evaluate the following components:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in that field.

We can largely rely on context-based reasoning, as we lack specific numerical data. Here is a structured approach to approximate these probabilities:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
   - We need to estimate the likelihood that a graduate student is in a specific field. For simplicity, assume equal priors, as we don't have specific data indicating otherwise:
     - \( P(\text{business administration}) \approx 0.5 \)
     - \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.5 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   - \( P(E|\text{business administration}) \): Adam’s traits (e.g., love for nature, empathy for animals) don’t strongly align with what is typically expected from business administration students. This can be relatively low.
     - Estimate: \( P(E|\text{business administration}) \approx 0.1 \)
   - \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \): Adam’s traits align well with subjects focusing on nature and animals. This probability is higher.
     - Estimate: \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.9 \)

3. **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   - This represents the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch across all other potential fields of graduate study.
   - Given that we are considering only two fields:
     - \( P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) = P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \) and vice versa.

Now, applying Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(H) \cdot P(E|H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be expressed in terms of the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) + P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \]

Calculation details (assuming equal priors of 0.5 for simplicity):

\[ P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.5 + 0.9 \cdot 0.5 = 0.05 + 0.45 = 0.5 \]

Now calculate \( P(H|E) \):

1. **For Business Administration:**
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.1}{0.5} = 0.1 \]

2. **For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.9}{0.5} = 0.9 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.9"
}
