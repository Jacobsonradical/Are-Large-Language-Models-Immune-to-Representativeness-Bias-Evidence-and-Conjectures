To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the given fields using Bayes' rule, I'll break down the reasoning for each field.

### Definitions
- \( H: \) Hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
- \( E: \) The personality sketch of Adam.
- \( \neg H: \) Hypothesis that Adam was not enrolled in that specific field.

### Bayes' Rule
Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

### Normalizing Factor
For simplicity, let's note that \( P(E) \) is a normalizing factor which ensures the probabilities sum to 1 across all possible fields. Here, since we restrict our evaluation to two fields mentioned and given the personality sketch, we can focus on the relative probabilities and then normalize:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{1}) \cdot P(H_{1}) + P(E|H_{2}) \cdot P(H_{2}) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For simplification, we examine \( P(E|H_{\text{field}}) \) and relative comparisons.

### Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)
We must take into account common distributions:
- Graduate students in business administration are common.
- Fewer students enroll in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration.

Let's assume:
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.2 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.05 \]

### Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \)
We analyze the match of Adam's personality with each field:
- Business Administration: Some elements like intelligence might fit, but his deep love for nature and animals, and his empathy for hard work in natural environments don’t align well.
\[ P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.1 \]

- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Adam's love for nature, plants, animals, and empathy align very well with this field.
\[ P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.7 \]

### Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)
Given Adam’s traits, other fields less tied to nature or animals might not be very likely. We'll estimate:
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.2 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.3 \]

### Calculations

Adjusting for only these two fields:

\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) P(H_{\text{business administration}}) + P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \]

Simplified Expression:
\[ \text{For Business Administration:} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) P(H_{\text{business administration}})}{P(E)} \]

\[ \text{For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})}{P(E)} \]

Given:
\[ 
P(E) \approx (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.7 \cdot 0.05) = 0.02 + 0.035 = 0.055 
\]

Thus:
\[ 
P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.055} = 0.3636 
\]

\[ 
P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{0.055} = 0.6364 
\]

  "business administration": 0.3636,
