To solve this problem using Bayes' theorem, we will evaluate the probability of Adam being enrolled in each field given his personality sketch.

Firstly, let's denote the necessary probabilities:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality given he was enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality given he was not enrolled in that specific field.
- \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in the field given his personality.

We will calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For this exercise, we will use the given context to give reasonable estimates for these probabilities.

### Business Administration
1. **Prior Probability** (\( P(H) \)): Let's assume that 15% of graduate students are enrolled in business administration programs.
   \[ P(H) = 0.15 \]
   
2. **Likelihood** (\( P(E|H) \)): The personality sketch of Adam seems less typical for this field, which often attracts individuals who are more extroverted and interested in finance or management rather than nature. Let's estimate a relatively low likelihood: 
   \[ P(E|H) = 0.1 \]
   
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is not in business administration. Given that other fields might suit his described interests better, this should be higher:
   \[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \]
   
Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{0.4} = 0.0375 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **Prior Probability** (\( P(H) \)): Let's assume that 5% of graduate students are enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science programs.
   \[ P(H) = 0.05 \]
   
2. **Likelihood** (\( P(E|H) \)): Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science studies.
   \[ P(E|H) = 0.8 \]
   
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Since many other fields may not align as well, we estimate:
   \[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \]
   
Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.2} = 0.2 \]

Based on these calculations, the estimates are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0375,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.2
}
