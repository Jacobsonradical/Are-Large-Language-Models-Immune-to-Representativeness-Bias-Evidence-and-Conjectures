Sure, let's begin by establishing tentative probabilities for each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science (Field 1)
- **P(H)**: This is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam’s curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, this is likely to be relatively high.
- **P(E|H)**: This is the probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given that he is in this field. Adam's empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align well with this field.
- **P(E|¬H)**: Given the broad range of graduate fields, the probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch without him being in agricultural and veterinary science should be lower.

### Business Administration (Field 2)
- **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration. This is generally lower since the personality traits described seem less aligned with a business-focused field.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch if he were in this field would be lower since his traits do not strongly align with business administration.
- **P(E|¬H)**: This could be higher because the personality traits described for Adam could align with many non-business-related fields.

### Estimation
Let's assign tentative probabilities:

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- **P(H)**: 0.3 
- **P(E|H)**: 0.8 
- **P(E|¬H)**: 0.2 

Bayes’ Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 + 0.2 \cdot 0.7 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.24 + 0.14 = 0.38 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.3}{0.38} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.6316 \]

#### Business Administration:
- **P(H)**: 0.05 
- **P(E|H)**: 0.1 
- **P(E|¬H)**: 0.4 

Bayes’ Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.05 + 0.4 \cdot 0.95 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.005 + 0.38 = 0.385 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.05}{0.385} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.013 \]
