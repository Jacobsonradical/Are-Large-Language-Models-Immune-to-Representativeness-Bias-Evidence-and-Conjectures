To solve this using Bayes' theorem, we'll need to estimate the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the complements \( P(E|\neg H) \) for the fields specified. Based on the personality sketch and relevance to each field, let's make some reasoned estimates.

Let's go step by step:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The chances of Adam being in each field, without knowing his personality sketch.
    - \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \)
    - \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \)

    Let's assume that the proportion of graduate students in "agricultural and veterinary science" and "business administration" reflects the national average for simplicity.

    - Approximate percentage of graduate students in agricultural and veterinary science: 10%
    - Approximate percentage of graduate students in business administration: 20%

    Thus, we can use:
    - \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.10 \)
    - \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.20 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The conditional probabilities of the personality sketch given each field.
    - \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \)
    - \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \)

    Adam's traits, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, understanding of abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work, seem highly aligned with "agricultural and veterinary science" but somewhat less so with "business administration".

    Let's reasonably estimate:
    - \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.70 \)
    - \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.30 \)

3. **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The conditional probabilities of the personality sketch given he is not in each field.
    - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \)
    - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business administration}}) \)

    Assume that many other fields do not align well with Adam's traits, but there are still fields that could potentially fit.
    
    Simplistically:
    - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.20 \)
    - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.30 \)
  
Using Bayes' theorem \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \), where:

\( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Now, we can calculate:

**For agricultural and veterinary science**:
- \( P(E) = (0.70 \times 0.10) + (0.20 \times 0.90) \)
- \( P(E) = 0.07 + 0.18 = 0.25 \)

- \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{0.70 \times 0.10}{0.25} = \frac{0.07}{0.25} = 0.28 \)

**For business administration**:
- \( P(E) = (0.30 \times 0.20) + (0.30 \times 0.80) \)
- \( P(E) = 0.06 + 0.24 = 0.30 \)

- \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{0.30 \times 0.20}{0.30} = \frac{0.06}{0.30} = 0.20 \)

Therefore, the final probabilities \( P(H|E) \) are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.28,
  "business administration": 0.20
}
```
