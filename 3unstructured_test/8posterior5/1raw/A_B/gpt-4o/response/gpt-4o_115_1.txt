To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we use the following formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For each hypothesis \( H \), we need to estimate:
1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field of study.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given he is in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given he is not in that field.
4. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing Adam's personality traits.

Since \( P(E) \) remains constant for all hypotheses in this context (it acts as a normalizing constant), we'll focus more on the proportionality \( P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

Let's make reasonable estimates based on Adam's personality traits and then calculate the relative likelihoods:

- **Prior Probability Estimates \(P(H)\):**
  - **Business Administration:** This is a relatively common field with a moderate prior probability for any given graduate student, but it might be less likely for someone with Adam's personality traits that suggest a preference for nature and animals.
  - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Given Adam's interests in nature, plants, and animals, there is a higher prior probability for this field.

- **Likelihood Estimates \(P(E|H)\):**
  - **Business Administration:** A typical business administration student might not necessarily have strong empathy for animals or an interest in nature. The likelihood of \(E\) given \(H\) is lower here.
  - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** This field directly aligns with Adam’s traits, making it highly likely that if Adam were in this field, he would exhibit those traits.

- **Calculation:**
  - Let's assume for simplicity \( P(H) \) for business administration is 0.1 and for agricultural and veterinary science is 0.3 (given Adam's clear fit for the latter).
  - Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) for business administration as 0.05 (since his traits don’t align well) and for agricultural and veterinary science as 0.8 (since his traits are highly compatible).

Given these estimates, for normalization purposes, we will only be interested in the relative values:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

For business administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.05 \cdot 0.1 = 0.005 \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \]

To convert these into probabilities, we would typically need to normalize them, but since we're comparing relative values, we leave them in the proportional form.

Thus, the approximate probability estimates become:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.005,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.24
}
```

These values provide a relative measure of likelihood for Adam's enrollment in each field based on his personality sketch.
