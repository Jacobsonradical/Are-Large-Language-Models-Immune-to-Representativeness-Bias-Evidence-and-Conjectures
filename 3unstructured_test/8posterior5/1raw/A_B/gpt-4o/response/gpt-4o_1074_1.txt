Let's break down the steps to calculate the posterior probabilities using Bayes' Rule:

1. **P(H)**:
   - This is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field before considering his personality sketch.
   
2. **P(E|H)**:
   - This is the probability of the evidence (Adam's personality sketch) given that he is enrolled in a particular field.
   
3. **P(E|\neg H)**:
   - This is the probability of the evidence given that Adam is not enrolled in that particular field. Since there are many fields, this can be complex to estimate accurately, but it would generally be lower because many fields would not match his interests and skills as well.

4. **Bayes Rule**:
   - The posterior probability \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \).

Given:
- **P(H)**: For simplicity, let's assume that in the overall student population, each field has an equal chance of being selected. But we will weigh these by typical enrollment numbers and the likelihood that Adam might select these based on his traits.
- **P(E|H)**: Higher for fields that align well with Adam's traits.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Lower because many fields wouldn't align as well with Adam's traits.

Now, based on Adam's personality sketch:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- **P(H)**: Let's assume P(H) is moderate (around 0.1 to 0.2) as it's not the most common but not rare either.
- **P(E|H)**: High, given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals. Let's say 0.8.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Given the wide range of other fields, many of which don't align well with Adam's characteristics, this could be approximately 0.2.
  
Calculating \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since calculating \( P(E) \) requires a complete enumeration of all possible fields, we simplify relative calculations.
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.4} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.4} \approx 0.3 \]

### Business Administration:
- **P(H)**: Assuming it's a common field (0.3 to 0.4).
- **P(E|H)**: Lower because business traits don't closely match - maybe 0.1.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Given his traits, a lot of alternate possibilities align better than business. So, let's say 0.4.

Calculating \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.35}{0.7} \approx \frac{0.035}{0.7} \approx 0.05 \]

Thus, our estimates are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.05
}
