To compute the probabilities using Bayes' rule, we follow these steps:

1. **P(H)** - The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a certain field.
2. **P(E|H)** - The probability of observing E (Adam's personality sketch) given that Adam was enrolled in that specific field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)** - The probability of observing E given that Adam was not enrolled in that specific field.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be derived from the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

However, our calculation simplifies to a relative comparison as we don't need the absolute values.

Here are the values based on the given sketch:

1. **Business Administration**
   - **P(H)**: We would expect this to be relatively low given Adam's non-business oriented traits, perhaps 0.05 (5%).
   - **P(E|H)**: This would be quite low. The traits described don't align traditionally with business administration interests. 0.01 (1%).
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: Many non-business students could have similar traits, so this is relatively high. Suppose 0.3 (30%).

   Using Bayes' Rule:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} 
           = \frac{0.01 \cdot 0.05}{0.01 \cdot 0.05 + 0.3 \cdot 0.95} 
           = \frac{0.0005}{0.0005 + 0.285} 
           = \frac{0.0005}{0.2855} 
           \approx 0.00175
   \]
   So, P(H|E) for business administration is approximately 0.00175.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - **P(H)**: We would expect this to be higher given Adam's traits, perhaps 0.2 (20%).
   - **P(E|H)**: This would be relatively high because the traits strongly align with interests in this field, say 0.8 (80%).
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: Slightly lower because fewer non-Agri/Vet students would fit this profile. Suppose 0.1 (10%).

   Using Bayes' Rule:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} 
           = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{0.8 \cdot 0.2 + 0.1 \cdot 0.8} 
           = \frac{0.16}{0.16 + 0.08} 
           = \frac{0.16}{0.24} 
           \approx 0.6667
   \]
   So, P(H|E) for agricultural and veterinary science is approximately 0.6667.

Therefore, considering the personality sketch provided:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.00175,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6667
}
