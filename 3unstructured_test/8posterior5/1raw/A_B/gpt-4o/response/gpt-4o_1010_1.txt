To apply Bayes' rule in determining P(H|E) for each hypothesis, we need to consider the prior probabilities P(H), the likelihoods P(E|H), and the likelihoods of E assuming H is false, P(E|¬H). For the sake of this exercise, we'll make informed guesses based on the description of Adam and general tendencies.

Let's denote the fields:
- H1: Adam enrolled in Business Administration
- H2: Adam enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science

### Step-by-Step Calculation

1. **Prior Probability (P(H))**: 
   - It's generally less common for someone with Adam's described personality to enroll in Business Administration compared to Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
   - P(H1): Let's assume P(H1) = 0.2
   - P(H2): Let's assume P(H2) = 0.4 (higher due to Adam's affinity for nature and animals)

2. **Likelihoods (P(E|H))**:
   - Given Adam's traits, it's less likely for him to be a Business Administration student.
   - P(E|H1): Low, let's assume P(E|H1) = 0.1
   - P(E|H2): High, let's assume P(E|H2) = 0.7

3. **Likelihood of E assuming H is false (P(E|¬H))**:
   - To estimate this, we'd consider the possibility of Adam having those characteristics in any other field.
   - Let P(E|¬H1) = 0.6 (since his personality traits might be somewhat common outside Business Administration)
   - Let P(E|¬H2) = 0.2 (since his personality traits are more common within Agricultural and Veterinary Science compared to other fields)

### Applying Bayes' Rule
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

**For Business Administration (H1)**:
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.6 \cdot 0.8 = 0.02 + 0.48 = 0.50 \]
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.50} = 0.04 \]

**For Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H2)**:
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.4}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = 0.7 \cdot 0.4 + 0.2 \cdot 0.6 = 0.28 + 0.12 = 0.40 \]
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.28}{0.40} = 0.70 \]
