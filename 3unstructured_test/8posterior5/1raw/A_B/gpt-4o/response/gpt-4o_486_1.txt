To estimate the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science \( (H1) \) or business administration \( (H2) \), we will use Bayes' rule and assign reasonable values to prior probabilities \( P(H) \), and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1)

- \( P(H1) \): This is the prior probability that a randomly selected graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Say this is relatively low, as graduate programs are often diversified, but not insignificantâ€”we might assign it 0.05.

- \( P(E|H1) \): This is the probability that Adam has the characteristics described by \( E \) given he is studying agricultural and veterinary science. Given his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and high intelligence, this probability is high. Say, 0.8.

- \( P(E|\neg H1) \): This is the probability that Adam has the characteristics described by \( E \) given he is not studying agricultural and veterinary science. Since these characteristics could still be present in many other fields but are less likely than in agricultural and veterinary science, this might be around 0.2.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1)}{P(E)} \]

We need to calculate \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1) + P(E|\neg H1) \cdot P(\neg H1) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.19 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.23 \]

Now,

\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H1|E) \approx 0.174 \]

### Business Administration (H2)

- \( P(H2) \): This is the prior probability that a randomly selected graduate student is enrolled in business administration. This might be slightly higher due to business programs' popularity, say 0.1.

- \( P(E|H2) \): This is the probability that Adam has the characteristics described by \( E \) given he is studying business administration. Given his interests and personality traits, this is less likely. Say, 0.1.

- \( P(E|\neg H2) \): This is the probability that Adam has the characteristics described by \( E \) given he is not studying business administration. This would be the complement, also approximated as 0.2.

Using the same Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2)}{P(E)} \]

Using the previously calculated \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2) + P(E|\neg H2) \cdot P(\neg H2) \]

Since \( P(E) \) does not change:

\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H2|E) \approx 0.043 \]

  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.174",
  "business administration": "0.043"
