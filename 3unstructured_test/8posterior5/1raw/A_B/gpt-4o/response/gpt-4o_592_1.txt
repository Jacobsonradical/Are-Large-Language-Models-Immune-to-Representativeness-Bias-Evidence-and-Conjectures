To determine the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following values:

1. **P(H)**: The initial probability (prior) that Adam is enrolled in the specific field without knowing the personality sketch \( E \).
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in the specified field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in the specified field.

Bayes' rule formula is:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields when comparing them and it cancels out when calculating relative probabilities, we can use a simplified form:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

### For **business administration**:
- **P(H)**: The general probability of a graduate student being in business administration might be moderately high because it is a common field. Let's assign it a value of 0.15 (15%).
- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch (interest in nature, empathy, love for animals, intelligence focusing on abstract concepts) matches someone in business administration is relatively low. Let's assign it a value of 0.05 (5%).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of Adam having this personality sketch if he is not in business administration would be more reflective of fields that match his interests. Let's give it a value of 0.3 (30%).

### For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
- **P(H)**: The general probability of a graduate student being in agricultural and veterinary science might be lower than business administration given the overall distribution of graduate fields. Let's assign it a value of 0.05 (5%).
- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch matches someone in agricultural and veterinary science is very high, given his interests and empathy towards nature and animals. Let's assign it a value of 0.8 (80%).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science would be lower. Let's assign it a value of 0.1 (10%).

Let's compute:
\[
\text{For business administration: }
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.05 \times 0.15 = 0.0075
\]

\[
\text{For agricultural and veterinary science: }
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \times 0.05 = 0.04
\]

To normalize, we would sum the values and divide each by the sum to get probabilities that sum to 1. However, as requested, we are listing these as independent probabilities without the need for normalization to 1:
