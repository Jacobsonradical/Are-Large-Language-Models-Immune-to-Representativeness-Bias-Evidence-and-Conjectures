Let's begin by breaking down the terms and computing the probabilities using Bayes' theorem. To remind you of Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll need to assign some reasonable estimates for the probabilities in order to compute \( P(H|E) \).

**Probabilities for Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**

Let's assume the base rate \( P(H) \) for a given graduate field like Agricultural and Veterinary Science is reasonably low but not negligible. Let's say \( P(H) = 0.05 \).

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**

Given Adam’s personality sketch (deep love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants), the likelihood that he belongs to Agricultural and Veterinary Science is high. Let's say \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).

3. **Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**

This is the probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given that he is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given his strong fit in this field, this might be relatively low. Let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

**Probabilities for Business Administration**

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**

The base rate \( P(H) \) for Business Administration could be higher compared to a niche field like Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Let's say \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**

Given Adam's traits, it is less likely that he is pursuing Business Administration. Let's say \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

3. **Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**

The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given that he is not in Business Administration would be higher than the previous field but still not overwhelming. Let’s say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

We need to calculate \( P(E) \), which is the total probability of observing Adam's personality sketch across all possible fields. For simplicity, we'll use a weighted average based on the considered hypotheses and their complements:
 
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Now, calculate for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95 \]

\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.05) + (0.1 \cdot 0.95) = 0.035 + 0.095 = 0.13 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{0.13} \approx 0.269 \]

2. **Business Administration**

\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 \]

\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) = 0.02 + 0.24 = 0.26 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.26} \approx 0.077 \]

Now, putting these results together:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.269,
  "business administration": 0.077
}
```

These values suggest that, based on Adam's personality sketch, it is much more likely that he was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science as a graduate student in 2021 compared to Business Administration.
