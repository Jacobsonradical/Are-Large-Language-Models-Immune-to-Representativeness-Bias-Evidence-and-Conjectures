To determine the probabilities we need to use Bayes' rule:

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}\]

Let's break it down step-by-step for the two fields: agricultural and veterinary science, and business administration. We'll assume subjective probabilities where exact values are not provided.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

**1. P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.**
Since Adam has a strong appreciation for nature and animals, this field seems highly relevant.
\[ P(H) = 0.3 \]

**2. P(E|H): The probability of observing the evidence (E) given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.**
The evidence strongly matches someone in this field.
\[ P(E|H) = 0.9 \]

**3. P(E|\neg H): The probability of observing the evidence given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.**
The evidence is less likely to match other fields in general.
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \]

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.3}{0.9 \cdot 0.3 + 0.2 \cdot 0.7} = \frac{0.27}{0.27 + 0.14} = \frac{0.27}{0.41} \approx 0.6585 \]

### Business Administration

**1. P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.**
Given Adam's personality sketch, this seems less likely.
\[ P(H) = 0.1 \]

**2. P(E|H): The probability of observing the evidence (E) given that Adam was enrolled in business administration.**
The evidence does not fit well.
\[ P(E|H) = 0.1 \]

**3. P(E|\neg H): The probability of observing the evidence given that Adam was not enrolled in business administration.**
This value would be similar to the general evidence not fitting other fields.
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \]

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.1 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.18} = \frac{0.01}{0.19} \approx 0.0526 \]

### Final Results

Here are the computed posterior probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6585",
  "business administration": "0.0526"
}
