To determine \( P(H|E) \) through Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate the probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each hypothesis H. The formula for Bayes' rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) (the overall probability of the evidence) is the same for both hypotheses, we focus on calculating and comparing the numerators for each scenario. 

Let's estimate the probabilities for each field:

### Hypothesis: Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in business administration. Let's say this is moderately likely. Estimating around 0.2.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam's personality traits given he is studying business administration. Some traits do not highly align with typical business administration students, though not impossible. Let's estimate around 0.2.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam's personality traits given he is not studying business administration. This set of characteristics are more aligned with other fields. Estimating around 0.8.

### Hypothesis: Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Say around 0.1 due to less common specialization.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam's personality traits given he is studying agricultural and veterinary science. His traits strongly align with this field. Estimate around 0.8.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam's traits given he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Other fields are more likely to show different personality traits. Estimate around 0.4.

Now we perform the Bayesian update:

### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.04}{P(E)} \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.08}{P(E)} \]

Since we care about the relative likelihoods rather than the exact values of \( P(E) \), we can rank the hypotheses by comparing their numerators:

{
  "business administration": 0.04,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08
}

So, we conclude:

{
  "business administration": 0.04,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08
}
