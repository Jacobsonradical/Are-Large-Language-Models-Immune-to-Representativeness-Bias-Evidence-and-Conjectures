Let's start by considering the given personality sketch E of Adam and hypotheses H for each of the fields.

### Hypotheses:
1. Hₐ: Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
2. H_b: Adam was enrolled in business administration.

### Probabilities:
- P(H): Prior probability of being enrolled in that field.
- P(E|H): Probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- P(E|¬H): Probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam was NOT enrolled in that field.
- P(H|E): Posterior probability of being enrolled in that field given the personality sketch E (what we aim to calculate).

Now, let's make some assumptions based on the provided information.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
1. **P(Hₐ)**: Since agricultural and veterinary science fields align closely with Adam's love for nature, animals, and strong empathy, let's assume a moderately high prior probability.
   - P(Hₐ) = 0.2
   
2. **P(E|Hₐ)**: The personality traits described (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy) fit very well with someone in this field.
   - P(E|Hₐ) = 0.8
   
3. **P(E|¬Hₐ)**: The probability of having this personality sketch without being in agricultural and veterinary science might be lower due to specific alignment.
   - P(E|¬Hₐ) = 0.3

### Business Administration:
1. **P(H_b)**: Business administration is quite common, but given Adam's personality traits, it's less likely compared to agricultural/veterinary science.
   - P(H_b) = 0.1
   
2. **P(E|H_b)**: The described traits do not match as closely with business administration.
   - P(E|H_b) = 0.2
   
3. **P(E|¬H_b)**: Since the traits align better with non-business fields (like agricultural and veterinary science), this probability would be relatively high.
   - P(E|¬H_b) = 0.7

### Bayes' Rule for Posterior Calculation:
Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

### Calculation:

#### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(Hₐ|E) = \frac{P(E|Hₐ) \cdot P(Hₐ)}{P(E|Hₐ) \cdot P(Hₐ) + P(E|¬Hₐ) \cdot P(¬Hₐ)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{0.8 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.16}{0.16 + 0.24} = \frac{0.16}{0.4} = 0.4 \]

#### For Business Administration:
\[ P(H_b|E) = \frac{P(E|H_b) \cdot P(H_b)}{P(E|H_b) \cdot P(H_b) + P(E|¬H_b) \cdot P(¬H_b)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.7 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.63} = \frac{0.02}{0.65} ≈ 0.031 \]

### Final Answer:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.031
}
```
These calculated probabilities suggest that given Adam's personality sketch, he is significantly more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration.
