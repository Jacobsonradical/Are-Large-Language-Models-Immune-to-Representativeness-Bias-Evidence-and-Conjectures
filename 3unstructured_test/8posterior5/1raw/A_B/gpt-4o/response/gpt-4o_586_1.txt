Let's denote:

- H1: Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- H2: Adam was enrolled in business administration.

Given the personality sketch E:

To compute the posterior probability P(H|E) for each field, we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

First, let's assign some reasonable probabilities based on the personality sketch and general knowledge.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1)**:
    - P(H1): We need to assign a prior probability. Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and high empathy, it's reasonable to assign a relatively higher prior probability.
    - P(E|H1): The likelihood of Adam having such a personality given he is in this field is very high.
    - P(E|\neg H1): The likelihood of Adam having such a personality given he is in a different field might be lower.

2. **Business Administration (H2)**:
    - P(H2): Given Adam's personality, it seems less aligned with business administration.
    - P(E|H2): The likelihood of Adam having such a personality given he is in this field is lower.
    - P(E|\neg H2): The likelihood of Adam having such a personality given he is in a different field might be higher.

Let's assign some numerical estimates for priors and likelihoods:

- P(H1) = 0.3
- P(H2) = 0.1
- P(E|H1) = 0.9
- P(E|H2) = 0.2
- P(E|\neg H1) = 0.2
- P(E|\neg H2) = 0.8

Since P(E) is common for both fields, it will cancel out when comparing P(H1|E) and P(H2|E).

Using Bayes' rule for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1)**:
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H1|E) \propto P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1) \]
\[ P(H1|E) \propto 0.9 \cdot 0.3 = 0.27 \]

2. **Business Administration (H2)**:
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H2|E) \propto P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2) \]
\[ P(H2|E) \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.1 = 0.02 \]

Normalizing these probabilities to sum to 1 among the considered fields:

Total = 0.27 + 0.02 = 0.29

\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.27}{0.29} \approx 0.93 \]
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.29} \approx 0.07 \]

Therefore, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.93,
  "business administration": 0.07
}
