To apply Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis, we'll use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we don't have explicit values for these probabilities, we can only provide an approximation based on the qualitative description of Adam's personality sketch \( E \). Here are the steps and units of information guiding our approximations:

1. **Business Administration (H1)**:
    - **P(H1)**: Given that graduate students can be in various fields, let's assume P(H1), i.e., the prior probability of a graduate student being in business administration, is moderate but not very high. Let's estimate this about 0.2.
    - **P(E|H1)**: The personality sketch \( E \) doesn't naturally align with business administration, as it emphasizes nature, plants, puzzles, animals, and empathy. So, P(E|H1) might be quite low. Let's estimate this about 0.05.
    - **P(E|\neg H1)**: This represents the probability of having Adam's traits in fields other than business administration. Given the traits mentioned, most other fields (especially those related to nature or animals) might align better, making P(E) likely higher. Let's estimate this about 0.8.

    Using Bayes' rule:
    \[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.2}{0.8} = 0.0125 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H2)**:
    - **P(H2)**: Assuming there are multiple fields, and given the interest in nature and animals, the prior probability of agricultural and veterinary science might be reasonably high. Let's estimate this at about 0.1.
    - **P(E|H2)**: This fits well with Adam's personality sketch, so P(E|H2) should be high. Let's estimate this at about 0.7.
    - **P(E|\neg H2)**: Again, considering the traits, or personality sketch aligning with a nature-related field, having these traits outside agricultural and veterinary science might be moderate. Let's estimate this at 0.4.

    Using Bayes' rule:
    \[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.1}{0.4} = 0.175 \]

Assuming these qualitative estimates, we can now present the results as requested:

{
  "business administration": 0.0125,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.175
