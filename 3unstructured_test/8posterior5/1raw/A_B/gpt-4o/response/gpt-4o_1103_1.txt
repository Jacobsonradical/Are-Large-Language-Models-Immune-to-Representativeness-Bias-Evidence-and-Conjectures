In order to calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we can use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that \( P(E) \) is common for all hypotheses and will cancel out if we are comparing relative probabilities, we will focus on estimating \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Here are the steps:

1. **Estimate \( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the specific field.
2. **Estimate \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in the specific field.
3. **Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in the specific field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

**\( P(H) \):** Let's assume that there is a moderate likelihood that a graduate student might be in agricultural and veterinary science. We could estimate this to be approximately 0.1 (10%).

**\( P(E|H) \):** The personality sketch fits very well with someone in agricultural and veterinary science. Curiosity about nature, empathy towards animals, and appreciation for hard work are all aligned with this field. We could estimate this to be quite high, around 0.8 (80%).

**\( P(E|\neg H) \):** The probability of this personality sketch being true for a student not in agricultural and veterinary science could be lower than those in agricultural and veterinary science but not zero. We could estimate it to be around 0.3 (30%).

### Business Administration:

**\( P(H) \):** Given the broad range of fields, we might estimate the likelihood of a graduate student being in business administration to also be around 0.1 (10%).

**\( P(E|H) \):** The personality traits described in E seem somewhat less aligned with typical traits one might associate with business administration (although not impossible). This might be estimated at 0.2 (20%).

**\( P(E|\neg H) \):** The probability of having these traits if not in business administration could be similar to the agricultural and veterinary science case, around 0.3 (30%).

Now, applying Bayes' rule relatively (the exact value of \( P(E) \) cancels out):

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H)P(H) \]

So for agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \]

For business administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.2 \times 0.1 = 0.02 \]

Thus, we normalize these probabilities relative to each other:
- For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.02} = \frac{0.08}{0.10} = 0.8 \]

- For business administration:
\[ \frac{0.02}{0.08 + 0.02} = \frac{0.02}{0.10} = 0.2 \]

Therefore, the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field would be:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
