To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) for the hypotheses \( H \) of each field given the evidence \( E \) using Bayes' rule, we need to first estimate the following:

1. **Prior probability \( P(H) \)**: The initial likelihood of Adam enrolling in each field without any specific evidence.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he were enrolled in that field.
3. **Marginal probability \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he were enrolled in any other field.

These will allow us to compute \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \), where \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant.

Let's estimate these values:

### Business Administration

1. **Prior probability \( P(H) \)**: Business Administration is a common graduate field. Let's assume \( P(\text{BA}) \) to be relatively moderate, say 0.2.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The personality traits described (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy) don't strongly fit with the typical personality traits of Business Administration students. Let's assume this probability to be low, say 0.1.
3. **Marginal probability \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Given that Business Administration isn't a likely fit, the personality traits are more likely elsewhere. Let's set this to a higher value, say 0.3.

\( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior probability \( P(H) \)**: Agricultural and Veterinary Science is a more specific field. Let's assume \( P(\text{AVS}) \) to be less common, say 0.1.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's interest in nature, empathy, and love for animals strongly support this field. Therefore, assume a high probability, say 0.8.
3. **Marginal probability \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The traits are less likely outside of this field given the strong match. Let's assume this to be lower, say 0.2.

\( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \).

### Normalizing Factor \( P(E) \)

For each field, we can normalize the combined probabilities:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{BA}})P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E|H_{\text{AVS}})P(H_{\text{AVS}}) + \ldots \]

Given we don't have the probabilities for other fields, we won't be able to definitively give a normalized value, but we can provide the unnormalized posterior probabilities:

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \approx 0.02 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) \approx 0.08 \]

So relative to each other:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}
