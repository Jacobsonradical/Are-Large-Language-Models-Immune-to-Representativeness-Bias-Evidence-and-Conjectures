To apply Bayes' Rule, we need to consider the following:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing E if Adam is enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing E if Adam is not enrolled in the given field.

Given the fields "agricultural and veterinary science" and "business administration," let's evaluate these probabilities based on the personality sketch of Adam.

### For "agricultural and veterinary science":
1. **P(H)**: Let's assume a moderate prior probability that a graduate student might be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. 
2. **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy, it is highly likely that he would be in this field. 
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: If Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science, the likelihood of observing these personality traits diminishes because these traits are highly aligned with this field. However, it is still possible he exhibits these traits in another field.

Using these evaluations, we approximate:
- \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \)

Applying Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
Given \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.7 \),
\[ P(E) = (0.9 \times 0.3) + (0.4 \times 0.7) = 0.27 + 0.28 = 0.55 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.3}{0.55} \approx 0.49 \]

### For "business administration":
1. **P(H)**: Let's assume a lower prior probability for a graduate student being enrolled in business administration, as it is less likely based on Adam's personality.
2. **P(E|H)**: Traits like empathy and intelligence can be present in business administration, but his love for nature and animals makes it less likely.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Since these traits align more with other fields better than business administration, we might predict higher likelihood for fields such as agricultural sciences over business.

Using these evaluations, we approximate:
- \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.55 \) (as this accounts for other fields generally)

Applying Bayes' Rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
where
\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]
Given \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.9 \),
\[
P(E) = (0.3 \times 0.1) + (0.55 \times 0.9) = 0.03 + 0.495 = 0.525
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.1}{0.525} \approx 0.057 
\]

So, the probabilities become:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.49,
  "business administration": 0.057
}
```
