To calculate the posterior probabilities P(H|E) using Bayes' Rule, we need to estimate the following probabilities:
1. P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
2. P(E|H): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
3. P(E|\neg H): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was not enrolled in that specific field.

Bayes' Rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that P(E) is constant across all fields, we can compare the relative probabilities directly.

Let's start with the estimates for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

   - P(H): Let's assume that about 5% of graduate students are in this field.
   - P(E|H): Adam's personality, which includes a genuine curiosity about nature, a love for animals, and a warm heart, seems highly compatible with this field. Let's estimate this probability as high, around 0.8.
   - P(E|\neg H): Let's estimate the likelihood of such a personality sketch in fields other than agricultural and veterinary science as moderate. This can be around 0.2.

   Using these estimates:
   \[
   P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04
   \]

2. **Business Administration**

   - P(H): Let's assume that about 20% of graduate students are in this field.
   - P(E|H): Adam's personality does not seem particularly well-suited to business administration, which often values different traits such as leadership in different contexts and a focus on financial outcomes. Let's estimate this probability as low, around 0.1.
   - P(E|\neg H): As before, we estimate the likelihood of such a personality sketch in fields other than business administration as moderate. This can be around 0.2.

   Using these estimates:
   \[
   P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02
   \]

Comparing the relative probabilities, we get:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.04",
  "business administration": "0.02"
}
