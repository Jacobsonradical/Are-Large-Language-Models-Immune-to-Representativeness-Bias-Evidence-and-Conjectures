Sure, let's work through this step-by-step using Bayes' Rule. Bayes' Rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.

To simplify the calculations, we'll assume that the priors \( P(H) \) for each field are equal, denoted as \( P(H) = 1/N \) where \( N \) is the number of potential fields (though we don't need to know \( N \) explicitly because it will cancel out).

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Assign Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \):**
   Since we are comparing two specific fields, we assume equal priors for simplicity:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = \frac{1}{N}
   \]
   \[
   P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = \frac{1}{N}
   \]

2. **Estimate Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \):**
   - For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
     - Likely high because Adam has a deep love for animals, enjoys nature and plants. This fits well with the field.
     \[
     P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \approx 0.9
     \]
   - For **business administration**:
     - Likely low because the described traits do not strongly correlate with typical business administration characteristics.
     \[
     P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \approx 0.2
     \]

3. **Estimate Likelihoods \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   Since there are many other fields, we'll assume an average likelihood for non-specified fields:
   \[
   P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \approx 0.1
   \]
   \[
   P(E|\neg H_{\text{business administration}}) \approx 0.1
   \]

4. **Compute Posterior Probabilities \( P(H|E) \):**

   For agricultural and veterinary science:
   \[
   P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot \frac{1}{N}}{P(E)}
   \]

   For business administration:
   \[
   P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot \frac{1}{N}}{P(E)}
   \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant and the same for both cases, it does not affect the relative comparison. Thus the posterior probabilities' relative magnitudes depend only on the numerators:

\[
P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} \propto 0.9
\]
\[
P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} \propto 0.2
\]

To normalize these to get probability values, we divide each by the sum of both:

\[
P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} = \frac{0.9}{0.9 + 0.2} = \frac{0.9}{1.1} \approx 0.818
\]
\[
P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} = \frac{0.2}{0.9 + 0.2} = \frac{0.2}{1.1} \approx 0.182
\]

### Final Answer:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.818,
  "business administration": 0.182
}
```
