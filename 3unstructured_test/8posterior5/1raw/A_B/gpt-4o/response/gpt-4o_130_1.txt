Bayes' theorem can help us determine the probability of Adam being enrolled in specific fields given his personality sketch. Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability of the hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence \( E \).

For simplicity, we'll assume all probabilities are subjective estimates.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his love for nature, plants, and animals, it is reasonably high. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.3 \).

2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch given enrollment in agricultural and veterinary science. Given the strong correlation between his traits and this field, let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch given enrollment in any field except agricultural and veterinary science. It would be lower but not negligible. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

### Business Administration

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration. Given his traits, this is likely lower. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch given enrollment in business administration. His traits are less aligned with this field. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch given enrollment in any field except business administration. It would be higher than the previous, but still moderate. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Now, we'll compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.3) + (0.2 \cdot 0.7) = 0.24 + 0.14 = 0.38 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.3}{0.38} \approx 0.632 \]

For business administration:

\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) = 0.01 + 0.27 = 0.28 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.28} \approx 0.036 \]

Therefore:

  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.632,
  "business administration": 0.036
