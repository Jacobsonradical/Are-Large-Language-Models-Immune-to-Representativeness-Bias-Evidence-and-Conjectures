To estimate the probabilities, we need to make some educated assumptions based on Adam's personality sketch and the typical nature of respective graduate programs. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) * P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality traits given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the personality traits across all fields.

Let's make some rough estimations:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- \( P(E|H) \) — Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align well with this field. Therefore, \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \).
- \( P(H) \) — Assuming a somewhat equal distribution of graduate students across fields, but adjusting for the high alignment with his traits, \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) — The probability of observing Adam's traits in fields other than agricultural and veterinary science might be lower, \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.8 * 0.2}{0.8 * 0.2 + 0.3 * (1 - 0.2)} = \frac{0.16}{0.16 + 0.24} = \frac{0.16}{0.4} = 0.4 \]

### Business Administration:
- \( P(E|H) \) — Adam's traits don't strongly align with business administration as it typically focuses less on nature, animals, and more on economics and management. Therefore, \( P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \).
- \( P(H) \) — Business programs are quite popular, so the prior might be higher, say \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) — The probability of observing these traits in fields other than business administration might be higher, \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.2 * 0.3}{0.2 * 0.3 + 0.5 * (1 - 0.3)} = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.35} = \frac{0.06}{0.41} \approx 0.146 \]

So the final answers are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.146
}
```
