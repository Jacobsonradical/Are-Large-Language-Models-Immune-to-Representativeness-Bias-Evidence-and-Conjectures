To calculate \( P(H|E) \) for both business administration and agricultural and veterinary science, we need to define the probabilities involved in Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, rather than providing exact numerical values, which require more specific data about enrollment rates and other factors, I'll provide estimated values that align with the personality sketch of Adam.

### Business Administration
1. **Initial Hypothesis \( P(H) \)**:
   - Business administration is a common field, so assume a moderate prior probability.
   - Let's estimate \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

2. **Conditional Probability \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Business administration students might not typically align with Adam's interests in nature, puzzles, and animals.
   - So, we assume a lower fit \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

3. **Complementary \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - Given his traits, he is probably better suited for other fields.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **Initial Hypothesis \( P(H) \)**:
   - Agricultural and veterinary science is less common but fits Adam's personality traits better.
   - Let's estimate \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

2. **Conditional Probability \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - This field aligns well with Adam's interests in nature, animals, and dedication to hard work.
   - So, a high fit \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

3. **Complementary \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - Were Adam not in this specific field, his personality could fit a range of other fields.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem for both fields:

### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{(0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8)} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.24} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.02}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.077 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{(0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9)} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.27} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.08}{0.35} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.229 \]

Thus, the approximations for each field are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.077,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.229
}
```
