To apply Bayes' rule, we need to calculate the values for the probability that Adam is enrolled in each field given his personality sketch. We'll use the following terminology:

- P(H) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the specified field (business administration or agricultural and veterinary science).
- P(E|H) is the probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in the specified field.
- P(E|\neg H) is the probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in the specified field.
- P(H|E) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the specified field given his personality sketch.

Let's start with some reasonable assumptions for each field:

### Business Administration
- **P(H):** Considering the diversity of graduate fields, let's assume P(H) = 0.1 (as business administration is a popular but not dominant field among all possible graduate fields).
- **P(E|H):** Business administration typically does not require a deep love for animals or nature, so let's assume P(E|H) = 0.1.
- **P(E|\neg H):** Considering that the personality traits described are not typical for business administration but might occur elsewhere, let's assume P(E|\neg H) = 0.5.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.1 \cdot 0.1 + 0.5 \cdot 0.9} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.45} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.46} \approx 0.0217 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H):** Agricultural and veterinary science might be less common than business administration but more relevant to Adam's traits. Let's assume P(H) = 0.05.
- **P(E|H):** Adam's traits strongly align with agricultural and veterinary science, so let's assume P(E|H) = 0.9.
- **P(E|\neg H):** Given that the personality sketch is not typical of all other fields, let's assume P(E|\neg H) = 0.3.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.9 \cdot 0.05 + 0.3 \cdot 0.95} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.285} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.33} \approx 0.1364 \]

Combining these values, we get:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0217,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.1364
}
