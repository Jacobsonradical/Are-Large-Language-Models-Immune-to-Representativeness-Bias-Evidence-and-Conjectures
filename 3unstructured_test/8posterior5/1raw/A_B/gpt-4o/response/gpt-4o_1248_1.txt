To determine \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). The formula for Bayes' rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Let's analyze the two fields: business administration and agricultural and veterinary science.

### Business Administration
1. **\( P(H) \):**
   - The overall probability of a graduate student being in business administration. Given that there are a variety of graduate fields, let's assume \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.2 \).

2. **\( P(E|H) \):**
   - Given the personality sketch \( E \), how likely is it that Adam is in business administration?
   - Given Adam's traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, etc.), these traits are less common in business administration.
   - We'll assume \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1 \).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   - The likelihood of observing the personality sketch in all other fields excluding business administration.
   - It is likely higher because Adam’s traits are more common in other fields (especially those related to nature, empathy, and animals).
   - We'll assume \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.5 \).

Using these values:

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{(0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.5 \cdot 0.8)} \]

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.4} = \frac{0.02}{0.42} \approx 0.048 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **\( P(H) \):**
   - The overall probability of a graduate student being in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.1 \).

2. **\( P(E|H) \):**
   - Given the personality sketch \( E \), how likely is it that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science?
   - Adam’s traits strongly align with interests and activities in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - We'll assume \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.8 \).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   - The likelihood of observing the personality sketch in all other fields excluding agricultural and veterinary science.
   - We'll assume \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.2 \).

Using these values:

\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{(0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9)} \]

\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.18} = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \approx 0.308 \]

The calculated probabilities for each field are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.048,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.308
}
