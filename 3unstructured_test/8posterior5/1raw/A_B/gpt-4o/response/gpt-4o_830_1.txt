To estimate \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we first need to estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Let's start by breaking down the probabilities for each field of study:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

- **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Considering the number of fields in graduate studies, let's assume a rough prior estimate of 0.1.
- **P(E|H)**: This is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is studying Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given Adam's empathy, love for nature, plants, and animals, his traits align strongly with this field. Therefore, let's assign a high value, say 0.8.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: This is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not studying Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Since there are many other fields of study where his traits could also be applicable, let's estimate this value to be lower, around 0.2.

Using Bayes Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
We use \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \) where \( P(\neg H) \approx 0.9 \):

\[
P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) = 0.08 + 0.18 = 0.26
\]

So,

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.26} \approx \frac{0.08}{0.26} \approx 0.3077
\]

2. **Business Administration**

- **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration. Let's assume a rough prior estimate of 0.1.
- **P(E|H)**: This is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is studying Business Administration. The traits mentioned do not strongly align with typical traits for Business Administration, so let's assign a lower probability, say 0.2.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: As before, the probability of observing \( E \) given that Adam is not studying Business Administration. Given that \( E \) could still fit into other fields, we estimate this value again around 0.2.

Using Bayes Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
We use \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \):

\[
P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) = 0.02 + 0.18 = 0.20
\]

So,

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.20} = 0.1
\]

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3077,
  "business administration": 0.1
