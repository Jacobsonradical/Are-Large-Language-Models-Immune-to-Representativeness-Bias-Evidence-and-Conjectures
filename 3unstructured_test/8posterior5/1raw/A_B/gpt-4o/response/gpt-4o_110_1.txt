Let's break this down step-by-step using Bayes' theorem, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, we will focus on the relative likelihoods rather than exact probabilities, as actual numbers can be challenging without extensive data. 

1. **Business Administration (H1):**

   - \( P(H1) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
   - \( P(E|H1) \): The likelihood of observing Adam’s personality sketch given that he is in business administration.
   - \( P(E|\neg H1) \): The likelihood of observing Adam’s personality sketch given that he is not in business administration.
   
   Analyzing the fit:
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, which is not particularly related to business administration.
   - His love for animals and appreciation for hard work might marginally fit.
   - Solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts can fit many fields, but especially not business-focused ones.
   
   Therefore:
   - \( P(H1) \): Considering business administration is a common graduate field - let's assume \( P(H1) = 0.2 \) (a reasonable prior estimate, though it could be more or less depending on specific institutional data).
   - \( P(E|H1) \): Low to moderate, let’s say \( P(E|H1) = 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H1) \): Higher, because Adam's characteristics are more likely in another field – let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H1) = 0.5 \).

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H2):**

   - \( P(H2) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - \( P(E|H2) \): The likelihood of observing Adam’s personality sketch given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - \( P(E|\neg H2) \): The likelihood of observing Adam’s personality sketch given that he is not in agricultural and veterinary science.
   
   Analyzing the fit:
   - Adam’s curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy fit very well with this field.
   - His intelligence and appreciation for hard work also fit particularly well with a research-heavy and practical field like agricultural and veterinary science.
   
   Therefore:
   - \( P(H2) \): Given that this field could be less common but fitting better, let's assume \( P(H2) = 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|H2) \): Very high, let’s say \( P(E|H2) = 0.8 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H2) \): Lower, let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H2) = 0.3 \).

Using Bayes’ theorem:

\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is common in both, we focus on the numerators for relative comparison (since normalization is required for precise values but isn’t provided):

Relative weight comparison:
\[ \text{business administration} \approx 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]
\[ \text{agricultural and veterinary science} \approx 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]

Therefore, in relative terms:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```
