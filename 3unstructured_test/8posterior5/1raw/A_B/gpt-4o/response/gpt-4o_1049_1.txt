To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in either business administration (BA) or agricultural and veterinary science (AVS) given his personality sketch (E), we'll use Bayes' rule. Let's denote the hypotheses as follows:
- \( H_{BA} \): Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( H_{AVS} \): Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Bayes' rule states that:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to estimate:
- \( P(H_{BA}) \): Prior probability Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(H_{AVS}) \): Prior probability Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): Probability Adam's personality sketch given he was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \): Probability Adam's personality sketch given he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \): Probability Adam's personality sketch given he was not enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \): Probability Adam's personality sketch given he was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Assumptions:
- We'll assume some prior probabilities \( P(H_{BA}) \) and \( P(H_{AVS}) \) based on the distribution of graduate students in different fields.
- We'll estimate likelihoods \( P(E|H_{BA}) \) and \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \) based on how well the personality traits match the typical student profile in those fields.

### Business Administration (BA)
- \( P(H_{BA}) \): Let's assume 10% of graduate students are in BA.
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): Personality traits like empathy and high intelligence are useful in BA but the fit is not as strong as with AVS, say 0.2.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \): Considering many fields exist, assume a broad average probability, say 0.5.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS)
- \( P(H_{AVS}) \): Let's assume 5% of graduate students are in AVS.
- \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \): Adam's personality fits very well with traits common in AVS, say 0.7.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \): Assume probability for non-AVS fields to have that personality on a broader average, say 0.4.

### Calculation
Let's use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H_{BA}|E) \) and \( P(H_{AVS}|E) \):

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)} \]

Let's first compute the denominators \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \cdot P(\neg H_{BA}) \]
\[ P(E) \text{ (approximation) } = (0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.5 \cdot 0.9) = 0.02 + 0.45 = 0.47 \]

Similarly for AVS:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) + P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \cdot P(\neg H_{AVS}) \]
\[ P(E) \text{ (approximation) } = (0.7 \cdot 0.05) + (0.4 \cdot 0.95) = 0.035 + 0.38 = 0.415 \]

Now, compute the posterior probabilities:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{(0.2 \cdot 0.1)}{0.47} = \frac{0.02}{0.47} \approx 0.0426 \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{(0.7 \cdot 0.05)}{0.415} = \frac{0.035}{0.415} \approx 0.0843 \]

Now, package the results as requested:
