Sure, let's use Bayes' theorem to find the probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for the fields of "business administration" and "agricultural and veterinary science." 

Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis.

To simplify, we'll consider \(P(E)\) as a normalization factor that ensures the resulting probabilities sum up to 1, but we'll not compute it explicitly since we are only asked to compare the probabilities for these two fields.

Now, let's estimate \(P(H)\), \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E|\neg H)\) for each field.

### Business Administration
1. **P(H) (prior probability):**
   - Business administration is a common graduate field, so let's assume \(P(H)\) is moderately likely. We'll assign \(P(H) = 0.2\).

2. **P(E|H) (likelihood of evidence given hypothesis):**
   - Business administration students might exhibit some of Adam's traits, but they are generally more focused on business, management, and finance rather than nature and animals. Thus \(P(E|H)\) might be lower. Let's assume \(P(E|H) = 0.1\).

3. **P(E|\neg H) (likelihood of evidence given negation of hypothesis):**
   - Since the negation includes a vast number of other fields (many of which might fit Adam's description better), this would be relatively high. Let's assume \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.5\).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H) (prior probability):**
   - This field is less common than business administration but aligns well with Adam's traits. Let's assume \(P(H) = 0.1\).

2. **P(E|H) (likelihood of evidence given hypothesis):**
   - Adam's characteristics strongly align with those typically found in this field. So \(P(E|H)\) should be high. Let's assign \(P(E|H) = 0.8\).

3. **P(E|\neg H) (likelihood of evidence given negation of hypothesis):**
   - Similar to business administration, but this group's probability would be slightly lower as it includes many less-fitting fields. Let's assume \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.4\).

Now, let's compute \(P(H|E)\).

### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E)_{AVS} = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

To compare these probabilities, we can ignore \(P(E)\) since itâ€™s just a normalization factor. 

So, we have:
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} \propto 0.02 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{AVS} \propto 0.08 \]

Thus, in relative terms, \(P(H|E)_{AVS}\) is higher than \(P(H|E)_{BA}\).

Now putting these into the requested format while recognizing that the probabilities are relative:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08
}
