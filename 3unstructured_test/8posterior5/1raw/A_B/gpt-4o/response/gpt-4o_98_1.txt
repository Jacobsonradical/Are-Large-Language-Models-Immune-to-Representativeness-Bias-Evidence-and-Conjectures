To estimate the probabilities, let's first outline our understanding of each hypothesis (H):

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field aligns well with several aspects of Adam's personality sketch. His genuine curiosity about nature and plants, deep love for animals, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work suggest a natural fit for a field focused on agriculture and veterinary science.

2. **Business Administration**: Some aspects of Adam's personality, such as high intelligence and the ability to understand abstract concepts, could be beneficial in business administration. However, his specific interests in nature, animals, and empathy do not strongly align with this field.

Now, let's assign probabilities:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in each field.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the evidence given the hypothesis.

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing the evidence given the opposite of the hypothesis.

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science** (AVS):

1. **P(H)**: Let's assume that Adam has an equal chance of enrolling in any graduate field. Given hundreds of potential fields, we might set a prior probability P(H) for any specific field around 0.01.
  
2. **P(E|H)**: The evidence strongly fits this field given Adam's personality, so we might assign a high probability, say 0.9.
  
3. **P(E|¬H)**: Given that Adam is not in AVS, it would be less likely, although not impossible, to match all his traits perfectly to another field. Thus, let's assume a lower probability, around 0.1.

For **Business Administration** (BA):

1. **P(H)**: Similarly, we assume a prior P(H) of 0.01.
  
2. **P(E|H)**: The evidence poorly fits this field given Adam's interests, so we assign a lower probability, say 0.2.

3. **P(E|¬H)**: Given that Adam is not in BA, the matching of his traits would also be fairly low. Let's assign a probability of 0.8.

We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that \( P(E) \) is constant for each hypothesis and is proportional to \( P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \), we can compute the posterior probabilities without the exact value of \( P(E) \) as below:

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:

\[ P(H|E)_{AVS} \propto 0.9 \times 0.01 \]
\[ P(\neg H|E)_{AVS} \propto 0.1 \times 0.99 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{AVS} \approx \frac{0.009}{0.009 + 0.099} \approx \frac{0.009}{0.108} \approx 0.083 \]

For **Business Administration**:

\[ P(H|E)_{BA} \propto 0.2 \times 0.01 \]
\[ P(\neg H|E)_{BA} \propto 0.8 \times 0.99 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} \approx \frac{0.002}{0.002 + 0.792} \approx \frac{0.002}{0.794} \approx 0.0025 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.083,
  "business administration": 0.0025
}
