To solve this problem using Bayes' Rule, we need to determine the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in different fields based on the given personality sketch.

Bayes' Rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that hypothesis \( H \) is true given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of evidence \( E \) given that hypothesis \( H \) is true.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \) being true.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of evidence \( E \).

Let's denote:
- \( H_1 \): Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( H_2 \): Adam was enrolled in business administration.

We need to judge \( P(H_1) \), \( P(E|H_1) \), \( P(E|\neg H_1) \), \( P(H_2) \), \( P(E|H_2) \), and \( P(E|\neg H_2) \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H_1) \)**:
   This is the probability that a random graduate student would be in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume:
   \[ P(H_1) \approx 0.05 \]

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H_1) \)**:
   Adam's personality sketch matches well with traits often associated with agricultural and veterinary science (curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals). Therefore:
   \[ P(E|H_1) \approx 0.8 \]

3. **Likelihood for not \( H_1 \), \( P(E|\neg H_1) \)**:
   If Adam is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, the evidence is less likely to match, but it can still fit other fields:
   \[ P(E|\neg H_1) \approx 0.2 \]

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H_2) \)**:
   This is the probability that a random graduate student would be in business administration. Let's assume:
   \[ P(H_2) \approx 0.15 \]

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H_2) \)**:
   Adam's personality sketch matches less well with traits typically associated with business administration (abstract thinking might fit, but empathy for animals and interest in nature less so). Therefore:
   \[ P(E|H_2) \approx 0.1 \]

3. **Likelihood for not \( H_2 \), \( P(E|\neg H_2) \)**:
   If Adam is not enrolled in business administration, the evidence would likely fit better in this case, considering many other fields he may fit into:
   \[ P(E|\neg H_2) \approx 0.4 \]

### Calculation of Posterior Probabilities

Using Bayes' Rule, \( P(H_1|E) \) and \( P(H_2|E) \):

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E|\neg H_1) \cdot P(\neg H_1) \]
\[ P(E) \approx (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.04 + 0.19 = 0.23 \]
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.23} \approx \frac{0.04}{0.23} \approx 0.174 \]

#### Business Administration:
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) + P(E|\neg H_2) \cdot P(\neg H_2) \]
\[ P(E) \approx (0.1 \cdot 0.15) + (0.4 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.015 + 0.34 = 0.355 \]
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{0.355} \approx \frac{0.015}{0.355} \approx 0.042 \]

So the results are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.174,
  "business administration": 0.042
}
```
