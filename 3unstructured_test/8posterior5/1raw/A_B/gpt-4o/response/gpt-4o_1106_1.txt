To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E|\neg H) \). However, without specific numerical values, we'll need to make reasoned estimations.

### Hypothesis 1: Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Let's assume that the proportion of students enrolling in Business Administration in graduate programs is moderate.
   - Estimation: \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Given the personality sketch E, attributes like curiosity about nature, warm-hearted, empathy toward animals, and interest in abstract concepts do not strongly align with a typical Business Administration student.
   - Estimation: \( P(E|H) = 0.05 \).

3. **Negative Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - If Adam were not in Business Administration, his personality might be more likely attributed to other fields, especially those tied to nature or abstract thinking.
   - Estimation: \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

4. **Posterior Probability \( P(H|E) \)**:
   - Using Bayes' rule: \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \), we can approximate \( P(E) \) as \( P(E|\neg H) \) since it's more likely that many other fields align better with Adam's E:
   \[
   P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \approx 0.05 \cdot 0.2 + 0.2 \cdot 0.8 = 0.01 + 0.16 = 0.17
   \]
   - Finally, \( P(H|E) \) becomes: \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.2}{0.17} \approx 0.0588 \].

### Hypothesis 2: Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Let's assume that the proportion of students enrolling in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is lower than Business Administration.
   - Estimation: \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Given personality sketch E, attributes like curiosity about nature, empathy toward animals, and a love of plants strongly align with this field.
   - Estimation: \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

3. **Negative Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - If Adam were not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, most other fields could not strongly match the given personality traits.
   - Estimation: \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

4. **Posterior Probability \( P(H|E) \)**:
   - Using Bayes' rule: \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   Since \( P(E) \approx 0.1 \cdot 0.8 + 0.1 \cdot 0.9 = 0.08 + 0.09 = 0.17 \):
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.17} \approx 0.4706
   \]

Therefore, the probability estimates are:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.0588",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.4706"
}
```

These numbers show that based on the personality sketch provided, Adam is far more likely to be enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science than in Business Administration.
