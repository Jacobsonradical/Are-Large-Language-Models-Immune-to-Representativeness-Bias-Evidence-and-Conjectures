To apply Bayes' rule and compute \( P(H|E) \), we first need to evaluate the following:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given he is in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given he is not in that field.

### Evaluation:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): Let's assume that the base rate for graduate students in business administration is relatively high. We might estimate this at around \( 0.15 \) considering it is a popular field.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's traits such as a genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and understanding of hard work are not strongly correlated with the typical qualities of a business administration student. This probability could be low, around \( 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given that we are looking at any field other than business administration, the likelihood of Adam's personality traits aligning with those fields would be higher. Let’s estimate this at \( 0.3 \).

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) + P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) \cdot P(\neg \text{business administration})} \]

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{0.1 \cdot 0.15 + 0.3 \cdot 0.85} \approx \frac{0.015}{0.015 + 0.255} = \frac{0.015}{0.27} \approx 0.056 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Let's assume that the base rate for graduate students in agricultural and veterinary science is lower than in business, around \( 0.05 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's personality traits are closely aligned with characteristics expected in this field, higher likelihood around \( 0.8 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): For fields outside agricultural and veterinary science, the probability of matching Adam's traits would be lower. Let’s estimate it at \( 0.2 \).

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) + P(E|\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science})} \]

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.95} \approx \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.19} = \frac{0.04}{0.23} \approx 0.174 \]

### Final Answer:
