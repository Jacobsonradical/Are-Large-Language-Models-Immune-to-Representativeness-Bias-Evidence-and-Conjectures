To determine P(H|E) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate the prior probability P(H), the likelihood P(E|H), and the marginal likelihood P(E). Here, P(E) can be ignored in relative comparisons since it will be a normalizing constant.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his deep love for animals and nature, let's assign this a moderately high prior since it aligns with his interests. I'll estimate around 0.3.

2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood that he has the attributes described in E given that he is studying agricultural and veterinary science. Since the description strongly matches this field, let's give it a high value, say 0.8.

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood he has these attributes but is not enrolled in that field. Since there are other fields like biology or environmental science that could also strongly match his personality, I'll estimate this around 0.2.

By applying Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

\[ \text{For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:} \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \]

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Given his interests, this seems less likely, so I'll estimate it at around 0.1.

2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood that he has those attributes given that he is studying business administration. Given that business administration does not directly align with his interests in nature, animals, and puzzles, I'll estimate this low, around 0.1.

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood he has these attributes but is not enrolled in business administration. Similar to before, because there are many fields aligning with his attributes, I'll set this around 0.2.

By applying Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

\[ \text{For Business Administration:} \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.1 = 0.01 \]

Combining these, we normalize to get the relative probabilities:

  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.24,
  "business administration": 0.01
