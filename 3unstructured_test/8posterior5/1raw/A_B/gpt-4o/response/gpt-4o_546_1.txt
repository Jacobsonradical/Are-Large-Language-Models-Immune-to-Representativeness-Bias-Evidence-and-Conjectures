To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes Rule, we need to estimate:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in a particular field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in that particular field.

Bayes Rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields, to find the relative values of \( P(H|E) \) between the fields, we only need to consider the numerator \( P(E|H)P(H) \).

### For Business Administration:
1. \( P(H_{BA}) \): Let's assume the proportion of graduate students in business administration is moderate.
2. \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): Adam’s personality traits don't heavily align with typical attributes sought after in business administration (curiosity about nature, love for animals, etc.).
3. \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \): Given that there are multiple other fields, the probability of this personality sketch in any other field might still be moderate.

Given these, we can make the following estimations:

\[ P(H_{BA}) \approx 0.2 \]
\[ P(E|H_{BA}) \approx 0.1 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \]: This would be approximately 0.5 (rough estimate given the diverse pool of other fields).

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
1. \( P(H_{AVS}) \): Let's assume the proportion of graduate students in agricultural and veterinary science is relatively low but appropriate for Adam's personality.
2. \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \): Adam’s traits (love for nature, plants, animals) are strongly aligned with agricultural and veterinary science.
3. \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \): Again, considering the rest of the fields, this is broad but not specifically aligned with Adam.

Given these, we can make the following estimations:

\[ P(H_{AVS}) \approx 0.1 \]
\[ P(E|H_{AVS}) \approx 0.7 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \]: This would be about 0.5 to maintain the balance.

### Calculation
Since we only need the relative posteriors and exact values for \( P(E) \) are not needed, we compare \( P(E|H)P(H) \):

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto P(E|H_{BA})P(H_{BA}) = 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02 \]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{AVS})P(H_{AVS}) = 0.7 \times 0.1 = 0.07 \]

Normalization for comparison implies:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.07} \approx 0.22 \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.07}{0.02 + 0.07} \approx 0.78 \]

Thus, the probabilities would be:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.22,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.78
}
