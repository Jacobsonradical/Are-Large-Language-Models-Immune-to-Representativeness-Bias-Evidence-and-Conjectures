To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Rule, we need to consider:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being in that field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality characteristics given that he is in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality characteristics given that he is not in that field. This can be tricky but should be estimated based on how we perceive Adam's traits fit into fields other than the one being considered.
4. \( P(E) \): The total probability of observing Adam’s personality characteristics, which can be computed as \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \).

Given that we do not have exact data, we're making educated guesses about these probabilities based on the information given.

### Business Administration

1. **P(H):** The prior probability of Adam being in business administration. Let's assume the base rate of students in business administration is around 0.1 (10%).
2. **P(E|H):** The probability of Adam having the described characteristics (curiosity about nature, love for animals) if he was in business administration. This seems relatively low, let's assume 0.2.
3. **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of Adam having the described characteristics if he was not in business administration. Given that his traits seem more aligned with fields like science or veterinary, let's assume this is relatively high, say 0.8.

\( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)} = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{(0.2 \times 0.1) + (0.8 \times 0.9)} \approx 0.027 \)

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H):** The prior probability of Adam being in agricultural and veterinary science. Let’s assume this base rate is around 0.05 since it’s a more specialized field (5%).
2. **P(E|H):** The probability of Adam having the described characteristics if he was in agricultural and veterinary science. This seems quite high, let's assume 0.9.
3. **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of Adam having the described characteristics if he was not in agricultural and veterinary science. Given our assumptions, let's assume this is relatively lower, say 0.4.

\( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)} = \frac{0.9 \times 0.05}{(0.9 \times 0.05) + (0.4 \times 0.95)} \approx 0.103 \)

Thus, the probabilities are as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.027,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.103
}
