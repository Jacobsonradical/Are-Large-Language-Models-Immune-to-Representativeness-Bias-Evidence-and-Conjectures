To solve for \( P(H|E) \), the probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific graduate field given his personality sketch, we'll use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here’s the breakdown for each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

#### Estimating Probabilities
- \( P(H) \): This is the prior probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Suppose this is approximately \( 0.05 \) (5%) considering the overall distribution of graduate fields in the U.S.
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, and his empathy, these traits align well with agricultural and veterinary science. Thus, \( P(E|H) \) would be high, let's estimate it to be \( 0.80 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability that a student not in agricultural and veterinary science has Adam's personality traits might be lower. Let’s, for instance, estimate this to be \( 0.10 \).

Using these estimates:
- \( P(H) = 0.05 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.10 \)

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.05}{(0.80 \cdot 0.05) + (0.10 \cdot 0.95)} \]

Calculating the denominator:
\[ (0.80 \cdot 0.05) + (0.10 \cdot 0.95) = 0.04 + 0.095 = 0.135 \]

Now:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.135} \approx 0.296 \]

### Business Administration

#### Estimating Probabilities
- \( P(H) \): This is the prior probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is enrolled in business administration. Suppose this is approximately \( 0.20 \) (20%).
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's traits, they do not clearly align with typical business administration candidates, so \( P(E|H) \) might be lower. Let’s estimate it to be \( 0.05 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability that a student not in business administration has Adam's personality traits is perhaps similar as previous, let’s estimate this also to be \( 0.10 \).

Using these estimates:
- \( P(H) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.05 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.10 \)

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.20}{(0.05 \cdot 0.20) + (0.10 \cdot 0.80)} \]

Calculating the denominator:
\[ (0.05 \cdot 0.20) + (0.10 \cdot 0.80) = 0.01 + 0.08 = 0.09 \]

Now:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.09} \approx 0.111 \]
