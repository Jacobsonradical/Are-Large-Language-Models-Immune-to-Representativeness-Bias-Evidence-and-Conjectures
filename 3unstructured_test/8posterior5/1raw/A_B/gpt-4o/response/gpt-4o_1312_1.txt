Given the details provided in Adam's personality sketch, we can make educated judgments on the prior and conditional probabilities to compute the posterior probabilities using Bayes' rule.

### Notations and Assumptions:
- Let \( H_1 \) be the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- Let \( H_2 \) be the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- Let \( E \) denote Adam's personality sketch.

We need to compute:
1. \( P(H_1) \): Prior probability that Adam was in agricultural and veterinary science.
2. \( P(E|H_1) \): Probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. \( P(E|\neg H_1) \): Probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was in any field other than agricultural and veterinary science.

Similarly,
4. \( P(H_2) \): Prior probability that Adam was in business administration.
5. \( P(E|H_2) \): Probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was in business administration.
6. \( P(E|\neg H_2) \): Probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was in any field other than business administration.

Finally, we use Bayes' rule to compute:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of evidence.

### Assumptions and Estimates:
- Let's assume there are many more fields than just these two (so neither \( P(H_1) \) nor \( P(H_2) \) are very high).
- Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy, it seems more likely that he might be in agricultural and veterinary science rather than business administration.

Using these assumptions:
1. Let \( P(H_1) = 0.10 \): Prior probability for agri/vet science.
2. Let \( P(E|H_1) = 0.80 \): Likelihood of Adam's personality being in agri/vet science.
3. Let \( P(E|\neg H_1) = 0.10 \): Likelihood of Adam's personality in any other field (assuming not as high).

4. Let \( P(H_2) = 0.10 \): Prior probability for business administration.
5. Let \( P(E|H_2) = 0.05 \): Likelihood of Adam's personality fitting business administration.
6. Let \( P(E|\neg H_2) = 0.20 \): Likelihood of Adam's personality in any field other than business administration.

Now, we compute:

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[
P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E|\neg H_1) \cdot P(\neg H_1)}
\]
\[
P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.10}{0.80 \times 0.10 + 0.10 \times 0.90} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.09} = \frac{0.08}{0.17} \approx 0.47
\]

### For Business Administration:
\[
P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) + P(E|\neg H_2) \cdot P(\neg H_2)}
\]
\[
P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.10}{0.05 \times 0.10 + 0.20 \times 0.90} = \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.18} = \frac{0.005}{0.185} \approx 0.027
\]

### Summary:
\[
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.47,
  "business administration": 0.027
}
\]

Please note these are estimates based on given assumptions and might vary with more specific data or different assumptions.
