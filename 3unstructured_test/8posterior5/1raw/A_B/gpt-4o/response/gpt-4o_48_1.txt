To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we will use the following formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we're comparing two fields, we'll assume specific values for their relative prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the probabilities associated with the personality sketch \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

1. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): Let's assume a prior probability of being enrolled in business administration is 0.3, since it's a commonly chosen graduate field.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The probability of having Adam's personality sketch if he's in business administration might be lower because the sketch reflects a strong interest in nature and animals. We'll assume \( P(E|H) \) to be 0.1.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch if he's in any field other than business administration might be relatively higher, since other fields might align better with his characteristics. Let's assign \( P(E|\neg H) \) to be 0.5.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Let's assume a prior probability of being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is 0.2, since it's more specialized.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The probability of having Adam's personality sketch if he's in agricultural and veterinary science is high because his interests align closely with this field. We'll assume \( P(E|H) \) to be 0.8.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the personality sketch if he's in any field other than agricultural and veterinary science would consequently be lower. Letâ€™s assign \( P(E|\neg H) \) to be 0.3.

To keep things consistent, we assume \( P(E) \) is the same regardless of the field as it represents the overall probability of the personality sketch.

Bayes' Rule application:

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.3}{P(E)} = \frac{0.03}{P(E)} \]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.16}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same in both denominators, we can compare the relative probabilities:

Relatively:
\[ P(H|E) \text{ for Agricultural and Veterinary Science} = \frac{0.16}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) \text{ for Business Administration} = \frac{0.03}{P(E)} \]

Weighting these values proportionally, we arrive at:

{
  "business administration": "0.15",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.85"
}

This indicates a much higher probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration, based on his personality sketch.
