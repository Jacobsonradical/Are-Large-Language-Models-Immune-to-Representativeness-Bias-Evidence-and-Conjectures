To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \), we need to apply Bayes' Rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to estimate the following for each field:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing E (Adam's personality sketch) given that H (hypothesis of the field) is true.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing E given that H is not true.

Given we don't have specific statistics, I'll estimate these probabilities based on general trends and logic:

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Business administration is a relatively common field for graduate students.
   - Let’s assume a prior probability of 0.15 for this example.

2. **Probability of E given H \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Adam's personality sketch indicates a strong connection to nature, abstract thinking, and empathy.
   - These traits are not typically aligned with the common perceptions of business administration students.
   - Let’s assign a lower conditional probability, say 0.05.

3. **Probability of E given not H \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - We need to reflect the traits existing over all other possible fields of graduate study.
   - Given the alignment with fields like science, environmental studies, etc., this probability might be moderate.
   - Let's assign it a value of 0.20.

Applying Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Here, \( P(E) \) can be considered a normalization constant, but we don't need to compute its exact value as we are interested in the relative probabilities.

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Agricultural and veterinary science is less common but still significant among graduate fields.
   - Let’s assume a prior probability of 0.10 for this example.

2. **Probability of E given H \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Adam's traits strongly align with agricultural and veterinary sciences, considering his love for nature, plants, animals, and strong empathy.
   - Let’s assign a high conditional probability, say 0.70.

3. **Probability of E given not H \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - Reflects the likelihood that someone studying outside agriculture and veterinary sciences would display these traits.
   - Let’s assign 0.15 based on the spread over other fields.

Applying Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.70 \cdot 0.10}{P(E)} \]

### Summary

Now comparing the relative results (we don't need to actually compute \( P(E) \) as it is a common denominator for all fields):

1. Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \approx 0.0075 \]

2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.70 \cdot 0.10}{P(E)} \approx 0.07 \]

Both values are hypothetical but reflect the relative likelihood given Adam's personality. Normalizing would suggest that he is significantly more likely to be enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science than in Business Administration.

Here's the structured answer:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0075,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.07
}
```

These are relative and hypothetical illustrative values based on the given information and assumptions.
