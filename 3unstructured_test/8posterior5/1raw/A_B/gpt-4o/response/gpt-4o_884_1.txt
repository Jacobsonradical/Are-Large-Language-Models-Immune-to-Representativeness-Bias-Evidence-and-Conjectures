Let's start by evaluating the probabilities for each hypothesis.

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: The probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. This is generally lower given the personality sketch favoring nature and animals. But business administration is a common field, so let's assume:
   \[
   P(H_{BA}) = 0.1
   \]

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam is in business administration. His empathy and understanding might be beneficial, but his deep love for animals and nature is less aligned with business administration. Let’s say:
   \[
   P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.05
   \]

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam is not in business administration. This value will be higher, considering that there are other more aligned fields such as agricultural and veterinary science. Let’s estimate:
   \[
   P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.4
   \]

Given these values, we can calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]
\[
P(E) = (0.05 \cdot 0.1) + (0.4 \cdot 0.9) = 0.005 + 0.36 = 0.365
\]
\[
P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{0.365} \approx 0.0137
\]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: The probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his love for animals and nature, this seems quite plausible. Let’s set:
   \[
   P(H_{AVS}) = 0.3
   \]

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science. This aligns closely with his curiosity about nature and love for animals. Thus:
   \[
   P(E|H_{AVS}) = 0.8
   \]

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science. This would be influenced by other fields, so let’s set:
   \[
   P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) = 0.2
   \]

Given these values, we can calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule:
\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]
\[
P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.3) + (0.2 \cdot 0.7) = 0.24 + 0.14 = 0.38
\]
\[
P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.3}{0.38} \approx 0.6316
\]

### Summary

The estimates for \( P(H|E) \) are as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0137,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6316
}
```

These values represent the probability that Adam was enrolled in either field given his personality sketch E.
