To apply Bayes' rule, we need to break down and estimate the required probabilities.

Let’s take each of the fields:

1. **Agricultural and veterinary science (H₁)**
2. **Business administration (H₂)**

The prior probabilities \( P(H₁) \) and \( P(H₂) \) are the initial assumptions about Adam's enrollment before considering the additional evidence \( E \). We assume these to be roughly equal since we start without additional context, but you can adjust based on specific university data or general trends.

Here’s how we'd estimate each probability:

1. **Agricultural and veterinary science (H₁)**
    - Prior probability \( P(H₁) \): Suppose we assume a relatively moderate likelihood, given Adam’s traits: 0.3.
    - Likelihood \( P(E|H₁) \): Adam’s curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work fit well with agricultural and veterinary science, so we can give this a high value: 0.9.
    - Probability of evidence given not \( H \): This is the likelihood that Adam's personality sketch holds if he is not enrolled in agricultural/veterinary sciences. Given his traits, which are less strongly associated with other fields, let’s estimate it lower: 0.3.

2. **Business administration (H₂)**
    - Prior probability \( P(H₂) \): Assuming equal initial likelihood: 0.3.
    - Likelihood \( P(E|H₂) \): Adam’s traits poorly align with the stereotypical qualities for business administration, so give this a low value: 0.1.
    - Probability of evidence given not \( H \): This is the likelihood that Adam's personality sketch holds if he is not enrolled in business administration. We estimate it higher, assuming many fields can overlap: 0.6.

Using Bayes' rule, \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \), where \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E| \neg H)P(\neg H) \).

Calculate normalized posterior probabilities:

1. **Agricultural and veterinary science**

\[
P(H₁|E) = \frac{P(E|H₁) \cdot P(H₁)}{P(E|H₁) \cdot P(H₁) + P(E|\neg H₁) \cdot P(\neg H₁)}
\]

\[
P(H₁|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.3}{0.9 \cdot 0.3 + 0.3 \cdot 0.7} = \frac{0.27}{0.27 + 0.21} = \frac{0.27}{0.48} \approx 0.5625
\]

2. **Business administration**

\[
P(H₂|E) = \frac{P(E|H₂) \cdot P(H₂)}{P(E|H₂) \cdot P(H₂) + P(E|\neg H₂) \cdot P(\neg H₂)}
\]

\[
P(H₂|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.3}{0.1 \cdot 0.3 + 0.6 \cdot 0.7} = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.42} = \frac{0.03}{0.45} \approx 0.0667
\]
