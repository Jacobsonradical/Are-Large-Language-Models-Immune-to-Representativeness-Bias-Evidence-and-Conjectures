To estimate the probabilities, we first consider the components involved:
- P(H): The prior probability that Adam is in the specified field.
- P(E|H): The probability of the evidence (E) given that Adam is in the specified field (H).
- P(E|¬H): The probability of the evidence (E) given that Adam is not in the specified field (¬H).

Assumptions:
1. **P(H)**: We don't have specific information about the general distribution of graduate students across fields, so we'll assume a somewhat uniform prior across various possible fields. For simplicity, let's assign \(P(H) = 0.1\) for both fields. The cumulative probability of other possible fields will sum to the remaining 0.8.

2. **P(E|H)**: This is the likelihood of the evidence given the specified field:
    - For **business administration**, the evidence here does not strongly suggest a business administration field. Given Adam's attributes (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, intelligence, abstract thinking, and teamwork), the fit is weak. Let's estimate \(P(E|H) = 0.05\).
    - For **agricultural and veterinary science**, the evidence fits well with this field due to Adam's strong interest in nature and animals. Thus, \(P(E|H) = 0.6\).

3. **P(E|¬H)**: This is the general likelihood of the evidence without conditioning on any specific field. Given Adam's attributes, they might better align with fields such as biological sciences, environmental sciences, or psychology rather than business. Let's estimate \(P(E|¬H) = 0.2\).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]
\[ P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) \]

Let's compute for each field.

### Business Administration
1. Prior probability \(P(H) = 0.1\)
2. Likelihood \(P(E|H) = 0.05\)
3. General evidence likelihood \(P(E|¬H) = 0.2\)
4. Complementary prior \(P(¬H) = 0.9\)
\[ P(E) = 0.05 \times 0.1 + 0.2 \times 0.9 = 0.005 + 0.18 = 0.185 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.1}{0.185} \approx \frac{0.005}{0.185} \approx 0.027 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. Prior probability \(P(H) = 0.1\)
2. Likelihood \(P(E|H) = 0.6\)
3. General evidence likelihood \(P(E|¬H) = 0.2\)
4. Complementary prior \(P(¬H) = 0.9\)
\[ P(E) = 0.6 \times 0.1 + 0.2 \times 0.9 = 0.06 + 0.18 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.1}{0.24} \approx \frac{0.06}{0.24} = 0.25 \]

Based on these computations, the posterior probabilities are:
