To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to consider the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence under the null hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H) \). Bayes' Rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We can omit the denominator \( P(E) \) since it will cancel out when comparing the hypotheses, simply using:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Let's assess each step for the two fields and then compare their relative likelihoods.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **Prior \( P(H) \):** This is the prior probability that Adam is in this field. Given his characteristics, a passion for nature, plants, and animals, this seems reasonably high. Let's assume:
   \[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.2 \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** Given Adam's profile, it is highly likely that his interest in nature, animals, and empathy fits well with this field.
   \[ P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.8 \]

3. **Evidence under null hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H) \):** This is the probability of observing Adam's profile if he were not in this field. This might be lower due to the specific nature of his interests.
   \[ P(E|\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.3 \]

### Business Administration
1. **Prior \( P(H) \):** This is the prior probability that Adam is in this field. Given his traits, this seems less likely. Let's assume:
   \[ P(\text{business administration}) = 0.1 \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** Given Adam's profile, his characteristics do not strongly suggest a fit for business administration. However, some empathetic and intelligent individuals might choose this field.
   \[ P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.3 \]

3. **Evidence under null hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H) \):** This is the probability of observing Adam's profile if he were not in business administration, which would likely be higher.
   \[ P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) = 0.7 \]

### Compute \( P(H|E) \)

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   \[
   P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \propto P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})
   \]
   \[ = 0.8 \cdot 0.2 = 0.16 \]

2. **Business Administration:**
   \[
   P(\text{business administration}|E) \propto P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})
   \]
   \[ = 0.3 \cdot 0.1 = 0.03 \]

So relative to each other:

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \approx 0.16 \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) \approx 0.03 \]

_Note that these are comparative values and not absolute probabilities._

Therefore, our approximate values are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.16,
  "business administration": 0.03
}
```
