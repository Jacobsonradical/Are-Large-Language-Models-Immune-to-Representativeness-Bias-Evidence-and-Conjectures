Sure, I will follow the Bayesian framework to determine the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field of specialization given the personality sketch of Adam.

Given:
- \(P(H)\) = the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \(P(E|H)\) = the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in that field.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\) = the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in that field.
- \(P(H|E)\) = the posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in that field given his personality sketch.

For the sake of this problem, let’s assume the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) are equal for both fields, as we don’t have enough information to unequally weigh them. So \( P(H) = 0.5 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. \( P(H) \): Probability of being enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science
   \[
   P(H) = 0.5
   \]

2. \( P(E|H) \): Probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy, this probability should be quite high.
   \[
   P(E|H) = 0.9
   \]

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is not enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. This will be lower as his traits align more with this field compared to the general population.
   \[
   P(E|\neg H) = 0.2
   \]

Using Bayes’ Rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.5}{0.9 \cdot 0.5 + 0.2 \cdot 0.5}
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.45}{0.45 + 0.1}
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.45}{0.55}
\]
\[
P(H|E) \approx 0.818
\]

### Business Administration

1. \( P(H) \): Probability of being enrolled in Business Administration
   \[
   P(H) = 0.5
   \]

2. \( P(E|H) \): Probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in Business Administration. This field does not typically align with his love for animals and nature, so this probability will be lower.
   \[
   P(E|H) = 0.2
   \]

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is not enrolled in Business Administration. Since his traits don’t quite align with Business Administration, this probability remains moderate.
   \[
   P(E|\neg H) = 0.3
   \]

Using Bayes’ Rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.5}{0.2 \cdot 0.5 + 0.3 \cdot 0.5}
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.1 + 0.15}
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.25}
\]
\[
P(H|E) = 0.4
\]

Based on the above calculations, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.818,
  "business administration": 0.4
}
```
