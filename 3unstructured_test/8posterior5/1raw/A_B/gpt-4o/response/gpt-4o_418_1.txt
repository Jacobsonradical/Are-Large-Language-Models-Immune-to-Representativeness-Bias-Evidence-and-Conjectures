To apply Bayes' rule, we need to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since the total does not need to add up to 1, we can simply compare the relative posterior probabilities without normalizing if only two hypotheses are considered. 

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **Estimate Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**
   This is our prior belief about the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in each field.
   
   - **Agricultural and veterinary science**: Let's assume a relatively higher prior, given Adam's interest in nature and animals, say \( P(H_{avs}) = 0.3 \).
   - **Business administration**: Let's assume a lower prior considering Adam's personality traits do not align closely with typical traits pursued in business administration, say \( P(H_{ba}) = 0.1 \).

2. **Estimate Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)** 
   This is the probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that hypothesis \( H \) is true.
   
   - **Agricultural and veterinary science**: High likelihood given Adam's traits. \( P(E|H_{avs}) = 0.8 \).
   - **Business administration**: Lower likelihood as his traits do not strongly match this field. \( P(E|H_{ba}) = 0.2 \).

3. **Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \)**
   This is more complex as it entails the probability of observing \( E \) if not enrolled in \( H \). However, for comparative purposes, we can assume rough estimates as follows:
   
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{avs}) \): Other fields might partially align with his traits. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{avs}) = 0.4 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{ba}) \): Similar reasoning, assume \( P(E|\neg H_{ba}) = 0.5 \).

4. **Compute \( P(E) \)**
   Given that it appears in the denominator and is more complex, we can skip explicit computation for comparison unless precision is required. We divide by it implicitly.

### Bayes' Rule

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

### Calculation

1. **Agricultural and veterinary science**: 

\[
P(H_{avs}|E) \propto P(E|H_{avs}) \cdot P(H_{avs}) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24
\]

2. **Business administration**:

\[
P(H_{ba}|E) \propto P(E|H_{ba}) \cdot P(H_{ba}) = 0.2 \cdot 0.1 = 0.02
\]

We compare these two values relatively.

### Posterior Probability Estimates

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.24,
  "business administration": 0.02
}
```

These estimates indicate that given the evidence \( E \), Adam is much more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration.
