To compute the probabilities of Adam being enrolled in a specific field using Bayes' Theorem, we need the following probabilities:

1. **P(H)**: Initial probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field (prior probability).
2. **P(E|H)**: Probability of the evidence (Adam's personality sketch) given that he was enrolled in a specific field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability of the evidence given that he was not enrolled in that specific field.
4. **P(H|E)**: Probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given the evidence (posterior probability).

Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that information, let's evaluate each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: Let's assume this to be a relatively reasonable prior probability for a graduate student with a focus on nature, plants, and animals. We can set this to, say, 0.1.
2. **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's strong affinity for nature, plants, animals, and curiosity about nature, P(E|H) should be high. Let's set this to 0.8.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: This is the probability that Adam's traits match the personality sketch given all fields that are not agricultural and veterinary science. This is likely lower, but considering many fields require empathy and intelligence, let's set this to 0.4.
4. **P(E)**: Overall, P(E) can be approximated as a weighted sum of likelihoods across all possible fields. For simplicity, let's assume P(E) = 0.5.

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that a student selected at random is in business administration. Let's set this to be 0.2, considering a decent number of students pursue this field.
2. **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's traits, this probability should be lower, as interest in nature, animals, and solving puzzles isnâ€™t as aligned with business administration. Let's set this to 0.2.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: This remains the same as above. P(E|\neg H) = 0.4.
4. **P(E)**: As before, P(E) = 0.5.

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.5} = 0.16 \]

### Business Administration

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.5} = 0.08 \]

Consolidating these into the requested format:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.16,
  "business administration": 0.08
}
