To calculate \( P(H|E) \), we need to use Bayes' theorem, which is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(H) \) for each specialization isn't specified directly, I will assume a uniform prior \( P(H) \) for the purpose of this exercise. Additionally, \( P(E) \) is the normalization factor and doesn't need to be specifically computed for relative comparison. Therefore, I'll focus on \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Let's consider Adam's personality sketch \( E \) and how well it fits with each field.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - **P(H)**: Without specific priors, assume equal probabilities for all fields being considered, so let's assume as a starting point \( P(H) = 0.5 \).
   - **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and interest in understanding complex topics, there's a high likelihood he fits well in this field. Let's estimate it at \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of someone with Adam's specific interests and personality being in a field outside of agricultural and veterinary science, assuming all other fields are equally likely, might be lower. Let's estimate it at \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

\[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} \]

2. **Business Administration:**
   - **P(H)**: Using the same uniform prior, \( P(H) = 0.5 \).
   - **P(E|H)**: Adam's personality traits — curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy — don't strongly align with typical interests in business administration. Let's estimate it at \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: Given the other possibilities, the fit outside business admin given Adam's interests may be somewhat higher than within. Let’s estimate it at \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \).

\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is used for normalization across all probabilities, we only need the numerators for a relative comparison.

Thus, we can say:

\[ 
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} = 0.4,
  "business administration": \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} = 0.1
}
\]

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
