To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in each field given his personality sketch using Bayes' Theorem, we need to evaluate the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in that field.

Bayes' Rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, we'll assume:
- The prior probabilities for each field are equally likely, since we do not have data suggesting otherwise. Therefore, \( P(H) = 0.5 \) for each field (since we consider just these two fields in the context).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) for 'agricultural and veterinary science' is the probability of observing Adam's personality if he is not in that field, and similarly for 'business administration'.

Let's estimate these values:

1. **Agricultural and veterinary science:**
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.5 \): Neutral probability without other context.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given that Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, plants, a love for animals, and a warm heart, it is highly likely he could be enrolled in this field. Thus, \( P(E|H) \) might be around \( 0.8 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given that if Adam is not in this field, but considering there are many fields unrelated to nature/plants, this value could be around \( 0.2 \).

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) can be expressed as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Substituting values:
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \times 0.5 + 0.2 \times 0.5 = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

2. **Business administration:**
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.5 \)
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's personality doesnâ€™t strongly correlate with common traits of business administration (interest in nature/animals is a weak indicator), so this may be \( 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): If he is not in business administration, observing his characteristics might be more common in other fields like science, thus could be \( 0.5 \).

\[ P(E) = 0.1 \times 0.5 + 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.05 + 0.25 = 0.3 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.5}{0.3} \approx 0.17 \]

Thus, we have:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.17
}
