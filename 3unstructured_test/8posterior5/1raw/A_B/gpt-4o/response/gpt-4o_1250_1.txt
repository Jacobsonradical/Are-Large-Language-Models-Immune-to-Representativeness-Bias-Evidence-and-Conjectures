Certainly! Let's proceed by estimating the probabilities for each field based on Adam's personality sketch.

### **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam would be enrolled in this field. Given Adam's strong affinity for nature, plants, animals, and his appreciation for hard work, it is somewhat likely he would be in this field.
  \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \)

- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in this field. Since his traits align very well with typical characteristics of someone in this field, this probability should be quite high.
  \( P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \)

- **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in this field. Since there are other fields that might also align with some of his traits, this is lower but still possible.
  \( P(E|¬H) \approx 0.3 \)

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot (1 - P(H))} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.3}{0.9 \cdot 0.3 + 0.3 \cdot 0.7} = \frac{0.27}{0.27 + 0.21} ≈ \frac{0.27}{0.48} ≈ 0.5625 \]

### **Business Administration**
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam would be enrolled in this field. Based on his personality sketch, the likelihood that Adam would be in this field seems lower given his evident passion for nature and animals, which are less central to this field.
  \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \)

- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in this field. Since his personality does not strongly align with typical traits of someone in business administration, this value should be lower.
  \( P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \)

- **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in this field. This could be aligned more with other fields.
  \( P(E|¬H) \approx 0.35 \)

Using Bayes' rule again:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot (1 - P(H))} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.35 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.315} ≈ \frac{0.02}{0.335} ≈ 0.0597 \]

So our final answers are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5625,
  "business administration": 0.0597
}
```
