We can approach this problem by breaking it down using Bayes' Rule. Bayes' Rule states that:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.
\( P(E|H) \) is the probability that we would observe the given personality sketch (E) if Adam were enrolled in that field.
\( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability that we would observe the personality sketch if Adam were not enrolled in that field.

We'll evaluate \( P(H|E) \) for the fields of:
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- Business Administration

Let's make reasonable assumptions to judge our probabilities:

### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H):** Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, which aligns well with a field in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume the prior probability is relatively higher than average. We might estimate \( P(H) = 0.1 \) (10%).
- **P(E|H):** Given that Adam is in this field, his characteristics strongly align with what you would expect from someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. So, let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \) (80%).
- **P(E|\neg H):** For other fields, the probability of having the same personality sketch is lower because his characteristics are highly specific to nature and animals. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.05 \) (5%).

### 2. Business Administration
- **P(H):** Adam's characteristics are not highly indicative of a typical business administration student. Let's assume the prior probability is lower. We might estimate \( P(H) = 0.05 \) (5%).
- **P(E|H):** Even if Adam were in business administration, his personality sketch is less typical for this field. So, let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \) (10%).
- **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of observing the personality sketch in fields other than business administration is higher than \( P(E|H) \) for business administration but lower than \( P(E|H) \) for agricultural science. We might assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \) (10%).

Now let's calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.8 \times 0.1 + 0.05 \times 0.9} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.045} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.125} \]

\[ P(H|E) = 0.64 \] (or 64%)

### For Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.05}{0.1 \times 0.05 + 0.10 \times 0.95} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.095} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.1} \]

\[ P(H|E) = 0.05 \] (or 5%)
