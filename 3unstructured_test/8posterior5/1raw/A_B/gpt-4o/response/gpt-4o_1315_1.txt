Sure, let's walk through the logic using Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For each field:

1. **Business Administration (H1)**
   - **P(H1)**: The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in business administration.
   - **P(E|H1)**: The probability of the personality sketch if Adam were enrolled in business administration.
   - **P(E|\neg H1)**: The probability of the personality sketch if Adam were not enrolled in business administration.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H2)**
   - **P(H2)**: The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - **P(E|H2)**: The probability of the personality sketch if Adam were enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - **P(E|\neg H2)**: The probability of the personality sketch if Adam were not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Let's start with some judgments on the probabilities:

### 1. Business Administration
- **P(H1)**: Let's assume business administration is a common field, say **0.2** (20% prior).
- **P(E|H1)**: The personality traits described (love for nature, puzzles, empathy, animals) do not strongly align with typical business administration traits. Let's assume a low probability, say **0.1**.
- **P(E|\neg H1)**: The probability of the personality sketch among non-business administration students might be higher as other fields (like natural sciences) might attract such personalities. Let's assume **0.5**.

### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H2)**: Given that this is a more specialized field, let's assume a lower prior probability, say **0.05** (5% prior).
- **P(E|H2)**: The personality sketch strongly aligns with this field (interest in nature, plants, animals). Let's assume a high probability, say **0.8**.
- **P(E|\neg H2)**: The probability of the personality sketch among non-agricultural and veterinary science students would be lower. Let's assume **0.3**.

Now, let's compute the posterior probabilities using Bayes' theorem:

### Business Administration
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.02}{P(E)} \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} = \frac{0.04}{P(E)} \]

**Summarizing the probabilities**

```json
{
  "business administration":  0.02 / (0.02 + 0.04),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.04 / (0.02 + 0.04)
}
```

To normalize the above,

For business administration:
\[ P(H1|E) \approx \frac{0.02}{0.06} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.33 \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H2|E) \approx \frac{0.04}{0.06} = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.67 \]

So the answer is:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.33,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.67
}
```
