To determine the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the given fields using Bayes' rule, we need to consider:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a certain field without any information about his personality.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in a certain field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in a certain field.

Let's begin by setting up reasonable estimates for these probabilities:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- \( P(H) \): Assume there is a relatively low number of students in this field compared to all possible fields, but it correlates well with Adam's interest closely described in the personality sketch. Let's estimate \( P(H) \) as 0.05.
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's characteristics, there is a high probability he'd be in this field because it matches his interests in nature, animals, and empathy. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) as 0.7.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of someone with Adam's personality traits not being in Agricultural and Veterinary Science but still having such a profile can be lower. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) as 0.2.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we need \( P(E) \) (the overall likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \)), which is:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.035 + 0.19 = 0.225 \]

Now, calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{0.225} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.035}{0.225} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.156 \]

### Business Administration

- \( P(H) \): Business Administration is a more common graduate field, so we might estimate \( P(H) \) as 0.2.
- \( P(E|H) \): Adam's personality traits do not closely match this field, so \( P(E|H) \) might be low. Let's estimate it as 0.1.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam having this profile and not being in Business Administration would be higher given other fields that match better with his traits. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) as 0.25.

Using the same process:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.25 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.2 = 0.22 \]

Now, calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.22} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.22} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.091 \]
