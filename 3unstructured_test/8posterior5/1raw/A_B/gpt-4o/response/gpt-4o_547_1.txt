To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we first need to understand the components:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the evidence given that Adam is in the specified field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the evidence given that Adam is not in the specified field.

We'll assume the following:

### Business Administration:
1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\):** Business Administration is a common graduate field, so let's assume \(P(H) = 0.3\).
2. **\(P(E|H)\):** Business Administration doesn't inherently involve nature, plants, or animals, and typically attracts those interested in commerce rather than natural sciences. Therefore, let's assume \(P(E|H) = 0.1\).
3. **\(P(E|\neg H)\):** Out of all possible fields excluding Business Administration, those traits associated with Adam are more likely to be found in other fields such as natural sciences or veterinary studies. Let's assume \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.5\) (to reflect these other fields collectively accounting for a good chance).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\):** While this field is less common than Business Administration, it is specifically relevant given Adam's interests. Let's assume \(P(H) = 0.1\).
2. **\(P(E|H)\):** Given Adam's interests in nature, animals, and plants, these traits are highly consistent with Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Hence, let's assume \(P(E|H) = 0.9\).
3. **\(P(E|\neg H)\):** Excluding Agricultural and Veterinary Science, his profile still has some probability in remaining fields, but significantly less so. Let's assume \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.4\).

Now we compute \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \(P(E)\) can be found using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]

### For Business Administration:
\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7 \]
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.3) + (0.5 \times 0.7) = 0.03 + 0.35 = 0.38 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.3}{0.38} \approx 0.079 \]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = (0.9 \times 0.1) + (0.4 \times 0.9) = 0.09 + 0.36 = 0.45 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.1}{0.45} \approx 0.2 \]

Therefore, the probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for each field are:
{
  "business administration": 0.079,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.2
}
