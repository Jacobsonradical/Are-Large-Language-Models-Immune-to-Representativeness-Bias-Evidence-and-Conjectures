To solve this problem using Bayes' theorem, we first need to estimate the following probabilities for each field:

- \( P(H) \) : The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \) : The probability of E (Adam's personality sketch) given H (that Adam was enrolled in that field).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) : The probability of E (Adam's personality sketch) given ¬H (that Adam was not enrolled in that field).

Bayes' Theorem to compute \( P(H|E) \) is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, because \( P(E) \) can be cumbersome to estimate directly, we often approximate or work with comparative likelihood ratios.

Let's make some rough estimations:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability: \( P(H) \)**
   - Let's assume graduate students are reasonably distributed across fields. Agricultural and veterinary science is a specialized field, probably attracting fewer students than more general fields like business.
   - Estimate: 0.05

2. **Probability of E given H: \( P(E|H) \)**
   - Given Adam's personality, enjoying nature, plants, animals, and having empathy, this field aligns very well.
   - Estimate: 0.8

3. **Probability of E given ¬H: \( P(E|\neg H) \)**
   - Given his personality, such a combination is less likely if he isn't in agricultural and veterinary science, although not impossible. Many other fields might not align as well.
   - Estimate: 0.1

\[ P(H|E) \text{ for Agricultural and Veterinary Science} \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{\text{P(E)}} \]

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability: \( P(H) \)**
   - Business administration has a large number of students.
   - Estimate: 0.1

2. **Probability of E given H: \( P(E|H) \)**
   - Adam's traits don’t align as naturally with typical traits expected in business administration. His love for nature, animals, and empathy are less directly related to this field.
   - Estimate: 0.1

3. **Probability of E given ¬H: \( P(E|\neg H) \)**
   - Adam's personality is more likely if he isn't in business administration.
   - Estimate: 0.2

\[ P(H|E) \text{ for Business Administration} \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{\text{P(E)}} \]

### Normalization

Since we are comparing relative likelihoods, normalize our outputs to ensure consistency in comparison:

\[ \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{\text{P(E)}} \approx 0.04 \]
\[ \frac{0.1 \times 0.1}{\text{P(E)}} \approx 0.01 \]

When dividing by the common factor \( P(E) \), we only need the relative proportions here.

### Final Answer:
\[ \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.01} \approx 0.80 \]
\[ \frac{0.01}{0.04 + 0.01} \approx 0.20 \]

Here is the formatted response:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.80,
  "business administration": 0.20
}
