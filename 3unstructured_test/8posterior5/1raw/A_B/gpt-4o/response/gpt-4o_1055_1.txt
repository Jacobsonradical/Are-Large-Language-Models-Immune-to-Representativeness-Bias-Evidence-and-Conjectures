Let's break this down using Bayes' Theorem, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, we need to estimate the following:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of being enrolled in each field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam having the given personality sketch if he was enrolled in each field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam having the given personality sketch if he was not enrolled in each field.

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \), we will focus on relative probabilities based on qualitative reasoning. Note that these are subjective estimates.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science might be somewhat moderate, as graduate programs in the U.S. cover a broad range of fields.
- **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy, the probability of Adam having the personality sketch given his enrollment in this field is quite high. 
- **P(E|\neg H)**: If Adam is not in this field, the probability of him having such a personality sketch could be significantly lower, as these traits are very well-aligned with agricultural and veterinary science.

### Business Administration

- **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration might be moderate given the large number of MBA programs.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam having the personality sketch given his enrollment in business administration is likely lower because the personality traits described do not strongly correlate with the typical skills and interests in business administration.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: If Adam is not in business administration, the probability of him having such a personality sketch could be moderately high, considering his traits align more with fields like agricultural and veterinary science.

Based on these arguments, let's assign some rough subjective probabilities:

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): 0.3
- \( P(E|H) \): 0.8
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): 0.2

#### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): 0.3
- \( P(E|H) \): 0.2
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): 0.7

Now let's calculate the posterior probabilities:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \]

2. **Business Administration**

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \times 0.3 = 0.06 \]

Normalizing these values to ensure they sum to 1:

\[ P(H|E_{agricultural}) = \frac{0.24}{0.24 + 0.06} = \frac{0.24}{0.30} = 0.8 \]

\[ P(H|E_{business}) = \frac{0.06}{0.24 + 0.06} = \frac{0.06}{0.30} = 0.2 \]

So the final results are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```
