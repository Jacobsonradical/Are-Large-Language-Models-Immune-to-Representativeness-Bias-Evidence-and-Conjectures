To solve this problem using Bayes' rule, we need to assign probabilities to the given hypotheses and calculate the probabilities based on the evidence provided. Let’s start by denoting:

- \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration
- \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science
- \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given he was enrolled in business administration
- \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \): The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \): The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given he was not enrolled in business administration
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \): The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given he was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science

Let's assign values based on the personality sketch:

1. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): Priors are not specified, but we assume a lower prior since Adam's personality sketch doesn't strongly align with typical business administration interests.
   - \(P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): The likelihood is lower since business administration does not typically involve strong connections to nature and empathy for animals.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \): This is higher because the personality traits are less typical for business administration students.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \): Priors are not specified, but we assume a higher prior given Adam’s interests align more closely with this field.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \): The likelihood is higher since this field is closely related to nature, plants, and animals.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \): This is lower because the personality traits are quite typical for agricultural and veterinary science students.

We'll need approximate quantitative values for these probabilities. Let's estimate:

### Business Administration
- \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.8 \)

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.9 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.4 \)

We'll use Bayes' Rule to compute \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For each hypothesis, \( P(E) \) can be simplified as follows:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

### Calculations

#### Business Administration
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.8 \cdot 0.9) = 0.02 + 0.72 = 0.74 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.74} \approx 0.027 \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.3) + (0.4 \cdot 0.7) = 0.27 + 0.28 = 0.55 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.3}{0.55} \approx 0.491 \]

Now, output the final probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.027,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.491
}
