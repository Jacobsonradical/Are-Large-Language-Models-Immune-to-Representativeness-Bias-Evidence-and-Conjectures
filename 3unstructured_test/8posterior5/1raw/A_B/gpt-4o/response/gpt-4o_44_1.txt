To calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we'll utilize Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field, \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of Adam having the personality sketch \( E \) given he was enrolled in that field, and \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of Adam having the personality sketch \( E \) given he was not enrolled in that field.

Since we do not have exact values, we'll make reasonable estimates based on the information provided:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

**Assumptions:**
1. **P(H)**: Let's assume a modest probability of 0.05 that any random graduate student is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
2. **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's appreciation for nature, strong empathy, and love for animals, it is highly likely that his personality sketch fits this field. We'll assume 0.9.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: For those not in this field, considering many other possible fields, we might assume a lower probability. Letâ€™s assume 0.1.

### Business Administration

**Assumptions:**
1. **P(H)**: Business Administration is a popular field, so let's assume a higher prior of 0.2.
2. **P(E|H)**: Adam's personality does not quite align with the typical traits of someone in Business Administration. We'll be generous and assume 0.2.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: For those not in Business Administration, it's still possible to have Adam's traits but we'd think it's higher than in-agricultural. So we might assume 0.4.

Now let's calculate \( P(H|E) \):

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) = \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H)) \)

\[ P(E) = 0.9 \cdot 0.05 + 0.1 \cdot 0.95 \]

\[ P(E) = 0.045 + 0.095 = 0.14 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.14} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.321 \]

### Business Administration

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) = \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H)) \)

\[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8 \]

\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.32 = 0.36 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.36} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.111 \]
