To calculate \( P(H|E) \) for both fields using Bayes' Rule, we'll need to consider the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in that specific field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in that specific field.

Then we can use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant which would be the same for all hypotheses considered here, we can compare the unnormalized posterior probabilities without explicitly computing \( P(E) \).

Let's assign some reasonable estimates for these probabilities based on the provided information:

1. **Business Administration:** 
   - \( P(H) \) (Prior Probability): Let's assume a typical graduate student has a reasonable chance of being in Business Administration.
     - \( P(H) \approx 0.10 \)
   - \( P(E|H) \) (Likelihood of E given H): A student in Business Administration is less likely to match Adam's personality sketch.
     - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.05 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \) (Likelihood of E given not H): Since Adam's personality sketch fits better with non-business students, this may be relatively higher.
     - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.15 \)

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H) \) (Prior Probability): This is a less common field but due to Adam's characteristics, this prior can be a bit higher.
     - \( P(H) \approx 0.05 \)
   - \( P(E|H) \) (Likelihood of E given H): Adam's personality fits well with someone in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
     - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.70 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \) (Likelihood of E given not H): Less likely if not in this field, considering the fit.
     - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.10 \)

Now, using Bayes' Rule (skipping normalizing constant):

1. **Business Administration:**
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.05 \cdot 0.10 = 0.005 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.70 \cdot 0.05 = 0.035 \]

So the unnormalized probabilities suggest that Adam is much more likely to be in Agricultural and Veterinary Science than in Business Administration.

Therefore, the final results are:

{
  "business administration": 0.005,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.035
}

These results indicate that given Adam's personality sketch, he is considerably more likely to be enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science than in Business Administration, even though these numbers are not normalized to actual probabilistic values summing to 1.
