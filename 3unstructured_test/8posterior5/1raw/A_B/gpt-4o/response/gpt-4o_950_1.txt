Let's walk through the steps to compute \( P(H|E) \) for both fields using Bayes' rule. Here’s the process laid out in detail:

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant and needs the value for all possible hypotheses, it is often not specified directly but can be inferred relatively between different hypotheses. Let's define our hypotheses:

1. \( H_1 \): Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
2. \( H_2 \): Adam was enrolled in business administration.

### Hypothesis 1: Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- \( H_1 \): Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- Prior \( P(H_1) \): This field aligns well with Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals. Let's assume a reasonably high prior, say 0.3.
- Likelihood \( P(E|H_1) \): Given Adam's traits, graduating in this field fits very well. Assume a high value, say 0.9.
- \( P(E|\neg H_1) \): The probability of E given Adam is not in this field might be lower but not negligible. Assume 0.5.

Using Bayes’ theorem:

\[ P(H_1|E) \propto P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) = 0.9 \cdot 0.3 = 0.27 \]

### Hypothesis 2: Business Administration

- \( H_2 \): Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- Prior \( P(H_2) \): Adam's personality sketch doesn't strongly suggest a fit with business administration. Assume a lower prior, say 0.1.
- Likelihood \( P(E|H_2) \): Given Adam's interests, it's less likely he would be pursuing business administration. Assume a lower value, say 0.2.
- \( P(E|\neg H_2) \): The probability of E given Adam is not in this field might be higher due to his other traits. Assume 0.7.

Using Bayes’ theorem:

\[ P(H_2|E) \propto P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) = 0.2 \cdot 0.1 = 0.02 \]

Since these probabilities are proportional and need to be normalized, we should note the relative strength between them. Let's compute the proportional values:

\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.27}{0.27 + 0.02} \approx 0.93 \]
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.27 + 0.02} \approx 0.07 \]

Thus, our final answer in the requested format would be:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.93,
  "business administration": 0.07
}
