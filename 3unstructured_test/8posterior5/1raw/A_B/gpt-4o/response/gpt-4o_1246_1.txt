To make the computations, we need to assess the probabilities in each field. Here's a step-by-step breakdown according to the provided data.

For each field, we'll denote:
- \(P(H)\): Initial probability of Adam being enrolled in that field (prior probability).
- \(P(E | H)\): Probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is in that field (likelihood).
- \(P(E | \neg H)\): Probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not in that field (complement likelihood).

From Bayes' rule:
\[P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

Since \(P(E)\) is constant across all fields and our goal is to compare the relative probabilities, we can use the following proportionality (ignoring \(P(E)\)):
\[P(H | E) \propto P(E | H) \cdot P(H)\]

Assumptions and rough estimates:
- \(P(H)\): Let's assume a uniform prior probability since specific enrollment probabilities for each field aren't provided (this is a simplifying assumption).
  - For business administration, \(P(H) \approx 0.1\)
  - For agricultural and veterinary science, \(P(H) \approx 0.05\)

We need to estimate \(P(E|H)\) and \(P(E|\neg H)\):
- \(P(E|H_{ba})\) (likelihood for business administration) might be lower since the personality traits listed (nature curiosity, love for animals, empathy) aren't typical of a business administration student.
  - Let's assume \(P(E|H_{ba}) = 0.1\)
- \(P(E|\neg H_{ba})\) could be higher considering similar characteristics could be found in other fields.
  - Let's assume \(P(E|\neg H_{ba}) = 0.7\)

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- \(P(E|H_{avs})\) (likelihood for agricultural and veterinary science) would likely be high since Adam's traits align well with this field (love for nature, animals).
  - Let's assume \(P(E|H_{avs}) = 0.8\)
- \(P(E|\neg H_{avs})\) would be lower compared to other fields.
  - Let's assume \(P(E|\neg H_{avs}) = 0.3\)

Using Bayes' rule (in the proportional form):

For Business Administration:
\[P(H_{ba} | E) \propto P(E | H_{ba}) \cdot P(H_{ba}) = 0.1 \cdot 0.1 = 0.01\]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[P(H_{avs} | E) \propto P(E | H_{avs}) \cdot P(H_{avs}) = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04\]

Normalizing so the total sum of these probabilities equals 1 for comparison:
\[
P(H_{ba} | E) \approx \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.04} = 0.2
\]
\[
P(H_{avs} | E) \approx \frac{0.04}{0.01 + 0.04} = 0.8
\]

Therefore, we have:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
