To solve this problem, we need to evaluate the probabilities \( P(H) \) (prior probability), \( P(E|H) \) (likelihood), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) (likelihood under the complement hypothesis) for both fields: business administration and agricultural and veterinary science. We'll then use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \).

### Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \), the denominator can be ignored for the relative comparison.

Let's denote:
- \( H_{BA} \) for business administration
- \( H_{AVS} \) for agricultural and veterinary science

### Probabilities:
Without specific numerical data, we'll make reasonable assumptions based on common knowledge about these fields and Adam's personality.

#### Business Administration:
- **\( P(H_{BA}) \)**: The prior probability that a U.S. graduate student would be in business administration. Let's assume \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.1 \).
- **\( P(E|H_{BA}) \)**: The likelihood of Adam's characteristics given he is in business administration. Given Adam's interest in nature, empathy, animals, and abstract thinking, this likelihood seems relatively low. Let's assume \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.1 \).
- **\( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \)**: The likelihood of Adam's characteristics for all other fields. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.5 \).

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- **\( P(H_{AVS}) \)**: The prior probability that a U.S. graduate student would be in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume \( P(H_{AVS}) = 0.05 \).
- **\( P(E|H_{AVS}) \)**: The likelihood of Adam's characteristics given he is in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, love for animals, and empathy, this likelihood is very high. Let's assume \( P(E|H_{AVS}) = 0.9 \).
- **\( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \)**: The likelihood of Adam's characteristics for all other fields. Let's again assume \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) = 0.5 \).

### Computation using Bayes' Rule:

#### Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.1 = 0.01 \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \propto 0.9 \cdot 0.05 = 0.045 \]

### Normalizing the Values (Optional):
The values do not need to sum to 1, but they should give us a relative idea. 

### Final Answer:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.01,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.045
}
```
Based on these values, Adam is significantly more likely to be in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration given the provided personality sketch.
