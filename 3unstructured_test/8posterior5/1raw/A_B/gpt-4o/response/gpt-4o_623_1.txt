To apply Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the following probabilities:

For each field:
- P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- P(E|H): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was in that field.
- P(E|¬H): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was not in that field.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

### Hypothesis 1: Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- P(H): Let's assume the prior probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is about 0.05 (5%).
- P(E|H): Given Agricultural and Veterinary Science, the personality sketch is a strong match (curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals), so we might estimate this as 0.8.
- P(E|¬H): The probability of the personality sketch being observed given that Adam is not in this field is lower. Let's estimate it as 0.2.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} \]

Since P(E) is hard to estimate directly, it's common to estimate relative probabilities instead of absolute ones. However, P(E) can be seen as the general match of such a sketch among all possible fields, which would be:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.95 = 0.04 + 0.19 = 0.23 \]

So:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.23} = \frac{0.04}{0.23} \approx 0.174 \]

### Hypothesis 2: Business Administration
- P(H): Let's assume the prior probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is enrolled in Business Administration is about 0.1 (10%).
- P(E|H): Given Business Administration, the personality sketch is less aligned. We might estimate this as 0.1.
- P(E|¬H): The probability of the personality sketch being observed given that Adam is not in this field might be higher because the sketch fits better in other fields. Let's estimate it as 0.25.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

\( P(E) \) is already approximated as 0.23, so:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.23} = \frac{0.01}{0.23} \approx 0.043 \]

### Summary
Based on the calculations, we get:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.174,
  "business administration": 0.043
}
