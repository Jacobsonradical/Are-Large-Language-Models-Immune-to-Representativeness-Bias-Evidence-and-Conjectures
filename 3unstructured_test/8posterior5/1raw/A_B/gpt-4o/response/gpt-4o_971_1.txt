To compute the probabilities involved and apply Bayes' rule, let's start by estimating the probabilities and then use these values to compute the posterior probabilities.

Given:
- P(H): Prior probability of Adam being in that field.
- P(E|H): Likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is in that field.
- P(E|\neg H): Likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is *not* in that field.
- P(H|E): Posterior probability of Adam being in that field given the personality sketch.

For the fields "business administration" and "agricultural and veterinary science," we'll start by estimating the priors (P(H)), and conditioned probabilities (P(E|H) and P(E|\neg H)).

### Field: Business Administration
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration. Let's assume this is low because the traits described do not strongly align with typical business administration students. Let's estimate this as 0.05.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in business administration. This might be low to moderate since curiosity and intelligence can be relevant, but empathy and a love for animals are less typical for business students. Let's estimate 0.2.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is *not* in business administration. Since we have many other fields where his traits would be more fitting, this might be higher. Let's estimate 0.8.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Approximating P(E) as the normalization factor for the sketch across all fields:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Here \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.95 \):
\[ P(E) \approx (0.2 \cdot 0.05) + (0.8 \cdot 0.95) = 0.01 + 0.76 = 0.77 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.05}{0.77} = \frac{0.01}{0.77} \approx 0.013 \]

### Field: Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his traits, this is much more likely. We could estimate this as 0.3.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in this field. This is very high due to his love for nature, animals, and empathy. Let's estimate this as 0.9.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is *not* in this field. This, in contrast, might be lower. Let's estimate 0.2.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Approximating P(E):
\[ P(E) \approx (0.9 \cdot 0.3) + (0.2 \cdot 0.7) = 0.27 + 0.14 = 0.41 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.3}{0.41} = \frac{0.27}{0.41} \approx 0.659 \]

Here are the estimates:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.013,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.659
}
```

These estimates show that based on the given personality sketch, it is much more probable that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration.
