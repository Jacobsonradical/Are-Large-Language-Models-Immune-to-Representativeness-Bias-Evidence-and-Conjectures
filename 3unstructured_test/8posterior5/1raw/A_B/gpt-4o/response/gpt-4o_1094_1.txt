To apply Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the probabilities involved. Here's the detailed breakdown:

1. **P(H): The Prior Probability** - The probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field before considering his personality sketch.

2. **P(E|H): The Likelihood** - The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in that field.

3. **P(E|¬H): The Complementary Likelihood** - The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in that field.

4. **P(E): The Marginal Probability** - The total probability of observing Adam's personality sketch across all fields.

5. **P(H|E): The Posterior Probability** - The probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field after considering his personality sketch.

For simplicity, let's assume our base rates (P(H)) for the two fields are equal since we do not have specific prior data about the distribution of graduate students across different fields. This is not necessarily realistic, but it's a common starting point without more data.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- P(H): Reflects the proportion of all graduate students studying agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume this is 0.05 (5%).
- P(E|H): Adam's personality sketch fits well with someone in this field. Let's assign this a high value, say 0.8.
- P(E|¬H): Reflects the probability of encountering someone with Adam's personality sketch in a field other than agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume this is lower, say 0.2.

We can use Bayes' rule as follows:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

With \( \neg H \) representing all other fields, we'll assume the prior for one specific non-listed field is shared equally among all other fields.

### Business Administration

- P(H): Reflects the proportion of all graduate students studying business administration. Let's assume this is 0.1 (10%).
- P(E|H): Adam's personality sketch does not fit well with someone in this field. Let's assign this a lower value, say 0.1.
- P(E|¬H): Reflects the probability of encountering someone with Adam's personality sketch in a field other than business administration. Let's assume this stays at 0.2.

### Calculations

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- P(H) = 0.05
- P(E|H) = 0.8
- P(E|¬H) = 0.2
- P(E) approximated as:
  \[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95) = 0.04 + 0.19 = 0.23 \]
- P(H|E):
  \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.23} = \frac{0.04}{0.23} \approx 0.1739 \]

#### Business Administration
- P(H) = 0.1
- P(E|H) = 0.1
- P(E|¬H) = 0.2
- P(E) approximated as:
  \[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) = 0.01 + 0.18 = 0.19 \]
- P(H|E):
  \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.19} = \frac{0.01}{0.19} \approx 0.0526 \]
