Sure, let's break this down systematically:

1. **Business Administration (H₁)**
   - **P(H₁)**: This is the prior probability that Adam is studying business administration. Given that business administration is a common field, let's assume a moderate prior probability. For simplicity, we can set this at around 0.15.
   - **P(E|H₁)**: This is the probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is in business administration. Given that Adam has a strong connection with nature, empathy for animals, and a love for puzzles, these traits are less typical in business administration students. Let's assign a low probability, say 0.05.
   - **P(E|\neg H₁)**: This is the probability of observing E given that Adam is NOT in business administration. Since there are other fields that better match his personality, let's assume this is relatively higher. We can set it around 0.3.

   Using Bayes' Theorem, \(P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) * P(H)}{P(E)}\):

   Since \(P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)(1 - P(H))\):

   - \(P(E) = 0.05 \times 0.15 + 0.3 \times 0.85 = 0.0075 + 0.255 = 0.2625\)
   - Then, \(P(H₁|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.15}{0.2625} \approx 0.0286 \)

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H₂)**
   - **P(H₂)**: This is the prior probability that Adam is studying agricultural and veterinary science. This field aligns much better with Adam's traits, so we would expect this to be higher, say around 0.2.
   - **P(E|H₂)**: This is the probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his attributes, this is fairly high. Let's assign a high probability, say 0.8.
   - **P(E|\neg H₂)**: This is the probability of observing E given that Adam is NOT in agricultural and veterinary science. Since Adam's traits align less with fields excluding agricultural and veterinary science, we can assume these traits are less common in those fields. Let’s keep this around 0.25.

   Using Bayes' Theorem, \(P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) * P(H)}{P(E)}\):

   Since \(P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)(1 - P(H))\):

   - \(P(E) = 0.8 \times 0.2 + 0.25 \times 0.8 = 0.16 + 0.20 = 0.36\)
   - Then, \(P(H₂|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.2}{0.36} \approx 0.4444 \)


Therefore, the probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": 0.0286,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4444
}

These calculations show that based on the given traits and interests, Adam is much more likely to be in the field of agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration.
