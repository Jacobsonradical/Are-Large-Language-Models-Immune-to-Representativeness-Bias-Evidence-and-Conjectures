Let's denote the fields as follows:
- \( H_{1} \): Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( H_{2} \): Adam was enrolled in business administration.

Next, let's judge the probabilities:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
#### Prior Probability (\( P(H_{1}) \)):
We can reasonably assume that the proportion of graduate students in agricultural and veterinary science is relatively small compared to more common fields like business administration or engineering. Let's assume \( P(H_{1}) = 0.05 \).

#### Likelihood (\( P(E|H_{1}) \)):
Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and attributes that align well with agricultural and veterinary sciences (such as empathy and appreciation for hard work), it makes sense that his likelihood of being in this field is high. Let's assume \( P(E|H_{1}) = 0.8 \).

#### Complement Likelihood (\( P(E|\neg H_{1}) \)):
This is the probability of the evidence given that Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Given that there are many other fields that could also match his attributes somewhat but perhaps not as closely, we will assign a moderate value. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{1}) = 0.1 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H_{1}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{1}) \cdot P(H_{1})}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) = P(E|H_{1}) \cdot P(H_{1}) + P(E|\neg H_{1}) \cdot P(\neg H_{1}) \).

Let's calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.1 \cdot 0.95) = 0.04 + 0.095 = 0.135 \]

Now, calculate \( P(H_{1}|E) \):
\[ P(H_{1}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.135} = \frac{0.04}{0.135} \approx 0.296 \]

### Business Administration
#### Prior Probability (\( P(H_{2}) \)):
Business administration is a common field, so the prior probability is higher. Let's assume \( P(H_{2}) = 0.2 \).

#### Likelihood (\( P(E|H_{2}) \)):
Adam's attributes do not strongly align with business administration. While his skills and intelligence could be applicable, his interests in nature and animals are not typical for this field. Let's assume \( P(E|H_{2}) = 0.2 \).

#### Complement Likelihood (\( P(E|\neg H_{2}) \)):
This is the probability of the evidence given that Adam is not in business administration. Given the broad range of other fields that may match his interests better, we assign a moderate value. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{2}) = 0.15 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H_{2}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{2}) \cdot P(H_{2})}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) = P(E|H_{2}) \cdot P(H_{2}) + P(E|\neg H_{2}) \cdot P(\neg H_{2}) \).

Let's calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.2) + (0.15 \cdot 0.8) = 0.04 + 0.12 = 0.16 \]

Now, calculate \( P(H_{2}|E) \):
\[ P(H_{2}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.16} = \frac{0.04}{0.16} = 0.25 \]

So, the results are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.296,
  "business administration": 0.25
}
```

These computations demonstrate that, given the personality sketch, Adam has a higher posterior probability of being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration.
