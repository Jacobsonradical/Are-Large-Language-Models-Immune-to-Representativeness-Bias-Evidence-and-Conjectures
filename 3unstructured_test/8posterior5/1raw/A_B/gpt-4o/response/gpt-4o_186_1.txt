To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the hypotheses H (i.e., the fields of specialization) given the evidence E (the personality sketch of Adam), we will use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of H.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given H.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the complement of H.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence.

Since we only have qualitative details, we'll use educated guesses for the probabilities.

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): The base rate of students enrolled in Business Administration. Let's assume this is moderately common, say \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's characteristics if he is a Business Administration student. Given that Adam's personality is more aligned with nature, empathy, and love for animals, \( P(E|H) \) might be quite low. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's characteristics if he is not a Business Administration student. Given the qualitative match, it might be higher. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): The base rate of students enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. This specialization might be less common than Business Administration, but not rare. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's characteristics if he is an Agricultural and Veterinary Science student. This seems quite high given his interests and empathy. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's characteristics if he is not an Agricultural and Veterinary Science student. This may be moderate. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

We need to compute \( P(E) \) which serves as a normalization factor:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{biz}) \cdot P(H_{biz}) + P(E|H_{agg}) \cdot P(H_{agg}) + P(E|\neg H_{biz} \cap \neg H_{agg}) \cdot P(\neg H_{biz} \cap \neg H_{agg}) \]

Given the qualitative nature, this calculation is complex, so we'll assign conceptual values for easier comparison.

### Using Bayes' Rule to Compute Posterior Probabilities

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{biz}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{biz}) \cdot P(H_{biz})}{P(E)} \]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_{agg}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{agg}) \cdot P(H_{agg})}{P(E)} \]

Let's assume:
\[ P(E) \approx k \text{ (some constant factoring other possibilities too, but largely influenced by these main two fields)} \]

Putting values roughly without exact normalization:

{
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{k} \approx \frac{0.02}{k} \approx 0.1 \),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{k} \approx \frac{0.08}{k} \approx 0.5 \)
}

{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.5"
}
