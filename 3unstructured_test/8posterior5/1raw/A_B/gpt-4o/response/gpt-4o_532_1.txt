Let's start by assigning probabilities to each of the variables involved.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H) (Prior Probability)**: This is the probability that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, without any additional information. Let's assign a value based on the assumption that this is one of many fields available to graduate students.
   - Assume P(H) = 0.1 (reflecting a reasonable prior probability for one field among many).

2. **P(E|H)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch, given that he is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. The sketch aligns well with this field given his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work.
   - So, let's say P(E|H) = 0.8 (highly likely given the match in traits).

3. **P(E|¬H)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch, given that he is not enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. While these traits could fit other fields, they are quite specific to nature and animals.
   - Let's assign P(E|¬H) = 0.2 (not very likely outside of this field).

Using Bayes' Rule, we can calculate P(H|E):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Now, we need P(E), the overall probability of Adam’s personality sketch. P(E) can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

Where \( P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.9 \).

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.18 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.26 \]

Now calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.308 \]

### Business Administration
1. **P(H) (Prior Probability)**: This is the probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration.
   - Assume P(H) = 0.1 (similar prior probability to represent that it's one of many fields).

2. **P(E|H)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch, given that he is enrolled in Business Administration. The personality sketch does not align well with typical traits highly specific to nature, animals, and abstract concepts. Business Administration might focus more on leadership, economics, and quantitative skills.
   - So, let's say P(E|H) = 0.1 (less likely given the mismatch in traits).

3. **P(E|¬H)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch, given that he is not enrolled in Business Administration.
   - Let's assign P(E|¬H) = 0.3 (more likely outside of this field, especially given his traits might suit other non-business fields).

Again, using Bayes' Rule,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We can use \( P(E) = 0.26 \) from the previous calculation.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.038 \]

Based on the calculations:

  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.308,
