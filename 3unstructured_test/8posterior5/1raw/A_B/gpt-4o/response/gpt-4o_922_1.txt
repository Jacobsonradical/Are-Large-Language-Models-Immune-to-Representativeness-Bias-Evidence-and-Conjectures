To use Bayes' rule for the two fields, we need to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \), which is the probability that Adam was enrolled in that specific field given the personality sketch \( E \). Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll assume the following for simplicity:

- Prior probabilities \( P(H) \): The general likelihood of a graduate student being in each field without any specific information about Adam.
- Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is in the specific field.
- Complementary probabilities: The likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \) for the negation of \( H \), where \( H \) is each field.

Let's consider the following assumptions for our analysis:

- \( P(H_{\text{bus. admin.}}) = 0.1 \): There are many fields of study, and business administration is one of them, so we assign a prior probability of 0.1.
- \( P(H_{\text{agri. vet. sci.}}) = 0.05 \): Agricultural and veterinary science might be less common, so we assign a slightly lower prior probability.

For the likelihoods:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{bus. admin.}}) = 0.1 \): Business administration students are less likely to have a deep love for animals and nature, so this likelihood is low.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agri. vet. sci.}}) = 0.6 \): Agricultural and veterinary science students are more likely to share traits such as empathy for animals and curiosity about nature, so this likelihood is higher.

For the complementary probabilities (assuming other fields don't strongly match Adam's personality sketch):
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{bus. admin.}}) = 0.6 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agri. vet. sci.}}) = 0.55 \)

Now we can compute \( P(E) \) for each field with a weighted sum, where \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \).

### For Business Administration:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{bus. admin.}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{bus. admin.}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{bus. admin.}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{bus. admin.}}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.1 + 0.6 \cdot 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.01 + 0.54 = 0.55 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{bus. admin.}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{bus. admin.}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{bus. admin.}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{bus. admin.}}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.55} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{bus. admin.}}|E) \approx 0.018 \]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{agri. vet. sci.}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agri. vet. sci.}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{agri. vet. sci.}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{agri. vet. sci.}}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.6 \cdot 0.05 + 0.55 \cdot 0.95 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.03 + 0.5225 = 0.5525 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{agri. vet. sci.}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agri. vet. sci.}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agri. vet. sci.}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agri. vet. sci.}}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.05}{0.5525} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agri. vet. sci.}}|E) \approx 0.054 \]
