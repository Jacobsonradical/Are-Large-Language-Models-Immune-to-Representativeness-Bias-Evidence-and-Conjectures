Sure, let's break this down step by step using Bayes' Rule.

Bayes' Rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For the fields given, we'll estimate the probabilities for business administration and agricultural and veterinary science.

### 1. Business Administration

#### Estimations:
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration. We'll assume a typical university's distribution where let's say 10% of graduate students are in business administration.
  \[ P(H)_{\text{business}} = 0.10 \]
  
- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood that a business administration student has Adam's characteristics. Business administration may not be strongly associated with a deep love for animals, nature, or abstract puzzles. Let's estimate this low given Adamâ€™s strong inclination towards natural sciences and personal characteristics.
  \[ P(E|H)_{\text{business}} \approx 0.05 \]

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood that a non-business student has Adam's characteristics. Many non-business fields, such as the sciences, humanities, and veterinary fields, might describe someone like Adam.
  \[ P(E|\neg H)_{\text{business}} \approx 0.20 \]

Using these estimations in Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{business}} = \frac{P(E|H)_{\text{business}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{business}}}{P(E)_{\text{business}}} \]

Since we do not have the exact value of \( P(E) \), we normalize it through comparison with the next field.

### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

#### Estimations:
- **P(H)**: The prior probability Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume another 10% of graduate students are in this field.
  \[ P(H)_{\text{agg\_vet}} = 0.10 \]
  
- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood that this field matches Adam's characteristics. Given Adam's love for nature, animals, and puzzles, this seems a very good fit.
  \[ P(E|H)_{\text{agg\_vet}} \approx 0.60 \]

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood that a non-agg/vet student has Adam's characteristics. This is lower since non-agg/vet students might be less likely to share this specific profile.
  \[ P(E|\neg H)_{\text{agg\_vet}} \approx 0.10 \]

Using the same approach in Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agg\_vet}} = \frac{P(E|H)_{\text{agg\_vet}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{agg\_vet}}}{P(E)_{\text{agg\_vet}}} \]

### Normalizing

We compare the two fields using the ratios given by Bayes' Rule:

\[ \frac{P(H|E)_{\text{business}}}{P(H|E)_{\text{agg\_vet}}} = \frac{\frac{P(E|H)_{\text{business}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{business}}}{P(E)_{\text{business}}}}{\frac{P(E|H)_{\text{agg\_vet}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{agg\_vet}}}{P(E)_{\text{agg\_vet}}}} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same:
\[ \frac{P(H|E)_{\text{business}}}{P(H|E)_{\text{agg\_vet}}} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.10}{0.60 \cdot 0.10} = \frac{0.005}{0.06} = \frac{1}{12} \]

Thus, \( P(H|E)_{\text{agg\_vet}} \approx 12 \times P(H|E)_{\text{business}} \).

Given our estimates of P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|\neg H), let's finalize:

\[
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.60
}
\]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration is very low, whereas the probability that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is considerably higher.
