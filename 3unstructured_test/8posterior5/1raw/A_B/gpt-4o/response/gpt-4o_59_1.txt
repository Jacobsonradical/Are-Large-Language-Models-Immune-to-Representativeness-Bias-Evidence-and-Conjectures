To determine \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch of Adam, we need to use Bayes' theorem. The theorem is stated as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood that Adam’s personality sketch matches someone in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood that Adam’s personality sketch matches someone not in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch, which can be broken down as:
  - \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \)

Since we do not have precise numerical values, we need to make reasoned estimates based on the provided information about Adam and typical characteristics of graduate students in those fields.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

#### P(H)
- Agricultural and veterinary science tends to involve a strong interest in nature, animals, and possibly a quiet disposition for detailed work. Given Adam's traits, we can reasonably assume there is a relatively higher probability he might choose this field.
- Estimate: \( P(H) \approx 0.15 \) (15% prior probability)

#### P(E|H)
- Given Adam's characteristics (curiosity about nature, love for animals, understanding of hard work), it is highly likely they match someone in this field.
- Estimate: \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \) (80% likelihood)

#### P(E|\neg H)
- Outside of this field, the likelihood of having such a personality may be lower, as not all fields will emphasize these traits equally.
- Estimate: \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \) (30% likelihood)

### Business Administration

#### P(H)
- Business administration may attract individuals with different characteristics (e.g., an interest in management, finance, leadership). Adam's personality traits do not strongly suggest a fit for this field.
- Estimate: \( P(H) \approx 0.05 \) (5% prior probability)

#### P(E|H)
- The likelihood of someone in business administration matching Adam's personality (nature-loving, puzzles, empathy, animals) is lower.
- Estimate: \( P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \) (20% likelihood)

#### P(E|\neg H)
- As before, we assume the general population of graduate students has a lower but reasonable likelihood of the described personality.
- Estimate: \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \) (30% likelihood)

Now, we compute \( P(H|E) \) for each case using Bayes' theorem:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

First compute \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.3 \cdot (1 - 0.15) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.3 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.255 \]
\[ P(E) ≈ 0.375 \]

Then compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.375} \]
\[ P(H|E) ≈ \frac{0.12}{0.375} \]
\[ P(H|E) ≈ 0.32 \]

### Business Administration

First compute \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.05 + 0.3 \cdot (1 - 0.05) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.01 + 0.3 \cdot 0.95 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.01 + 0.285 \]
\[ P(E) ≈ 0.295 \]

Then compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.05}{0.295} \]
\[ P(H|E) ≈ \frac{0.01}{0.295} \]
\[ P(H|E) ≈ 0.034 ≈ 0.03 \]

### Final Results

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.32,
  "business administration": 0.03
