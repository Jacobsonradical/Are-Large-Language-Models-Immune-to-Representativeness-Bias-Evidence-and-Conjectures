To apply Bayes' rule and compute the probability \( P(H|E) \), we need the probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Let's denote:

- \( H_{BA} \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration.
- \( H_{AVS} \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

Now, let's make reasonable assumptions about these probabilities based on the personality sketch of Adam.

### Business Administration

1. **P(H_{BA})**: Probability that any random graduate student is in Business Administration. Let's assume a 10% probability for this field.
   \[
   P(H_{BA}) = 0.10
   \]

2. **P(E|H_{BA})**: Likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is in Business Administration. Given Adam's curiosity about nature and deep love for animals, this seems less likely for a Business Administration student.
   \[
   P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.01
   \]

3. **P(E|\neg H_{BA})**: Likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in Business Administration. This is higher because many other fields may match his personality better.
   \[
   P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.05
   \]

Using Bayes' rule:
\[
P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)}
\]
where
\[
P(E) = P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \cdot P(\neg H_{BA})
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
P(E) = 0.01 \cdot 0.10 + 0.05 \cdot 0.90 = 0.001 + 0.045 = 0.046
\]

Therefore,
\[
P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.01 \cdot 0.10}{0.046} \approx 0.0217
\]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H_{AVS})**: Probability that any random graduate student is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Let's assume a 5% probability for this field.
   \[
   P(H_{AVS}) = 0.05
   \]

2. **P(E|H_{AVS})**: Likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given his interests, this seems very likely.
   \[
   P(E|H_{AVS}) = 0.50
   \]

3. **P(E|\neg H_{AVS})**: Likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. This is lower as the match is quite strong.
   \[
   P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) = 0.02
   \]

Using Bayes' rule:
\[
P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)}
\]
where
\[
P(E) = P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) + P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \cdot P(\neg H_{AVS})
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
P(E) = 0.50 \cdot 0.05 + 0.02 \cdot 0.95 = 0.025 + 0.019 = 0.044
\]

Therefore,
\[
P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.50 \cdot 0.05}{0.044} \approx 0.5682
\]

### Summary

\[
\{
  "business administration": 0.0217,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5682
\}
\]
