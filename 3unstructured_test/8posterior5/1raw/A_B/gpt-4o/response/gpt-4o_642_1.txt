To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) through Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihoods \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Given:
- \( E \): The personality sketch of Adam.
- \( H \): The hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We will make reasonable assumptions about the prior probabilities and the likelihoods, as follows:

1. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H) \): It's a commonly chosen graduate field, but does not strongly correlate with Adam's personality sketch.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch given Business Administration is moderate but not particularly high.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch given other fields (not Business Administration) is higher than for Business Administration, as Adam's personality sketch fits better with other specialized fields.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): This field aligns well with Adam's interests (curiosity about nature, love for animals).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch given Agricultural and Veterinary Science is very high.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch given other fields (not Agricultural and Veterinary Science) is lower as Adam's characteristics strongly correspond to this field.

Let's assign reasonable numeric values for computation:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1 \)
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.2 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.8 \)

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.05 \) (fewer students might choose this field overall, but it's increasing)
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.9 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.1 \)

For simplicity, let's assume \( P(E) = 1 \) as it will cancel in the computation (normalized at the end).

Now calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{1} = 0.02 \]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{1} = 0.045 \]

Thus, the computed probabilities are:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.045
}
```
