To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular graduate field given his personality sketch \( E \), we can use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the limited information, I'll be making some educated estimates based on the personality sketch provided:

**1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam would be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science might be relatively low, considering graduate students can pick from a wide array of fields. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.10 \).
  
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, it seems highly likely he might choose this field. Assume \( P(E|H) = 0.80 \).
  
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): This is the likelihood of observing Adam's characteristics given he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Considering his traits might moderately fit other fields too, let's estimate this as \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.30 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.10}{P(E)} \]

\( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \)
\[ P(E) = 0.80 \times 0.10 + 0.30 \times 0.90 = 0.08 + 0.27 = 0.35 \]

Therefore:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.10}{0.35} = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \approx 0.23 \]

**2. Business Administration**

- \( P(H) \): Business administration is a common field, so the prior probability might be higher. Assume \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
  
- \( P(E|H) \): The personality traits of curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals don't strongly align with typical traits associated with business administration. Assume \( P(E|H) = 0.10 \).
  
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Using the same initial estimate as before, \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.30 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.10 \times 0.15}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) remains the same:
\[ P(E) = 0.80 \times 0.10 + 0.30 \times 0.90 = 0.35 \]

Therefore:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.10 \times 0.15}{0.35} = \frac{0.015}{0.35} \approx 0.043 \]

Final answers in the required format:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.23,
  "business administration": 0.043
}
```

These are rough estimates and could be further refined with more concrete data on probabilities.
