To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \(P(E)\) can be computed as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Given that there are many fields of graduate study beyond just the two considered, we note:

\[
P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H)
\]

### Estimations for Agricultural and Veterinary Science

Let's assign probabilities for Adam being in agricultural and veterinary science:

- \(P(H_{\text{agri}})\): The base rate probability that a random graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. Given the popularity of various disciplines, we might estimate that about 5% of graduate students fall into this category.
  
  \[
  P(H_{\text{agri}}) = 0.05
  \]

- \(P(E|H_{\text{agri}})\): The probability that E (Adam's personality sketch) is true given that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's interests and characteristics match very well with this field, we might estimate this quite high, say 0.8.
  
  \[
  P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) = 0.8
  \]

- \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{agri}})\): The probability that E is true given that Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Given that there are other fields with empathetic, animal-loving, and nature-curious people, we might estimate this lower, say 0.2.
  
  \[
  P(E|\neg H_{\text{agri}}) = 0.2
  \]

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agri}})}{P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agri}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{agri}}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{\text{agri}}))}
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.95}
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.19} = \frac{0.04}{0.23} \approx 0.174
\]

### Estimations for Business Administration

Now let's assign probabilities for Adam being in business administration:

- \(P(H_{\text{biz}})\): The base rate probability that a random graduate student is in business administration. Business programs are very popular, so we might estimate this at about 15%.

  \[
  P(H_{\text{biz}}) = 0.15
  \]

- \(P(E|H_{\text{biz}})\): The probability that E (Adam's personality sketch) is true given that Adam is in business administration. Given the mismatch, we consider this significantly lower, say 0.1.

  \[
  P(E|H_{\text{biz}}) = 0.1
  \]

- \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{biz}})\): The probability that E is true given that Adam is not in business administration. Similar to above, let's keep it at 0.2 for simplicity.

  \[
  P(E|\neg H_{\text{biz}}) = 0.2
  \]

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(H_{\text{biz}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{biz}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{biz}})}{P(E|H_{\text{biz}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{biz}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{biz}}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{\text{biz}}))}
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{biz}}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{0.1 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85}
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{biz}}|E) = \frac{0.015}{0.015 + 0.17} = \frac{0.015}{0.185} \approx 0.081
\]

### Summary

Based on these calculations, the conditional probabilities, given Adam's personality sketch, that he is enrolled in either of the two fields are:

\[
\{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.174,
  "business administration": 0.081
\}
\]
