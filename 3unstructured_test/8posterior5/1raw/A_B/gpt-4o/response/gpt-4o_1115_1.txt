To estimate the posterior probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for each field using Bayes' rule, we begin by noting prior probabilities \(P(H)\), and conditional probabilities \(P(E|H)\) and \(P(E|\neg H)\). Then we apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that \(P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)\), let's evaluate each term:

1. **agricultural and veterinary science**:

   - **P(H)**: The prior probability that any graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given it's a specific field, suppose this is rather low. Let's assume \(P(H) = 0.05\).
   - **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam has the given personality traits given he is studying agricultural and veterinary science. Considering his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, this seems highly consistent. Let's assume \(P(E|H) = 0.9\).
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that Adam has the given personality traits given he is not studying agricultural and veterinary science. These traits could fit other fields, but not all fields. Let's assume \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.2\).

2. **business administration**:

   - **P(H)**: The prior probability that any graduate student is enrolled in business administration. This is a broader and more common field. Suppose \(P(H) = 0.2\).
   - **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam has the given personality traits given he is studying business administration. His traits don't strongly align with business administration. Let's assume \(P(E|H) = 0.1\).
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that Adam has the given personality traits given he is not studying business administration. Let's assume \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.3\).

Given these, we calculate \(P(E)\):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{agriculture})P(H_{agriculture}) + P(E|\neg H_{agriculture})P(\neg H_{agriculture}) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.045 + 0.19 = 0.235 \]

Now, apply Bayes' rule for agricultural and veterinary science:

\[ P(H_{agricultural}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{agricultural}) \cdot P(H_{agricultural})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_{agricultural}|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.235} \]

\[ P(H_{agricultural}|E) \approx \frac{0.045}{0.235} \approx 0.191 \]

And now, for business administration:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{business})P(H_{business}) + P(E|\neg H_{business})P(\neg H_{business}) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.24 = 0.26 \]

Now, apply Bayes' rule for business administration:

\[ P(H_{business}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{business}) \cdot P(H_{business})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_{business}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.26} \]

\[ P(H_{business}|E) \approx \frac{0.02}{0.26} \approx 0.077 \]

So, the results are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.191,
  "business administration": 0.077
}
