To solve this, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \(H\) given evidence \(E\).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \(E\) given hypothesis \(H\).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \(H\).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of evidence \(E\).

### Given:
1. **Business Administration (H1)**
   - Prior probability \(P(H1)\): The proportion of graduate students in the field of business administration is relatively high compared to agricultural and veterinary science. So let's assume \( P(H1) = 0.3 \).
   - Likelihood \(P(E|H1)\): The personality sketch doesn't strongly align with typical traits of business administration students. Suppose \( P(E|H1) = 0.1 \).
   - \(P(E|\neg H1)\): Probability that the personality sketch describes a student not in business administration. Considering the diverse pool of students, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H1) = 0.5 \).

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H2)**
   - Prior probability \(P(H2)\): The proportion of graduate students in this field is lower. Let's assume \( P(H2) = 0.05 \).
   - Likelihood \(P(E|H2)\): The personality traits strongly match with students in agricultural and veterinary science. Suppose \( P(E|H2) = 0.8 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H2) \): Probability that the personality sketch describes a student not in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H2) = 0.3 \).

Now calculate the posterior probabilities using Bayes' theorem.

### 1. Business Administration:
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1) + P(E|\neg H1) \cdot P(\neg H1) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.3) + (0.5 \cdot 0.7) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.03 + 0.35 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.38 \]
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.3}{0.38} \]
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.38} \]
\[ P(H1|E) \approx 0.079 \]

### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2) + P(E|\neg H2) \cdot P(\neg H2) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.3 \cdot 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.285 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.325 \]
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.325} \]
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.325} \]
\[ P(H2|E) \approx 0.123 \]

Let's format the final output:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.079,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.123
}
```

These values suggest a higher probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration based on the given personality sketch.
