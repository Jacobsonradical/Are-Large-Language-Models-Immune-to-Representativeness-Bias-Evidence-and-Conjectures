To estimate the probabilities, let's break down each term:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field. This is an estimate based on how common each field is for graduate students.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is enrolled in that field. Essentially, how well the personality sketch fits someone in that field.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is not enrolled in that field. This needs to consider how characteristic the evidence is of graduate students in other fields.

Let's denote our two fields as follows:

- H1: Adam is enrolled in Business Administration.
- H2: Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

### Business Administration
- **P(H1)**: Business Administration is a very common field, so we'll estimate a relatively high prior probability compared to other specific fields. Let's estimate: 0.3
- **P(E|H1)**: Given Adam's interest in nature, empathy, and love for animals, this doesn't align well with typical business administration traits. Let's estimate: 0.1
- **P(E|¬H1)**: There are numerous other fields that could explain Adam's traits better. Thus, the probability of this evidence across all non-business administration fields might be higher. Let's estimate: 0.6

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H2)**: Agricultural and Veterinary Science is less common among all possible graduate fields than business. Let's estimate: 0.05
- **P(E|H2)**: Given Adam's interest in nature, animals, and strong empathy, this aligns closely with traits typical of this field. Let's estimate: 0.7
- **P(E|¬H2)**: There are numerous other fields that could explain his traits, but less so than agricultural and veterinary science. Might be similar to the previous case. Let's estimate: 0.6

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, we use \( P(E) \) (the total probability of evidence) using the sum of the probabilities for \( E \) across hypotheses and complementary contexts. Since we only need relative probabilities:

### Business Administration

\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1)P(H1)}{P(E|H1)P(H1) + P(E|H2)P(H2) + \text{other terms}} \]

Approximate \( P(E) \) using the significant terms:

\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.1 * 0.3}{0.1 * 0.3 + 0.7 * 0.05} \]
\[ P(H1|E) \approx \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.035} \]
\[ P(H1|E) \approx \frac{0.03}{0.065} \approx 0.46 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{P(E|H2)P(H2)}{P(E|H1)P(H1) + P(E|H2)P(H2) + \text{other terms}} \]

Approximate \( P(E) \) using the significant terms:

\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.7 * 0.05}{0.1 * 0.3 + 0.7 * 0.05} \]
\[ P(H2|E) \approx \frac{0.035}{0.03 + 0.035} \]
\[ P(H2|E) \approx \frac{0.035}{0.065} \approx 0.54 \]

### Summary:

So the posterior probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": "0.46",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.54"
}

Note that these values are rough estimates used to demonstrate the process rather than exact probabilities.
