To compute \( P(H|E) \) (the probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field given his personality sketch), we need to apply Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since \( P(E) \) (the total probability of the evidence) is the same for each field comparison (given that there are only two fields in consideration here), we can focus on the numerator for a relative comparison:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Let’s go through each step for both fields.

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is studying business administration. Let's assume a generic prior probability for graduate fields without deep data, say \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.2 \).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality description matching someone enrolled in business administration. Given Adam's love for nature, animals, and puzzles — traits not typically associated with business administration — this likelihood is comparatively low. Let’s estimate \( P(E|H_{BA}) \) at 0.1.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of the personality description given other fields. Considering there's a vast range of other fields, some of which may share elements of Adam's interests (like science, social work, etc.), let's put this at about 0.8.

So the relative probability for business administration:
\[ 
P(H_{BA}|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02 
\]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is studying agricultural and veterinary science. Let’s assume this is one of many fields and give it a prior similar to business administration, say \( P(H_{AVS}) = 0.1 \).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality description matching someone enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam’s curiosity about nature and love for animals, this is highly consistent with the field. Let’s put \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \) at 0.8.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam's personality description given other fields. This remains similar to above, 0.8.

So the relative probability for agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ 
P(H_{AVS}|E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 
\]

### Normalizing

To normalize and express this as a probability:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.08} = \frac{0.02}{0.10} = 0.2 \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.02 + 0.08} = \frac{0.08}{0.10} = 0.8 \]

Therefore, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
