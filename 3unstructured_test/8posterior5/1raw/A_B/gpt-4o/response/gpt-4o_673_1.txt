To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each of the two fields, we will need to estimate four values for each field: \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), \( P(E|\neg H) \), and then use Bayes' rule to find \( P(H|E) \).

Let's outline the values and the thought process behind choosing them.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
        - Let's assume the number of students in Agricultural and Veterinary Science relative to other fields is reasonably high due to the relevance and importance of the field, but not the most prevalent. Say, \( P(H) \approx 0.05 \).
    - **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
        - Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals, coupled with his attributes, align strongly with this field. Say, \( P(E|H) \approx 0.80 \).
    - **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
        - While his characteristics are ideal for Agricultural and Veterinary Science, they can also fit other fields, such as Natural Sciences or Environmental Studies, though with less likelihood. Say, \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.20 \).
    - **P(H|E)**: Using Bayes' rule,
        \[
        P(H|E) \propto P(H) \cdot P(E|H) = 0.05 \cdot 0.80 = 0.04
        \]

2. **Business Administration**:
    - **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration.
        - Considering the prevalence of Business Administration programs, the prior probability might be higher than Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Say, \( P(H) \approx 0.10 \).
    - **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in Business Administration.
        - Adam’s characteristics do not strongly align with typical traits of Business Administration students. Say, \( P(E|H) \approx 0.10 \).
    - **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in Business Administration.
        - This value is similar to that used earlier since Adam’s profile can fit other more relevant fields better. Say, \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.20 \).
    - **P(H|E)**: Using Bayes' rule,
        \[
        P(H|E) \propto P(H) \cdot P(E|H) = 0.10 \cdot 0.10 = 0.01
        \]

Given these calculations, the final probabilities would need normalization, but since we are only comparing relative likelihoods, we provide the raw proportional values.

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.04,
  "business administration": 0.01
}
```

Note: These values are illustrative examples based on subjective reasoning and should be further validated through actual data or detailed domain knowledge.
