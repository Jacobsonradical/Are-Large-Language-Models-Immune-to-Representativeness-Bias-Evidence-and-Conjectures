To solve this problem using Bayes' rule, we'll proceed with the given data and estimates for the required probabilities. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to estimate the following for each hypothesis:
1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of the hypothesis.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing E given H.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing E given not H.
4. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing E.

However, since \( P(E) \) appears in both calculations and can be complex to estimate exactly, we will use approximate reasoning without calculating it explicitly.

### Hypothesis 1: Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H)**: Let's assume this is moderately likely for graduate students in general, but a bit higher given Adam's love for animals and dedication.
   \[ P(H) \approx 0.15 \]
2. **P(E|H)**: The characteristics of curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align well.
   \[ P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \]
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: For non-agricultural and veterinary science fields, it's less likely to find such a precise match.
   \[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \]

### Hypothesis 2: Business Administration
1. **P(H)**: This is less likely given the characteristics; business administration usually does not require a strong curiosity about nature.
   \[ P(H) \approx 0.05 \]
2. **P(E|H)**: These personality traits are less typical for business administration students.
   \[ P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \]
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of these traits in fields other than business is low.
   \[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.25 \]

### Calculations for P(H|E):

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.8 \cdot 0.15 \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.12 \]

#### Business Administration:
Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.1 \cdot 0.05 \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.005 \]

### Normalized Probabilities (for the sake of relative comparison):
- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
  \[ P(H|E) = 0.12 \]
- For Business Administration:
  \[ P(H|E) = 0.005 \]

Therefore, in summary:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.12,
  "business administration": 0.005
}
```

These values represent the relative likelihood that Adam is enrolled in each field, given his personality sketch.
