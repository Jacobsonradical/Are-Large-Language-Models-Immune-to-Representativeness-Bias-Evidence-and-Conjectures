To apply Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the complement likelihoods \( P(E|\neg H) \). Let’s break these down for each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
  Let’s assume there is a moderate chance a student might be enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. For instance, let’s set this at 0.1 to reflect a reasonable, moderate likelihood.
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
  Adam’s personality sketch aligns well with this field — a genuine curiosity about nature, a love for animals, appreciation for hard work. We could set this to a high probability, such as 0.8.
- **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
  Given his interests, the likelihood of his personality if he’s not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science may be lower but still probable since there are other similar fields. Let's set this at 0.3 as many qualities might align with other yet similar fields.

### Business Administration
- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
  Business Administration is a popular graduate field. We might assume a higher prior than Agricultural and Veterinary Science, say 0.2.
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
  Adam's personality seems less aligned with typical traits needed in Business Administration, such as a high interest in finance, marketing, or organizational management. We might estimate this at 0.1.
- **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
  The likelihood of having Adam’s personality traits if he is not enrolled in Business Administration remains similar to above scenarios, let’s approximate this at 0.3 too.

Now, applying Bayes’ rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \),

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \)
- Complement of \( P(H) \), \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.9 \)

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) = 0.08 + 0.27 = 0.35 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.35} = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \approx 0.229 \]

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \)
- Complement of \( P(H) \), \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.8 \)

\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) = 0.02 + 0.24 = 0.26 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.26} = \frac{0.02}{0.26} \approx 0.077 \]

Here are the posterior probabilities for each field given E:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.229,
  "business administration": 0.077
}
