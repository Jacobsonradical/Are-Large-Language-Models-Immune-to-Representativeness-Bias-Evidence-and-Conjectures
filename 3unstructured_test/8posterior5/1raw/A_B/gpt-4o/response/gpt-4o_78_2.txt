To apply Bayes' Rule, we need to evaluate the probabilities P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|\neg H) for each field. 

**Definitions:**
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the given personality sketch \( E \) if Adam was enrolled in the given field (likelihood).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the given personality sketch \( E \) if Adam was not enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field given the personality sketch \( E \) (calculated using Bayes' Rule).

Bayes' Rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields, it can be omitted when comparing the relative probabilities.

First, let's estimate the individual probabilities.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \) (prior probability): Let's assume a relatively low chance as only a fraction of students are enrolled in this field. We might guess \( P(H) = 0.05 \) for illustrative purposes.
- \( P(E|H) \) (likelihood): Given his personality sketch—deep love for animals, strong understanding of hard work, curiosity about nature—his traits align strongly with this field. So, let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Without specific evidence for another field, we assume the likelihood of the personality sketch across other fields. Let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.7 \cdot 0.05 = 0.035 \]

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \) (prior probability): Business Administration is a common field, so we might guess \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|H) \) (likelihood): His traits—warm heart, empathy, curiosity, love for nature and animals—don’t strongly suggest this field compared to others. So, let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Using the same assumption for the rest of the fields, \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \cdot 0.2 = 0.04 \]

### Results in Requested Format
The proportional values calculated above give us a sense of \( P(H|E) \). After normalization (dividing by the common factor \( P(E) \)), we obtain:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.035,
  "business administration": 0.04
}
```

This suggests that considering the given personality sketch, there is a slightly higher posterior probability of Adam being in Business Administration compared to Agricultural and Veterinary Science, though neither probability is very high.
