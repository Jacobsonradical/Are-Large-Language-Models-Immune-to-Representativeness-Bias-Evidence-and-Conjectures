To address this problem, we need to apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given the specific field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the specific field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of Adam's personality sketch, which can be considered as a normalization factor here.

Let's break this down for each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H)**: Assume a moderate prior probability since agricultural and veterinary sciences are common graduate fields but not the most popular ones. Let's say \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
2. **P(E|H)**: Given that Adam has a love for nature, animals, and a warm heart, it's highly likely that someone with his personality would be in this field. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch existing in fields other than agricultural and veterinary science should be considered. Given his specific interests, this might be less frequent. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

Applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

\( P(E) \) normalizes across all possible hypotheses but is constant for comparison purposes. So we can consider the relative values:

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{constant} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.08 \]

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)**: Business administration is one of the most popular graduate fields. Assume a higher prior probability \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch matching a business administration student is lower since his interests and empathy align more with nature and animals rather than business. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch existing in fields other than business administration is relatively high. We'll assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

Applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.02}{constant} \]

### Relative Probabilities
Considering the constant normalization factor:

\[ \text{"agricultural and veterinary science"} \approx \frac{0.08}{constant} \]
\[ \text{"business administration"} \approx \frac{0.02}{constant} \]

Thus, the relative values are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08,
  "business administration": 0.02
}
