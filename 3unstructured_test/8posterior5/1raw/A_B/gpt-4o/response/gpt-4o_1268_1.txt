To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field (agricultural and veterinary science, and business administration), I'll go through the steps of assigning probability estimates and using Bayes' Rule.

Given:
- \( E \): Personality sketch of Adam.
- \( H \): Hypothesis about Adam being in a specific field.
- \( \neg H \): Adam not being in that specific field.

Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability of Adam being in the field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Probability of Adam having the personality sketch \( E \) given he's in the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of Adam having the personality sketch \( E \) given he's not in the field.

Let's start with the field of agricultural and veterinary science:

1. **Agricultural and veterinary science:**
   - \( P(H) \): Given Adam's interest in nature, animals, and plants, a plausible assumption might be higher compared to a random pick of fields. Let's assume this to be 0.2.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The personality sketch strongly aligns with traits needed and typical for this field. Giving it a high probability, let's say 0.9.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): If Adam is not in this field, then his personality sketch is somewhat less compatible. Let's assume this to be 0.1.
   - We use \( P(E) \) which is the normalization factor, but since we compare two hypotheses, it effectively acts as a constant normalization factor that can ultimately be ignored for comparison.

2. **Business administration:**
   - \( P(H) \): Less likely given the information, but there are still people who fit this personality sketch in business administration. Assume this to be 0.1.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The personality sketch fits somewhat less well with this field but it’s not impossible. Say 0.3.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): If Adam is not in business administration, this doesn’t change much given the available information. Conservatively assume this to be similar to the first case, 0.05.

### Calculations:

1. **Agricultural and veterinary science:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.18}{P(E)} \]

2. **Business administration:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.03}{P(E)} \]

For comparison (ignoring the \( P(E) \) as it's a common normalization factor):
- Relative probability for agricultural and veterinary science: 0.18
- Relative probability for business administration: 0.03

Normalizing these relative probabilities:
Sum of relative probabilities = \( 0.18 + 0.03 = 0.21 \)
Now, providing probabilities:
- Agricultural and veterinary science: \( \frac{0.18}{0.21} \approx 0.857 \)
- Business administration: \( \frac{0.03}{0.21} \approx 0.143 \)


Final answers:
