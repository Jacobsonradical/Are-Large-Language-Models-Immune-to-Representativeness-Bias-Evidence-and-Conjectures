To use Bayes' Rule to compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific graduate field based on his personality sketch, we need to consider the prior probabilities \(P(H)\), the likelihood \(P(E|H)\), and the marginal likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\). Here's how we break it down for both fields:

### Business Administration

**Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**:
Graduate students in business administration are quite common. However, given Adam's personality and interests, it seems less likely (though not impossible) he would choose business administration.

\(P(H)\): Let's say 0.1 (10%)

**Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**:
The personality sketch provided seems less aligned with a typical business administration student who may be more interested in business dynamics and managerial skills rather than deeply empathetic and intrinsically motivated by nature.

\(P(E|H)\): Let's say 0.05 (5%)

**Marginal Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)**:
This is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in business administration. Given that his traits may likely fit into many other fields, it is higher.

\(P(E|\neg H)\): Let's say 0.8 (80%)

**Posterior Probability \(P(H|E)\)**:
Applying Bayes Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \)

Let's calculate \(P(E)\):
\[ P(E) = 0.05 \times 0.1 + 0.8 \times 0.9 = 0.005 + 0.72 = 0.725 \]

Now, the posterior:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.1}{0.725} = \frac{0.005}{0.725} \approx 0.0069 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

**Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**:
Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy, it is much more plausible that he is in this field.

\(P(H)\): Let's say 0.3 (30%)

**Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**:
The personality sketch is highly aligned with a student in agricultural and veterinary science.

\(P(E|H)\): Let's say 0.8 (80%)

**Marginal Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)**:
The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. This is lower as the personality sketch aligns more with this field.

\(P(E|\neg H)\): Let's say 0.3 (30%)

**Posterior Probability \(P(H|E)\)**:
Similarly, applying Bayes Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \)

Let's calculate \(P(E)\):
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \times 0.3 + 0.3 \times 0.7 = 0.24 + 0.21 = 0.45 \]

Now, the posterior:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.3}{0.45} = \frac{0.24}{0.45} \approx 0.5333 \]


So, the resulting probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0069,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5333
}
```
