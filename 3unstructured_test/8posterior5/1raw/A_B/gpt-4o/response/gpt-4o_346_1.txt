To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we first need to consider the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood of E given not H (\( P(E|\neg H) \)). Bayes’ rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be calculated from:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) P(H) + P(E|\neg H) P(\neg H) \]

However, we need only relative values. The denominator \( P(E) \) will cancel out when comparing different fields.

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Business administration is a common field for graduate students, but not an exceptionally large proportion.
   - Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Business skills are not typically associated with a love for nature, plants, and animals. So, the likelihood seems low.
   - Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

3. **Likelihood of observing \( E \) given not H \( (\neg H) \)**: Since there are many other graduate fields that might align more with Adam's interests, the presence of E is more likely if he is not in business.
   - Let's conservatively estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This field is more specific and less common than business administration.
   - Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's interests align strongly with this field. The likelihood seems very high.
   - Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).

3. **Likelihood of observing \( E \) given not H \( (\neg H) \)**: Similar to business administration, but possibly slightly higher because several diverse fields can still align with his interests.
   - Let's conservatively assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

### Bayesian Calculation
Now we apply Bayes’ rule in a proportional way:

1. **Business Administration:**

\[ P(\text{H|E}) \propto P(E|H) \times P(H) = 0.1 \times 0.1 = 0.01 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

\[ P(\text{H|E}) \propto P(E|H) \times P(H) = 0.9 \times 0.05 = 0.045 \]

### Normalizing Values for Comparison

Given these proportions and without the exact normalization factor, we can compare the relative likelihoods.

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.01,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.045
}
```

In this format, the values represent the relative confidence (not the exact probabilities) that Adam was enrolled in the respective fields based on his personality sketch.
