To apply Bayes' theorem, we need to evaluate the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \), and then compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis. 

### Step-by-Step Calculation

**Step 1: Define the probabilities**

1. **Prior probability \( P(H) \)**: This is the general probability of being enrolled in the given field without any additional information.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in the given field.

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in any other field.

**Business Administration:**
- \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): Assuming a low prior probability, since Adam's interests and attributes do not strongly align with business administration.
    Let's estimate it at 0.10.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): The likelihood that Adam’s personality fits with business administration is low, say 0.05.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \): Likelihood that Adam’s personality is seen in fields other than business administration is relatively higher. Assume it is 0.90.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \]

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \): Given Adam's interests, it is more likely he's enrolled in this field. Assume 0.20.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \): Adam’s personality aligns strongly with this field. Assume 0.70.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \): Probability that Adam’s personality is in a field other than agricultural and veterinary science. Assume 0.30.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}})}{P(E)} \]

### Step 2: Compute Posterior Probabilities

Assume \( P(E) \) is the same for both cases for normalization purposes. We don’t need an exact number for this, just the correct proportional calculations will do.

**Business Administration:**
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.10}{P(E)} \approx 0.005 \]

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{0.70 \cdot 0.20}{P(E)} \approx 0.14 \]

### Step 3: Normalizing
Given that we're only calculating relative probabilities for comparison and assuming the sum of all probabilities is normalized within this context:

- Normalize to sum to 1:
\[ \text{Total} = P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) + P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) \]
\[ \text{Total} = 0.005 + 0.14 = 0.145 \]

\[ \frac{P(H_{\text{BA}}|E)}{\text{Total}} = \frac{0.005}{0.145} \approx 0.034 \]
\[ \frac{P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E)}{\text{Total}} = \frac{0.14}{0.145} \approx 0.966 \]
