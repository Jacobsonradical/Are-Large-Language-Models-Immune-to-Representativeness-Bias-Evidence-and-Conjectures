Sure, in order to provide more accurate calculations, let's consider hypothetical values for the probabilities and then apply Bayes' rule. We begin by assessing each field:

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that a random graduate student is in business administration. Let's assume that business administration is a common graduate program, so P(H) might be around 0.2.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood that Adam would have his personality traits given that he is in business administration. Business administration students are typically more focused on organizational, financial, and managerial interests, so let's assume P(E|H) is relatively low, perhaps 0.05.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood that Adam would have these personality traits given that he is not in business administration. Given the wide array of other possible fields, let's assume P(E|¬H) is 0.3.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that a random graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. This is a more specialized field, so P(H) could be around 0.05.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood that Adam would have his personality traits given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam’s personality sketch, this seems quite high, perhaps 0.7.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: As before, the likelihood that Adam would have these personality traits given that he is not in agricultural and veterinary science is 0.3.

### Bayes' Rule Calculation:
Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be calculated by:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

### For Business Administration:
\[ P(E) = (0.05 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.01 + 0.24 = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.2}{0.25} = \frac{0.01}{0.25} = 0.04 \]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.05) + (0.3 \cdot 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.035 + 0.285 = 0.32 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{0.32} = \frac{0.035}{0.32} = 0.109375 \]

### Final Results:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.04,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.109375
}
```

These calculations suggest that, based on the provided personality sketch, Adam is more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration.
