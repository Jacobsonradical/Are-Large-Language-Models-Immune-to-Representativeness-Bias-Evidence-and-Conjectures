To calculate the probability \( P(H|E) \), we will use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch E given the hypothesis H.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch E given that Adam is not enrolled in the specific field.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of the personality sketch E, which can be calculated as \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

For each field, we will estimate these probabilities.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability** \( P(H) \):
   - Given Adam's traits, he appears well-suited for a field like this. However, we assume roughly equal initial probabilities for all fields.
   - Let's set \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

2. **Likelihood** \( P(E|H) \):
   - Adam's personality traits highly fit this field (strong empathy, love for animals, curiosity about nature).
   - Let's set \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

3. **Likelihood** \( P(E|\neg H) \):
   - For graduate fields not related to agricultural and veterinary science, Adam's traits are less directly related.
   - Let's set \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

Using these values:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9 = 0.08 + 0.18 = 0.26 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.26} \approx 0.3077 \]

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability** \( P(H) \):
   - This seems less suited to Adam's personality, but we still assume an equal prior probability.
   - Let's set \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

2. **Likelihood** \( P(E|H) \):
   - His personality traits fit this field less well (interest in nature and animals are less relevant).
   - Let's set \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).

3. **Likelihood** \( P(E|\neg H) \):
   - For non-business fields, Adam's traits can be more relevant.
   - Let's set \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.8 \).

Using these values:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.8 \cdot 0.9 = 0.02 + 0.72 = 0.74 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.74} \approx 0.027 \]
