To provide a concrete estimate for these probabilities, we need to make several reasonable assumptions based on the information given.

**Assumptions**:
1. We will assume that Adam's characteristics and interests are more likely to align with certain fields of study.
2. The base rates (P(H)) for different fields of study will be taken broadly from common knowledge about the proportion of graduate students in each field.
3. We will use a combination of subjective judgment and knowledge to estimate P(E|H) and P(E|\neg H).

Let's denote:
- H1: Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- H2: Adam is enrolled in business administration.

**Base Rates (P(H))**:
We assume the following rough base rates:
- P(H1) = 0.10 (10% of graduate students are in agricultural and veterinary science)
- P(H2) = 0.20 (20% of graduate students are in business administration)

**Likelihoods (P(E|H) and P(E|\neg H))**:
Based on Adam's personality sketch:
- P(E|H1): High, because his love for nature, plants, and animals aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science.
- P(E|\neg H1): Moderate, because while some characteristics may align with other fields, the overall profile strongly fits H1.

Estimating these:
- P(E|H1) = 0.80
- P(E|\neg H1) = 0.30

For business administration:
- P(E|H2): Low, because Adam's interests do not strongly align with business administration.
- P(E|\neg H2): Higher than P(E|H2), still moderate, considering other fields may also not fit well.

Estimating these:
- P(E|H2) = 0.10
- P(E|\neg H2) = 0.40

**Bayes' Rule Calculation**:
We use Bayes' rule to find P(H|E):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H1|E) \approx \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.10}{P(E)} \]

For business administration:
\[ P(H2|E) \approx \frac{0.10 \cdot 0.20}{P(E)} \]

Note that \(P(E)\) is the same for both calculations and is a normalization constant. Hence, we can ignore it when comparing relative probabilities.

So, normalizing the values,
\[ P(H1|E) \proportion 0.080 \proportion 0.80 \]
\[ P(H2|E) \proportion 0.020 \proportion 0.20 \]

Therefore, in relative terms:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.80,
  "business administration": 0.20
}
```
