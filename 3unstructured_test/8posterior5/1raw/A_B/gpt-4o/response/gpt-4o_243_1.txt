To calculate the probabilities, here's a step-by-step approach using Bayes' Rule. Note that:

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) (Adam's personality sketch) given that Adam was enrolled in the specific field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in the specific field.
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the specific field given his personality sketch.

We use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) can be inferred from the sum of the probabilities across all fields, it does not need to be calculated explicitly for comparing relative probabilities within this limited scope.

### Fields of Specialization
1. **Agricultural and veterinary science**
2. **Business administration**

### Assessing Probabilities

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: Let’s assume a moderate prior probability for this field, say 0.2, since it is a somewhat common field of graduate study.
- **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, there is a high likelihood the personality traits align with this field, so we can estimate this to be 0.9.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood that someone not in this field would have these traits is lower, but not impossible, so let’s estimate this to be 0.3.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]

#### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: Let’s assume a lower prior probability for this field, say 0.1, because the personality traits in the sketch seem less aligned with this field.
- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood that Adam’s traits match this field is relatively low, so we can estimate this at 0.1.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Someone not in this field could certainly have these traits, so let’s keep this at around 0.3.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac(0.1 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \]

### Computing Posterior Probabilities (Relative Values)
Since exact \( P(E) \) is not needed for comparison, we simply compute relative values:

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.9 \times 0.2 = 0.18 \]

For **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.1 = 0.01 \]

These relative values can be used to infer the overall likelihoods.

Here is the assess:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.18,
  "business administration": 0.01
}
```

Note: The values above provide a comparative framework rather than absolute probabilities, reflecting that Adam's personality traits are far more consistent with a field like agricultural and veterinary science than business administration.
