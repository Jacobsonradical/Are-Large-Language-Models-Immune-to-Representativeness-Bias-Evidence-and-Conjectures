Given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, we will use the probabilities and Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis \( H \) (field of study) based on the personality sketch.

1. **Assigning Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)**

Let's assume some reasonable prior probabilities for each field. Prior probabilities estimate the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in each field before considering the personality sketch.

- \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.05 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.10 \) 

These are just assumptions based on the general distribution of graduate students across various fields. 

2. **Calculating Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**

Next, we need the likelihood of the personality sketch given the hypothesis.

- For **agricultural and veterinary science**, Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature make it quite likely. Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.8 \).
- For **business administration**, Adam's curiosity about nature and love for animals seem less directly relevant. Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.1 \).

3. **Calculating \( P(E|\neg H) \)**

This represents the likelihood of the evidence given that Adam is not enrolled in a specific field. It can be complex to directly calculate this without additional context, but we'll use reasonable estimates. As a sum of all other fields, these are broader distributions.

- For agricultural and veterinary science: \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.3 \)
- For business administration: \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.6 \)

4. **Bayes' Rule: Computing \( P(H|E) \)**

Bayes' theorem is given as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We can rewrite \( P(E) \) (the total probability of the evidence) using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Now we compute the posteriors:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.3 \cdot (1-0.05) = 0.04 + 0.285 = 0.325 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.325} = \frac{0.04}{0.325} \approx 0.123 \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(E)_{\text{business administration}} = 0.1 \cdot 0.10 + 0.6 \cdot (1-0.10) = 0.01 + 0.54 = 0.55 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.10}{0.55} = \frac{0.01}{0.55} \approx 0.018 \]

Putting it all together:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.123",
  "business administration": "0.018"
}
```

These values denote the posterior probabilities (\( P(H|E) \)) indicating the likelihood that Adam is studying in these fields given his personality sketch.
