To estimate the probabilities involved and apply Bayes' Rule, we'll start with some assumptions and reasoning based on the given information. Below are the steps to break down the problem:

1. **Initial Probabilities P(H)**: 
   - P(H) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field before considering his personality sketch.

2. **Conditional Probabilities P(E|H)**:
   - P(E|H) is the probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is enrolled in a given field.

3. **Complementary Conditional Probabilities P(E|\neg H)**:
   - P(E|\neg H) is the probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is not enrolled in that field.

4. **Posterior Probabilities P(H|E)**: 
   - P(H|E) is what we need to calculate using Bayes' Rule: 
     \[
     P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
     \]
   - Here, since we are comparing fields within a context, we do not need to compute P(E) exactly as we can compare relative values.

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: Assuming graduate programs are evenly distributed among students (although in reality, this may vary), let's set an arbitrary prior probability for simplicity:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.2
   \]

2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood that Adam, with his interests and traits, would be enrolled in a business administration program. Given Adam's curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals, this seems less likely:
   \[
   P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \approx 0.1
   \]

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Likelihood of Adam showing these traits in fields other than business administration, which might be higher given the wide applicability of his traits:
   \[
   P(E|\neg H_{\text{business administration}}) \approx 0.3
   \]

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[
P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.1 \times 0.2 + 0.3 \times 0.8} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.24} \approx 0.077
\]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: Let's assume the same prior probability for this field for simplicity:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.2
   \]

2. **P(E|H)**: Adam's traits align very well with this field, given his love for animals and curiosity about nature:
   \[
   P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \approx 0.7
   \]

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Everywhere else, excluding agricultural and veterinary science:
   \[
   P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \approx 0.2
   \]

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[
P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) \approx \frac{0.7 \times 0.2}{0.7 \times 0.2 + 0.2 \times 0.8} = \frac{0.14}{0.14 + 0.16} = \frac{0.14}{0.3} \approx 0.467
\]

Thus, summarizing our estimates:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.077,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.467
}
```

This result shows that based on the personality sketch provided, it's much more likely that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration.
