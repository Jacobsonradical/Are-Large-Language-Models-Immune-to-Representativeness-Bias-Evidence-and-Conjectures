To compute the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science or business administration based on his personality sketch, I will assess the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field, the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) given the sketch, and the likelihoods \( P(E|\neg H) \) for fields outside of these specializations. Here’s how I can reason about each:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: 
    - Given that there is a wide range of fields in which graduate students can enroll, the priors \( P(H) \) for specific fields should be relatively low. 
    - However, I can assume a balanced prior distribution across different fields for simplicity.

2. **Likelihood of Evidence \( P(E|H) \)**: 
    - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and high empathy, \( P(E|H) \), the probability of his personality fitting this field is high.
    - Business Administration: Adam’s quiet nature, empathy, and puzzle-solving skills do not strongly align with the typical traits needed in business administration (e.g., leadership, extroversion). Thus, \( P(E|H) \) is lower.

3. **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: 
    - For simplicity, I will assume that \( P(E) \) remains consistent across a general pool of graduate students. Given his sketch, nature fields would likely be more conducive to his traits, so \( P(E|\neg H) \) is lower for agricultural and higher for broader fields like business administration.

Now, I will assign approximate values and use Bayes’ theorem to compute \( P(H|E) \):

Bayes’ theorem: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, I'll assume equal priors \( P(H) = 0.05 \) initially for each field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

- Prior \( P(H_{ag}) \): 0.05
- Likelihood \( P(E|H_{ag}) \): 0.9
- Complement likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{ag}) \): 0.7

Using Bayes’ rule,
\[ P(H_{ag}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{ag}) \cdot P(H_{ag})}{P(E)} \]
Given \( P(E) \) as a normalizing factor, assume its value is integrated such that the focus is on relative likelihoods,
\[ P(H_{ag}|E) \approx \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.9 \cdot 0.05 + 0.7 \cdot (1 - 0.05)} = 0.115 \]

### Business Administration:

- Prior \( P(H_{ba}) \): 0.05 
- Likelihood \( P(E|H_{ba}) \): 0.3
- Complement likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{ba}) \): 0.7

Using Bayes’ rule,
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{ba}) \cdot P(H_{ba})}{P(E)} \]
Similar integrative approach as above,
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.05}{0.3 \cdot 0.05 + 0.7 \cdot (1 - 0.05)} = 0.021 \]

So the final approximate probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.115,
  "business administration": 0.021
}

These values indicate Adam is considerably more likely to have been enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration based on the given personality sketch.
