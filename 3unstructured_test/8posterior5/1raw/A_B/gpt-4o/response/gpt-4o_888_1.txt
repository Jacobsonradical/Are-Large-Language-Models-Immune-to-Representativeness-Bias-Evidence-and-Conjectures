To evaluate the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we'll use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll assume that we don't know \( P(E) \) exactly but that it is the same for each field, so we'll work with relative probabilities. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): The general likelihood that a randomly selected graduate student is in Business Administration. Let's assume a moderate probability because Business Administration is a common field, say 0.2.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam exhibits characteristics described in E if he is in Business Administration. Adam's traits such as strong empathy, appreciation for hard work, and intelligence might fit moderately well with a career in Business Administration, but his curiosity about nature and animals is less typical. Let's assume this probability is relatively low, say 0.1.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that Adam exhibits characteristics described in E if he is not in Business Administration. Given Adam's traits are more in line with fields like Agricultural Science, let's assume it is higher, say 0.3.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): The general likelihood that a randomly selected graduate student is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. This field is less common than Business Administration but fits Adam's traits well. Let's assume a moderate probability, say 0.1.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam exhibits characteristics described in E if he is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. This fits very well given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy. Let's assume it is very high, say 0.8.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that Adam exhibits characteristics described in E if he is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Since these traits are more aligned with Agricultural Science, assume a lower probability, say 0.2.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]

Now, let's normalize to get probabilities that are relative to each other. We have:

- For Business Administration: 0.02
- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.08

Sum of the proportional probabilities:
\[ 0.02 + 0.08 = 0.10 \]

Normalize each:
\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.10} = 0.2 \]
\[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.10} = 0.8 \]

Therefore, the relative probabilities using this approach are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
