To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to consider \( P(H) \) (the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field), \( P(E|H) \) (the probability of the personality sketch being true if Adam were enrolled in that field), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) (the probability of the personality sketch being true if Adam were not enrolled in that field). Note that Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we do not have the exact value of \( P(E) \), we will focus on the relations among the probabilities to give a reasonable estimation.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, given the genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work suggests a higher prior probability. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.15 \).

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: Given that Adam has characteristics conducive to agricultural and veterinary science (interest in nature, animals, empathy), \( P(E|H) \) should be high. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability that Adam has these characteristics even if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Given these traits could fit other fields, this value is moderate. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Using Bayes’ rule, we get:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.7 \times 0.15}{0.7 \times 0.15 + 0.3 \times (1 - 0.15)} = \frac{0.105}{0.105 + 0.255} = \frac{0.105}{0.36} \approx 0.292 \]

### Business Administration

1. **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Given Adam's characteristics, it's less likely compared to agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: Although there are empathetic business leaders interested in nature, understanding abstract concepts are key in business. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Similar to above. Adam’s characteristics may fit other fields better. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.35 \).

Using Bayes’ rule, we get:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.3 \times 0.05}{0.3 \times 0.05 + 0.35 \times (1 - 0.05)} = \frac{0.015}{0.015 + 0.3325} = \frac{0.015}{0.3475} \approx 0.043 \]

Thus, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.292,
  "business administration": 0.043
}
```
