Certainly! Let's break down the Bayesian analysis for each field separately: agricultural and veterinary science and business administration.

Given the personality sketch \( E \), we need to estimate:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) if Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) if Adam was not enrolled in that field.

Finally, we'll use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \) and \( P(E) \) is constant across different hypotheses, we can compare \( P(H|E) \) values directly without calculating \( P(E) \).

For each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **\( P(H) \)**: Assuming equal prior probabilities across all fields, we'll assign a moderate prior.
   \[
   P(\text{AgriVet}) = 0.1
   \]

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's interest in nature, animals, and strong empathy, the likelihood is high.
   \[
   P(E|\text{AgriVet}) = 0.8
   \]

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: We'll assume a much lower likelihood for not being in this field.
   \[
   P(E|\neg \text{AgriVet}) = 0.2
   \]

Using Bayes' rule:

\[
P(\text{AgriVet}|E) \propto P(E|\text{AgriVet}) \cdot P(\text{AgriVet}) = 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08
\]

### Business Administration

1. **\( P(H) \)**: Assuming equal prior probabilities across all fields, we'll assign a moderate prior.
   \[
   P(\text{BusAdmin}) = 0.1
   \]

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's personality traits, the likelihood is low.
   \[
   P(E|\text{BusAdmin}) = 0.1
   \]

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This remains broad but depends on the diversity of other fields.
   \[
   P(E|\neg \text{BusAdmin}) = 0.3
   \]

Using Bayes' rule:

\[
P(\text{BusAdmin}|E) \propto P(E|\text{BusAdmin}) \cdot P(\text{BusAdmin}) = 0.1 \times 0.1 = 0.01
\]

Summarizing the results:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08,
  "business administration": 0.01
}
```

These values suggest that the personality sketch \( E \) is much more consistent with Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration.
