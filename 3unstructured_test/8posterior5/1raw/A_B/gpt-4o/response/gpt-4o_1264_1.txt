To address the problem, we'll start by estimating the probabilities in a qualitative manner and then compute the probabilities using Bayes' rule. Here, we need to assess:

1. P(H) - The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field.
2. P(E|H) - The likelihood that the personality sketch E is characteristic of students in that field.
3. P(E|¬H) - The likelihood that the personality sketch E is characteristic of students not in that field.

Then, we'll use Bayes' Theorem:
\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

For simplicity, assumed normalized values for P(E), but since the computation is relative, we can compare the results directly.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - **P(H)**: This field may have a moderate number of students overall, but Adam's attributes align well with this field.
   - **P(E|H)**: High, because Adam's love for nature and animals fits well with this field.
   - **P(E|¬H)**: Based on general knowledge, students not in this field might not collectively exhibit Adam's traits as strongly, so we would expect this to be low.

2. **Business Administration:**
   - **P(H)**: Business Administration is a very popular field with a high number of students, yet Adam’s personality traits do not strongly align with common traits required for this field.
   - **P(E|H)**: Low, because the traits like strong empathy and deep love for animals are less commonly the main focus for business students.
   - **P(E|¬H)**: Moderate to high because these attributes can be widely dispersed among students in other fields, especially non-business fields.

Let's assume some hypothetical values based on qualitative analysis:

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- P(H) = 0.2 (Assuming a moderate number of students)
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (High likelihood given the alignment of traits)
- P(E|¬H) = 0.2 (Low because of the misalignment of general traits)

**Business Administration:**
- P(H) = 0.3 (High number of students in this popular field)
- P(E|H) = 0.1 (Low likelihood as the traits don't align well)
- P(E|¬H) = 0.4 (Moderate to high likelihood)

Plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

\[P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{0.8 \cdot 0.2 + 0.1 \cdot 0.3} = \frac{0.16}{0.16 + 0.03} = \frac{0.16}{0.19} \approx 0.842\]

\[P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.3}{0.8 \cdot 0.2 + 0.1 \cdot 0.3} = \frac{0.03}{0.16 + 0.03} = \frac{0.03}{0.19} \approx 0.158\]

Now denote these values:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.842,
  "business administration": 0.158
}

These results suggest that based on the personality sketch, it is much more likely Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science than in Business Administration.
