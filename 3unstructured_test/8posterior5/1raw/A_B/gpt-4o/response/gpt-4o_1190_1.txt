To calculate the probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to assess the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) (how likely it is that a student is in that field), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) (how likely the personality sketch is given the field), and the likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \) (how likely the personality sketch is given that the field is not the one in question).

First, let's make reasonable assumptions based on general information:

1. **P(H) for Business Administration**:
   Graduate students in business administration are common in the U.S., so we will denote this with a moderate prior probability, e.g., \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

2. **P(H) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   This field may be less common than business administration, so we can denote a lower prior probability, e.g., \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

### Likelihood Assessments:
Considering Adam's personality sketch:

- **Business Administration**:
  - \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \): 
    Adam's traits like genuine curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, and strong empathy do not align well with the typical interests of business administration students. Likelihood is lower, e.g., \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.1 \).
  - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business administration}}) \):
    This would be higher because many fields could better align with Adam's personality. Let's say \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.3 \).

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  - \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): 
    Adam's personality sketch fits very well with this field. Likelihood is higher, e.g., \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.7 \).
  - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \):
    Similar personality traits could match with other nature-related fields, but they are less likely overall. Let's set \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.2 \).

### Applying Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is calculated as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

We can use these approximations to calculate posterior probabilities:

1. **Business Administration**:
   \[
   P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) = 0.02 + 0.24 = 0.26
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.26} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.26} \approx 0.077
   \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[
   P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) = 0.07 + 0.18 = 0.25
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.25} \approx \frac{0.07}{0.25} \approx 0.28
   \]

Therefore, the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field are:

{
  "business administration": 0.077,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.28
}
