We'll start by determining the prior probabilities \(P(H)\), which represent the likelihood that Adam is enrolled in each field prior to considering the personality sketch.

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.05,
  "business administration": 0.15
}

Next, we determine \(P(E|H)\), the likelihood of observing the personality sketch if Adam is indeed enrolled in each field.

Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.9,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

Then, we need to determine \(P(E|\neg H)\), the likelihood of observing the personality sketch if Adam is not enrolled in each field. Let's estimate how common these traits are outside of the specified fields.

Assuming the traits are moderately common in fields unrelated to Adam's, we use:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.3
}

Now, let's apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \(P(E)\) can be computed using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Given that \(P(\neg H)\) for either field is \(1 - P(H)\), let's estimate \(P(E)\) for both cases.

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[ P(E)_{AV} = (0.9 \cdot 0.05) + (0.3 \cdot 0.95) = 0.045 + 0.285 = 0.33 \]

Therefore:

\[ P(H|E)_{AV} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.33} = \frac{0.045}{0.33} \approx 0.136 \]

For Business Administration:

\[ P(E)_{BA} = (0.1 \cdot 0.15) + (0.3 \cdot 0.85) = 0.015 + 0.255 = 0.27 \]

Therefore:

\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{0.27} = \frac{0.015}{0.27} \approx 0.056 \]

So, the final answers are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.136,
  "business administration": 0.056
}
