Given the personality sketch of Adam and considering the nature of the fields in question, we can make educated guesses about the relevant probabilities. We will use some reasonable assumptions for the values of \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

**Step 1: Assessing the priors and likelihoods:**

1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
   - \( P(H) \): This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Considering that this is a specialized field, we can assign it a moderately low prior probability. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is indeed enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, this probability should be relatively high. Let's assign \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is not enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Considering that interests similar to his could appear in other science-related fields, but are less likely specifically in business-related fields, let's assign \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

2. Business Administration:
   - \( P(H) \): This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration. Business Administration is a common field, and many students enroll in it, but Adam's personality traits seem less aligned with this field. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is indeed enrolled in Business Administration. Given that his traits are not typically associated with Business Administration, this probability is low. Let's assign \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is not enrolled in Business Administration. Considering his traits seem more aligned with other fields, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

**Step 2: Calculating \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule:**

Bayes' Rule: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]

1. For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.1) + (0.4 \times (1 - 0.1)) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.36 = 0.44 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.44} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.44} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.182 \]

2. For Business Administration:
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.05) + (0.5 \times (1 - 0.05)) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.005 + 0.475 = 0.48 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.05}{0.48} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.48} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0104 \]

**Final Results:**
