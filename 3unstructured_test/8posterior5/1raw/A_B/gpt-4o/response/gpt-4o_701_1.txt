To calculate the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we will use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here's the breakdown for each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, it could be reasonably high. Let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam would have the given personality traits if he were enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. This is likely quite high due to the alignment of interests. Let's assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that Adam would have the given personality traits if he were not enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given his interests, this could be reasonably less. Let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]

\( P(E) \) can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

Assuming \( P(\neg H) = 0.8 \):

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.2) + (0.2 \times 0.8) = 0.16 + 0.16 = 0.32 \]

So, 

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.2}{0.32} = 0.5 \]

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration. Given his personality traits, this may be lower. Let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.05 \).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam would have the given personality traits if he were enrolled in Business Administration. This is likely lower due to the misalignment of interests. Let's assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that Adam would have the given personality traits if he were not enrolled in Business Administration. Given his interests, this could be relatively higher. Let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.05}{P(E)} \]

\( P(E) \) can be calculated using the previous \( P(E) = 0.32 \):

So,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.05}{0.32} \approx 0.015625 \]
