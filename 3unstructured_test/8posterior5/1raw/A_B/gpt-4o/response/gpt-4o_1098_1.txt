To calculate the probability \( P(H|E) \), we use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in that particular field.
- \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \), but we don't need to calculate \( P(E) \) directly since we're looking to compare the relative likelihoods of different hypotheses.

### Given Fields:
1. **Business Administration**
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

Let's assign qualitative estimates to each parameter.

#### Business Administration:
- \( P(H) \): We assume an equal prior probability across all graduate fields. For simplicity, let's assume Adam has an equal chance of being enrolled in any field. Let's set \( P(H) = 0.5 \) given it's one of two alternatives presented here (but keep in mind in reality this should be adjusted based on actual enrollment distributions).
- \( P(E|H) \): Business Administration may not align closely with Adam's qualities related to nature, animals, and empathy. Thus, let's assume a lower probability, say \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): This would entail Adam being in some field other than Business Administration. Given his interests, it's higher but still not overwhelming, so \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.9 - 0.1 = 0.8 \).

\[ 
P(H|E)_{\text{business\_administration}} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.5}{0.1 \cdot 0.5 + 0.8 \cdot 0.5} = \frac{0.05}{0.45} \approx 0.111 
\]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- \( P(H) \): Again, assuming an equal prior probability, \( P(H) = 0.5 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): This field aligns well with Adam's interests and personality sketch. Let's set a higher probability, say \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): This entails Adam being in some field other than Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Let's assume it's less likely to encompass his specific traits, so \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

\[ 
P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural\_and\_veterinary\_science}} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.8 \cdot 0.5 + 0.2 \cdot 0.5} = \frac{0.4}{0.4 + 0.1} = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8 
\]

### Final Answer:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.111,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These probabilities reflect the relative likelihoods that Adam is enrolled in each field given his personality sketch.
