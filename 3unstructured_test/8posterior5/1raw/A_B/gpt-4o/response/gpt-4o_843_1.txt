Given the personality sketch of Adam (E), we need to estimate the posterior probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for the fields "agricultural and veterinary science" and "business administration" using Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To apply Bayes' rule, we need to estimate:

1. Prior probability \(P(H)\): The likelihood that a randomly chosen graduate student is in the given field.
2. Likelihood \(P(E|H)\): The probability that the given personality sketch fits a student in that field.
3. Evidence \(P(E)\): The overall likelihood of the personality sketch across all fields (this will be common to both computations).

The prior probability \(P(H)\) can be denoted roughly based on general statistics about graduate enrollments, but since exact figures are not provided, let’s make reasonable assumptions:

- \(P(H: \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.1\)
- \(P(H: \text{business administration}) \approx 0.2\)

Next, let's evaluate the likelihoods:

1. \(P(E|H: \text{agricultural and veterinary science})\): Adam's personality traits closely align with this field. High curiosity about nature, love for animals, warm heart, and empathy are strong indicators. Let's estimate this to be 0.8.
2. \(P(E|H: \text{business administration})\): The traits are less aligned with business administration, which often emphasizes leadership, competitiveness, and strategic thinking over empathy and love for nature. Let's estimate this to be 0.2.

Now, for \(P(E|\neg H)\), where \(\neg H\) denotes all other fields combined, we need to consider the diversity of graduate fields and how Adam's traits may fit in them. However, generally, his traits might be less common in other fields combined, so let's make a rough estimate:

- \(P(E|\neg H: \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.3\)
- \(P(E|\neg H: \text{business administration}) \approx 0.5\)

The evidence \(P(E)\) is the same for both fields, and it accounts for all possible fields essentially capturing Adam's traits:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H: \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(H: \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) + P(E|H: \text{business administration}) \cdot P(H: \text{business administration}) + \cdots \]

For simplicity, we'll focus on our specific fields. Using these values:

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H|E: \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

For business administration:
\[ P(H|E: \text{business administration}) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

Since \(P(E)\) is a common normalizing constant, let’s denote:
\[ P(H|E: \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]
\[ P(H|E: \text{business administration}) \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.2 = 0.04 \]

These values can be interpreted proportionally, so we get:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08,
  "business administration": 0.04
}
```

This suggests that given Adam's personality sketch, he's more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration.
