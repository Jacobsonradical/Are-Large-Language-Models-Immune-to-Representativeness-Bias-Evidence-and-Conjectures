To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll estimate these probabilities to the best of our understanding based on the provided sketch of Adam.

### Business Administration

#### Estimations:
- **P(H):** Probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration in general.
  - Business administration is a common field, so let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \) (10% of grad students might be in business administration).
  
- **P(E|H):** Probability that Adam has this personality sketch given he is in business administration.
  - People in business administration might be curious and intelligent, but the deep love for nature, empathy for animals, and appreciation for hard work seem less aligned. So this might be lower: \( P(E|H) \approx 0.05 \).

- **P(E|\neg H):** Probability of having Adam's personality sketch if he is not in business administration. Given the distinct personality traits:
  - Other fields might better fit Adam's personality, so let’s estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \).

#### Computation:
Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \):

\[ P(E) = 0.05 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9 = 0.005 + 0.18 = 0.185 \]

Now:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{0.185} \approx \frac{0.005}{0.185} \approx 0.027 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

#### Estimations:
- **P(H):** Probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in general.
  - This field is less common than business administration but still significant. Let’s assume \( P(H) \approx 0.05 \) (5% of grad students might be in this field).
  
- **P(E|H):** Probability that Adam has this personality sketch given he is in agricultural and veterinary science.
  - His curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy strongly align with this field. So let’s assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \).

- **P(E|\neg H):** Probability of having Adam's personality sketch if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science.
  - If Adam's personality is specific to this field more so than others, this might be low: \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.15 \).

#### Computation:
Using the same steps as before:

\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.15 \cdot 0.95 = 0.04 + 0.1425 = 0.1825 \]

Now:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.1825} \approx \frac{0.04}{0.1825} \approx 0.219 \]

### Final Results:

Here are the calculated probabilities for Adam being enrolled in these fields based on his personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.027,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.219
}
