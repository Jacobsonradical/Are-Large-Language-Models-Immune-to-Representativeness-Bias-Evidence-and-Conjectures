To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Rule, we need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the complement likelihoods \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we don't know \( P(E) \) explicitly, we can work with the proportional relationship:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Let's break it down for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - **P(H):** The prior probability that a random graduate student is in this field. Let's assume a relatively low, yet not negligible prior, given the modest number of students typically in such fields.
   - **P(E|H):** The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in this field. Considering Adam's traits like curiosity about nature, love for animals, and understanding hard work, these match well with this field.
   - **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Since Adam's traits are somewhat specific, \( P(E|\neg H) \) would likely be lower.

  Assuming:
  - \( P(H) \approx 0.05 \) (5%)
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.80 \) (80%) because his traits match very well with this field.
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.10 \) (10%) as fewer students in other fields would have such matching traits.

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.80 \times 0.05 = 0.04 \]

2. **Business Administration:**
   - **P(H):** The prior probability that a random graduate student is in this field. Given the broad popularity of MBA programs, let's assume a higher prior probability.
   - **P(E|H):** The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in this field. Adam's traits, such as empathy and warmth, can be present but are not strongly indicative of business administration.
   - **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in Business Administration. This would possibly be somewhat low, though not as low as the previous consideration.

  Assuming:
  - \( P(H) \approx 0.20 \) (20%)
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.20 \) (20%) because traits like empathy and love for animals are not particularly indicative of this field.
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.15 \) (15%) because these traits are not uncommon.

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.20 \times 0.20 = 0.04 \]

So, normalizing these results to give a relative sense: 

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.04",
  "business administration": "0.04"
}

Both fields have the same calculated proportional posterior chance based on the assumptions and given traits, making it likely Adam could be in either field based on the provided sketch. 

However, for more nuanced results, additional specifics and priors about field distributions would be necessary.
