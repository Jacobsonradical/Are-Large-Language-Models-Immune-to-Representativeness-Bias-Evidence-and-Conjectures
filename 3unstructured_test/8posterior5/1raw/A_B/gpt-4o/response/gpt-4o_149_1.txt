To approach this problem, we will use Bayesian inference. Bayes' rule allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis given new evidence. The rule is mathematically expressed as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence \( E \).

However, we simplify our task by comparing \( P(H|E) \) for different fields since the denominator \( P(E) \) will be the same for all fields being compared.

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: Let's assume the base rate (prior probability) for students enrolling in agricultural and veterinary science is reasonably low, given the range of possible fields. We approximate this as:
\[ P(H) \approx 0.05 \]

2. **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's interest in nature, animals, and plants, it's very likely that he is in this field. We can assume:
\[ P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \]

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch fitting other fields is lower but not negligible. We approximate:
\[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.1 \]

### For Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: Business administration is a popular field for graduate students, so the prior might be higher. We approximate this as:
\[ P(H) \approx 0.15 \]

2. **P(E|H)**: Adam's personality traits do not strongly align with typical traits for a business administration student. We can approximate:
\[ P(E|H) \approx 0.05 \]

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch fitting other fields is still the same as before. We approximate:
\[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.1 \]

Now, using Bayes' rule for Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \propto P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \]

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \propto 0.9 \times 0.05 = 0.045 \]

For Business Administration:

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) \propto P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) \]

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) \propto 0.05 \times 0.15 = 0.0075 \]
