To compute the values, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, let's assume there are only two fields: agricultural and veterinary science, and business administration. We can analyze the given probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): the prior probability of Adam being in a certain field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given the hypothesis that he was enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given the hypothesis that he was not enrolled in that field.
4. \( P(E) \): the probability of Adam's personality sketch regardless of the field he is enrolled in.

We will calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field based on the personality sketch.

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
1. \( P(H) \): Graduate students in the agricultural and veterinary sciences are a small subset of the general graduate student population. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
2. \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's fascination with nature, plants, animals, empathy, and understanding of hard work, it is very likely he is in this field. Let’s assume \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given the specific traits point toward nature-related fields, the probability of the same traits in a student outside this field may be reasonably lower. Let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

**Business Administration**:
1. \( P(H) \): This is a very popular graduate field, so let’s assume \( P(H) = 0.25 \).
2. \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam’s traits, it seems less likely that he is in business administration. Let’s assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of these traits in students outside business fields may be higher. Let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

To calculate \( P(E) \) we need combined probabilities:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's calculate \( P(E) \) for both fields:

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(E_{\text{total}}) = (0.9 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) = 0.09 + 0.18 = 0.27 \]

**Business Administration**:
\[ P(E_{\text{total}}) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.5 \cdot 0.75) = 0.025 + 0.375 = 0.4 \]

Now, we calculate \( P(H|E) \):

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E_{\text{total}})} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{0.27} = 0.333 \]

**Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E_{\text{total}})} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.4} = 0.0625 \]

Thus, we get the values:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.333,
  "business administration": 0.0625
}
