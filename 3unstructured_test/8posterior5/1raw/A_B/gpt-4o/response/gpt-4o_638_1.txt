To apply Bayes' rule here, we'll use the following formula for each field:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's break down the components for each field:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is in a given field. This can be quite subjective without additional data, but we'll assume some reasonable estimates.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the evidence (E, the personality sketch of Adam) given that he is in the field (H).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the evidence given that he is not in the field (H).

To get the posterior probabilities, we need to make some educated guesses based on the given personality traits and his traits fitting the fields.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: Assuming equal probabilities across a wide range of fields, let's take 0.05 as a base probability (one of many possible fields).
2. **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's love for nature, animals, and plants, this probability should be fairly high. Let's estimate it at 0.8.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of a similar personality sketch occurring in other fields might be reasonably lower. Let's say 0.3.

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \)

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.05) + (0.3 \times 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.285 = 0.325 \]

So,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.325} \approx 0.123 \]

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: Again, assuming equal probabilities across fields, let's take 0.05 as the base probability.
2. **P(E|H)**: Given the personality sketch, Adam's traits don't seem to align with the typical characteristics needed for business administration. Let's estimate it at 0.1.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of the personality traits fitting other fields better. Let's keep it at 0.3.

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.05) + (0.3 \times 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.005 + 0.285 = 0.29 \]

So,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.05}{0.29} \approx 0.017 \]

### Final Result

By comparing the computed probabilities, we can fill in the values:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.123,
  "business administration": 0.017
}

These values represent the posterior probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each respective field given his personality sketch.
