To estimate the probabilities, we need to consider how consistent Adam's personality sketch (E) is with each field of graduate study (H), and also the general probability of someone being in each field regardless of their personality.

1. **Business Administration**:
   * P(H): Business administration is a common field for graduate students, but not overwhelmingly so. Let's estimate P(H) at around 0.2 (20%).
   * P(E|H): The personality sketch describes someone who loves nature, animals, and has empathy, which isn't strongly associated with business administration typically. Let's give it a relatively low value of about 0.1 (10%).
   * P(E|¬H): The probability of having Adam's personality sketch given he is not in business administration would likely be higher, as there are many fields where these traits would fit. Let's assume 0.3 (30%).

Using Bayes’ rule: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{(0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.24} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.26} \approx 0.077 \]

So, the posterior probability that Adam is in business administration given his personality sketch is approximately 0.077 (7.7%).

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   * P(H): Agricultural and veterinary science is a less common field compared to business but fits Adam's personality sketch very well. Let's estimate P(H) at around 0.05 (5%).
   * P(E|H): The personality sketch strongly aligns with agricultural and veterinary science. Let's give it a high value of about 0.7 (70%).
   * P(E|¬H): This is the same as above. Assuming 0.3 (30%).

Using Bayes’ rule: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{(0.7 \cdot 0.05) + (0.3 \cdot 0.95)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.035}{0.035 + 0.285} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.035}{0.32} \approx 0.109 \]

So, the posterior probability that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.109 (10.9%).

Here is the summarized answer:

{
  "business administration": 0.077,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.109
}
