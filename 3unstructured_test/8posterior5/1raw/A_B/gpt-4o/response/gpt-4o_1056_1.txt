To estimate the probabilities, let's first consider the following:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field in 2021 in the U.S.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in that field.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not enrolled in that field.

Here are the values:

1. **P(H for Agricultural and Veterinary Science)**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align well with the attributes of someone in agricultural and veterinary science.
2. **P(E|H for Agricultural and Veterinary Science)**: The personality sketch is highly consistent with this field.
3. **P(E|¬H for Agricultural and Veterinary Science)**: While these attributes could exist in other fields, they are less likely outside of this field compared to within it.

4. **P(H for Business Administration)**: Adam’s traits don’t directly align with the typical priorities and interests in business administration.
5. **P(E|H for Business Administration)**: The personality sketch is somewhat consistent but not strongly indicative of this field.
6. **P(E|¬H for Business Administration)**: Adam’s personality traits could still fit in other fields outside of business administration.

Given these considerations, let's assign some hypothetical values:

- For agricultural and veterinary science:
  - **P(H)**: 0.1 (assuming a low base rate of enrollment in this field among all possible fields)
  - **P(E|H)**: 0.9 (high likelihood his personality fits this field)
  - **P(E|¬H)**: 0.3 (moderate likelihood his personality fits other fields)

- For business administration:
  - **P(H)**: 0.2 (assuming a higher base rate of enrollment in this field among all possible fields)
  - **P(E|H)**: 0.2 (low likelihood his personality fits this field well)
  - **P(E|¬H)**: 0.4 (moderate likelihood his personality aligns with fields other than business administration)

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since P(E) can be calculated as a normalization factor but will cancel out when comparing:

- For agricultural and veterinary science:
  \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.1}{0.9 \times 0.1 + 0.3 \times 0.9} = \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.27} = \frac{0.09}{0.36} = 0.25 \]

- For business administration:
  \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.2}{0.2 \times 0.2 + 0.4 \times 0.8} = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.32} = \frac{0.04}{0.36} = 0.11 \]

Converted into the required format:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.25,
  "business administration": 0.11
}
