To approach the problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which states: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to consider the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the complement likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \).

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability ( \( P(H) \) )**: 
   - Business administration is a relatively common graduate field, so let's assume a moderate prior probability, say \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
   
2. **Likelihood ( \( P(E|H) \) )**: 
   - Given the personality sketch E, which highlights a love for nature, animals, and abstract concepts, the alignment with business administration might not be strong. We might set this likelihood low, say \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

3. **Complement Likelihood ( \( P(E|\neg H) \) )**: 
   - This is the probability that Adam has the given personality sketch if he is not in business administration. Given the large number of other fields more aligned with his interests, we can put a higher value, say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability ( \( P(H) \) )**: 
   - This field is less common than business administration, but still significant for students with interest in nature. Let's assume a lower prior probability than business, perhaps \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

2. **Likelihood ( \( P(E|H) \) )**: 
   - The likelihood that Adam has the given personality sketch if he is in agricultural and veterinary science is high, given his love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work. We might set this high, say \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

3. **Complement Likelihood ( \( P(E|\neg H) \) )**: 
   - Given the high alignment with his interests, the likelihood of this personality sketch if he is not in this field would be lower, say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

### Calculations

1. **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.6 \cdot 0.8} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.48} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.50} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.04 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.27} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.229 \]
