To calculate the probability \( P(H|E) \) (the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch), we will use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in that field.

Let's go step by step:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability of any given graduate student being enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is relatively low barring specific university statistics, but let's assume a moderate prior, say 0.1 (10%).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's keen interest in nature, plants, animals, and his deep love for animals, it is very likely he fits well in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Let's give this a high probability, say 0.8 (80%).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): If Adam were not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, it's still somewhat likely he will exhibit such traits but less so. Let's assume 0.2 (20%).

   Thus, using Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)}
   \]

2. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability of any given graduate student being enrolled in Business Administration is relatively high. Let's assume a moderate prior, say 0.2 (20%).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's personality traits, it's less likely he is in Business Administration, as his traits align more with natural sciences rather than business. Let's assign 0.1 (10%).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given the broad range of other fields, his personality sketch not substantially aligning with Business Administration, let's assume 0.25 (25%).

   Thus, using Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)}
   \]

* Note: To compute the actual values, we should also have \( P(E) \). However, since we are only comparing relative likelihoods, we can ignore \( P(E) \).

Let's standardize the results:
\[
P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{(0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.1 \cdot 0.2)} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.02} = \frac{0.08}{0.10} = 0.8
\]

\[
P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{(0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.1 \cdot 0.2)} = \frac{0.02}{0.08 + 0.02} = \frac{0.02}{0.10} = 0.2
\]

So the results, while keeping in the initial constraints of moderate priors and likelihoods, are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
