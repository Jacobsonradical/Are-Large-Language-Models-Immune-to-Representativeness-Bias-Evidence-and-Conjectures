Let's assess the probabilities in accordance with the given personality sketch and the fields mentioned. We'll begin by estimating \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for both fields based on the information provided. Then we'll compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given that Adam is one graduate student among many fields, we'll assume a relatively low prior, say 0.05.
- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch matches someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's love for nature, plants, animals, and strong empathy, this match is quite high. Let's assume 0.7.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch matches someone not studying agricultural and veterinary science. Since Adam's personality highly aligns with this field, we can assume a lower probability for this converse case. We'll estimate 0.3.

Applying Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) = 0.7 \cdot 0.05 + 0.3 \cdot 0.95 = 0.035 + 0.285 = 0.32 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{0.32} = \frac{0.035}{0.32} \approx 0.109 \]

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. We'll assume this is relatively higher than a specialized field like agricultural science but still not extremely high. Let's say 0.1.
- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch matches someone studying business administration. Given the sketch's focus on nature, empathy, love for animals—qualities that don't specifically align with business—we'll estimate this as low, around 0.2.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch matches someone not studying business administration. This is higher, given that it's consistent with many other fields that are not business-focused. We'll estimate 0.4.

Applying Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{ P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) = 0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.4 \cdot 0.9 = 0.02 + 0.36 = 0.38 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.38} = \frac{0.02}{0.38} \approx 0.053 \]

Based on the above computations:
