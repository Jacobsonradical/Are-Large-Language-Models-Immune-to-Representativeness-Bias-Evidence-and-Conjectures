To approach this problem, let's break down each required component: the prior probabilities \(P(H)\), the likelihoods \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E|\neg H)\). Then we'll use Bayes' Theorem to compute the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\).

### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **Prior Probability \(P(H)\):** This is the probability that any randomly selected graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. This value might be relatively low given the overall distribution of students across various disciplines, but we assume some reasonable base rate. Let's assume \(P(H) = 0.05\).
  
- **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\):** Given that Adam fits the description of being curious about nature, appreciating hard work, and loving animals, it's highly likely that someone with his personality is in this field. So we assume a high value, say \(P(E|H) = 0.8\).
  
- **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\):** This is the probability that someone not in agricultural and veterinary science has Adam's characteristics. While these traits are not unheard of outside this field, they might be less common. Let's assume a value of \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.2\).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Given:
- \( P(H) = 0.05 \)
- \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.95 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \)

Calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.19 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.23 \]

Now calculate \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.174 \]

### 2. Business Administration

- **Prior Probability \(P(H)\):** Business administration is a common field, so we can assume a higher base rate. Let's say \(P(H) = 0.2\).
  
- **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\):** While some traits like appreciation for hard work might fit, others like love for nature and animals might not strongly align. Let's assume a moderate value, say \(P(E|H) = 0.3\).
  
- **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\):** This is similar to the first calculation, let's assume \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.2\).

Given:
- \( P(H) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \)

Calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.2) + (0.2 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.06 + 0.16 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.22 \]

Now calculate \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.22} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.22} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.273 \]
