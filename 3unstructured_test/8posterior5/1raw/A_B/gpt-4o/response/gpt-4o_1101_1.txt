Let's first break down the information provided and make a considered judgment about the probabilities and apply Bayes' rule.

**Bayes' Rule Formula**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We will need to estimate the values for:
1. \( P(H) \) - The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \) - The probability of observing the personality sketch if Adam is in the given field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - The probability of observing the personality sketch if Adam is NOT in the given field.

Since we do not have exact numbers for P(E), we can assume it will be the same for all computations, allowing us to use relative values. For simplicity, letâ€™s consider hypothetical probabilities.

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)**: Business administration is quite a common field. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \) for graduate students.
2. **P(E|H)**: A genuine curiosity about nature and animals, plus an interest in abstract concepts, does not strongly align with business administration. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The traits are quite general, so they could be common among other fields. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H)**: This is less common than business administration, but not extremely rare for someone in the U.S. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).
2. **P(E|H)**: The personality sketch aligns very well with agricultural and veterinary science (love for animals, nature, etc.). Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: These traits are less common among those not in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

### Computation using Bayes' Rule

### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a common term for both calculations and we're focusing on relative probabilities:
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.1 \cdot 0.1 + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1-P(H_{BA})) } \]

\[ 
P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.18} = \frac{0.01}{0.19} \approx 0.0526 
\]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E)_{AVS} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} \]

\[ 
P(H|E)_{AVS} = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.2 \cdot 0.95} = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.19} = \frac{0.04}{0.23} \approx 0.1739 
\]

So, based on these heuristic estimations:

{
  "business administration": "0.0526",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.1739"
}
