Let's break down the probabilities to estimate the likelihood that Adam was enrolled in each field based on his personality sketch.

### Field 1: Business Administration
1. **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
    - Business administration is a common field, so let's assume a moderate prior probability. 
    - P(H) ≈ 0.2

2. **P(E|H):** The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
    - The personality traits described (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals) are not strongly aligned with what we typically associate with business administration.
    - P(E|H) ≈ 0.1

3. **P(E|¬H):** The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was NOT enrolled in business administration.
    - Considering that his traits are more aligned with other fields, this probability is higher.
    - P(E|¬H) ≈ 0.3

Using Bayes' Rule: 
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8}
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.24} = \frac{0.02}{0.26} \approx 0.077
\]

So, for business administration:
\[
P(H|E) \approx 0.077
\]

### Field 2: Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
    - This is a more specialized field, so we assume a lower prior than for business administration.
    - P(H) ≈ 0.05

2. **P(E|H):** The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
    - The traits (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals) are strongly aligned with this field.
    - P(E|H) ≈ 0.8

3. **P(E|¬H):** The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was NOT enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
    - This would be lower given the alignment of his personality with agricultural and veterinary science.
    - P(E|¬H) ≈ 0.15

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.15 \cdot 0.95}
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.1425} = \frac{0.04}{0.1825} \approx 0.219
\]

So, for agricultural and veterinary science:
\[
P(H|E) \approx 0.219
\]

### Summary
\[
{
  "business administration": 0.077,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.219
}
\]
