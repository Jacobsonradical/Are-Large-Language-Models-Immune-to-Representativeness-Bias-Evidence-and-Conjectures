Let's analyze the probabilities required to compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Rule, which states:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Here, \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field. \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is in that field. \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not in that field.

Let's define our assumptions:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior, \( P(H) \):**
   - Given Adam's keen interest in nature, plants, and animals, assume a higher likelihood of him being in this field.
   - \( P(H) = 0.2 \) (20% chance)
   
2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \):**
   - Given this field, the personality sketch seems highly likely.
   - \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \) (80% chance)
   
3. **Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   - If Adam is not in this field, the probability of observing such a personality sketch decreases.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \) (10% chance)
   
### Business Administration

1. **Prior, \( P(H) \):**
   - Given Adam’s interests, it's less likely but possible that he's in a field like business administration.
   - \( P(H) = 0.05 \) (5% chance)
   
2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \):**
   - Personality traits don't directly align but could be plausible.
   - \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \) (30% chance)
   
3. **Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   - If Adam is not in this field, the probability of observing such a personality sketch isn’t affected much.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \) (20% chance)

To compute the normalized probabilities \( P(H|E) \), we need to first find \( P(E) \).

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

Let's denote the two fields evaluated in the problem as A (agricultural and veterinary science) and B (business administration).

\[
P(E) = P(E|A) \cdot P(A) + P(E|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)
\]

Given multiple potential hypotheses, we must consider all potential other fields (sum of all priors):

\[
P(E) = P(E|A) \cdot P(A) + P(E|\neg A) \cdot (1 - P(A))
\]

Let's compute these:

\[
P(E_A) = 0.8 \cdot 0.2 + 0.1 \cdot 0.8 = 0.16 + 0.08 = 0.24
\]

Now for \( P(B) \):

\[
P(E_B) = 0.3 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.95 = 0.015 + 0.19 = 0.205
\]

For Bayes' Rule (for each):

\[
P(A|E) = \frac{P(E|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{0.24} = \frac{0.16}{0.24} \approx 0.67
\]

\[
P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.05}{0.205} = \frac{0.015}{0.205} \approx 0.073
\]

Representing the probabilities as requested:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.67,
  "business administration": 0.073
