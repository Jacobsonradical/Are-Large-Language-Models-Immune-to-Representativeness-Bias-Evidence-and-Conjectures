Sure, let's go through the process step by step for each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work, the prior seems higher. 
   - Let's estimate: \( P(H_{ag\&vet}) = 0.3 \)

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of E given H, that is, how likely Adam's personality sketch is if he was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. 
   - Given Adam's traits, this seems very likely: \( P(E|H_{ag\&vet}) = 0.9 \)

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of E given not H. This considers all other fields.
   - Adam’s profile might fit to some extent in other fields but not as perfectly: \( P(E|\neg H_{ag\&vet}) = 0.2 \)

Using Bayes’ rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{ag\&vet}) P(H_{ag\&vet}) + P(E|\neg H_{ag\&vet})(1 - P(H_{ag\&vet})) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.9 \cdot 0.3 + 0.2 \cdot 0.7 = 0.27 + 0.14 = 0.41 \]

So,

\[ P(H_{ag\&vet}|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.3}{0.41} \approx 0.659 \]

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration.
   - Given Adam's personality sketch, this seems less likely: \( P(H_{bus}) = 0.1 \)

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of E given H, that is, how likely Adam's personality sketch is if he was enrolled in Business Administration.
   - Adam’s characteristics do not closely fit this field: \( P(E|H_{bus}) = 0.2 \)

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of E given not H.
   - We already calculated this: \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.41 \)

Using Bayes’ rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.41} \approx 0.049 \]

In conclusion:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.659,
  "business administration": 0.049
}
```
These values show that based on Adam's personality sketch, he is much more likely to be enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science than in Business Administration.
