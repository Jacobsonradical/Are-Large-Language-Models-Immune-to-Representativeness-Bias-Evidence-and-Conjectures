To apply Bayes' theorem in this context, we need to calculate the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\) for each field given the personality sketch \(E\). Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

Where:
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the given field.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood that Adam has the personality traits \(E\) given that he is enrolled in the field \(H\).
- \(P(E|\neg H)\) is the likelihood that Adam has the personality traits \(E\) given that he is not enrolled in the field \(H\).

For simplicity, we can make qualitative estimates based on the given personality sketch and typical characteristics of students in these fields.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

1. **P(H):** Let's assume a moderate prior that Adam might be in this field, given his love for nature and animals, say \(P(H) = 0.2\).

2. **P(E|H):** This field is quite aligned with his traits of curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. Let's set this high, say \(P(E|H) = 0.9\).

3. **P(E|\neg H):** Among students not in agricultural and veterinary science, these traits might still be moderately common but less so. Let's estimate this at \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.3\).

4. **P(E):** This is a normalization constant, but in the context of only two hypotheses, we can compute relative comparisons rather than needing the exact value.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.2}{0.9 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot (1 - 0.2)} = \frac{0.18}{0.18 + 0.24} = \frac{0.18}{0.42} \approx 0.4286\]

### Business Administration:

1. **P(H):** Let's assume a lower prior for Adam being in business administration, given the lesser match of his traits with typical business students, say \(P(H) = 0.1\).

2. **P(E|H):** Traits such as a deep love for animals and curiosity about nature are less characteristic of business administration students. Let's estimate this low, say \(P(E|H) = 0.2\).

3. **P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood of these traits in students not in business administration might still be around our earlier estimate, say \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.35\).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.35 \cdot (1 - 0.1)} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.315} = \frac{0.02}{0.335} \approx 0.0597\]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4286,
  "business administration": 0.0597
}
```

These numbers reflect the relative likelihood of Adam being enrolled in each of these fields given his personality traits.
