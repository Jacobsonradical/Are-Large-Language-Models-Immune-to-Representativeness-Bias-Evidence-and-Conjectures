To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing \( E \) given that Adam is not in that field (aggregate for all other fields, but we use it comparatively here).
- \( P(E) \) is the normalization factor, ensuring the total probability sums to 1, but for comparison, we can focus on relative values without explicitly calculating \( P(E) \).

First, let's assign some reasonable values based on the description provided:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): Given Adam's deep love for animals and curiosity about nature, it is fairly plausible that he is in this field. Let's estimate \( P(H) \) at 0.3.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam has these personality traits if he is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is high. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) at 0.9.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of having these traits and not being in this field might still be relatively high, due to the broad nature of the traits. Let’s set this at 0.3.

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): Adam does not exhibit traits typically associated with business administration (e.g., high interest in finance, economics, leadership in corporations). Let's estimate \( P(H) \) at 0.05.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of having these traits if enrolled in Business Administration seems low. Let’s set this at 0.2.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Similar to before, let's keep this consistent at 0.3 to balance against all other fields. 

Now applying Bayes' rule comparatively for both fields:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} = \frac{0.27}{P(E)} \]

2. **Business Administration**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} = \frac{0.01}{P(E)} \]

Those ratios denote the relative likelihood. Even without normalizing (dividing by \( P(E) \)), it's clear that **Agricultural and Veterinary Science** has a higher value than **Business Administration**. Normalizing these will provide the final values, but for simplicity, we can denote relative likelihood directly:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.27,
  "business administration": 0.01
}
