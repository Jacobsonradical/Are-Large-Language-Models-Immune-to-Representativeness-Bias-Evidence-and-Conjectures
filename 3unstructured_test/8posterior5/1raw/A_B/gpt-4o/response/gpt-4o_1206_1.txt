To apply Bayes' Rule \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \), we need to estimate the probabilities of the hypotheses and evidence. Here’s the step-by-step process for each field:

**1. Business Administration:**

- **P(H):** The prior probability that a random graduate student is in Business Administration.
  Let's assume a low prior, say 0.05 (5%), since people with Adam's interests and personality traits are usually not associated with Business Administration.
  
- **P(E|H):** The probability that Adam's personality sketch fits if he is in Business Administration.
  Given his curiosity about nature, empathy for animals, and love for working outdoors, the fit seems low. Let's say 0.02 (2%).

- **P(E|¬H):** The probability that Adam's personality sketch fits if he is not in Business Administration.
  This would be higher since there are many fields where his interests and personality could be relevant. Let's set this at 0.2 (20%).

**2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

- **P(H):** The prior probability that a random graduate student is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
  Let's assume a moderately high prior, say 0.10 (10%), since students in this field often have genuine curiosity about nature, plants, empathy for animals, etc.

- **P(E|H):** The probability that Adam's personality sketch fits if he is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
  Given his traits that align strongly with this field, let's assume it's high, say 0.8 (80%).

- **P(E|¬H):** The probability that Adam's personality sketch fits if he is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
  Again, this would be lower than P(E|H) but still not very low, reflecting the likelihood the description matches non-agricultural fields. Let's assume 0.3 (30%).

Now we can plug these into Bayes' Rule.

For **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.02 \times 0.05) + (0.2 \times 0.95) = 0.001 + 0.19 = 0.191 \]
Now:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02 \times 0.05}{0.191} \approx 0.0052 \]

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where:
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.10) + (0.3 \times 0.9) = 0.08 + 0.27 = 0.35 \]
Now:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.10}{0.35} \approx 0.2286 \]

Thus, the probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": 0.0052,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.2286
}
