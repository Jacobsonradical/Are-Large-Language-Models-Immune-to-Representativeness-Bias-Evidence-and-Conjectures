Given Adam's personality sketch and the fields provided, let's analyze the probabilities.

### Hypotheses
H1: Adam was enrolled in Business Administration.
H2: Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

### Prior Probabilities
P(H1): Prior probability for Business Administration.
P(H2): Prior probability for Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

For simplicity, we might assume that all fields have an equal initial likelihood if we don't have specific prior data. However, given Adam's interests, it makes sense to adjust these accordingly. Generally, the probability that a random student is in either of these programs could be different based on university stats, but we'll assume them initially as equally likely and will then adjust for the given sketch.

### Likelihoods
P(E|H1): Probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was in Business Administration.
P(E|H2): Probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
P(E|¬H1): Probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was not in Business Administration.
P(E|¬H2): Probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

Given Adam’s love for nature, animals, and his curiosity about plants, it seems much more likely that he is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science than Business Administration.

P(E|H1) would be relatively low because Business Administration doesn’t directly correlate with a strong appreciation for nature, animals, and abstract concepts.

P(E|H2) would be high because these areas are closely related to Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

### Estimations
Let's estimate these values cautiously:

\[
P(H1) \approx 0.3 \quad (\text{business administration})
\]
\[
P(H2) \approx 0.7 \quad (\text{agricultural and veterinary science})
\]

\[
P(E|H1) \approx 0.1 
\]
\[
P(E|H2) \approx 0.8 
\]

\[
P(E|\neg H1) \approx 0.6 
\]
\[
P(E|\neg H2) \approx 0.2 
\]

### Bayesian Calculations

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
Where:
\[ 
P(E) = P(E|H1)P(H1) + P(E|H2)P(H2)
\]

Calculations:

**For Business Administration (H1):**
\[
P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.3) + (0.8 \times 0.7) = 0.03 + 0.56 = 0.59
\]
\[
P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1)P(H1)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.3}{0.59} \approx 0.051
\]

**For Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H2):**
\[
P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.3) + (0.8 \times 0.7) = 0.03 + 0.56 = 0.59
\]
\[
P(H2|E) = \frac{P(E|H2)P(H2)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.7}{0.59} \approx 0.949
\]

Hence, the probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": "0.051",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.949"
}
