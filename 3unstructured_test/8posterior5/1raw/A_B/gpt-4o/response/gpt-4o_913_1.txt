To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for both fields using Bayes' rule, we need to:

1. Assess \( P(H) \) for each field: this is the prior probability of Adam being in that field.
2. Assess \( P(E|H) \) for each field: this is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is in that field.
3. Assess \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field: this is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is not in that field.
4. Use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant and not given explicitly, we can compare the relative probabilities.

Let's start with the assessments and then the computations.

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \)**:
   Graduate students can be in numerous fields, but business administration is quite common. Let's assume a rough estimate like \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.3 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \)**:
   Traits such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work don't strongly align with business administration. Thus, this probability could be relatively low. Let's assign \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \)**:
   Given that there are many other fields and we don't have specific negation probabilities, let's say \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.5 \), assuming there's a good chance other fields align with these traits.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \)**:
   This field is less common than business administration but it's highly aligned with Adam's interests. Assign a rough \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.2 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \)**:
   Adam's traits strongly align with agricultural and veterinary science. Assign a high \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.8 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \)**:
   Assuming there's a significant probability these traits belong to other fields minus the specific AVS aspects, letâ€™s assign \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.5 \).

Now, we apply Bayes' rule proportionally:

### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]
Since \( P(E) \) is constant across hypotheses:
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} \propto P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) \]
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.3 = 0.03 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E)_{AVS} = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{AVS} \propto P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) \]
\[ P(H|E)_{AVS} \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.2 = 0.16 \]

Now, normalizing these values for proportions:

Total proportion = \( 0.03 + 0.16 = 0.19 \)

Thus:
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.03}{0.19} \approx 0.158 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{AVS} = \frac{0.16}{0.19} \approx 0.842 \]

### Final Answer

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.158,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.842
}
