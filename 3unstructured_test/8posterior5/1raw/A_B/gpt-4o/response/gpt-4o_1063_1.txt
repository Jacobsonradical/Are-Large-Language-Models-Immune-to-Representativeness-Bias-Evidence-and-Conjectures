Let's first break down the problem using Bayes' theorem:

### Bayes' Theorem
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field given his personality traits.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality traits given he was enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality traits, which can be derived using the law of total probability.

Firstly, let's assign hypothetical values to each component for the required fields:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science. Since this is somewhat aligned with his interests in nature and animals, let's assume it is relatively moderate.
  \[ P(H) = 0.15 \]
  
- **P(E|H):** The likelihood of observing Adam’s traits if he is in agricultural and veterinary science.
  \[ P(E|H) = 0.8 \]
  
- **P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood of observing Adam’s traits in other fields.
  \[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \]

### Business Administration
- **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam is in business administration. Considering it doesn't align as well with his given personality traits, let’s assume it is lower.
  \[ P(H) = 0.05 \]
  
- **P(E|H):** The likelihood of observing Adam’s traits if he is in business administration.
  \[ P(E|H) = 0.1 \]
  
- **P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood of observing Adam’s traits in other fields still remains the same.
  \[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.25 \]

### Using these to compute P(H|E)
For each field, the equation for Bayes' theorem becomes:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times (1 - 0.15)} \\
P(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.17} \\
P(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \\
P(H|E) \approx 0.414
\]

#### Business Administration
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.05}{0.1 \times 0.05 + 0.25 \times (1 - 0.05)} \\
P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.2375} \\
P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.2425} \\
P(H|E) \approx 0.021
\]

### Final Answer
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.414,
  "business administration": 0.021
}
```

These results suggest that given Adam's personality traits, it is far more likely that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science rather than business administration during his graduate studies in 2021.
