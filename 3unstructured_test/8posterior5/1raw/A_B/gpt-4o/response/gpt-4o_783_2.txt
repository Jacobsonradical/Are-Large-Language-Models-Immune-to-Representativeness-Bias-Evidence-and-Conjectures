To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to know the following probabilities:
1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in a given field \( H \).
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in the given field \( H \).

Bayes’ Rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) (the marginal probability of observing the evidence) is the same for both hypotheses being evaluated here, we can focus on the numerator of Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given the personality sketch of Adam, let’s evaluate the fields:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Let's assign a reasonably moderate prior since it isn't an uncommon field and fits with his interests.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Given his curiosity about nature, appreciation for plants, deep love for animals, and empathy, this field aligns well with his personality sketch.
3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: We should consider that if he is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, the probability of the sketch matching other fields could be lower for fields unlike this one.

### Business Administration
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Let’s assign a lower prior probability because the personality sketch doesn’t align as well with this field.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The traits described (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals) don’t align well with what we typically expect for someone in business administration.
3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of the sketch matching this field if he is not in another field is relatively low.

Let's assign hypothetical values for the probabilities:

1. Agricultural and veterinary science:
   - \( P(H) = 0.25 \) (reasonable prior given his interests)
   - \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \) (very likely given his personality)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \) (less likely in general if not in this field)

2. Business administration:
   - \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (lower prior given the disconnect with his interests)
   - \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \) (unlikely given his personality)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \) (somewhat likely given variability in other fields)

Now using Bayes Rule:

- For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.25 = 0.2 \]

- For business administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.15 = 0.015 \]

Normalizing these values (optional for comparison but not necessary as asked):

Total sum = 0.2 + 0.015 = 0.215

Normalized probabilities:
\[ P(H|E) \text{ for agricultural and veterinary science} = \frac{0.2}{0.215} \approx 0.93 \]
\[ P(H|E) \text{ for business administration} = \frac{0.015}{0.215} \approx 0.07 \]

Hence our final results are:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.93,
  "business administration": 0.07
}
