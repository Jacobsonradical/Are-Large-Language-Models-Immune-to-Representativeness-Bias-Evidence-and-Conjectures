Given the personality sketch E of Adam, we need to estimate the likelihoods and prior probabilities for each field to compute the posterior probability using Bayes' rule. Here's an approach to filling in the values:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field, without knowing his personality sketch.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is not enrolled in that field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)**: This can be considered as the prior probability of a graduate student being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, which is likely lower given the vast number of fields. Let's assume a value of 0.05.
- **P(E|H)**: Given Adamâ€™s curiosity about nature, love for animals, and high empathy, this fits well with the agricultural and veterinary science field. Let's assign a high probability of 0.9.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Given the unique attributes, it's less likely that a person not in this field would match the personality sketch as closely. Let's assume a value of 0.1.

### Business Administration

- **P(H)**: This can be considered as the prior probability of a graduate student being enrolled in business administration, which is relatively high given the popularity of the field. Let's assume a value of 0.2.
- **P(E|H)**: The personality sketch does not align strongly with traits typical of business administration. Let's assign a moderate-to-low probability of 0.2.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Given that there are many fields outside business administration, it's somewhat likely that his personality could align with another field. Let's assume a value of 0.1.

Now, we use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Calculating separately for each field:

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

\[ P(E)_{\text{ag}} = (0.9 \cdot 0.05) + (0.1 \cdot 0.95) = 0.045 + 0.095 = 0.14 \]

\[ P(\text{H}_{\text{ag}} | E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.14} = \frac{0.045}{0.14} \approx 0.321 \]

#### Business Administration

\[ P(E)_{\text{bus}} = (0.2 \cdot 0.2) + (0.1 \cdot 0.8) = 0.04 + 0.08 = 0.12 \]

\[ P(\text{H}_{\text{bus}} | E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.12} = \frac{0.04}{0.12} \approx 0.333 \]

So, the posterior probabilities are roughly:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.321,
  "business administration": 0.333
}

It's important to note that these estimates can change depending on assumptions made for prior probabilities and likelihoods.
