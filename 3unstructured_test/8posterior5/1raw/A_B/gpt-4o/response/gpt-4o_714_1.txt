To calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to follow the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields and does not need to be normalized to add up to 1 (as we're only calculating relative probabilities), we will focus on \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Here's a step-by-step approach to estimate these probabilities for each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H):** Probability that Adam was enrolled in this field. Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, and a strong appreciation for hard work, he appears to be a good fit for agricultural and veterinary science. Let's estimate this probability as moderately high, say 0.3.
- **P(E|H):** Given that Adam is enrolled in this field, the personality sketch matches well with someone in this field. Therefore, let's assign a high probability, say 0.7.
- **P(E|\neg H):** Probability of Adamâ€™s personality traits if he was not enrolled in this field. Given the alignment of his traits with agricultural and veterinary science, if he were not in this field, his traits might be less common. Let's assign a moderate value of 0.2.

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.7 \cdot 0.3 \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.21 \]

### Business Administration
- **P(H):** Probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Adam's traits do not strongly align with typical business administration, which may not correlate as closely with empathy for animals, curiosity about nature, etc. Let's give this a low prior probability, say 0.1.
- **P(E|H):** Given that he is enrolled in business administration, the likelihood of having the specified personality traits is lower. Let's assign a low probability, say 0.2.
- **P(E|\neg H):** Probability of Adam having these traits if he was not in business administration might still be moderately high, given these are broad and somewhat rare traits. Let's assign a moderate value of 0.25.

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.1 \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.02 \]

Now let's summarize the answers:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.21,
  "business administration": 0.02
}
```

This calculation shows that the probability Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is relatively higher compared to business administration, given his personality traits.
