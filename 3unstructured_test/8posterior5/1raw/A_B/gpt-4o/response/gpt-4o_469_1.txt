First, let's assign some hypothetical values based on the personality sketch of Adam. 

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
1. **P(H)**: The probability that Adam is generally enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Let's say P(H) is 0.1 (meaning 10% of the people are enrolled in this field).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, this field aligns well with his interests. Let’s assume P(E|H) is high, say 0.8.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - If Adam were not enrolled in this field, there could still be a chance that his personality traits appear, but it's lower. Let’s assume P(E|\neg H) is 0.2.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))}\]

\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9}\]

\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.18}\]

\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.26}\]

\[P(H|E) \approx 0.3077\]

**Business Administration:**
1. **P(H)**: The probability that Adam is generally enrolled in business administration.
   - Let's say P(H) is 0.15 (meaning 15% of the people are enrolled in this field).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is enrolled in business administration.
   - Given Adam’s personality traits, it is less likely that he matches this field well. Let’s assume P(E|H) is low, say 0.1.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is not enrolled in business administration.
   - Given that the majority of other fields align with his traits more than business administration does, let’s assume P(E|\neg H) is higher, say 0.25.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))}\]

\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{0.1 \cdot 0.15 + 0.25 \cdot 0.85}\]

\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.015}{0.015 + 0.2125}\]

\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.015}{0.2275}\]

\[P(H|E) \approx 0.0659\]

Given these calculations, the probabilities are as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3077,
  "business administration": 0.0659
}
```
