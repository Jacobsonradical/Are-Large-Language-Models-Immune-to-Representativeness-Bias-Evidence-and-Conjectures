To solve this using Bayes' rule, we'll need to estimate the probabilities for the different hypotheses and the evidence provided. Here's the process:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's estimate this to be relatively low, say 0.05 (5%).
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the evidence given the hypothesis. Considering Adam’s love for nature, plants, and animals, and his curiosity about nature, this is likely high. Let's set it at 0.8 (80%).
- **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science. This would be lower, perhaps 0.2 (20%), as other fields may not align well with his personality sketch.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{(0.8 \times 0.05) + (0.2 \times 0.95)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.19} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.23} \approx 0.174 \]

### Business Administration

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in business administration. Let's set this a bit higher, say 0.1 (10%).
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the evidence given the hypothesis. Considering Adam's characteristics, this is likely low since business administration does not directly align with his interests. Let's set it at 0.1 (10%).
- **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is not in business administration. This would remain relatively unchanged, perhaps 0.25 (25%).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.1}{(0.1 \times 0.1) + (0.25 \times 0.9)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.225} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.235} \approx 0.043 \]

Here's the output:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.174,
  "business administration": 0.043
