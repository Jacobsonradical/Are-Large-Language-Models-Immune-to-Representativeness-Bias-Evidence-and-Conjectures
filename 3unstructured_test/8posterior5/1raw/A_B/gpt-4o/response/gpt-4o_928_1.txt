To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to determine the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihoods of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Here's the formulation using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For the sake of simplicity, we will assume that \( P(E) \) is the same across all hypotheses considered, thereby focusing on the relative comparisons. 

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (Adam displaying strong interests in nature, animals, and plants)**:

   - **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**:
     Grad students are spread across a wide range of fields. Let's assume the probability of a student being in this field is reasonably low given the total range of fields, say \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
     Given Adam's traits (interest in nature, plants, strong empathy, love for animals), it is very likely that someone in this field would possess such traits. Let's use a high likelihood, say \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

   - **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
     Given that there are many other fields with lower alignment to Adam’s described characteristics, we would assign a lower likelihood of observing such traits in those fields. Hypothetically, \( P(E|\neg H) \) could be around \( 0.3 \).

2. **Business Administration**:

   - **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**:
     Business administration programs are quite common among graduate students. We could assume a higher prior probability as many students enroll in business administration, say, \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
     Adam's described characteristics (interest in nature, animals, and abstract concepts) are less typical for a graduate student in business administration compared to other fields. A lower likelihood might be appropriate here, say \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).

   - **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
     Given that Adam’s traits could be relatively rare in business schools compared to other fields with more alignment to nature and animals, this likelihood would be higher. We might estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \).

Now, applying Bayes' rule for each hypothesis:
 
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  \[
  P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)}
  \]
  Relative to \( P(E) \), the numerator is \( 0.08 \).

- **Business Administration**:
  \[
  P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)}
  \]
  Relative to \( P(E) \), the numerator is \( 0.04 \).

Given these values (and assuming \( P(E) \) is normalized across more hypotheses in a comprehensive model), we can reason the relative conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08,
  "business administration": 0.04
}
```

Note: The exact numbers can be adjusted to match real statistical granularity if available, but the relative magnitudes should respect Adam’s detailed interests aligning more closely with fields like agricultural and veterinary science.
