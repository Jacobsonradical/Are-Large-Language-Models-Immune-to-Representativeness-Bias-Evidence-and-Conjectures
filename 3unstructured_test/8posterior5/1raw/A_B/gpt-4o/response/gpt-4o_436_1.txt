To determine \( P(H|E) \), let's first outline our estimations for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

1. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): This is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration, regardless of the personality sketch. Given that business administration is a common field, let's assume this probability could be around 0.2.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch aligns with someone in business administration. Given his interests in nature, animals, and abstract thinking, this seems less likely. Let's assume this to be 0.1.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is in any field other than business administration. Since many other fields, like scientific ones, might fit his personality better, let's assume this to be higher, around 0.4.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This is less common than business administration, but given his personality sketch, it might be a bit higher for him specifically. Let's assume it to be 0.1.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch aligns with someone in this field. Given his interests, this is much higher. Let's say 0.7.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is in any field other than agricultural and veterinary science. Considering that many fields might not fit as well as this one, let's assume 0.2.

### Calculations using Bayes' Rule

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)} \]

#### 1. Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{(0.1 \times 0.2) + (0.4 \times 0.8)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.32} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.34} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0588 \]

#### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.1}{(0.7 \times 0.1) + (0.2 \times 0.9)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.07}{0.07 + 0.18} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.07}{0.25} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.28 \]

Thus, the outputs are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0588,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.28
}
