To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) where \( H \) denotes a specific field and \( E \) denotes Adam's personality sketch, we'll use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, we'll focus on the relative likelihoods rather than exact probabilities and focus on the ratios of \( P(E|H) \).

### Key Assumptions:
1. **P(H)** denotes the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the given field.
2. **P(E|H)** represents how likely Adam's personality sketch \( E \) is given that he is in the specified field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)** represents how likely Adamâ€™s personality sketch \( E \) is given that he is not in the specified field.
4. **P(E)** is the total probability of \( E \) which can be derived but is not necessary for the comparative analysis here.

### Hypotheses Analysis:

#### Business Administration:
- **P(H)**: Let's assume enrollments are relatively common, say, around 0.1 (since Business Administration is very broad and popular).
- **P(E|H)**: This might be low because the sketch emphasizes nature, animals, and abstract problem-solving, which are not typical for Business Administration. Let's say 0.2.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: We'd assume for most other fields, traits vary, so let this be 0.7.

Using the above, we can then estimate:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H)P(H) = 0.2 \times 0.1 = 0.02 \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- **P(H)**: Enrollment, particularly for someone like Adam with relevant traits, might be lower due to less popularity but more aligned, say 0.05.
- **P(E|H)**: This will be high because the personality sketch aligns well with agricultural sciences or veterinary sciences. Let's assume 0.8.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Same as before, 0.7.

Using the above, we can then estimate:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H)P(H) = 0.8 \times 0.05 = 0.04 \]

Even though these are not normalized and exact calculations, the comparative values should give us a good sense.

### Summary of Probabilities (Comparative):

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.04
}
```

This implies that based on Adam's personality sketch, it is more probable for him to be enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science compared to Business Administration, given his interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy.
