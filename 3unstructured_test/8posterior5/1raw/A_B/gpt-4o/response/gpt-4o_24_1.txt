To apply Bayes' rule and calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given Adam's personality sketch \( E \), we'll need to estimate the probabilities as follows:

1. **Prior probability \( P(H) \) -** The initial probability of Adam being in each field without knowing his personality sketch.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \) -** The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch \( E \) given he is in a specific field \( H \).
3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \) -** The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch \( E \) given he is in a different field \(\neg H \).

For simplicity, we'll make some reasonable assumptions about these probabilities based on the personality sketch.

### Evaluating Prior Probability \( P(H) \)

- **Agricultural and veterinary science**: Considering Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, it seems relatively likely he might be in this field. We'll estimate a moderate prior probability for this.
  
- **Business administration**: Judging by Adam's empathy and lack of explicit mention of business-related skills, this seems less likely. We'll assign a lower prior probability.

### Evaluating Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)

- **Agricultural and veterinary science**: Adam's traits fit well with this field. A high likelihood is appropriate.
  
- **Business administration**: His traits don’t align particularly well with business administration. A low likelihood seems reasonable.

### Evaluating Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)

- For both fields, to simplify calculations, we'll assume generic values for the probability that someone not in the specified field would have Adam’s traits.

### Formulating Values

Given:
- \( P(H) \) for **agricultural and veterinary science** = 0.3 (moderately likely based on interests)
- \( P(H) \) for **business administration** = 0.1 (less likely)
  
And estimating likelihoods:
- \( P(E|H) \) for **agricultural and veterinary science** = 0.8 (high fit)
- \( P(E|H) \) for **business administration** = 0.2 (low fit)
  
For \( P(E|\neg H) \):
- For simplicity, let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) \) = 0.4 for both cases (average probability of having those traits)

### Applying Bayes' Rule

Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) (total probability of traits) can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.3) + (0.4 \times 0.7) = 0.24 + 0.28 = 0.52 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.3}{0.52} \approx \frac{0.24}{0.52} \approx 0.462 \]

#### Business Administration
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \times 0.1) + (0.4 \times 0.9) = 0.02 + 0.36 = 0.38 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{0.38} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.38} \approx 0.053 \]

### Final Answer

  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.462,
  "business administration": 0.053
}
