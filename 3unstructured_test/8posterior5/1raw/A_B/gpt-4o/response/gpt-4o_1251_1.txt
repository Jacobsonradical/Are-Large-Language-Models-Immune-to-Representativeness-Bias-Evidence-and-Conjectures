To solve the problem, we'll use Bayes' rule, which requires us to determine the following probabilities:

1. P(H): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the field (before knowing the personality sketch).
2. P(E|H): The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in the specific field.
3. P(E|¬H): The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in the specific field.

Bayes' rule formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have P(E) (the normalization constant) for the specific fields, we'll simplify to comparing the relative likelihoods and priors directly.

Let's assign some reasonable values in a hypothetical scenario:
1. **P(H)**: Without any other information, let's assume a uniform prior distribution among many fields, knowing that there are many graduate paths. For simplicity, we'll assign smaller priors to each specific field because we're choosing just two out of many potential fields.

2. **P(E|H)**: This evaluates how well the personality sketch fits with the chosen field.

3. **P(E|¬H)**: This is essentially the "average" fit of the personality sketch for graduate students not in the specific field.

### Let's assign hypothetical values:

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- P(H) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.1 (assuming a smaller fraction of total graduate students are in this field)
- P(E|H) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.8 (Adam’s characteristics fit well with this field: love for nature, plants, and animals)
- P(E|¬H): Let's assume an average relevance probability with other fields: 0.2

#### Business Administration:
- P(H) for Business Administration: 0.1 (assuming an equal prior probability for simplicity)
- P(E|H) for Business Administration: 0.1 (Adam’s characteristics don't intuitively match with typical business administration traits as strongly)
- P(E|¬H): Let's assume an average relevance probability with other fields: 0.2

Now we apply Bayes' theorem but we'll just compare the numerators due to limited information about P(E).

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]

#### Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.1 = 0.01 \]

By normalizing the probabilities for the two fields, if we consider these two exclusive possibilities:

\[
\text{Sum} = 0.08\ (Agricultural and Veterinary Science) + 0.01\ (Business Administration) = 0.09
\]

Now we can normalize these values:

\[
P(Agricultural\ and\ Veterinary\ Science|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.09} \approx 0.89
\]
\[
P(Business\ Administration|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.09} \approx 0.11
\]

Based on these values:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.89",
  "business administration": "0.11"
}
