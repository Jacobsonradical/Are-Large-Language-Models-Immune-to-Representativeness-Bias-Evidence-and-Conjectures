Let's evaluate the fields based on the provided personality sketch and then apply Bayes' theorem to estimate the likelihood that Adam was enrolled in each given field.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science without knowing anything else. Given his strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, we can assume this is somewhat likely. Let's assume a relatively high prior due to Adam's interests, e.g., 0.3.
   - **P(E|H)**: This is the probability of the personality traits given that Adam is in the agricultural and veterinary science field. Given his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and warm heart, these traits highly align with someone in this field. Let's assign a high value, e.g., 0.8.
   - **P(E|¬H)**: This is the probability of these traits if Adam is not in this field. While these traits are specific, it's possible but less probable that someone in another field like business administration would share them. Let's suppose a lower value, e.g., 0.2.

   Using Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   Assuming:
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))
   \]
   \[
   P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.3) + (0.2 \cdot 0.7) = 0.24 + 0.14 = 0.38
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.3}{0.38} \approx 0.6316
   \]

2. **Business Administration**:
   - **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Based on the provided personality traits, Adam doesn't seem to have a strong alignment with business administration. Let's assume a lower prior probability, e.g., 0.1.
   - **P(E|H)**: This is the probability of the personality traits if Adam is in the business administration field. Empathy and love for animals are not typical traits of a business administration student but are possible. Let's assign a lower probability, e.g., 0.2.
   - **P(E|¬H)**: This is the probability of the traits outside the business administration field. Since we have two specific fields in question, the rest of the personality profile would lean towards agricultural and veterinary science. As before, let's use 0.2, which was used in the above estimation.

   Using Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))
   \]
   \[
   P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) = 0.02 + 0.18 = 0.20
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.20} = 0.1
   \]

Combining these calculations, the results are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6316,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
