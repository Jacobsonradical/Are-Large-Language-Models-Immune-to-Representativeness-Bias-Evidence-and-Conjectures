To use Bayes' Rule to calculate \( P(H|E) \), we need the following probabilities:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field \( H \).
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in the field \( H \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in the field \( H \).

Bayes' Rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant that ensures the probabilities sum to 1 across all possible fields, we will focus on comparing the relative values of \( P(H|E) \) for the given fields.

Let's estimate the values:

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

- **P(H)**: Let's assume a moderate prior probability for a graduate student in the U.S. choosing this field, assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
- **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's interests and characteristics (curiosity about nature, love for animals), it's highly likely he would be in this field if he were in this field, so \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Given his high intelligence and love for animals, the probability of this evidence appearing in another field is lower but not unlikely, so \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

#### Business Administration:

- **P(H)**: Let's assume a moderate prior probability for a graduate student in the U.S. choosing this field, assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
- **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's interests and characteristics, it's unlikely that he would be in this field, so \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of this evidence appearing in another field is higher, given his interests, so \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.9 \).

Now, we can use Bayes' Rule for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.1 \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.08 \]

2. **Business Administration**:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.1 \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.01 \]

To compare them, normalize the values so they sum to 1:

\[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.01} = \frac{0.08}{0.09} \approx 0.889 \]
\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.08 + 0.01} = \frac{0.01}{0.09} \approx 0.111 \]

But as you said, our totals do not need to add up to 1 in this context.

Thus, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.889,
  "business administration": 0.111
}
