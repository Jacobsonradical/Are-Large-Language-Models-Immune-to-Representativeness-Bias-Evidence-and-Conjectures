In order to estimate the probabilities required for Bayes' rule, we need to make some assumptions based on the given personality sketch of Adam and the nature of the fields specified.

First, let's lay out some assumptions about the probabilities:

**Hypothesis: Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
- P(H) = General probability that a graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in this field.
- P(E|H) = Probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is in this field.
- P(E|\neg H) = Probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in this field.

**Hypothesis: Business Administration**
- P(H) = General probability that a graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in this field.
- P(E|H) = Probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is in this field.
- P(E|\neg H) = Probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in this field.

General Assumptions:
1. These probabilities are not empirical and are to be estimated based on common sense and available information about the fields and the personality sketch.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H)**:
   - Let's assume the general probability that a graduate student is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is moderate but not very high, say around 0.1.
2. **P(E|H)**:
   - Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, the probability that he matches the profile if enrolled in this field is very high, let's assume 0.8.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**:
   - Assuming that students not in this specific field might not share his personality traits to the same extent, let's assume 0.2.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For simplicity in calculation, assume \(\neg H \) as the sum of all complementary fields, and their combined probability is 0.9.

\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9 = 0.08 + 0.18 = 0.26 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.26} \approx 0.3077 \]

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)**:
   - Let's assume the general probability that a graduate student is in Business Administration is higher due to the popularity of the program, say around 0.3.
2. **P(E|H)**:
   - Given Adam's personality sketch with a focus on empathy, intelligence, animals, and plants, the fit seems poor. Suppose it is around 0.1.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**:
   - Assuming students not in this field might better match his profile, say 0.4.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For simplicity in calculation, assume \(\neg H\) as the sum of all complementary fields excluding Business Administration, and their combined probability is 0.7.

\[ P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.3 + 0.4 \cdot 0.7 = 0.03 + 0.28 = 0.31 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.3}{0.31} \approx 0.0968 \]

Based on the above calculations, the results are as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3077,
  "business administration": 0.0968
}
```

These values give us the estimated probabilities that Adam is enrolled in either Agricultural and Veterinary Science or Business Administration given his personality sketch.
