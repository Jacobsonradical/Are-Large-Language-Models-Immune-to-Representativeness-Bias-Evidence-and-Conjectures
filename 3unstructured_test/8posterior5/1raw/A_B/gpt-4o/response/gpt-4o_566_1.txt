To calculate \( P(H|E) \), we use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \), we need to estimate the following probabilities to calculate \( P(H|E) \):

1. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in each field.
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in each field.

Let's consider the fields one by one:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(E|H)**: If Adam were enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, it makes sense given his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and understanding of hard work involved with these fields. Therefore, we might estimate \( P(E|H) \) to be fairly high, say 0.8.
- **P(H)**: The overall prior probability that a random graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science can be considered relatively low, but some students do pursue this path. So, we estimate \( P(H) \) as 0.1.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of having Adam's personality traits if he were not in agricultural and veterinary science might be less likely but still possible given the wide array of other fields that could align. So, we might estimate this as 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H)} \]

Calculating \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.1) + (0.3 \times 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.27 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.35 \]

Therefore:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.35} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.229 \]

### Business Administration

- **P(E|H)**: If Adam were enrolled in business administration, the described personality sketch might not be as fitting, but not impossible. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) as 0.2.
- **P(H)**: The prior probability of being in business administration is higher than agricultural and veterinary science due to its popularity. We estimate \( P(H) \) as 0.2.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of having Adam's traits if he were not in business administration might be higher as many suitable fields exist. So we could estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) similarly as before, 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule:

Calculating \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.2 \times 0.2) + (0.3 \times 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.24 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.28 \]

Therefore:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.2}{0.28} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.28} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.143 \]
