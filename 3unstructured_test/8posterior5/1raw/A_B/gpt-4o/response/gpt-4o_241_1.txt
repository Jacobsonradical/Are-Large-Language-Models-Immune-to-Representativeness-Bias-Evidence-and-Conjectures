To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' rule, which can be expressed as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given the personality sketch \( E \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in that specific field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch, which can be computed as \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Since we're not given specific probabilities and must make reasonable assumptions, we'll proceed accordingly:

1. **Hypothesis 1: Business Administration (H1)**
   - **P(H1)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration. Let's assume a reasonable generic prior, for example, 0.1.
   - **P(E|H1)**: The probability of the sketch of Adam if he's studying Business Administration. Given Adamâ€™s qualities (curiosity about nature, puzzles, empathy, etc.), this likelihood seems low. Let's assume 0.1.
   - **P(E|\(\neg\)H1)**: The probability of the sketch if he's in some other field. If we consider all other potential fields, this probability might be moderate. Let's assume 0.3.

Now, we calculate \( P(H1|E) \):
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1)}{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1) + P(E|\neg H1) \cdot P(\neg H1)} \]
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.1 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9} \]
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.27} \]
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.28} \approx 0.036 \]

2. **Hypothesis 2: Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H2)**
   - **P(H2)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Let's assume a reasonable generic prior, for example, 0.1.
   - **P(E|H2)**: The probability of the sketch of Adam if he's studying Agricultural and Veterinary Science. This likelihood is high given his characteristics. Let's assume 0.7.
   - **P(E|\(\neg\)H2)**: The probability of the sketch if he's in some other field. This remains the same as in H1, 0.3.

Now we calculate \( P(H2|E) \):
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2)}{P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2) + P(E|\neg H2) \cdot P(\neg H2)} \]
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.7 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9} \]
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.07}{0.07 + 0.27} \]
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.07}{0.34} \approx 0.206 \]

Therefore, the posterior probabilities are:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.036,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.206
}
```
