To calculate \(P(H|E)\) for each field using Bayes' Rule, we need these components:

1. \(P(H)\): Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
2. \(P(E|H)\): Likelihood of the evidence given that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): Likelihood of the evidence given that Adam was not enrolled in the given field.
4. \(P(E)\): Overall probability of the observed evidence, which can be computed using the law of total probability.

Bayes' Rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we only need to compute \(P(H|E)\) relative to the given fields, we'll use the simplified version:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

We'll assume \(P(H)\) for each field is equal initially, since no prior information about Adam's specific enrollment likelihood is given. Therefore, we primarily focus on the likelihood \(P(E|H)\) for each field and compare them.

Let's evaluate the details for the likelihoods:

### Business Administration

- **\(P(H)\)**: Assume it's 0.5 (no information bias).
- **\(P(E|H)\)**:
  - Adam's traits align less with typical business administration interests, which often involve less direct engagement with nature, animals, and strong empathy.
  - Hence, let's assume \(P(E|H) \approx 0.2\).

- **\(P(E|\neg H)\)**: As there's less alignment, assuming \(P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.8\) might be generous, but appropriate for contrasting calculation.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **\(P(H)\)**: Assume it's 0.5 (no information bias).
- **\(P(E|H)\)**:
  - Adam's traits strongly align with agricultural and veterinary science, given his curiosity about nature, plants, animals, and high empathy.
  - Hence, let's assume \(P(E|H) \approx 0.9\).

- **\(P(E|\neg H)\)**: Given the alignment, \(P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.1\).

Now, normalize these:

1. Compute the unnormalized probabilities:
   - Business administration: \(0.2 \times 0.5 = 0.1\)
   - Agricultural and veterinary science: \(0.9 \times 0.5 = 0.45\)

2. Normalize:
   - Total unnormalized probability \(= 0.1 + 0.45 = 0.55\)
   - Business administration normalized: \(\frac{0.1}{0.55} \approx 0.182\)
   - Agricultural and veterinary science normalized: \(\frac{0.45}{0.55} \approx 0.818\)

Therefore, the calculated probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.182,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.818
}
