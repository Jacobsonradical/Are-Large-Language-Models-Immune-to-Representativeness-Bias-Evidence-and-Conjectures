To use Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study, we need to assess the following probabilities:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in the field \( H \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in the field \( H \).

Bayes' theorem is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here is the step-by-step calculation for each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   Let's assume that the proportion of graduate students enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is moderately low:
   \[ P(H) \approx 0.05 \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   Given Adam's personality traits such as a genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, it's quite likely that he would be enrolled in this field:
   \[ P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   We need to consider how likely it is for someone with Adam's personality to be in any other field. Given the specific interests in nature and animals, this might not be as common:
   \[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \]

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   Business administration is a popular field among graduate students:
   \[ P(H) \approx 0.2 \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   Based on Adam's personality traits, it seems less likely that he would choose business administration:
   \[ P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   This is the probability of observing Adam's personality in any other field, excluding business administration:
   \[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \]

### Posterior Probabilities Using Bayes' Theorem

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
   Since \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \), we can compute:
   \[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.05) + (0.2 \times 0.95) = 0.04 + 0.19 = 0.23 \]
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.23} = \frac{0.04}{0.23} \approx 0.174 \]

2. **Business Administration**:
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
   \[ P(E) = (0.2 \times 0.2) + (0.4 \times 0.8) = 0.04 + 0.32 = 0.36 \]
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.2}{0.36} = \frac{0.04}{0.36} \approx 0.111 \]
