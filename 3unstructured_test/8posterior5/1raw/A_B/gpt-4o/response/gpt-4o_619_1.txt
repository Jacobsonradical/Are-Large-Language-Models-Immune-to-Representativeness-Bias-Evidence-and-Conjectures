To apply Bayes' Rule to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study, we need to establish the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) occurring given that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) occurring given that Adam is not enrolled in that particular field.
4. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of the personality sketch \( E \). However, this can be computed implicitly by normalizing the probabilities.

Bayes' Rule: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields, we only need to compute the product \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for normalization purposes.

Let's now make reasonable estimates for these probabilities:

### Business Administration:
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of a random graduate student being in business administration. Let's assume this to be around 0.2.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam having the described personality if he is studying business administration. Given the sketch, Adam's interests and personality (nature, animals, empathy) do not strongly align with typical business administration traits, so let's estimate it as 0.1.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of having the described personality in fields other than business administration. Since the personality sketch aligns less with business, this probability could be higher in other fields, say 0.6.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of a random graduate student being in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume this to be around 0.05 (as this field might be less common).
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam having the described personality if he is studying agricultural and veterinary science. This field aligns well with Adam's interests and personality. Let's estimate it at 0.8.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of having the described personality in fields other than agricultural and veterinary science. Given the specificity of his personality, let's estimate it at 0.3.

Now we calculate the unnormalized posterior probabilities:

### For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04 \]

Finally, we normalize these to get \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02+0.04} = \frac{0.02}{0.06} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.33 \]
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.02+0.04} = \frac{0.04}{0.06} = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.67 \]

Hence, the answers are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.33,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.67
}
