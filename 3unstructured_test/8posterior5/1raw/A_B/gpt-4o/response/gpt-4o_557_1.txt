To solve the problem, we need to apply Bayes' theorem which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field given the evidence E.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence E given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of evidence E which can be calculated as \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \)

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:  
   - \( P(H) \): Let's assume there is a moderately high prior probability Adam is in this field given his traits (e.g., 0.2).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's traits, it is very likely he is in this field (e.g., 0.9).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): This is more challenging to estimate. Let's assume an average likelihood someone not in this field would have those traits (e.g., 0.1).

   So,
   - \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) = 0.9 \cdot 0.2 + 0.1 \cdot 0.8 \approx 0.26 \)
   - \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.2}{0.26} \approx  0.692 \)

2. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): Given Adam's traits, we might infer that it's less likely he is in this field (e.g., 0.05).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given his traits, it's not very likely Adam is in this field (e.g., 0.05).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): As before, let's assume an average likelihood someone not in this field would have those traits (e.g., 0.1).

   So,
   - \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) = 0.05 \cdot 0.05 + 0.1 \cdot 0.95 \approx 0.0975 \)
   - \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.05}{0.0975} \approx 0.0256 \)

Thus, we have:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.692,
  "business administration": 0.0256
}
