To solve this, we will use Bayes' rule. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events in the following way:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability of hypothesis \(H\) given the evidence \(E\).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing evidence \(E\) given that hypothesis \(H\) is true.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \(H\).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of evidence \(E\) under all hypotheses.

Let’s denote:
- \( H_1 \) : Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( H_2 \) : Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|H_1) \): Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H_2) \): Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was enrolled in business administration.

### Step 1: Estimate the Probabilities

**1. Prior Probabilities, \( P(H_1) \) and \( P(H_2) \):**
- We assume there are many fields, so let's assume a relatively even distribution of students across the different graduate fields. For simplicity, we might use a low prior to start since we're considering only two fields among many possible ones.
 
  Let’s say:
  \[
  P(H_1) = 0.1
  \]
  \[
  P(H_2) = 0.1
  \]

**2. Conditional Probabilities, \( P(E|H_1) \) and \( P(E|H_2) \):**
- \( P(E|H_1) \): Adam has characteristics that align well with someone interested in agricultural and veterinary science (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy). Let’s assign a high probability.
  \[
  P(E|H_1) = 0.8
  \]

- \( P(E|H_2) \): Adam’s personality profile does not closely fit the stereotypical characteristics of someone studying business administration (such as less emphasis on nature and animals). Let’s assign a lower probability.
  \[
  P(E|H_2) = 0.1
  \]

**3. Probability of Evidence, \( P(E) \):**
- This is more complex to compute directly, but we don't need the exact value to make relative comparisons. We will instead use that it is a normalization factor ensuring the probabilities \(P(H|E)\) sum to 1.

### Step 2: Compute posterior probabilities \( P(H_1|E) \) and \( P(H_2|E) \)

Using Bayes' rule:
\[
P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)}
\]
\[
P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E)}
\]

The denominator \( P(E) \) is the same for both, so we’re interested in the relative magnitude.


### Step 3: Calculate

- For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[
P(H_1|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08
\]

- For business administration:
\[
P(H_2|E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.1 = 0.01
\]
 
### Normalizing Step

The normalized values will be:
\[
P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.01} = \frac{0.08}{0.09} \approx 0.89
\]
\[
P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.08 + 0.01} = \frac{0.01}{0.09} \approx 0.11
\]

So, the computed posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.89,
  "business administration": 0.11
}
```
