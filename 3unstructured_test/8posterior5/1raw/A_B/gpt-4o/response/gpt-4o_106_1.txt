To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam's enrollment in each field (agricultural and veterinary science, and business administration) using Bayes' rule, we need to determine the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \), which is the probability of the evidence given that he is not enrolled in that field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**
    - It is reasonable to assume a small proportion of graduate students are enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, let's estimate this as low, around 0.05.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**
    - Given the personality sketch of Adam having curiosity about nature, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work, it's highly likely he would be enrolled in this field. Let's estimate this as high, around 0.8.

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**
    - Assuming not being in agricultural and veterinary science, the probability of Adam still fitting this unique personality sketch is relatively lower. Let's estimate this as moderate, around 0.2.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Estimating \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.05) + (0.2 \times 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.19 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.23 \]

Therefore:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.174 \]

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**
    - It's reasonable to assume a medium proportion of graduate students are enrolled in business administration, let's estimate this as higher, around 0.15.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**
    - Given the personality sketch of Adam focusing on nature, puzzles, and animals, it seems less likely he would fit the typical business administration profile, let's estimate this as low, around 0.1.

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**
    - The probability of Adam fitting this unique personality profile while being in fields other than business administration is still relatively lower. Let's estimate this as similar to the first case, around 0.2.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Estimating \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.015 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.185 \]

Therefore:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.15}{0.185} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.081 \]
