Sure, let's analyze the two fields based on Adam's personality sketch and apply Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probability P(H|E).

### Preliminary Analysis

1. **P(H) - Prior Probability**
   - P(H for business administration): Considering the general distribution of graduate studies, let's assume a moderate prior probability for business administration, around 0.1 (10%).
   - P(H for agricultural and veterinary science): Given Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, let's assume a higher prior probability, around 0.05 (5%).

2. **P(E|H) - Likelihood**
   - P(E|H for business administration): The personality traits described don't align strongly with business administration, so assign a low likelihood, around 0.05.
   - P(E|H for agricultural and veterinary science): The traits very closely match agricultural and veterinary science, so assign a high likelihood, around 0.9.

3. **P(E|\neg H) - Likelihood under complement**
   - P(E|\neg H for business administration): Considering the vast number of other fields, we assume a moderate likelihood that his traits could match other fields like psychology or environmental science, around 0.8.
   - P(E|\neg H for agricultural and veterinary science): Given Adam's strong specific interests, assume a lower likelihood that his traits match other non-related fields, around 0.3.

### Applying Bayes' Rule

Bayes' rule: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is computed by:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

#### Business Administration
\[ P(E) = (0.05 \times 0.1) + (0.8 \times 0.9) = 0.005 + 0.72 = 0.725 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.1}{0.725} = \frac{0.005}{0.725} \approx 0.0069 \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(E) = (0.9 \times 0.05) + (0.3 \times 0.95) = 0.045 + 0.285 = 0.33 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.05}{0.33} = \frac{0.045}{0.33} \approx 0.136 \]

### Conclusion

Given the results of these computations, the probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": "0.0069",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.136"
}
