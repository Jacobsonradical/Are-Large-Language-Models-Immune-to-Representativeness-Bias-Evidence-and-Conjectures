To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in specific fields of study based on his personality sketch (E), we can make use of Bayes' theorem. The theorem is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the personality sketch.

In this scenario, we'll estimate the required probabilities for each field.

### For Business Administration

1. **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration.
    - This could be considered relatively moderate compared to other fields since Business Administration is a common field for graduate students in the U.S.
    - Let's estimate it as \(0.15\) (or 15%).

2. **P(E|H):** The probability of Adam's personality sketch if he were enrolled in Business Administration.
    - Considering Adam's traits (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals), these traits are less typical for a Business Administration student. However, it is still possible.
    - Estimate this as \(0.1\).

3. **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of Adam's personality sketch if he were not enrolled in Business Administration.
    - Since empathy and love for animals are more common in other fields, this could be relatively higher.
    - Let's estimate this as \(0.3\).

4. **P(E):** The total probability of observing Adam's personality sketch (summarizing across all fields).
    - For simplicity, assume that this is \(0.2\).

Using these values in Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{0.2} = \frac{0.015}{0.2} = 0.075 \]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
    - This is less common compared to Business Administration but aligns more with Adam's traits.
    - Let's estimate it as \(0.05\) (or 5%).

2. **P(E|H):** The probability of Adam's personality sketch if he were enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
    - Given Adamâ€™s love for nature, animals, empathy, and hard work, this fits well.
    - Estimate this as \(0.7\).

3. **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of Adam's personality sketch if he were not enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
    - There's still a chance for these traits in other fields but less so compared to this specific field.
    - Let's estimate this as \(0.2\).

4. **P(E):** The total probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.
    - For simplicity, use \(0.2\) (same as above).

Using these values in Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{0.2} = \frac{0.035}{0.2} = 0.175 \]

### Summary

Here are the estimated probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field given his personality sketch:
