To assess the probabilities requested, let's break down the problem as follows:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field, without any additional information.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam is enrolled in that field \(H\).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam is not enrolled in that field \(H\).

Applying Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \(P(E)\) is common in both computations and is not provided, we'll focus on the relative likelihoods.

Let's analyze each field first before computing the relative probabilities.

### Field: Business Administration

#### Prior Probability (P(H))
- Business Administration is a popular graduate field, so let's assume P(H) is high but not extremely so. Let's estimate it at: 
\[ P(\text{BA}) = 0.2 \]

#### Probability of Personality Sketch Given the Field (P(E|H))
- The given personality sketch emphasizes a love for nature, empathy, and a deep love for animals, which is less typical in Business Administration, so this should be lower:
\[ P(E|\text{BA}) = 0.01 \]

#### Probability of Personality Sketch Given Not the Field (P(E|\neg H))
- Since P(E) is distributed over many possible fields, the probability of this sketch given not this field is generally higher due to other more fitting fields:
\[ P(E|\neg \text{BA}) = 0.2 \]

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{0.01 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{BA}|E) \propto 0.002 \]

### Field: Agricultural and Veterinary Science

#### Prior Probability (P(H))
- This field is less common, but highly relevant given the sketch about animals and nature. Assume a moderate prior:
\[ P(\text{AVS}) = 0.05 \]

#### Probability of Personality Sketch Given the Field (P(E|H))
- The sketch perfectly fits this field, so this should be very high:
\[ P(E|\text{AVS}) = 0.8 \]

#### Probability of Personality Sketch Given Not the Field (P(E|\neg H))
- Since this trait can fit several other fields, but less perfectly, this should be moderate:
\[ P(E|\neg \text{AVS}) = 0.2 \]

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(\text{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{AVS}|E) \propto 0.04 \]

### Normalization

To provide values that can be understood in comparison without knowing \(P(E)\), we normalize relative values:

For Business Administration:
\[ P(\text{BA}|E) \approx \frac{0.002}{(0.002 + 0.04)} = \frac{0.002}{0.042} \approx 0.048 \]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(\text{AVS}|E) \approx \frac{0.04}{(0.002 + 0.04)} = \frac{0.04}{0.042} \approx 0.952 \]

Therefore:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.048,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.952
}
