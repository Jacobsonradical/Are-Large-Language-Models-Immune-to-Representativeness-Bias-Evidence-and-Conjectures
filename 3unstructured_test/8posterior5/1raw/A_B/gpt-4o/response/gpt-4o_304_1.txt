To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' theorem, we need to evaluate:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the respective field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given Adam was in the respective field.
- \( P(E \mid \neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given Adam was not in the respective field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch, which we can consider constant for comparison since it affects both \( P(H|E) \) calculations equally.

### For Business Administration:
- \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): The prior likelihood that a random graduate student is in business administration. This would likely be lower given Adam's detailed characteristics are not typically aligned with a business administration profile.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): The probability of Adam's personality traits given he is in business administration. This could be lower considering his warm heart, empathy, and deep love for animals, which are not typically core traits for business administration but not impossible.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \): The probability of Adam's personality traits given he is not in business administration, could be higher given how common empathy and animal love are in other fields.

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \): The prior likelihood that a random graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. This would likely be higher given his interests and traits.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \): Highly likely as his traits strongly align with agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \): The probability of Adam's personality traits given he is not in agricultural and veterinary science, maybe lower since his specific interests and traits are well aligned with AVS.

Assumptions for likelihoods and priors (values based on typical Bayesian reasoning):

- Let's assume:
  - \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.2 \)
  - \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.3 \)
  - \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.1 \)
  - \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.8 \)
  - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \) and \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \) are less critical in differentiation since \( P(E) \) normalizes these effectively in comparison.

### Compute \( P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \):
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \approx 0.2 \cdot 0.3 = 0.06 \]

### Compute \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) \):
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) \approx 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]

Finally, normalizing with the understanding \( P(E) \) affects both equally and the comparisons mainly hold:

  "business administration": 0.06,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08
}
