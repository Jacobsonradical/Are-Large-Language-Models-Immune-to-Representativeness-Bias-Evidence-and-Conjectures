Sure, let's analyze the fields with respect to the given personality sketch of Adam and apply Bayes' rule to calculate the posterior probabilities.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
     - As there's no specific context, we can assume a general prior for enrollment in various fields.
     - Let's assume the prior probability is 0.1 (10%).

   - **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
     - Given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, it strongly aligns with this field.
     - Assign a high probability, say 0.9 (90%).

   - **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in this field.
     - Given the many other fields, only a few might align similarly well.
     - Assign a moderate probability, say 0.2 (20%).

   Using Bayes' rule:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) * P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   Where \(P(E)\) can be computed as:
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|¬H) * P(¬H)
   \]
   \[
   P(E) = 0.9 * 0.1 + 0.2 * 0.9 = 0.09 + 0.18 = 0.27
   \]
   So:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 * 0.1}{0.27} = \frac{0.09}{0.27} \approx 0.333
   \]

2. **Business Administration**
   - **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
     - Assume a general prior probability, say 0.1 (10%).

   - **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
     - The sketch is less aligned with typical business administration traits.
     - Assign a low probability, say 0.05 (5%).

   - **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in this field.
     - Similarly, if not in business, he could be in another field matching the given traits.
     - Assign a moderate probability again, say 0.2 (20%).

   Using Bayes' rule again:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) * P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   Where \(P(E)\) remains the same as previously calculated:
   \[
   P(E) = 0.09 + 0.18 = 0.27
   \]
   So:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 * 0.1}{0.27} = \frac{0.005}{0.27} \approx 0.0185
   \]

Based on these calculations, the probabilities would be:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.333,
  "business administration": 0.0185
}
```
