To solve this, let's break down the problem using Bayes' theorem, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here are our steps:

1. **Determine P(H)** - the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field, based on general knowledge.
2. **Determine P(E|H)** - the probability of the evidence given the specific hypothesis.
3. **Determine P(E|\neg H)** - the probability of the evidence given any other field, not including the specific hypothesis.

Let's assign general probabilities based on reasonable assumptions:

- **Business Administration:**
  - P(H) (Prior) = 0.2
  - P(E\|H) (Likelihood) = 0.01 (The sketch doesn't match a typical business administration personality)
  - P(E\|\neg H) (Likelihood complement) = 0.7 

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
  - P(H) (Prior) = 0.05
  - P(E\|H) (Likelihood) = 0.7 (The sketch strongly matches this field)
  - P(E\|\neg H) (Likelihood complement) = 0.02

Next, we combine these values using Bayes' Theorem to calculate P(H|E) for each hypothesis:

### Business Administration:

Using Bayes' formula, we need to calculate:

1. Posterior Probability: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since P(E) can be expressed using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(E) = (0.01 \cdot 0.2) + (0.7 \cdot 0.8) = 0.002 + 0.56 = 0.562 \]

So, 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01 \cdot 0.2}{0.562} = \frac{0.002}{0.562} \approx 0.0036 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.05) + (0.02 \cdot 0.95) = 0.035 + 0.019 = 0.054\]

So,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{0.054} = \frac{0.035}{0.054} \approx 0.648 \]

Using these calculations, we can report:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0036,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.648
}
