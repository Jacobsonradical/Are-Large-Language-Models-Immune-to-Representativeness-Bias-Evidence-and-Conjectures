To compute the probabilities effectively, let's break down the problem using Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

It's important to note where each probability comes from:

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in that specific field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not enrolled in that specific field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.

Let's evaluate each component for the two graduate fields; agricultural and veterinary science, and business administration.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Considering Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, and animals from his personality sketch, the prior probability of him being in this field is relatively high. Let's estimate \( P(H) = 0.3 \).

- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's traits align very closely with this field (mentions of nature, plants, animals), the likelihood of observing the personality sketch if Adam is in this field is very high. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).

- **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Given that his interests and traits could still potentially align with other fields, but to a lesser extent, let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

### Business Administration
- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Given the personality sketch, it seems less likely that Adam is pursuing business administration. However, some intelligent and abstract thinkers do go into business, let's estimate \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The traits described, especially deep love for animals and nature, are less likely in a business administration context. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

- **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: For other fields, the likelihood of observing this personality sketch is still moderately reasonable. Let's still estimate it to be around \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Now, we can compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)} {P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1-P(H))} \]

### Calculations

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.3} {0.9 \cdot 0.3 + 0.2 \cdot (1-0.3)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.27} {0.27 + 0.14} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.27} {0.41} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.66 \]

#### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1} {0.1 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot (1-0.1)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01} {0.01 + 0.27} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01} {0.28} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.036 \]

Based on these calculations, here are the results:

  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.66,
