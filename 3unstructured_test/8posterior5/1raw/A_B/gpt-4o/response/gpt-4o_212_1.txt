Let's go through the process of estimating the probabilities and then applying Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \).

**Step 1: Define the Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**

For simplicity, let's assume the prior probability \( P(H) \) for each field is the proportion of students typically enrolled in that field in graduate schools in the U.S. In the absence of specific data, we'll use rough estimates:

- \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \approx 0.20 \) (since business administration is a common field)
- \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \approx 0.05 \) (since it's less common)

**Step 2: Define the Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**

This is the probability of the evidence (personality sketch) given that Adam is in a particular field:

- For business administration, \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \) might be low because the characteristics described (e.g., love for nature, love for animals) are not typical for business students. Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \approx 0.05 \).

- For agricultural and veterinary science, \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \) has a high match with the subjects' values and interests. Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \approx 0.90 \).

**Step 3: Define the Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**

This is the probability of the evidence given that Adam is not in the given field:

- For business administration, \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business administration}}) \) would be based on the likelihood of Adam's interests fitting into other fields (excluding business administration). Given Adam's specific interests, this might be relatively higher. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business administration}}) \approx 0.30 \).

- For agricultural and veterinary science, \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \) would similarly include other fields. Given the specificity of the interests, this might be moderate. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \approx 0.20 \).

**Step 4: Apply Bayes' Rule**

Bayes' rule: \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \), where \( P(E) \) can be computed using the law of total probability.

For simplicity, if we're only comparing two fields, we assume \( P(E) = P(E|H_1)P(H_1) + P(E|H_2)P(H_2) + P(E|\neg H_1)P(\neg H_1) \) since it would cover all scenarios. However, we'll just use direct computation to highlight the relative probabilities.

**For Business Administration:**

\( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}})}{P(E)} \)

\[
P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.20}{0.05 \cdot 0.20 + 0.90 \cdot 0.05} \approx \frac{0.01}{0.055} \approx 0.18
\]

**For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

\( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})}{P(E)} \)

\[
P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{0.90 \cdot 0.05}{0.05 \cdot 0.20 + 0.90 \cdot 0.05} \approx \frac{0.045}{0.055} \approx 0.82
\]

**Final Answer:**

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.18,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.82
}
```

These values represent the approximate posterior probabilities based on the given personality sketch and rough estimates.
