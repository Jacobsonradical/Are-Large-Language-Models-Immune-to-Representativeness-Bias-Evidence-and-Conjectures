To solve this problem, let’s start by breaking down the information provided and apply Bayes' theorem accordingly.

Here is the theorem for reference:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where:
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of hypothesis \(H\).
- \(P(E|H)\) is the probability of evidence \(E\) given hypothesis \(H\).
- \(P(E)\) is the total probability of the evidence.

Given that we only need the relative probabilities to compare the two fields, total normalization is not necessary.

### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1)

- P(H1): Probability that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
Let's assume the prior probability for each field is relatively low since there are many graduate fields of specializations.
- P(E|H1): Probability of Adam's personality sketch \(E\) given that he was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. This is relatively high because his curiosity about nature and love for animals align well with this field.
- P(E|¬H1): Probability of personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam was enrolled in any other field not related to Agricultural and Veterinary Science. This would be lower compared to P(E|H1).

### 2. Business Administration (H2)

- P(H2): Probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration.
Similarly, the prior probability is relatively low.
- P(E|H2): Probability of Adam's personality sketch \(E\) given that he was enrolled in Business Administration. This is likely low because his interests and traits do not align well with common expectations in this field.
- P(E|¬H2): Probability of personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam was enrolled in any other field not related to Business Administration.

Given these considerations, let's provide a plausible rough estimate:
- \(P(H1)\) = 0.02
- \(P(E|H1)\) = 0.7
- \(P(E|¬H1)\) = 0.05

- \(P(H2)\) = 0.02
- \(P(E|H2)\) = 0.1
- \(P(E|¬H2)\) = 0.5

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate \( P(H|E) \):

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1)}{P(E)} \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2)}{P(E)} \]

Since we are only interested in relative probabilities, we can compare the numerators directly without the denominator \( P(E) \).

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H1|E) \propto P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1) = 0.7 \cdot 0.02 = 0.014 \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H2|E) \propto P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2) = 0.1 \cdot 0.02 = 0.002 \]

Normalizing these values for comparability:

- Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.014}{0.014 + 0.002} = \frac{0.014}{0.016} \approx 0.875 \]

- Business Administration:
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.002}{0.014 + 0.002} = \frac{0.002}{0.016} \approx 0.125 \]

So, according to these calculations and the evidence provided:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.875,
  "business administration": 0.125
}
```
