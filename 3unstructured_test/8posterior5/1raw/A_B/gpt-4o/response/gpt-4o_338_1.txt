To estimate the likelihoods, let's first break down our understanding of each component in Bayes' rule:

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood that Adam exhibits personality sketch E given that he is enrolled in the particular field.
- **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood that Adam exhibits personality sketch E given that he is not enrolled in that particular field.
- **P(H|E)**: The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given personality sketch E.

Given the personality sketch E and the two fields, here are approximate values based on typical associations with those fields:

### Business Administration
- **P(H)** (prior probability for business administration): Business administration is a common field, so let's assign a prior probability of 0.2.
- **P(E|H)** (likelihood of personality sketch given business administration): Adam’s interests in nature, animals, and puzzles, along with his empathy and appreciation for hard work, are not typical traits most associated with business administration. Let's assign a lower likelihood of 0.1.
- **P(E|¬H)** (likelihood of personality sketch given not in business administration): Given Adam's traits, it feels more likely he wouldn't be in business administration, so let's assign a probability of 0.3 to this.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) \) can be calculated as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

Let's calculate it:
\[ P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8 = 0.02 + 0.24 = 0.26 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.26} = \frac{0.02}{0.26} \approx 0.077 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)** (prior probability for agricultural and veterinary science): This field is less common, so let's assign a prior probability of 0.1.
- **P(E|H)** (likelihood of personality sketch given agricultural and veterinary science): Adam exhibits many traits that align with this field, such as a love for nature and animals. Let's assign a high likelihood of 0.8.
- **P(E|¬H)** (likelihood of personality sketch given not in agricultural and veterinary science): Given Adam’s traits and interests, it feels less probable for him to have these traits in other fields, so let's assign a probability of 0.2.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(E) \] was already calculated as 0.26.
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.26} = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \approx 0.307 \]

Hence, the results are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.077,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.307
}
