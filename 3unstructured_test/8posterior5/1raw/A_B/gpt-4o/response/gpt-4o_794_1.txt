To calculate the conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we can use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without exact numeric values, we'll need to make educated guesses based on reasonable assumptions.

1. **Business Administration:**
   - Adam seems to have a strong affinity for nature, animals, and abstract concepts, which does not align well with a typical curriculum in business administration. Additionally, his quiet demeanor and interest in solving puzzles suggest a more scientific or analytical field.
   - Hypotheses:
     - \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration, which is likely low considering his interests.
     - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality traits if Adam were in business administration (also likely low).
     - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality traits if Adam were *not* in business administration (higher than \( P(E|H) \)).
   
   Assuming:
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \) (a rough guess based on the mismatch of interests).
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.8 \).
   
   Then:
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
   \]
   \[
   P(E) = (0.2 \times 0.1) + (0.8 \times 0.9) = 0.02 + 0.72 = 0.74
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{0.74} \approx 0.027
   \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - This field aligns well with Adam's curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals. It also tends to require high intelligence and an appreciation for hard work.
   - Hypotheses:
     - \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, which might be higher given his interests.
     - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality traits if Adam were in agricultural and veterinary science (likely high).
     - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality traits if Adam were *not* in agricultural and veterinary science (lower than \( P(E|H) \)).
   
   Assuming: 
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \) (a rough guess based on a good match of interests).
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \).
   
   Then:
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
   \]
   \[
   P(E) = (0.9 \times 0.3) + (0.5 \times 0.7) = 0.27 + 0.35 = 0.62
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 \times 0.3}{0.62} \approx 0.435
   \]

So, the conditional probabilities based on the provided personality sketch are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.027,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.435
}
```

These values reflect the relative likelihoods of Adam being enrolled in each field, based on the personality traits provided.
