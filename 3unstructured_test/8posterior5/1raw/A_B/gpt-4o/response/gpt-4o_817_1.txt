Let's analyze the given information to estimate the probabilities:

1. **P(H):** The probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field without any additional information.

2. **P(E|H):** The probability of the evidence given that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.

3. **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of the evidence given that Adam was not enrolled in the specific field.

We will use Bayes' theorem to compute P(H|E), which is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given the evidence.

Bayes' theorem is stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we do not have concrete values, we will make estimations. Let's assume equal priors for simplicity unless stated otherwise.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume it is low because this is a specialized field. Let’s assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam's traits being evident if he is enrolled in this field. Given his interest in nature, plants, and animals, this seems relatively high. So, \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of the evidence given that Adam is not in this field. While other fields could also relate to his interests, it's less likely. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Assuming \( P(H) = 0.1 \) and \( P(E) \) to be the normalization factor (which in this illustrative case we might not compute exactly), we get:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.08}{P(E)} \]

### Business Administration

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Given the popularity of this field, let’s assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam's traits being evident if he is enrolled in this field. Given his personality, it seems low but not impossible. So, \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).

- **P(E|\neg H)**: Using the complementary principle, let's make an educated guess. Since business administration is broadly different, we can estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.04}{P(E)} \]

### Results

By normalizing partially, we assume \( P(E) \) constant across comparisons:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8 * 0.1 / (0.8 * 0.1 + 0.3 * 0.9) ≈ 0.22,
  "business administration": 0.2 * 0.2 / (0.2 * 0.2 + 0.4 * 0.8) ≈ 0.111
}
```

Thus, tentatively normalized:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.22,
  "business administration": 0.111
}
```

Note: These values represent conditional probabilities given assumptions without actual normalization—just for judgments.
