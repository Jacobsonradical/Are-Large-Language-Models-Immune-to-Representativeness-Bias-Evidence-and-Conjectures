Let's define the probabilities based on the given personality sketch of Adam. We'll analyze the fields of business administration and agricultural and veterinary science based on the given traits, then use Bayes' rule to calculate the posterior probabilities.

### Definitions of Probabilities:
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given \( H \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in the specific field.

### Business Administration:
- **P(H):** This is the prior probability of being enrolled in business administration. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
- **P(E|H):** Given Adam's personality traits, it seems less likely that he is enrolled in business administration, but still possible due to high intelligence and appreciation for hard work. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
- **P(E|\neg H):** Probability of observing his personality traits if he is not in business administration. This could be higher given that agricultural and veterinary science might better fit his traits. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.7 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))} \]

### Calculation for Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.7 \cdot 0.8} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.56} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.58} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.034 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- **P(H):** This is the prior probability of being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).
- **P(E|H):** Given his love for nature, plants, animals, and empathy, it seems highly likely. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
- **P(E|\neg H):** Probability of observing personality traits if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science might be lower. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))} \]

### Calculation for Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.4 \cdot 0.95} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.38} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.42} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.095 \]

### Final Probability Values:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.034,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.095
}
```

These probabilities indicate that, based on the given personality sketch, it is more likely that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration.
