Let's break down the information given about Adam and apply Bayesian reasoning to assess the probabilities.

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each respective field. Given there are many fields in which a graduate student could be enrolled and no specific initial information about probabilities:
   - P(H_agricultural and veterinary science): This has some higher prior probability given Adam’s interest in nature and animals.
   - P(H_business administration): This is likely lower given no provided indicators Adam has interest in business.

2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of having the personality sketch E given each field H.
   - P(E|H_agricultural and veterinary science): Adam’s personality fits well with this field due to his interest in plants, animals, and nature, along with his empathy.
   - P(E|H_business administration): The fit is lower since Adam’s interests and skills (nature, animals, abstract concepts) don’t align as directly with business.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam’s traits if he were in any other field. Since Adam’s traits can fit naturally with fields associated with nature and animals, P(E|\neg H) might be reasonable but less direct for some other fields.

Given these considerations, I will assign reasonable but non-rigorous values for the probabilities:

- P(H_agricultural and veterinary science) = 0.15
- P(H_business administration) = 0.05

- P(E|H_agricultural and veterinary science) = 0.8 (Highly fitting)
- P(E|H_business administration) = 0.1 (Lesser fit)

- P(E|\neg H_agricultural and veterinary science) = 0.2 (Since his traits can fit multiple fields like environmental science, biology, etc.)
- P(E|\neg H_business administration) = 0.8 (Since we are comparing against a wide array of fields where his characteristics do fit better)

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need P(E), the total probability of the evidence, which is:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{agricultural}) \cdot P(H_{agricultural}) + P(E|\neg H_{agricultural}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{agricultural})) \]

Similarly for business:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{business}) \cdot P(H_{business}) + P(E|\neg H_{business}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{business})) \]

Assuming equal values for \(P(E)\) when calculating marginal totals, these approximate probabilities shall suffice for a ‘high-level’ computation:

Using the given values:
\[ P(H_{agricultural}|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85} = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.17} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.41 \]
\[ P(H_{business}|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.05}{0.1 \cdot 0.05 + 0.8 \cdot 0.95 } = \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.76} \approx \frac{0.005}{0.765} \approx 0.0065 \]

Therefore, in the JSON format as requested:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.41,
  "business administration": 0.0065
}
```

These probabilities reflect that Adam is much more likely to be engaged in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration, considering his personality traits.
