To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Rule, we need the following pieces of information:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam having the described personality sketch given he was enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of having the described personality sketch given he was not enrolled in the given field.

Bayes' Rule for computing \( P(H|E) \) is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since the total does not need to add up to 1 (because there are other fields), we can qualitatively estimate the probabilities and normalize if necessary.

Let's assume the following:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): Let's assume a moderate prior probability for any random graduate student being in this field, say 0.05.
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy, it seems highly likely that he would fit well in this field. Let's assume this probability is quite high, say 0.9.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): While this includes a wide range of other fields, the likelihood of having Adam's specific personality in other unrelated fields (given his specific traits) might be lower. Estimate this to be around 0.1.

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): The prior for any random graduate student, let's again assume a moderate probability, say 0.1.
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's disinterest in typical business traits and the focus on animals, nature, and puzzles, it seems less likely he would be in this field. Assume it to be quite low, say 0.05.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam having his personality in other fields (excluding business administration) might be higher compared to being specifically in business, say 0.4.

Given these values:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.045}{P(E)} \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.005}{P(E)} \]

We recognize \( P(E) \) is the sum of all possible states:
\[ P(E) \approx 0.045 + 0.005 + \text{other fields} \]
Since we are only comparing these two probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "significantly higher, exact value depends on normalization but let's assign 0.9 relative importance",
  "business administration": "significantly lower, let's assign 0.1 relative importance"
