To solve this problem, let's apply Bayesian reasoning. Bayes' Rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field, given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch, given that he was enrolled in that specific field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.

We'll estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field and then apply these values to compute \( P(H|E) \). Note that we won't calculate \( P(E) \) directly, but we will normalize the results so they add up to 1 across all hypotheses if only these two fields are considered.

First, let's assume that the priors \( P(H) \) for each field are roughly equal since we don't have any specific information otherwise. For simplicity, consider \( P(H) = 0.5 \) for each field considered here.

Considering the given personality sketch \( E \):

### Business Administration
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \): Given Adam's personality traits (love for nature, plants, animals, strong empathy, solving puzzles), these traits are less typical of someone in business administration. Hence, this probability might be relatively low. Let's estimate it to be around \( 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business administration}}) \): This would include all other fields, including agricultural and veterinary science. Again, without specific information, letâ€™s assign a rough estimate \( 0.5 \) due to varied possibilities being equal.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): Adam's traits are highly indicative of a field involving nature, or animals, like agricultural and veterinary science. Thus, this probability would be higher. Let's estimate it to be \( 0.7 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): Again, this includes all fields except for agricultural and veterinary science, let's estimate this to be \( 0.4 \).

Now, using Bayes' Rule, we get:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

- For Business Administration:
  \[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}})}{P(E)} \]

- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
  \[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})}{P(E)} \]

By comparing the probabilities, we can normalize them:


Normalization Constants:

\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.2 \cdot 0.5 = 0.1 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.7 \cdot 0.5 = 0.35 \]


\[ \text{Normalization Factor} = 0.1 + 0.35 = 0.45 \]


\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.45} = \approx 0.222 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{0.35}{0.45} = \approx 0.778 \]


Thus,

{
  "business administration": 0.222,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.778
