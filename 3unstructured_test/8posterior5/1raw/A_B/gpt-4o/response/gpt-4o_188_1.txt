To calculate the probabilities, let's break down the requirements and utilize Bayes' rule for each field.

Bayes' rule is defined as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since calculating \( P(E) \) directly is complex without specific data, we can focus on the relative probabilities for a quick estimate based on \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E| \neg H) \). We will use plausible assumptions for these probabilities based on the provided personality sketch.

### Business Administration

Assumptions:
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam's field is business administration. It's a fairly common field, but based on Adam's personality sketch, it's less likely than other fields closely linked with nature and animals.
- \( P(E|H) \): Probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he is in business administration. This is relatively low, as these traits don't align much with the typical focus in business administration.
- \( P(E| \neg H) \): Probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he is not in business administration. This is higher since his traits align more with other fields.

Choice of values:
- \( P(H) \): ~0.1
- \( P(E|H) \): ~0.1
- \( P(E| \neg H) \): ~0.4

Using Bayes' rule (approximating relative values):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.4} \approx 0.025 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

Assumptions:
- \( P(H) \): Higher prior probability since agricultural and veterinary science aligns with Adam's interests and personality traits.
- \( P(E|H) \): High likelihood of observing Adam's traits if he is in this field.
- \( P(E| \neg H) \): Lower compared to \( P(E|H) \), as Adam's traits strongly suggest this field.

Choice of values:
- \( P(H) \): ~0.2
- \( P(E|H) \): ~0.7
- \( P(E| \neg H) \): ~0.3

Using Bayes' rule (approximating relative values):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.3} \approx 0.467 \]

Therefore, the computed probabilities for each field, based on these assumptions, are:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.025",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.467"
}
```
