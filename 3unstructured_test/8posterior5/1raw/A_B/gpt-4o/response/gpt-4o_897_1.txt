To apply Bayes' rule, we first need to estimate the necessary probabilities:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch (E) given that Adam was enrolled in a specific field (H).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of the personality sketch (E) given that Adam was not enrolled in a specific field.
4. **P(H|E)**: The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field given the personality sketch (E).

Here’s the breakdown:

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: Graduate students in business administration are fairly common, but without specific data, we can assign a prior of around 0.1 (or 10%).
- **P(E|H)**: The personality traits described (curiosity about nature, love of animals, solving puzzles) are less typical for a business administration student. Therefore, we might estimate this probability as low, say 0.1.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: This includes all other fields, but considering that students from many other fields might better match the personality sketch, we can assign a somewhat higher probability, say 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Since \( P(E) \) is a composite probability, we simplify:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
So, if we normalize later:
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.1 \times 0.1 = 0.01 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: Graduate students in this field are less common than business but still relevant. We can assign a prior of around 0.05 (or 5%).
- **P(E|H)**: The personality sketch is highly compatible with this field, hence we might consider this probability high, say 0.8.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: This includes all other fields, but given the alignment of traits, let’s assign moderately, say 0.2.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.8 \times 0.05 = 0.04 \]

We should normalize these values against each other to have a proportion:
Normalize: 
\[ 0.01 \rightarrow \frac{0.01}{0.01+0.04} = \frac{1}{5} = 0.2 \]
\[ 0.04 \rightarrow \frac{0.04}{0.01+0.04} = \frac{4}{5} = 0.8 \]

Therefore, the updated posterior probabilities considering no other fields have dominated probabilities in the given context:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}
