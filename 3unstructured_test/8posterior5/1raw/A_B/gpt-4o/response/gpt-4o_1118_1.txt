To compute the probability of Adam being enrolled in either agricultural and veterinary science or business administration given his personality sketch, we'll use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll need to estimate the following probabilities for both fields:
1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam would be in the given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the personality sketch given he is in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the personality sketch given he is not in that field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
#### Estimations:
1. **P(H)**: Since we're considering Adam's field of study among many other possibilities, let's assume a rough estimate where agricultural and veterinary science is less common than some fields but still reasonably likely for someone with his interests. Let's assign it a prior probability of \(0.1\).

2. **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's love for nature, plants, animals, and his empathy, it seems highly likely he would fit well in this field. We can assign a high probability here, say \(0.8\).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: For someone not in this field but still with Adam's personality, we can assume a lower probability since not all fields align with his traits as well. Let's estimate \(0.2\).

Using these estimates:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.18 = 0.26 \]

Now applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.26} \approx 0.31 \]

### Business Administration
#### Estimations:
1. **P(H)**: Business administration is a common field, but given Adam's interests, it seems less likely. Let's assign a prior probability of \(0.05\).

2. **P(E|H)**: The given personality traits (empathy, love for nature, animals) are less directly aligned with business. We might assign a lower probability, say \(0.2\).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: For a personality sketch like Adam's and not being in business administration, we might assume a higher probability since many other fields could match his interests. We can estimate it at \(0.4\).

Using these estimates:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.05 + 0.4 \cdot 0.95 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.01 + 0.38 = 0.39 \]

Now applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.05}{0.39} \approx 0.026 \]

The final probabilities are thus:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.31,
  "business administration": 0.026
}
