To solve this problem using Bayes' rule, we need to calculate the posterior probability P(H|E) for each field given the personality sketch E of Adam. Let's denote:

- P(H) as the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
- P(E|H) as the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
- P(E|\neg H) as the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in a particular field.
- P(H|E) as the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given the personality sketch E.

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To simplify calculations, since \( P(E) \) is constant for both cases, we'll omit it from our calculations, as it's a normalizing factor.

Let's assign plausible values based on the personality sketch.

1. **Business Administration**:
   - P(H): Probability that Adam was in business administration. Since graduate students can be from any field, let's assume a relatively uniform distribution. Let's say P(H) = 0.3.
   - P(E|H): Given the personality sketch, the likelihood that Adam was in business administration is relatively low because his interests and personality don't align strongly with typical characteristics of business administration (e.g., curiosity about nature, deep love for animals). Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.1.
   - P(E|\neg H): The likelihood that Adam has this personality sketch given that he is not in business administration should be higher. Given other possibilities, let’s assume P(E|\neg H) = 0.3.

   Using Bayes' rule (ignoring the normalizing factor P(E)):

   \[
   P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.3 = 0.03
   \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - P(H): Probability that Adam was in agricultural and veterinary science. Let’s assume a higher prior probability because his interests align with nature and animals. Let's say P(H) = 0.2.
   - P(E|H): Given the personality sketch, the likelihood that Adam was in agricultural and veterinary science is very high as his characteristics match well with this field. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.7.
   - P(E|\neg H): The likelihood that Adam has this personality sketch given he is not in agricultural and veterinary science should be lower. Let’s assume P(E|\neg H) = 0.2.

   Using Bayes' rule (ignoring the normalizing factor P(E)):

   \[
   P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.7 \cdot 0.2 = 0.14
   \]

Given these proprotional calculations, we normalize to get probabilities that sum up to 1 for these cases:

Normalization factor = 0.03 + 0.14 = 0.17

{
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.03}{0.17} = 0.176 \approx 0.18 \),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{0.14}{0.17} = 0.824 \approx 0.82 \)
}

So, the final answer is:

{
  "business administration": 0.18,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.82
}
