To determine the probabilities \( P(H|E) \), we first need to evaluate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field using the provided information about Adam. We will then apply Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Considering that agricultural and veterinary science is a niche field, we can estimate a relatively lower prior probability. Let's assume \( P(\text{Agri}) = 0.1 \).
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's personality sketch aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy). Let's assume a high likelihood: \( P(E|\text{Agri}) = 0.8 \).
3. **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: For fields other than agricultural and veterinary science, the likelihood of such a perfect fit with Adam's personality is less certain. Let's assign a moderate value: \( P(E|\neg \text{Agri}) = 0.3 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(\text{Agri}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{Agri}) \cdot P(\text{Agri})}{P(E)} \]

Normalizing factor \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|\text{Agri}) \cdot P(\text{Agri}) + P(E|\neg \text{Agri}) \cdot P(\neg \text{Agri}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) = 0.08 + 0.27 = 0.35 \]

So,
\[ P(\text{Agri}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.35} \approx 0.229 \]

### Business Administration
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Business Administration is a common field. Let's assign a higher prior probability: \( P(\text{Bus}) = 0.2 \).
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The personality traits described do not strongly align with typical traits associated with business administration (which often involve leadership, management skills, etc.). Let's assign a lower likelihood: \( P(E|\text{Bus}) = 0.1 \).
3. **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: For fields other than business administration, the probability that the given personality traits fit can be less specific. Letâ€™s assign a moderate value: \( P(E|\neg \text{Bus}) = 0.5 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(\text{Bus}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{Bus}) \cdot P(\text{Bus})}{P(E)} \]

Normalizing factor \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|\text{Bus}) \cdot P(\text{Bus}) + P(E|\neg \text{Bus}) \cdot P(\neg \text{Bus}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.5 \cdot 0.8) = 0.02 + 0.4 = 0.42 \]

So,
\[ P(\text{Bus}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.42} \approx 0.048 \]

Final Results:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.229,
  "business administration": 0.048
}
```

The calculations provide us with the posterior probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either agricultural and veterinary science or business administration, given his personality sketch and the base probabilities assumed for these fields.
