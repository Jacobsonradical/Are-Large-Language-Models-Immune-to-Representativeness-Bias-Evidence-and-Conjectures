To judge the probabilities, we first need to break down the provided information.

1. **P(H)**: This is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the respective fields. Without any specific data, let's make some general assumptions for the U.S.:

   - Business administration programs are quite common among graduate students.
   - Agricultural and veterinary science fields are less common but could match his interest in nature and animals.

2. **P(E|H)**: This is the probability of the personality sketch given the hypothesis that Adam is in the respective field. 

   - Business administration: It seems unlikely that Adam's personality sketch aligns well with the typical characteristics of a business administration student, especially given his strong interest in nature and animals.
   - Agricultural and veterinary science: The personality sketch fits very well with this field due to his love for nature, empathy for animals, and appreciation for hard work.

3. **P(E|¬H)**: This is the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in the respective field. 

   - Business administration: Higher, as many other fields could align better with his interests.
   - Agricultural and veterinary science: Lower, as fewer fields align as well with the provided personality sketch.

Using these qualitative assessments, let's make some quantitative estimates:

### Business Administration
- P(Business Administration): 0.3 (reasonable probability given many graduate students choose this field)
- P(E|Business Administration): 0.05 (personality doesn't align well with business administration)
- P(E|¬Business Administration): 0.2 (higher probability reflecting many other suitable options)

Using Bayes’ rule:
\[ P(Business Administration|E) = \frac{P(E|Business Administration) \cdot P(Business Administration)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.3}{0.05 \cdot 0.3 + 0.2 \cdot 0.7} \]
\[ P(Business Administration|E) \approx \frac{0.015}{0.015 + 0.14} = \frac{0.015}{0.155} \approx 0.097 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- P(Agricultural and Veterinary Science): 0.1 (fewer students in this field than business administration)
- P(E|Agricultural and Veterinary Science): 0.9 (strong alignment with his personality)
- P(E|¬Agricultural and Veterinary Science): 0.05 (fewer fields align as well)

Using Bayes’ rule:
\[ P(Agricultural and Veterinary Science|E) = \frac{P(E|Agricultural and Veterinary Science) \cdot P(Agricultural and Veterinary Science)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{0.9 \cdot 0.1 + 0.05 \cdot 0.9} \]
\[ P(Agricultural and Veterinary Science|E) \approx \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.045} = \frac{0.09}{0.135} \approx 0.667 \]

Thus, the computed probabilities are:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.097,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.667
}
