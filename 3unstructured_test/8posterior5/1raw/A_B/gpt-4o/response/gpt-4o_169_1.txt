To let Bayes' theorem guide us through the calculation of the posterior probabilities $P(H|E)$, we'll follow several steps:

1. **Prior Probability, $P(H)$**: This is the initial probability of each hypothesis before considering the evidence.
2. **Likelihood, $P(E|H)$**: This is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis.
3. **Marginal Likelihood, $P(E)$**: This can be broken into the components $P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)$.

Since $P(E)$ can be derived from the combination of agricultural and veterinary science, business administration, and other fields, it's computationally simplified by focusing on the two provided fields.

### Computation for Business Administration
1. **Prior Probability, $P(H = \text{business administration})$**:
   - Let’s assume a prior $P(H_{BA}) = 0.2$, as business administration is a common field of enrollment.
2. **Likelihood, $P(E|H_{BA})$**:
   - Given the sketch, business administration is less likely since the characteristics are more aligned with sciences related to nature and animals. Let's estimate $P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.1$.
3. **Marginal Likelihood, $P(E|\neg H_{BA})$**:
   - Among those not in business administration, the profile highly matches a science-oriented person. Assuming a generic distribution over many non-business fields, let’s estimate $P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.3$.

### Computation for Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **Prior Probability, $P(H = \text{agricultural and veterinary science})$**:
   - Let’s give a higher prior since it closely matches the sketch. Assume $P(H_{AV})=0.1$.
2. **Likelihood, $P(E|H_{AV})$**:
   - The evidence strongly matches the personality sketch. Let's estimate $P(E|H_{AV}) = 0.8$.
3. **Marginal Likelihood, $P(E|\neg H_{AV})$**:
   - This would be significantly lower since the fit is not as strong. Let’s assume $P(E|\neg H_{AV}) = 0.25$.

We can now apply Bayes’ rule to compute $P(H_{BA}|E)$ and $P(H_{AV}|E)$.

#### Business Administration:
\[
P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.02}{0.26} \approx 0.077
\]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[
P(H_{AV}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AV}) \cdot P(H_{AV})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.25 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.08}{0.305} \approx 0.262
\]

Thus, the computations are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.077,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.262
}
```

These probabilities are conditional and should logically shift relative to the priors and any new evidence provided.
