To calculate the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to evaluate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field. Here’s the breakdown:

**1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- **P(H)**: The probability that a random graduate student is studying agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume this is a relatively common but not overwhelmingly so specialization in the U.S. Therefore, \( P(H) \approx 0.05 \).
- **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy, it is highly likely that his personality fits well with this field. Therefore, \( P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood that Adam has this personality sketch given he is *not* in agricultural and veterinary science. With such specific interests, empathy, and puzzle-solving skills, these traits could be present but not as concentrated in other fields. Therefore, \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.1 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.05) + (0.1 \cdot 0.95) = 0.045 + 0.095 = 0.14 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.14} = \frac{0.045}{0.14} \approx 0.321 \]

**2. Business Administration:**
- **P(H)**: The probability that a random graduate student is studying business administration is relatively high. Let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.15 \).
- **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's personality sketch, it is less likely he is studying business administration because his interests and traits are more aligned with natural sciences than business. Therefore, \( P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that Adam has this personality and is not in business administration. Given that a large portion of graduate students are in fields other than business, we’ll estimate this similarly to previously, so \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(E) = ( 0.2 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) = 0.03 + 0.17 = 0.2 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{0.2} = \frac{0.03}{0.2} = 0.15 \]
