To determine the probability of Adam being enrolled in either business administration or agricultural and veterinary science based on his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch (which can be derived from combining the likelihoods and priors of all considered fields, but is not strictly necessary for comparing two specific fields here).

Let's make some educated guesses for these probabilities:

### Business Administration
**P(H):** The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration can be considered low, given his love and curiosity for nature and animals. Let's assume it is about 0.05 (5%).

**P(E|H):** The probability of Adam having the described personality if he were in business administration can be considered quite low, knowing that business administration might attract a different type of personality. Let's assume it is about 0.1 (10%).

**P(E|¬H):** This is trickier, as we need to consider a broad field of possibilities. Given that we have described Adam's personality and knowing that business administration is one of many fields, we can conservatively estimate this to be about 0.3 (30%).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
**P(H):** The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science can be considered high given his personality and interests. Let's assume it is about 0.2 (20%).

**P(E|H):** The probability of Adam having the described personality if he were in this field is quite high. Let's assume it is about 0.9 (90%).

**P(E|¬H):** Given that Adam’s personality highly suits this field compared to other possible fields, let's assume this could be relatively low among other remaining fields. Let's assume it is about 0.2 (20%).

Let’s plug these values into Bayes' rule.

### Business Administration
\[
P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{P(E|H)_{BA} \cdot P(H)_{BA}}{P(E)_{BA} + P(E)_{AVS} + \cdots}
\]
Since we're comparing only two fields, we'll leave \( P(E) \) generalized because the comparison informs the decision even without exact total normalization.

\[
P(H|E)_{BA} \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.05}{0.3} \approx \frac{0.005}{0.3} \approx 0.0167 \text{ (1.67%)}
\]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[
P(H|E)_{AVS} = \frac{P(E|H)_{AVS} \cdot P(H)_{AVS}}{P(E)_{BA} + P(E)_{AVS} + \cdots}
\]

\[
P(H|E)_{AVS} \approx \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.2}{0.2} = \frac{0.18}{0.2} = 0.9 \text{ (90%)}
\]

Putting these into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0167,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.9
}
```
This indicates that given Adam's personality sketch, it is highly likely that he is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science compared to Business Administration.
