To calculate the probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for each field given Adam's personality sketch, we can use Bayesâ€™ rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam having the given personality sketch if he is enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of Adam having the given personality sketch if he is not enrolled in a given field.

For the sake of this problem, let's make reasonable qualitative assessments for each parameter.

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- \(P(H)\): Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, and his love for animals, we can make an educated guess that this field would attract someone like Adam. Let's assign a relatively higher prior probability.
- \(P(E|H)\): Given that personality traits align very well with this field, it would be significantly high.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): Personality traits might also be present in people not involved in this field but could be less prevalent.

**Business Administration:**
- \(P(H)\): Given Adam's lack of interest in business-related subjects mentioned in the sketch, this prior probability should be lower.
- \(P(E|H)\): Personality traits don't perfectly align with common traits necessary for this field (e.g., interest in businesses, commerce), so this would be lower.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): Since business administration encompasses a broad range of personalities, the traits being described might still be somewhat common.

Let's use illustrative qualitative values, keeping in mind that these are reasonably subjective:
- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
  - \(P(H)\) = 0.3
  - \(P(E|H)\) = 0.7
  - \(P(E|\neg H)\) = 0.3

- For Business Administration:
  - \(P(H)\) = 0.1
  - \(P(E|H)\) = 0.2
  - \(P(E|\neg H)\) = 0.6

We finally calculate:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Here we don't have \(P(E)\), but it is common to leave it normalized by normalizing across given fields later if necessary.

So, the results would look like:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 
    "P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} = 0.21/P(E) approx.",
  "business administration": 
    "P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = 0.02/P(E) approx."
}
```

Therefore, wrapping them up:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.21",
  "business administration": "0.02"
}
```

Note: The values \( P(E) \) are kept unnormalized in step as it simplifies comparing relative probabilities, understanding full normalization across all possible hypotheses is required for raw \( P(H|E) \). The result indicates Adam is significantly more likely to belong to agricultural and veterinary sciences than to business administration given the provided personality sketch.
