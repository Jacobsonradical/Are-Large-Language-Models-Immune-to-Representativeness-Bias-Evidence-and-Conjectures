We'll use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the evidence \( E \). Bayes' Theorem is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

In the absence of specific numerical values, I'll make plausible estimates for \( P(H) \) (the prior probability of being in a given field), \( P(E|H) \) (the probability of observing the personality sketch given the field), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) (the probability of observing the personality sketch given not being in the field). Note that \( P(E) \) can be derived from the law of total probability.

Let's begin by estimating:
1. \( P(H) \): The prior probabilities of Adam enrolling in either Business Administration or Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the personality traits given enrollment in each respective field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the personality traits given not enrolling in each respective field.

We assume our hypothesis space is represented by the two fields mentioned, understanding this is an abstraction considering other fields he might be enrolled in.

### Business Administration
- \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): Let's assume the proportion of students in business administration is moderately high due to its popularity. We'll set this value at 0.2.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): Since there's nothing specific in Adam's personality sketch which directly aligns with typical business administration traits (e.g., interest in finance, entrepreneurship), the probability might be moderate. We'll set it at 0.3.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \): The likelihood of the evidence given that he is not in business administration might be higher, as his traits are quite general but lean more away from business-specific traits. We'll guess this at 0.6.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.6 \cdot 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.06 + 0.48 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.54 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.54} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.54} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \approx 0.1111 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \): Let's assume this field is less common among all graduate fields. We set this prior probability at 0.05.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \): His traits are very well-aligned with this field (curiosity about nature, love for animals). We'll set this high at 0.8.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \): The likelihood of the evidence given not being in agricultural and veterinary science might be lower since his traits align so well with this field. We'll set this at 0.5.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}})}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.5 \cdot 0.95 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.475 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.515 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.515} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.515} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) \approx 0.0777 \]

Therefore, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1111,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.0777
}
