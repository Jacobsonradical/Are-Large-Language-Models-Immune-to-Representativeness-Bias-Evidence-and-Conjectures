Bearing in mind that more information might be required for precise values, we are going to make an educated attempt to estimate the probability values based on the provided description.

1. **P(H) - The prior probability**: This is the initial probability of Adam being in each field without knowing his personality sketch.
2. **P(E|H) - The likelihood**: This is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is in the specified field.
3. **P(E|¬H) - The probability of the evidence given not H**: This is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is in any other field.

We will make assumptions for these probabilities to perform our calculations. Note, however, that due to limited information, the values will be subjective.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H_agricultural and veterinary science):** Let's assume within graduate fields, agricultural and veterinary science is a less common field. We might set this to 0.1.
2. **P(E|H_agricultural and veterinary science):** Adam's personality aligns very well with agricultural and veterinary science given his love for nature, animals, and strong understanding and appreciation for hard work. We might set this to 0.8.
3. **P(E|¬H_agricultural and veterinary science):** Given that Adam's traits seem quite unique and well-matched with agricultural and veterinary science, they might be less common across all other fields. We might set this to 0.2.

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where, 

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

\[ P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) \]

Let's calculate \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.1) + (0.2 \times 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.18 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.26 \]

So,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{(0.8 \times 0.1)}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \approx 0.3077 \]

### Business Administration

1. **P(H_business administration):** Let's assume business administration is a more common field among graduate students. We might set this to 0.2.
2. **P(E|H_business administration):** Adam's personality sketch does not seem to align well with business administration. We might set this to 0.2.
3. **P(E|¬H_business administration):** The same reasoning as above applies, and we keep this the same for consistency. We might set this to 0.2.

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

Let's calculate \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.2 \times 0.2) + (0.2 \times 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.16 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.20 \]

So,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{(0.2 \times 0.2)}{0.20} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.20} = 0.2 \]
