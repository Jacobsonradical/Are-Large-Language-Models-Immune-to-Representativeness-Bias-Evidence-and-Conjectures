Sure, let's go through each of the fields step-by-step:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (denote this as \(H_{AVS}\))**

   - **Prior Probability \(P(H_{AVS})\):** Agricultural and veterinary science is a specialized but fairly common field with numerous students, so let's assume a moderate prior probability. Suppose \(P(H_{AVS}) = 0.3\).

   - **Likelihood \(P(E|H_{AVS})\):** Given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals as well as his empathy, strong understanding, and appreciation for hard work, it is quite likely that he would fit well in this field. Suppose \(P(E|H_{AVS}) = 0.8\).

   - **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H_{AVS})\):** Without being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, it is still possible for Adam to possess these traits, but perhaps not as strongly as if he were enrolled in this field. Suppose \(P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) = 0.5\).

   - **Posterior Probability \(P(H_{AVS}|E)\):** Using Bayes' Rule:

     \[
     P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \times P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)} 
                 = \frac{0.8 \times 0.3}{P(E)}
     \]

     \(P(E)\) can be simplified as:

     \[
     P(E) = P(E|H_{AVS}) \times P(H_{AVS}) + P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \times P(\neg H_{AVS})
          = 0.8 \times 0.3 + 0.5 \times 0.7
          = 0.24 + 0.35
          = 0.59
     \]

     Therefore,

     \[
     P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.24}{0.59} \approx 0.41
     \]

2. **Business Administration (denote this as \(H_{BA}\))**

   - **Prior Probability \(P(H_{BA})\):** Business administration is a very common field with numerous students, so let's assume a relatively high prior probability. Suppose \(P(H_{BA}) = 0.4\).

   - **Likelihood \(P(E|H_{BA})\):** Given the personality sketch, it would seem less likely that Adamâ€™s interests and traits align strongly with business administration compared to agricultural and veterinary science. Suppose \(P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.2\).

   - **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H_{BA})\):** Without being enrolled in business administration, Adam's traits might not change much given how broad the reasons for non-business administration could be. Suppose \(P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.6\).

   - **Posterior Probability \(P(H_{BA}|E)\):**

     \[
     P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \times P(H_{BA})}{P(E)}
                 = \frac{0.2 \times 0.4}{P(E)}
     \]

     \(P(E)\) can be simplified as:

     \[
     P(E) = P(E|H_{BA}) \times P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \times P(\neg H_{BA})
          = 0.2 \times 0.4 + 0.6 \times 0.6
          = 0.08 + 0.36
          = 0.44
     \]

     Therefore,

     \[
     P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.44} \approx 0.18
     \]

  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.41,
  "business administration": 0.18
