Sure, let's go through the probabilities step by step for each field:

### Business Administration

- **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam is studying business administration.
  - Business administration is a common field of study, but given Adam's personality traits, it's not the most likely field. Let's assign a low prior probability, say 0.1.
  
- **P(E|H):** The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is studying business administration.
  - Adam's traits do not strongly align with typical characteristics you would expect from a business administration student. Given this, we'll assign a low probability, say 0.2.
  
- **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is not studying business administration.
  - Since there are other fields that align more closely with his traits, this probability is relatively moderate. Let's assign it 0.7.

Using these values, we can apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H)} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{(0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.7 \cdot 0.9)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.63} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.65} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.031 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam is studying agricultural and veterinary science.
  - This field is highly consistent with Adam's traits such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. Let's assign a high prior probability, say 0.3.
  
- **P(E|H):** The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is studying agricultural and veterinary science.
  - Adam’s traits strongly align with this field, so let's assign a high probability, say 0.8.
  
- **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is not studying agricultural and veterinary science.
  - Since there are fewer fields that align as closely with his traits, this probability is lower. Let's assign it 0.3.

Using these values, we can apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H)} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.3}{(0.8 \cdot 0.3) + (0.3 \cdot 0.7)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.24}{0.24 + 0.21} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.24}{0.45} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.533 \]

That gives us the final probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.031,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.533
}
