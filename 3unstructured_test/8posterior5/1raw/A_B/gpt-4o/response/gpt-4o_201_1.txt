Sure, let's break down the calculations. Here's how we can approach each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

   - \(P(H)\): The probability that any given graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume this is relatively low, given the multitude of fields available. We could estimate it around 0.05 (5%).
   
   - \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch if he were in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and understanding of hard work, this seems quite high. Let's estimate it at 0.9.
   
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch if he were not in agricultural and veterinary science. While some of these traits are common across other fields, they might be less strongly aligned with other fields on average. Let's estimate it at 0.2.
   
   - Using Bayes' Rule:
     \[
     P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
     \]
     Since \(P(E)\) is constant and we are comparing relative probabilities, we can ignore it for our estimation:
     \[
     P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.9 \cdot 0.05 = 0.045
     \]

2. **Business Administration:**

   - \(P(H)\): The probability that any given graduate student is in business administration. This is likely higher than agricultural and veterinary science due to the popularity of this field. Let's estimate it around 0.2 (20%).
   
   - \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch if he were in business administration. While he is intelligent and appreciates hard work, his traits like love for animals and nature curiosity are less typical. Let's estimate it at 0.1.
   
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch if he were not in business administration could be more aligned with other fields, especially those related to nature and animals. Let's estimate it at 0.3.
   
   - Using Bayes' Rule:
     \[
     P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02
     \]

Now, here are the posterior probabilities \(P(H|E)\) relative to each other:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.045,
  "business administration": 0.02
}
```
These values indicate that, given Adam's personality sketch, he is more likely to be in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration.
