Let's break down the information provided using Bayes' theorem:

**Bayes' Theorem**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll estimate \(P(H)\), \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E|\neg H)\) for each field, and then compute \(P(H|E)\).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

1. **P(H)**: Probability that a random graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Let's assume there's a moderate interest in this field among students, given the number of fields available.
   - Estimated P(H) = 0.1

2. **P(E|H)**: Probability of Adam having the personality sketch given he is in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals aligns closely with this field.
   - Estimated P(E|H) = 0.9

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability of Adam having the personality sketch given he is *not* in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - The elements of his personality (interest in nature, animals) may also be somewhat common in other fields, like biology or environmental science.
   - Estimated P(E|\neg H) = 0.2

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) = 0.09 + 0.18 = 0.27 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.27} = 0.333 \]

### Business Administration:

1. **P(H)**: Probability that a random graduate student is in business administration.
   - Given the popularity of this field, we'll assume it's more common.
   - Estimated P(H) = 0.2

2. **P(E|H)**: Probability of Adam having the personality sketch given he is in business administration.
   - Adam's personality sketch (interest in nature, empathy) is less typical for business administration.
   - Estimated P(E|H) = 0.05

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability of Adam having the personality sketch given he is *not* in business administration.
   - This is the same as the above, considering other possible fields.
   - Estimated P(E|\neg H) = 0.25

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.05 \cdot 0.2) + (0.25 \cdot 0.8) = 0.01 + 0.2 = 0.21 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.21} \approx 0.048 \]
