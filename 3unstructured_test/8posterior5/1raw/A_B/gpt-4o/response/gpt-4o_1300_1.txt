To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in each field given his personality sketch E, we will use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given Adam is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given Adam is not enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch (this could be decomposed further based on all possibilities, but we’ll just focus on the relative values).

Let’s estimate the probabilities:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): The probability that Adam was enrolled in a business administration program might be moderate given the general population of graduate students.
   - \( P(E|H) \): It seems less likely that a student in business administration would exhibit a deep love for animals, nature, and the specific traits highlighted in the personality sketch.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of someone not in business administration having this personality sketch would be higher, especially if they are in a field related to nature and animals.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): The probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science could be higher given his interest and love for nature, plants, and animals.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Much higher likelihood that someone in this field would match Adam's personality sketch.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Lower compared to \( P(E|H) \) since his traits align well with this field.

Now we compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using our estimates:

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \) (assuming a smaller proportion of graduate students are in business administration)
- \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \) (the traits are less typical for business administration students)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \) (traits more typical for non-business students but not entirely exclusive)

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \approx 0.1 \times 0.1 = 0.01 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \approx 0.05 \) (assuming a smaller but significant proportion of graduate students in agricultural and veterinary science)
- \( P(E|H) \approx 0.7 \) (traits very typical for this field)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.1 \) (traits not typical for non-agriculture/veterinary students)

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \approx 0.7 \times 0.05 = 0.035 \]

Finally, normalizing these to sum to 1 within the considered hypotheses:

\[ P(H|E \text{ for business administration}) = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.035} \approx 0.222 \]
\[ P(H|E \text{ for agricultural and veterinary science}) = \frac{0.035}{0.01 + 0.035} \approx 0.778 \]

Thus, our approximate results are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.222,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.778
}
