Here's how the values are derived:

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)** (Initial Probability of Business Administration):
   - Business Administration is a common field of study, but the personality traits described (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy) don’t strongly align with typical characteristics of this field.
   - I estimate P(H) = 0.05.

2. **P(E|H)** (Probability of Personality Sketch Given Business Administration):
   - The probability of someone in Business Administration having these traits seems relatively low given the nature-focused and empathetic descriptors.
   - I estimate P(E|H) = 0.1.

3. **P(E|\neg H)** (Probability of Personality Sketch Given Not Business Administration):
   - Given how specific Adam’s traits are, it’s more likely someone not in Business Administration fits this description.
   - I estimate P(E|\neg H) = 0.5.

4. Using Bayes' Rule:
   - P(H|E) = \(\frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))}\)
   - P(H|E) = \(\frac{0.1 \cdot 0.05}{0.1 \cdot 0.05 + 0.5 \cdot 0.95}\)
   - P(H|E) = \(\frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.475} \approx 0.01\)

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)** (Initial Probability of Agricultural and Veterinary Science):
   - Considering the specific personality traits, this field seems fitting and Adam’s traits fit well within this domain.
   - I estimate P(H) = 0.4.

2. **P(E|H)** (Probability of Personality Sketch Given Agricultural and Veterinary Science):
   - The traits align very well with the description of someone in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
   - I estimate P(E|H) = 0.9.

3. **P(E|\neg H)** (Probability of Personality Sketch Given Not Agricultural and Veterinary Science):
   - Given these traits, it’s less likely for someone not in this field to have this specific description.
   - I estimate P(E|\neg H) = 0.3.

4. Using Bayes' Rule:
   - P(H|E) = \(\frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))}\)
   - P(H|E) = \(\frac{0.9 \cdot 0.4}{0.9 \cdot 0.4 + 0.3 \cdot 0.6}\)
   - P(H|E) = \(\frac{0.36}{0.36 + 0.18} = \frac{0.36}{0.54} \approx 0.67\) (rounding slightly).

Combining this estimation process, we get the above values for the probabilities.
