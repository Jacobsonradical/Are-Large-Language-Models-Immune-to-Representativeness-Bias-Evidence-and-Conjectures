To calculate the probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch \( E \), we can use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We will assess the prior probability \( P(H) \) for each field and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Note that \( P(E) \) can be seen as a normalizing constant, so we'll focus on the relative values.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H):** Let's assume the prior probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is relatively low, say 0.05.
- **P(E|H):** Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work (all of which align well with agricultural and veterinary science), we can assign this a high value, like 0.8.
- **P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood he’d exhibit the same personality traits if he were not in agricultural and veterinary science might be lower, say 0.3.

Given these:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04 \]

### Business Administration

- **P(H):** The prior probability that any given graduate student is in business administration might be higher, say 0.15.
- **P(E|H):** Given the personality traits described, which don’t strongly align with business administration, we might assign this a lower value, like 0.2.
- **P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood he’d exhibit those traits outside of business administration may still be moderate, say 0.4.

Given these:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \cdot 0.15 = 0.03 \]

### Normalization

To find the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \), we need to normalize these values so they sum to 1 along with other potential fields that we are not considering here. For simplicity, assume these are the only two fields (this will sum to 1):

- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.04/(0.04 + 0.03) ≈ 0.571
- Business Administration: 0.03/(0.04 + 0.03) ≈ 0.429

Hence, the approximate posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.57,
  "business administration": 0.43
}
