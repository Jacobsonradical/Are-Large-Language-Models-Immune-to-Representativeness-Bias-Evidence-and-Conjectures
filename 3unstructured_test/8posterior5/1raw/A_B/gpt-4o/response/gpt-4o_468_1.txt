Given Adam's personality and interests, we can evaluate the probabilities accordingly.

### Business Administration
- **P(H):** The general probability of being a business administration student.
- **P(E|H):** Probability of displaying Adam's personality traits given he is in business administration.
- **P(E|¬H):** Probability of displaying those traits given he is not in business administration.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H):** The general probability of being an agricultural and veterinary science student.
- **P(E|H):** Probability of displaying Adam's personality traits given he is in agricultural and veterinary science.
- **P(E|¬H):** Probability of displaying those traits given he is not in agricultural and veterinary science.

Based on the personality sketch:

1. **Business Administration**
   - **P(H):** Let’s assume a moderate prior of 0.1 (as business administration is a common area of study for graduate students).
   - **P(E|H):** This is likely to be quite low, considering the personality traits (e.g., love for nature and animals, curiosity about plants) are less common in business students: 0.1.
   - **P(E|¬H):** This probability will be relatively higher as it includes all other fields, many of which can align better with Adam's interests. Let’s assume: 0.3.

   Applying Bayes' rule:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|¬H) \times P(¬H)} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.1}{0.1 \times 0.1 + 0.3 \times 0.9} = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.27} \approx 0.036
   \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - **P(H):** Let’s assume a moderate prior of 0.05 (as it is less common than business but still reasonable for the personality traits).
   - **P(E|H):** This is likely to be higher because Adam's traits align very well with this field: 0.8.
   - **P(E|¬H):** This probability will be lower as it excludes the field which aligns best with Adam’s personality. Let’s take: 0.2.

   Applying Bayes' rule:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|¬H) \times P(¬H)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.8 \times 0.05 + 0.2 \times 0.95} = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.19} \approx 0.174
   \]

Hence, the updated probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.036,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.174
}
```
