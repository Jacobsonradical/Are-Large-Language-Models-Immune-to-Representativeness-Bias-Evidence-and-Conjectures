To evaluate the probabilities and then use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probabilities \(P(H|E)\), let's go through the steps:

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**: The initial probability that Adam was enrolled in each field of study before considering his personality sketch.
2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given Adam was in a particular field.
3. **Marginal Likelihood \(P(E \mid \neg H)\)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam was not in that particular field.

Given these, we use Bayes' rule:
\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

Since \(P(E)\) (the overall probability of the personality sketch) is the same for both hypotheses and doesn't affect their relative values, we can compute the unnormalized posterior probabilities and then normalize them if necessary.

Let's consider the fields:

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
- **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**: Assume the prior probability that Adam chooses agricultural and veterinary science is moderate, say \(0.1\), as it's a relatively specialized field.
- **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: Given his love for animals, nature, and plants, this is very high, say \(0.8\).
- **Marginal Likelihood \(P(E \mid \neg H)\)**: For fields other than agricultural and veterinary science, this could still be notable but less likely, say \(0.3\).

\[P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08\]

**Business Administration**
- **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**: Assume the prior probability is slightly higher, say \(0.15\), as business administration is a common graduate field.
- **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: Given his personality, this is likely lower because his interests and skills don't directly align, say \(0.1\).
- **Marginal Likelihood \(P(E \mid \neg H)\)**: This would be somewhat higher here, as those in non-business fields may still have the traits, say \(0.4\).

\[P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.15 = 0.015\]

Normalization isn't strictly necessary for comparison but can be done:
Total Unnormalized: \(0.08 + 0.015 = 0.095\)

Normalized Probabilities:
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( \frac{0.08}{0.095} \approx 0.8421\)
- Business Administration: \( \frac{0.015}{0.095} \approx 0.1579\)

Thus, the approximate posterior probabilities are:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8421,
  "business administration": 0.1579
}
```

These probabilities suggest that, given the personality sketch, Adam is much more likely to have been enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science than in Business Administration.
