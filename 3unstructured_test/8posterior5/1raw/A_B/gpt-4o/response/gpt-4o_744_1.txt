To evaluate the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science (H1) or business administration (H2) based on the personality sketch (E), we need to compute P(H|E) using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, let's assume that P(H1) and P(H2) are the prior probabilities of enrolling in these fields, respectively. Without specific prior data, we'll use rough estimates. The values of P(H1) and P(H2) can be subjective but based on the given traits and general knowledge, we might make the following estimations:

- P(H1): Given Adam's strong love for nature, plants, and animals, it's reasonable to assume a higher prior for agricultural and veterinary science.
- P(H2): Business administration typically attracts individuals with different personality traits (e.g., leadership, interest in economics, and strategic thinking). Thus, it has a lower prior probability for Adam.

Let's assume the following estimations for subjective priors:
- P(H1): 0.3 (30%)
- P(H2): 0.05 (5%)

Next, we need to estimate P(E|H) and P(E|\neg H):
1. **P(E|H1)**: Since Adam's traits strongly align with agricultural and veterinary science, we can assign a high probability, e.g., 0.9.
2. **P(E|\neg H1)**: We can consider \(\neg H1\) as including a wider range of disciplines. Given the high alignment with agricultural and veterinary science, this might be lower, e.g., 0.2.

3. **P(E|H2)**: The probability that Adam's traits match business administration is low, perhaps 0.1.
4. **P(E|\neg H2)**: Given the amount of other fields available, the probability of these traits given not business administration might be higher, e.g., 0.4.

Finally, P(E) can be approximated through the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1) + P(E|\neg H1) \cdot P(\neg H1) \]

However, given we only want a relative measure and exact P(E) calculation is complex without additional context, we infer:

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2)}{P(E)} \]

Relative to each other under assumed P(E), results would be:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.9 * 0.3 / C = 0.27 / C
  "business administration": 0.1 * 0.05 / C = 0.005 / C
}

Where \( C \) is constant (P(E)).

Thus relative probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \(\approx 0.9\),
  "business administration": \(\approx 0.03\)
}

Therefore, in normalized form:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.27 / (0.27+0.005) ≈ 0.98,
  "business administration": 0.005 / (0.27 + 0.005) ≈ 0.02
}

Final output:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.98,
  "business administration": 0.02
}
