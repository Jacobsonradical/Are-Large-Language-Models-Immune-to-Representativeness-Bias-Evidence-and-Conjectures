To use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \), we need to evaluate the following quantities for each field of study: the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood of the evidence when the hypothesis is false \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Let's break it down for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is enrolled in this field. Let's assume that the prior probability is relatively low since this is a specialized field. We'll denote it as 0.1.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam's personality traits given that he is enrolled in this field. Given Adam's strong affinity to nature, animals, and appreciation for hard work in this field, we can assume a high likelihood, say 0.8.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam's personality traits given that he is not in this field. This encompasses all other fields and, considering the uniqueness of his traits towards this field, we can assign a lower probability, say 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)} {P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1} {0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08} {0.08 + 0.27} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08} {0.35} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.229 \]

2. **Business Administration**
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is enrolled in this field. Business administration is a more common field, so we'll denote it as 0.2.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam's personality traits given that he is enrolled in this field. Given that Adam's traits do not align strongly with the typical business administration persona, we assign a lower likelihood, say 0.2.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam's personality traits given that he is not in this field. Considering the vast number of other fields that may match his traits better, we'll assign this a higher value, say 0.4.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)} {P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2} {0.2 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04} {0.04 + 0.32} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04} {0.36} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.111 \]

So, the resultant posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.229,
  "business administration": 0.111
}
```
