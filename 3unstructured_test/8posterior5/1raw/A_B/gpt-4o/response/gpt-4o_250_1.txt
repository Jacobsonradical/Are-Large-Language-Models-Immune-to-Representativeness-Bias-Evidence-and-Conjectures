Let's break down the problem step-by-step using Bayes' Rule, which is defined as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the initial probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

First, let's itemize our known data points per program:
1. **Business Administration:**
   - \[ P(H_{BA}) \approx 0.1 \] (fraction of students generally in this graduate program)
   - \[ P(E|H_{BA}) \approx 0.2 \] (likelihood someone in this program fits Adam's description)
   - \[ P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \approx 0.01 \] (likelihood someone not in this program fits Adam's description)

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \[ P(H_{AVS}) \approx 0.05 \] (fraction of students generally in this graduate program)
   - \[ P(E|H_{AVS}) \approx 0.7 \] (likelihood someone in this program fits Adam's description)
   - \[ P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \approx 0.02 \] (likelihood someone not in this program fits Adam's description)

We need to compute \( P(E) \), the total probability of the evidence, which can be estimated as:

\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \cdot P(\neg H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \cdot P(\neg H_{AVS}) \]

\[ P(E) \approx (0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.7 \cdot 0.05) + (0.01 \cdot 0.9) + (0.02 \cdot 0.95) \]

\[ P(E) \approx 0.02 + 0.035 + 0.009 + 0.019 \]

\[ P(E) \approx 0.083 \]

Now, let's compute \( P(H|E) \):

**1. For Business Administration:**
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.083} \]

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx \frac{0.02}{0.083} \]

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx 0.241 \]

**2. For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{0.083} \]

\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \approx \frac{0.035}{0.083} \]

\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \approx 0.422 \]

Thus, the probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": 0.241,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.422
}
