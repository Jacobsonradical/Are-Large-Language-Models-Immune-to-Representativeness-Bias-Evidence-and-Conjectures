To compute the probabilities, we need to look at the components of Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given that \( H \) is false.

For simplicity, let's assign relative probabilities (guesses) to each term. We'll assume non-specific values because we are given no specific prior data; typically, these values would be determined through empirical data or strong knowledge of the domain.

1. **P(H)**: Given graduate fields in general, the prior probability can be assumed roughly equal among many fields due to lack of specific information.
2. **P(E|H)** & **P(E|\neg H)**: These will be higher if the nature fits with Adam's personality.

### Business Administration

1. **Prior \(P(H)\) for Business Administration**: 
   - Business Administration is a common graduate program, so let's assume \(P(H) \approx 0.1\).

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\) for Business Administration**: 
   - Business Administration is not particularly aligned with strong empathy, love for animals, or understanding of nature.
   - Thus, \(P(E|H) \approx 0.2\).

3. **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\) given not Business Administration**:
   - To calculate \(P(E|\neg H)\), notice that Adam's personality sketch strongly fits with fields related to animals and nature.
   - Assume \(P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4\) across all other fields.

Using the above, let’s compute:

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.4} = 0.05 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior \(P(H)\) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: 
   - Assuming equal prior among diverse fields, let's set \(P(H) \approx 0.1\).

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: 
   - Adam's interests strongly match this field (empathy, love for animals, nature).
   - Thus, \(P(E|H) \approx 0.9\).

3. **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)**:
   - Typical across other non-matching fields may remain \(P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4\).

Using the above, let’s compute:

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{0.4} = 0.225 \]

Thus, the approximate posterior probabilities, using the given format, are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.225
}
