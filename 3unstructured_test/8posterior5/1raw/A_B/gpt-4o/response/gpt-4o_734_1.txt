To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the data, we use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields (we're only comparing the probabilities within the given fields), we can work with the numerator for comparison purposes.

### Step-by-step computation:
1. **Estimate \( P(H) \):** The prior probability that Adam enrolled in each of these fields before considering the personality sketch \( E \).

2. **Estimate \( P(E|H) \):** The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam enrolled in these fields.

3. **Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \):** The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam did not enroll in these fields.

For simplicity, let's assume equal base rates of enrollment across different fields for Adam, denoted as \( P(H) \approx 0.01 \) (since there are so many graduate fields). This step is trivial, but real analysis may require more context-specific data.

**1. Business Administration:**
- **\( P(H) \)** is assumed to be 0.01.
- **\( P(E|H) \):** Adam's curiosity about nature and deep love for animals are not particularly aligned with business administration. Lower relevance means lower \( P(E|H) \), let's set this arbitrarily low.
  - Estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \)
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \):** The probability of having a personality sketch similar to Adam's in any other field. Given the specificity of traits, \( P(E|\neg H) \) seems higher compared to the specifics of business administration.
  - Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \) (very broad, almost any non-business field might fit better).

**2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- **\( P(H) \)** is assumed to be 0.01.
- **\( P(E|H) \):** Strong fit given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy.
  - Estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \)
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \):** Less certain in non-agricultural/vet fields, though not overwhelmingly rare.
  - Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \)

Given these estimates, let's compute \( P(H|E) \):

### Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.01}{P(E)} \approx 0.001/P(E) \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.01}{P(E)} \approx 0.009/P(E) \]

Even without computing \( P(E) \), it's clear \( P(H|E) \) is much higher for Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

Hence, the results are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.001 / P(E),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.009 / P(E)
}
```
For practical purposes, since we are comparing directly, ignore identical denominator \( P(E) \) and focus on relative scales:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.001,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.009
}
```
Adam is much more likely to be enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science considering the personality sketch provided.
