Let's break down the problem using Bayes' theorem. To compute \(P(H|E)\), we need to use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( H \) = Hypothesis (the field of study)
- \( E \) = Evidence (personality sketch of Adam)
- \( P(H) \) = Prior probability of the hypothesis
- \( P(E|H) \) = Probability of evidence given the hypothesis
- \( P(E) \) = Prior probability of evidence
- \( \neg H \) = Complement of the hypothesis
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) = Probability of evidence given the complement of the hypothesis

Let's evaluate each hypothesis one by one.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)**:
  - Let's assume, for simplicity, that P(H) is the prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This field is relatively less common than some others, so we might assign this a value like 0.05.

- **P(E|H)**:
  - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, has a deep love for animals, and a strong appreciation for hard workâ€”all traits that align well with this field. So, we'll assign this a high value, let's say 0.8.

- **P(E|\neg H)**:
  - Many of these traits can also be found in students of other fields, though perhaps to a lesser degree. We might assign this a lower value, like 0.2.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04 \]

### Business Administration

- **P(H)**:
  - Let's assume the prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in business administration. This field is quite common, so we might assign this a higher value, such as 0.2.

- **P(E|H)**:
  - Adam's traits do not strongly suggest a natural fit for business administration. His deep love for animals and nature, along with his quiet demeanor and puzzle-solving skills, do not necessarily align well with typical business administration traits. We'll assign this a lower value, let's say 0.1.

- **P(E|\neg H)**:
  - Again, these traits might be somewhat common in other fields, so we'll assign a moderate value like 0.3.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

### Normalization (Optional)

Since we are comparing the probabilities, we can normalize them if desired, but it is not needed for this problem as we are only comparing values within specific fields.

### Results

Here are the probabilities for each field after calculating \(P(H|E)\) proportionally:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.04,
  "business administration": 0.02
}
```

Thus, based on the personality sketch of Adam and the evaluated probabilities, it is more likely that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science rather than business administration.
