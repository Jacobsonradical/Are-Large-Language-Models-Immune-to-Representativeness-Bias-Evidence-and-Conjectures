To calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in business administration. Business programs are quite common, so let's assume a moderate prior probability.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is in business administration. Adam's traits (love for nature, animals, empathy, etc.) are not typical of business administration students, suggesting a low likelihood.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in business administration. Given the wide range of other fields, this can be somewhat higher.

Let's assume:
- \( P(H_{Business}) = 0.2 \) (moderate chance)
- \( P(E|H_{Business}) = 0.1 \) (low likelihood)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{Business}) = 0.4 \) (somewhat likely given other fields)

Now, Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H_{Business}|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]

Given \( P(E) \) (the overall likelihood of Adam's personality traits), the calculation simplifies proportionally compared to \( P(H_{Agriculture}|E) \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science. This is less common, so a lower prior.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch if he is in this field. Adam's traits highly align with agricultural/veterinary science, suggesting a high likelihood.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in agricultural and veterinary science.

Let's assume:
- \( P(H_{AgVet}) = 0.1 \) (low prior chance)
- \( P(E|H_{AgVet}) = 0.8 \) (very high likelihood)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{AgVet}) = 0.3 \) (lower, because his traits are quite specific)

Now, Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H_{AgVet}|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \]

Given \( P(E) \), the final calculation will use the same approach as above and be proportionally evaluated.

### Final Values

Given these evaluations:

\[ P(H_{Business}|E) \approx \frac{0.02}{P(E)} = 0.02 \times \text{constant} \]
\[ P(H_{AgVet}|E) \approx \frac{0.08}{P(E)} = 0.08 \times \text{constant} \]

Since both share the same denominator, the ratios directly compare as well. The proportional results are:
