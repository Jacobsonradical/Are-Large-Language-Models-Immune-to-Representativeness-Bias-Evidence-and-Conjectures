To calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Rule, we first need to evaluate the various probabilities. Bayes' Rule is given by:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

We will assume the following for simplicity:
- \( P(H) \) for both fields is assumed to be equal (as we don't have specific information about the overall distribution of graduate fields).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) represents the probability of evidence given that Adam is not in that field.
- Since \( P(E) \) is constant and can normalize the probabilities later, we will focus on comparing the relative likelihoods.

Here are the likelihood estimates:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1):**
   - \( P(H1) \): Let's assume this is moderately likely, say 0.2 given his traits.
   - \( P(E|H1) \): High, because of his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. Let's assume 0.8.
   - \( P(E|\neg H1) \): Lower, since these traits might not align as well with other disciplines. Let's give it 0.4.

2. **Business Administration (H2):**
   - \( P(H2) \): Let's assume this is equally moderately likely initially, say 0.2.
   - \( P(E|H2) \): Low, as business administration usually doesn't align directly with his interests in nature, animals, or puzzles. Assume 0.2.
   - \( P(E|\neg H2) \): Higher, considering the broad appeal of business studies, let's say 0.6. 

Let's find the likelihoods and then the posterior probabilities:

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[
P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)}
\]

For Business Administration:

\[
P(H2|E) = \frac{P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)}
\]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1) + P(E|\neg H1) \cdot P(\neg H1) = (0.8 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8) \).

\[
P(E) = 0.16 + 0.32 = 0.48
\]

Thus, for Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[
P(H1|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{0.48} = \frac{0.16}{0.48} \approx 0.333
\]

For Business Administration:

\[
P(H2|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.48} = \frac{0.04}{0.48} \approx 0.083
\]

So, our posterior probabilities look like this:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.333,
  "business administration": 0.083
}
