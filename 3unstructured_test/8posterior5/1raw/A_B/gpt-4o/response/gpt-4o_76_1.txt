To solve this problem, we'll need to compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given enrollment in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given enrollment in other fields.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the personality sketch.

First, let's make some educated assumptions regarding these probabilities for each field of study:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

#### Assumptions:
- \( P(H) \): Let’s assume 0.1 (10% probability of being enrolled in this field among all graduate fields).
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's traits, it's very likely he is in this field. Let's assume 0.8 (80%).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): There are many other fields with less alignment with his personality sketch. Let's assume 0.2 (20%).

### Business Administration

#### Assumptions:
- \( P(H) \): Let’s assume 0.2 (20% probability of being enrolled in this field among all graduate fields).
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's traits, it is less likely he is in this field. Let's assume 0.05 (5%).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Presence of similar traits across other fields. Let's assume 0.3 (30%).

### Calculate the Posterior Probability

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields and contributes to normalization only, it’s not computed explicitly but implied in proportional comparison of posterior probabilities. The calculation steps:

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H)P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \propto 0.08 \]

#### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H)P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \propto 0.01 \]

Now normalize these to get comparative values:
- Total \( P(E) \) implied: \( 0.08 + 0.01 = 0.09 \)

Normalized Posterior Probability:
- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( \frac{0.08}{0.09} \approx 0.89 \)
- For Business Administration: \( \frac{0.01}{0.09} \approx 0.11 \)

Therefore:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.89,
