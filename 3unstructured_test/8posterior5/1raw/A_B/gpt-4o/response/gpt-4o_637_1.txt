To apply Bayes' rule and calculate the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we will need to estimate the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihoods \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Let's break it down:

1. **Prior Probability (\( P(H) \)):**
   - \( P(\text{business administration}) \): Let's assume this field is quite popular and assume a higher prior compared to specialized fields like agricultural and veterinary science. We might set this to 0.25.
   - \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \): This field is less common but still significant, so we might set this prior at 0.1.

2. **Likelihoods (\( P(E|H) \)):**
   - \( P(E|\text{business administration}) \): Adam's personality sketch suggests he is more suited for fields related to nature, animals, and abstract problem-solving. Business administration, while requiring intelligence, might not typically align well with his interests. Let's assign a likelihood of 0.1.
   - \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \): This field aligns well with Adam's love for nature, animals, and appreciation for dedication and hard work. Let's assign a high likelihood of 0.9.

3. **Likelihoods (\( P(E|\neg H) \)):**
   - This is the probability of observing Adam's traits without assuming each hypothesis. We will assume that the personality sketch is generally more common in less specific fields. For simplicity, let's assume \( P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) \) as 0.5 and \( P(E|\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \) as 0.3.

Using these values, we can apply Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant to ensure probabilities sum up correctly here. Since we do not need the total to add up to 1, we will avoid computing \( P(E) \) and directly compare the relative values, recognizing they need to be normalized later.

So,

For **business administration**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.25 = 0.025 \]

For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.09 \]

Let's present these as relative values:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.025,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.09
}
```
