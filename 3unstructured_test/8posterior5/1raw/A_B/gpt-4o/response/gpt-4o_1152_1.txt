To compute the probabilities for Adam being enrolled in either business administration or agricultural and veterinary science, we will follow Bayesian probability using the provided personality sketch \( E \).

### Definitions:
- \( H_{BA} \): Hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( H_{AVS} \): Hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( E \): Evidence, i.e., the personality sketch of Adam.

### Probabilities:
- \( P(H_{BA}) \): Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(H_{AVS}) \): Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): Probability of observing the evidence given that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \): Probability of observing the evidence given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \): Probability of observing the evidence given that Adam was not enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \): Probability of observing the evidence given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(H_{BA}|E) \): Posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given the evidence.
- \( P(H_{AVS}|E) \): Posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given the evidence.

### Assumptions:
For simplicity, we'll assign \( P(H_{BA}) \) and \( P(H_{AVS}) \) equal initial prior probabilities, while also considering the connection between the evidence and the fields based on the personality sketch:

- \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.1 \) (assuming lower fit based on Adamâ€™s personality and interests)
- \( P(H_{AVS}) = 0.5 \) (assuming higher fit given his love for nature and animals)

We'll consider:

- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \approx 0.1 \) (Adam's personality seems less suited for a business administration program)
- \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \approx 0.9 \) (Adam's personality highly aligns with agricultural and veterinary science)

### Complementary Evidence Probabilities:
- \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) = 0.1 \)

### Bayes' Rule:
Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

The total probability of evidence \( E \) is given by:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \cdot P(\neg H_{BA}) \]
\[ P(E) \approx (0.1 \times 0.1) + (0.5 \times 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.01 + 0.45 = 0.46 \]

Next, compute \( P(H_{BA}|E) \):
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.1}{0.46} = \frac{0.01}{0.46} \approx 0.0217 \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) + P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \cdot P(\neg H_{AVS}) \]
\[ P(E) \approx (0.9 \times 0.5) + (0.1 \times 0.5) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.45 + 0.05 = 0.50 \]

Next, compute \( P(H_{AVS}|E) \):
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.5}{0.50} = 0.9 \]

Thus:

{
  "business administration": "0.0217",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.9"
}
