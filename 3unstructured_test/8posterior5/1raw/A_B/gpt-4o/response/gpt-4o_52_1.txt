To calculate the probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields based on the personality sketch, we'll use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to estimate the following probabilities:
1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.

Since we are not provided exact values, I'll make reasonable assumptions to estimate these probabilities:

### Business Administration:
1. **P(H)**: The probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
   - Assume there’s a moderate probability since business administration is a common field, say \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam having this personality sketch if he were a business administration student.
   - Given that business administration students are generally more social and less likely to have a deep love for animals and nature, assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of Adam having this personality sketch if he were not a business administration student.
   - Assume it’s higher because his traits align more with other fields, say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
1. **P(H)**: The probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Given his traits, there’s a strong alignment with this field, so assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam having this personality sketch if he were an agricultural and veterinary science student.
   - Very high since his traits match perfectly, \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of Adam having this personality sketch if he were not in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Lower because the detailed appreciation for nature and animals fits less with other fields, assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Now we can calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

### Calculations:
Let’s denote these probabilities for simplicity:
- Business Administration: \( P(E|H_{BA}), P(H_{BA}), P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \)
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( P(E|H_{AV}), P(H_{AV}), P(E|\neg H_{AV}) \)

For Business Administration:
\[ 
P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8} 
\]
\[ 
P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.24} 
\]
\[ 
P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.02}{0.26} 
\]
\[ 
P(H|E)_{BA} \approx 0.077 
\]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ 
P(H|E)_{AV} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{0.9 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9} 
\]
\[ 
P(H|E)_{AV} = \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.27} 
\]
\[ 
P(H|E)_{AV} = \frac{0.09}{0.36} 
\]
\[ 
P(H|E)_{AV} = 0.25 
\]

Thus, the computed probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.077,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.25
}
```
