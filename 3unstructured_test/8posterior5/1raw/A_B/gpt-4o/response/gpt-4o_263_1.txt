To compute the probabilities, we need to use Bayes' Theorem, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For each field, we'll first make an educated guess about \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Based on Adam's personality sketch, we'll then compute \( P(H|E) \).

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given his love for nature and animals, we can assume this field is a plausible choice but not overwhelmingly dominant. Let's assume a moderate prior probability, perhaps around 0.2.

2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is enrolled in this field. Given his traits, especially his love for animals and nature, this would be high. Let's assume 0.8.

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is not enrolled in this field. Since there are many fields that do not align as closely with his traits, this would be somewhat lower, perhaps around 0.3.

**Business Administration:**

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration. Considering his personality sketch, this field seems less aligned with his traits such as empathy, love for nature, etc. So, we assume a lower prior probability, perhaps around 0.05.

2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is enrolled in this field. These traits do not strongly align with the typical requirements and inclinations of Business Administration fields. Let's assume 0.1.

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is not enrolled in this field. This would be relatively higher than \( P(E|H) \), perhaps around 0.4.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.16}{P(E)} \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{P(E)} \]

To finally arrive at an answer, we note that we don't have the exact value of \( P(E) \). However, for comparative purposes, we can directly compare \( 0.16 \) and \( 0.005 \), noting that \( P(H|E) \) will be proportionally higher for Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

Thus, the comparative likelihoods are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.16,
  "business administration": 0.005
}
