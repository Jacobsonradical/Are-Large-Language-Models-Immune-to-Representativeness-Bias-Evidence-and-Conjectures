Sure, let's break down the necessary components to compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll need to compute this for each field:

### Business Administration

1. **\( P(H_{BA}) \)**: The prior probability that a random graduate student is in business administration. Let's assume this is \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.1 \) as a nominal value, acknowledging it's a common field.
2. **\( P(E|H_{BA}) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in business administration. Given his interests and personality traits, this would likely be relatively low, say \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.05 \).
3. **\( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not in business administration. Because many other fields might better match his personality, this could be somewhat higher, say \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.15 \) (this is necessarily more intuitive, assuming other fields cover broader matches).

We need to find \( P(E) \).
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \cdot P(\neg H_{BA}) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.05 \cdot 0.1) + (0.15 \cdot 0.9) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.005 + 0.135 = 0.14 \]

So,

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{0.14} \]

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx 0.0357 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **\( P(H_{AV}) \)**: The prior probability that a random graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume this is \( P(H_{AV}) = 0.05 \), acknowledging it's a less common field overall.
2. **\( P(E|H_{AV}) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his interests and personality traits, this would likely be quite high, say \( P(E|H_{AV}) = 0.7 \).
3. **\( P(E|\neg H_{AV}) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Since the traits are strong matches with this field and less so with others, this should indeed be lower, let's say \( P(E|\neg H_{AV}) = 0.1 \).

We apply the same calculation for \( P(E) \).

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{AV}) \cdot P(H_{AV}) + P(E|\neg H_{AV}) \cdot P(\neg H_{AV}) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.05) + (0.1 \cdot 0.95) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.035 + 0.095 = 0.13 \]

So,

\[ P(H_{AV}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AV}) \cdot P(H_{AV})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_{AV}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{0.13} \]

\[ P(H_{AV}|E) \approx 0.2692 \]

Here is the final answer formatted as requested:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0357,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.2692
}
```

These values represent the conditional probabilities of Adam being enrolled in the respective fields given the personality sketch.
