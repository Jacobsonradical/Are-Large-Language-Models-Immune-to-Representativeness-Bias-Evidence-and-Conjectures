To apply Bayes' rule to compute P(H|E) for each hypothesis, we need to assess the prior probability of each hypothesis P(H), the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given each field P(E|H), and the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given he is not in that field P(E|¬H).

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Prior Probability P(H)**: This is the general likelihood that a randomly chosen graduate student is in a given field. 

2. **Likelihood P(E|H)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's personality traits given he is enrolled in a specific field. 

3. **Likelihood P(E|¬H)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's personality traits given he is not enrolled in that specific field. 

Let's assume the priors P(H) reflect the enrollment proportions in graduate programs. For simplicity, we will use estimated values.

We'll start by approximating:

- The proportion of students in agricultural and veterinary science ≈ 0.05 (P(H))
- The proportion of students in business administration ≈ 0.15 (P(H))

Now considering Adam's personality traits and the fields:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1):
- P(H1) ≈ 0.05
- P(E|H1): Adam's traits (love for animals, nature, empathy) align strongly with this field, so let's estimate this as 0.9
- P(E|¬H1): The traits are not exclusive to this field but much less likely outside it compared to how they align with other fields. We can estimate this value as 0.5

### Business Administration (H2):
- P(H2) ≈ 0.15
- P(E|H2): Business administration does not strongly align with Adam's traits, so let's estimate this as 0.1
- P(E|¬H2): Given that business administration is diverse and has people with varied interests, we can still assume the likelihood to be quite similar to the general population, let's estimate it as 0.4

Now, we can apply Bayes' Rule to find P(H|E):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Where P(¬H) = 1 - P(H).

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:

\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{(0.9 \cdot 0.05) + (0.5 \cdot (1 - 0.05))} = \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.475} = \frac{0.045}{0.52} \approx 0.087 \]

2. **Business Administration**:

\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{(0.1 \cdot 0.15) + (0.4 \cdot (1 - 0.15))} = \frac{0.015}{0.015 + 0.34} = \frac{0.015}{0.355} \approx 0.042 \]

Thus, in JSON format:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.087,
  "business administration": 0.042
}
```

These values reflect that given Adam's personality sketch, it's more likely he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration, though the probabilities do not sum to 1 since there are other possible fields of study.
