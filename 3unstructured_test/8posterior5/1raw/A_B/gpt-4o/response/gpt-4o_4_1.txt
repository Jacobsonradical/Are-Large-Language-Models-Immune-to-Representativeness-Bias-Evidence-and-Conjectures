Given Adam's personality sketch, let's assess the likelihoods for each field and then use Bayes' rule to calculate the posterior probabilities.

Assumptions:
- \( P(H) \) represents the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the specified field.
- \( P(E|H) \) represents the probability of observing the evidence given that hypothesis H is true.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) represents the probability of observing the evidence given that hypothesis H is false.
- \( P(E) \) represents the total probability of observing the evidence.

The form of Bayes' rule we will use:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, let's assume prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for both fields are equal and realistic values. Also, the probabilities of evidence given each hypothesis are based on how well Adam's personality matches each field.

**P(H):**
- Let \( P(H) = 0.05 \) for each hypothesis as we have many possible graduate fields Adam could be in.

**P(E|H):**
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy strongly align with this field.
  - Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
  
- **Business Administration:** The given traits do not strongly suggest a match with business administration.
  - Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).

**P(E|\neg H):**
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Given the general distribution of traits in the larger population of graduate students, the traits might be less common.
  - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).
  
- **Business Administration:** The traits might be less indicative of Business Administration.
  - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

Using these assumptions:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)}
   \]

2. **Business Administration:**
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)}
   \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both hypotheses and only serves to normalize the probabilities, we don't need its exact value here. Instead, we can compare the numerators directly for relative probabilities.

Thus, we have:
\[
P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04
\]
\[
P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.05 = 0.01
\]

Normalizing these:
\[
\text{Total} = 0.04 + 0.01 = 0.05
\]

Now, compute the normalized probabilities:
\[
P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} = \frac{0.04}{0.05} = 0.8
\]
\[
P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} = \frac{0.01}{0.05} = 0.2
\]

So the final probabilities are:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```
