Let's follow the steps you outlined to calculate \( P(H|E) \) for both fields using Bayes' rule. For both hypotheses \( H_{\text{BA}} \) and \( H_{\text{AVS}} \):

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the specific field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch given Adam is enrolled in that specific field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch given Adam is not enrolled in that specific field.

Let's assume \( P(H_{\text{BA}})\) and \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \) are each \(0.1\) (10% chance for simplification, although these values can vary in realistic scenarios).

Now to judge \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \):

### Business Administration
- **P(H_{\text{BA}})** \( = 0.1\)
- **P(E|H_{\text{BA}})**: Adam's interests and traits such as a love for nature, animals, empathy, and quiet demeanor aren't strongly correlated with Business Administration, which tends to favor a more outgoing and assertive personality. Hence, this is quite low. Let's assign it a value of \(0.01\).
- **P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}})**: Given the diverse range of other fields, it is more probable to find Adam's personality traits in fields other than Business Administration. Let's assign \(0.5\).

By Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \]
Since \( P(E) \) is common for both fields and will cancel out in the comparative ranking, we'll focus on the numerator for now:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.01 \times 0.1 = 0.001 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H_{\text{AVS}})** \( = 0.1 \)
- **P(E|H_{\text{AVS}})**: Adam's traits align well with this field, given his love for nature, animals, and empathy. Let's assign it a high value of \(0.8\).
- **P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}})**: Given that there are many other fields that do not particularly match Adam's traits as closely as AVS, let's assign \(0.3\).

By Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}})}{P(E)} \]
Again, focusing on the numerator:
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \]

### Normalization
To convert these proportional values to probabilities, we normalize them by dividing by the total sum:

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \text{ proportion} = 0.001 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) \text{ proportion} = 0.08 \]

Sum of proportions = \( 0.001 + 0.08 = 0.081 \)

So the normalized probabilities are:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.001}{0.081} \approx 0.0123 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.081} \approx 0.9877 \]

Therefore, the answers are:

{
  "business administration": 0.0123,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.9877
}
