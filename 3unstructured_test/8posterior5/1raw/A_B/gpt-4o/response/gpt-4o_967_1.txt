To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need the following probabilities for both agricultural and veterinary science (denoted as H1) and business administration (denoted as H2):

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability that we would observe personality sketch E, given that Adam is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability that we would observe personality sketch E, given that Adam is not enrolled in the field.

Given the personality sketch, I'm going to make qualitative assessments for probabilities, but bear in mind that without additional data, these are subjective estimates. Let's define these probabilities:

1. For agricultural and veterinary science (H1):
   - \( P(H1) \): Let's assume this is a more specialized field, and relatively fewer students choose it compared to something like business administration. I might estimate \( P(H1) = 0.10 \).
   - \( P(E|H1) \): Given Adam’s personality sketch (curious about nature/plants, strong empathy, love for animals), it's highly consistent with someone in agricultural and veterinary science. So, \( P(E|H1) = 0.90 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H1) \): This is the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science, which might be quite low since the specific interests and traits are less aligned with many other fields. I might estimate \( P(E|\neg H1) = 0.20 \).

2. For business administration (H2):
   - \( P(H2) \): Business administration is a very popular field, so let's assume \( P(H2) = 0.15 \).
   - \( P(E|H2) \): Given Adam’s personality sketch, it doesn’t closely align with business administration (which might attract more extroverted, profit-driven personalities). So, \( P(E|H2) = 0.10 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H2) \): This would generally represent anyone not in business admin, which might be more compatible with the personality sketch, but not overwhelmingly so. Let's say \( P(E|\neg H2) = 0.25 \).

Now let's use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \).

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1)P(H1)}{P(E|H1)P(H1) + P(E|\neg H1)P(\neg H1)} \]
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.90 \times 0.10}{0.90 \times 0.10 + 0.20 \times 0.90} \]
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.18} = \frac{0.09}{0.27} \approx 0.33 \]

### For Business Administration:
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{P(E|H2)P(H2)}{P(E|H2)P(H2) + P(E|\neg H2)P(\neg H2)} \]
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.10 \times 0.15}{0.10 \times 0.15 + 0.25 \times 0.85} \]
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.015}{0.015 + 0.2125} = \frac{0.015}{0.2275} \approx 0.066 \]

Thus, the values are:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.33,
  "business administration": 0.066
}
