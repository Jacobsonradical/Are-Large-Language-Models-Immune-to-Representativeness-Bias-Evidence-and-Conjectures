Let's use Bayes' Rule to compute \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis \( H \). Bayes' Rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

First, we need to estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field:

1. **Assumptions for business administration:**
   - \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \): Prior probability that a graduate student is in business administration. Let's assume a moderate prior of 0.20 (as business is a common field, but not the most common).
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \): Probability that a person with Adam's personality traits is enrolled in business administration. Given that Adam has strong empathy and appreciation for hard work (traits useful in business), but his curiosity about nature and deep love for animals seem less relevant, we could estimate this to be low, around 0.10.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business administration}}) \): Probability of the same personality traits given that Adam is in another field. Given that nature curiosity and love for animals applies more directly to agricultural and veterinary sciences, it's higher. Let's estimate this around 0.60, reflecting how these traits are more common in non-business fields.

2. **Assumptions for agricultural and veterinary science:**
   - \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): Prior probability that a graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume a lower, but reasonable, prior of 0.05 (as it's less common than business, but still significant).
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): Probability that a person with Adam's traits is in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, and empathy, we estimate this high, around 0.70.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): Probability of the same personality traits given that Adam is in another field. This would be lower, given that these traits are more specific to agricultural and veterinary sciences. Let's estimate this around 0.20.

Let's apply these estimates in Bayes' Rule:

1. **Business administration:**
   \[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}})}{P(E)} \]
   \[ P(E) \text{ (marginal probability of E)} = P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{business administration}}) \]
   \[ P(E) = (0.10 \cdot 0.20) + (0.60 \cdot 0.80) = 0.02 + 0.48 = 0.50 \]

   Then,
   \[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{0.10 \cdot 0.20}{0.50} = 0.04 \]

2. **Agricultural and veterinary science:**
   \[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})}{P(E)} \]
   \[ P(E) = (0.70 \cdot 0.05) + (0.20 \cdot 0.95) = 0.035 + 0.19 = 0.225 \]

   Then,
   \[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{0.70 \cdot 0.05}{0.225} \approx 0.155 \]

So, the answers are:

{
  "business administration": 0.04,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.155
}
