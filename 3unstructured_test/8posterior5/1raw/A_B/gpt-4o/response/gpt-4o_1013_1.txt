Sure, let's break down the probabilities using the information provided in the personality sketch of Adam:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
#### 1. Calculate the Prior Probability \( P(H) \):
This represents the likelihood that a random graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume a rough prior estimate:
\[ P(H_{\text{agriculture}}) = 0.05 \]

#### 2. Calculate the Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):
Given that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science, how consistent is his personality with this field? His love for animals, curiosity about nature, and empathy are all highly consistent with this field.
\[ P(E|H_{\text{agriculture}}) = 0.8 \]

#### 3. Calculate the Likelihood of the Evidence given not H \( P(E|\neg H) \):
Given that Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science, how likely is it that someone with his description might exist in any other field?
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{agriculture}}) = 0.2 \]

### Business Administration
#### 1. Calculate the Prior Probability \( P(H) \):
This represents the likelihood that a random graduate student is enrolled in business administration. Let's assume a rough prior estimate:
\[ P(H_{\text{business}}) = 0.2 \]

#### 2. Calculate the Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):
Given that Adam is in business administration, how consistent is his personality with this field? While high intelligence and appreciation for hard work can fit many fields, business administration typically emphasizes different traits.
\[ P(E|H_{\text{business}}) = 0.1 \]

#### 3. Calculate the Likelihood of the Evidence given not H \( P(E|\neg H) \):
Given that Adam is not in business administration, how likely is it that someone with his description might exist in any other field?
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}}) = 0.7 \]

### Applying Bayes' Theorem
Bayes' theorem calculates the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using the formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For both fields, we'll use a simplified version for relative comparison since absolute values for \( P(E) \) are complex to compute here:

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E_{\text{agriculture}}) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agriculture}}) \times P(H_{\text{agriculture}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{P(E)} \]

#### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E_{\text{business}}) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \times P(H_{\text{business}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]

While \( P(E) \) is the same for both calculations and normalizes the probabilities, we can use the product \( P(E|H)P(H) \) to judge the stronger candidate without normalization.

### Results
Given the calculations:
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{P(E)} \approx 0.04 \),
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \approx 0.02 \)
}

Which means, relatively:
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.04,
  "business administration": 0.02
}

Adam is more likely to be in the field of agricultural and veterinary science based on his personality sketch.
