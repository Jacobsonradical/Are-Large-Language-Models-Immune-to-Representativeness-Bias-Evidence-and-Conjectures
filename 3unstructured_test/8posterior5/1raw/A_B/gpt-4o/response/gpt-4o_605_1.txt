To compute \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we first need to consider the following:

- \(P(H)\): Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
- \(P(E|H)\): Probability of the evidence (personality sketch) given that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): Probability of the evidence given that Adam was not enrolled in that particular field.

Bayes' rule is:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \(P(E)\) can be expanded using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Given that we do not have exact values, we shall approximate the values based on the given information.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume a mid-range probability, say 0.1 (assuming there are various fields and agricultural/vet sciences form about 10% of possibility).
- **P(E|H):** The probability that Adam's personality sketch fits agricultural and veterinary science. Given his strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, this seems high. Let's assume 0.8 (since these traits strongly fit this field).
- **P(E|\neg H):** The probability that Adam has this personality sketch if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Given that his traits are quite specific to this field, let's assume this probability is relatively low, say 0.2.

So, for **agricultural and veterinary science**:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
= \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.8 \times 0.1 + 0.2 \times 0.9}
= \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.18}
= \frac{0.08}{0.26} \approx 0.3077
\]

### Business Administration
- **P(H):** Prior probability Adam was enrolled in business administration. Assuming business administration also forms about 10% possibility, let's assume this as 0.1.
- **P(E|H):** Probability of the personality sketch given business administration. Given Adam's traits, this is likely low, as business administration typically doesn't align strongly with love for animals or nature. Let's assume 0.2.
- **P(E|\neg H):** Probability of the personality sketch given not business administration. This would be slightly higher than the above as itâ€™s about fitting non-specific fields. We might assume around 0.4.

So, for **business administration**:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
= \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{0.2 \times 0.1 + 0.4 \times 0.9}
= \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.36}
= \frac{0.02}{0.38} \approx 0.0526
\]

Hence, our probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3077,
  "business administration": 0.0526
}
