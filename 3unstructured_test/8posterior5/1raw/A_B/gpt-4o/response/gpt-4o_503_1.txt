To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) — the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field based on the personality sketch \( E \) — we'll use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the following fields:
1. Business Administration
2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

Let's consider each hypothesis \( H \):

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: Business Administration is a common field, so let's assume \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.2 \).
2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam’s personality traits do not strongly match the typical traits of students in Business Administration, so let's assume \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.1 \).
3. **Complementary Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Based on how common these traits are in graduate programs other than Business Administration, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.4 \).

Using these values in Bayes’ rule:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.4} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.4} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = 0.05 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: Agricultural and Veterinary Sciences are less common fields but align with Adam's interests, so let's assign \( P(H_{AVS}) = 0.1 \).
2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam’s personality traits closely match this field, so let’s assign \( P(E|H_{AVS}) = 0.8 \).
3. **Complementary Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Given the fields other than Agricultural and Veterinary Science, the likelihood of Adam's traits is lower, let's use \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) = 0.3 \).

Using these values in Bayes’ rule:

\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.3} \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.3} \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = 0.267 \]

Therefore, the posterior probabilities for each field are:

{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.267
}

Note that these values are not normalized to sum to 1 because there are other possible fields Adam could be enrolled in. However, this approach provides a comparative likelihood based on the given traits and assumptions.
