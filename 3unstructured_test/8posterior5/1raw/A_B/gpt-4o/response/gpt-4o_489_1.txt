To determine \( P(H|E) \) (the probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field, given his personality sketch), we need to first estimate the relevant probabilities:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he was not enrolled in that field.

Given Adam's personality sketch, intuitively:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's estimate this as 0.05 (a rough estimate considering the diversity of fields).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's personality sketch fits well with someone in this field (love for nature, animals, high intelligence, and empathy). Let's estimate this as 0.8.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of having such a personality sketch in other fields. Let's estimate this as 0.2 because such traits can be somewhat common, but their combination is still distinctive for agricultural and veterinary science.

2. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a graduate student is in business administration. Let's estimate this as 0.15 (more common compared to agricultural and veterinary science).
   - \( P(E|H) \): His personality and interests do not align strongly with typical traits seen in business administration. Let's estimate this as 0.1.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of having such a personality sketch in other fields. Let's estimate this as 0.2.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.05) + (0.2 \times 0.95) = 0.04 + 0.19 = 0.23 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.23} \approx 0.174 \]

For **Business Administration**:
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.015 + 0.17 = 0.185 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.15}{0.185} \approx 0.081 \]

Thus, the values are:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.174,
  "business administration": 0.081
}
