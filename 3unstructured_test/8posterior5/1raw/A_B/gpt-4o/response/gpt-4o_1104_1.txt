To determine \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Rule, we need to analyze the probabilities involved. Here’s the general formula for Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (Adam being enrolled in a particular field).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence (can be derived from \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \)).

Given that Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, a deep love for animals, and a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work, these characteristics are highly indicative of someone in the agricultural and veterinary sciences. His personality traits are less aligned with business administration. 

Let’s estimate each probability:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **\( P(H) \)**: This is the prior probability of any given graduate student being in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume a baseline probability that might be slightly lower than others, say, 0.05 (assuming around 5% of graduate students are in this field).
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: The probability that Adam exhibits these traits given he is in agricultural and veterinary science is high. Let’s estimate this at 0.9.
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability that Adam exhibits these traits given he is not in this field would be lower, as these traits are quite specific. Let’s estimate this at 0.2.

### Business Administration
- **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability of any graduate student being in business administration. Let’s assume a baseline probability, which might be higher, say, 0.15 (assuming around 15% of graduate students are in this field).
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: The probability that Adam exhibits these traits given he is in business administration is lower. Let’s estimate this at 0.1.
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability that Adam exhibits these traits given he is not in this field. Let’s estimate this at 0.3.

### Computations
To compute \( P(H|E) \), we need \( P(E) \), which is:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(E) = 0.9 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.95 = 0.045 + 0.19 = 0.235 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.235} \approx 0.1915 \]

For business administration:
\[ P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.15 + 0.3 \cdot 0.85 = 0.015 + 0.255 = 0.27 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{0.27} \approx 0.0556 \]

Therefore, the results are:
