To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field (business administration and agricultural and veterinary science), we need to apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the respective field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in the respective field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the respective field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch occurring.

Given that \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in the respective field, and using the approximately intuitive judgments for these probabilities, we can derive the posterior probabilities.

For simplicity, let's assume the following plausible values based on the personality sketch:

1. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H) \): While it's not extremely unlikely, it's less probable compared to fields more closely associated with his curiosity about nature and animals. Let's assume a moderate prior probability, say \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Assuming business administration students typically do not align strongly with a deep love for animals and nature, this likelihood might be lower. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given that most other fields might have a similar likelihood, letâ€™s assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): Given Adam's strong interest in nature and animals, this seems quite probable. Let's assume a higher prior probability, say \( P(H) = 0.4 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): His personality strongly aligns with traits usually found in this field, so a high likelihood is plausible. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The complement would account for all other fields, potentially lowering this likelihood. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Now, compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

1. **Business Administration:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.4}{P(E)} \]

To ensure our results sum correctly, we'll assume \( P(E) \) based on a weighted average of these probabilities. 

Given these, and recognizing the calculation simplicity:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H)*P(H) + P(E|\neg H)*(1-P(H)) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.1*0.2 + 0.5*0.8 + 0.8*0.4 + 0.3*0.6 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.4 + 0.32 + 0.18 \approx 0.72 \]

Now re-calculate posterior probabilities:

1. **Business Administration:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.72} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.72} \approx 0.028 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.4}{0.72} \approx \frac{0.32}{0.72} \approx 0.444 \]

Thus, the computed probabilities are:

  "business administration": 0.028,
