To approach this problem using Bayes' rule, we need to judge the probabilities:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field denoted by \( H \).
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in the field \( H \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in the field \( H \).

We will compute \( P(H|E) \), the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field \( H \) given the evidence \( E \), using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **Prior \( P(H) \)**:
   - Without specific statistics, let’s assume a modest prior that Adam could belong to a variety of fields. Let's set this somewhat higher given Adam's interests.
   - \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.2 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Given Adam’s genuine interest in nature, plants, animals, and his empathy, this field is highly relevant.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.8 \)

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - Reflects the probability of Adam having these characteristics if he weren't in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.2 \)

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.16}{P(E)} \]

### Business Administration
1. **Prior \( P(H) \)**:
   - A lower prior as Adam’s interests don’t strongly align with typical business administration characteristics.
   - \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.1 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Business administration does not strongly align with Adam’s characteristics.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.1 \)

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - Reflects the probability of Adam having these characteristics if he weren’t in business administration.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.3 \)

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.01}{P(E)} \]

To summarize calculations without the denominator \( P(E) \):

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \approx \frac{0.16}{P(E)} \),
  "business administration": \( \approx \frac{0.01}{P(E)} \)
}

Without the exact normalization factor \( P(E) \), the posterior probabilities are proportional to the numerators calculated:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.16,
  "business administration": 0.01
}

Since we can't compute the exact posterior probabilities without \( P(E) \), we use these relative values to show that it's much more likely Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration based on the given personality sketch.
