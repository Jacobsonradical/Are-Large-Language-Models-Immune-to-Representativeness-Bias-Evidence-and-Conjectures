To use Bayes' rule for this calculation, we start with the following definitions:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \) being true.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that the hypothesis \( H \) is true.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that the hypothesis \( H \) is not true.
- \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability of the hypothesis \( H \) being true given the evidence \( E \).

Bayes' rule is formulated as follows:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) \) can be expanded as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Given the personality sketch of Adam, let's assess the probabilities for both fields:

### Business Administration
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H_{BA}) \)**:
   - Let's assume the prior probability of a graduate student being enrolled in Business Administration (BA) is moderate. For simplicity, assume \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.2 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{BA}) \)**:
   - Given Adam's characteristics (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, understanding of abstract concepts), it's less likely for him to be in Business Administration. Let’s set \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.1 \).

3. **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \)**:
   - The probability that someone not in Business Administration exhibits Adam's traits might be more common. Assume \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.3 \).

Using these values:
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.24 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.26 \]

Now calculate \( P(H_{BA}|E) \):
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx 0.077 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H_{AVS}) \)**:
   - Assume the prior probability of a graduate student being enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS) is also moderate. For simplicity, assume \( P(H_{AVS}) = 0.2 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \)**:
   - Given Adam's characteristics (genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals), it is highly likely he might be in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Let’s set \( P(E|H_{AVS}) = 0.7 \).

3. **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \)**:
   - The probability that someone not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science exhibits Adam's traits might be less. Assume \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) = 0.2 \).

Using these values:
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.2) + (0.2 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.14 + 0.16 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.3 \]

Now calculate \( P(H_{AVS}|E) \):
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.3} \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.14}{0.3} \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \approx 0.467 \]

Therefore, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.077,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.467
}
```
