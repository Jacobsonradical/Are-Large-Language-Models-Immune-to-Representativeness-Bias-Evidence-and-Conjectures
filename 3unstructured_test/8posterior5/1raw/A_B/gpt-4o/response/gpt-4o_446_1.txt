Sure, let's break down the probabilities as requested. We'll start by assessing the probabilities for each field based on the details provided in Adam's personality sketch.

**1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- \(P(H)\): The prior probability that a given graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume a typical university setting where the proportion of students in this field is moderate but not among the highest. For simplicity, let's assign a moderate prior probability, say \(0.1\).
  
- \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science. Based on his deep love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants, and empathy, it is highly probable he would be in this field. So, we can assign this a high value, like \(0.8\).
  
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Considering there are many other fields and personality traits that fit Adam less neatly, we might assign this a lower probability, say \(0.2\).

Now, using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
Where \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.9 \).

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.18} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \approx 0.308 \]

**2. Business Administration:**
- \(P(H)\): The prior probability that a given graduate student is in business administration. This is typically one of the more popular fields. For simplicity, let's assign a moderate-to-high prior probability, say \(0.15\).

- \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is in business administration. Adam's traits do not precisely align with typical business administration characteristics (like strategic thinking, leadership, etc.). So, we'd assign a low value, say \(0.2\).

- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is not in business administration. Considering there are many other fields and personality traits that fit Adam more accurately, we might assign this a higher probability, say \(0.6\).

Again, using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
Where \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85 \).

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{0.2 \cdot 0.15 + 0.6 \cdot 0.85} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.51} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.54} \approx 0.056 \]

Hence, summarizing the posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.308,
  "business administration": 0.056
}
