To apply Bayes' Theorem, we need prior probabilities \( P(H) \), likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the probabilities of evidence given the negation of the hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H) \). Then we calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \).

Let's briefly assess each field of study based on the personality sketch provided.

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H_{BA}) \):** 
   - Business administration is a common graduate field, so let's assume a moderate prior. 
   - For simplicity, we'll use \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{BA}) \):**
   - The personality sketch does not strongly align with typical characteristics for Business Administration (like leadership, competitive drive, interest in economics, etc.).
   - Let's assign \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.1 \) to reflect this mismatch.

3. **Probability of Evidence Given Not-Hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \):**
   - Since other fields might be more likely aligned with the personality sketch, let's use a higher value for this probability.
   - We'll assume \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.3 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H_{AVS}) \):**
   - Agricultural and veterinary science might be less common relative to business administration but is more aligned with Adam's traits.
   - Let's assume \( P(H_{AVS}) = 0.1 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \):**
   - The personality sketch strongly aligns with this field (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy).
   - Thus, \( P(E|H_{AVS}) = 0.7 \).

3. **Probability of Evidence Given Not-Hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \):**
   - Other fields might align, but less so than Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
   - We'll assume \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) = 0.4 \).

### Calculations Using Bayes' Theorem

#### Business Administration
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) can be derived as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \cdot P(\neg H_{BA}) \]

Let's calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.3 \cdot 0.75 = 0.025 + 0.225 = 0.25 \]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.25} = \frac{0.025}{0.25} = 0.1 \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)} \]

Similarly:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) + P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \cdot P(\neg H_{AVS}) \]

Let's calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = 0.7 \cdot 0.1 + 0.4 \cdot 0.9 = 0.07 + 0.36 = 0.43 \]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.43} = \frac{0.07}{0.43} \approx 0.163 \]

### Conclusion

After calculations, here are the results:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.163
}
```

The values indicate that based on Adam's personality sketch, he is more likely to have been enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than business administration in 2021.
