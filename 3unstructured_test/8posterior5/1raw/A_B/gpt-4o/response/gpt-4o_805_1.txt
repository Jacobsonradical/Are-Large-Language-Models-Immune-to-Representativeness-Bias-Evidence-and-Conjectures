To compute \( P(H|E) \) for Adam enrolled in each field given the personality sketch \( E \), we need to use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here are the steps for each field:

1. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a randomly selected graduate student is enrolled in business administration. This is generally quite high given the popularity of the field. Let's approximate it as 0.2.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam’s personality traits if he is enrolled in business administration. Given Adam's curiosity about nature, warm heart, empathy, and love for animals, this is quite low. Business administration does not typically require strong traits aligned with nature and animal empathy. Let's approximate it as 0.05.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam’s personality traits if he is not enrolled in business administration. Given the description, these traits might be more common in other fields. Let's approximate it as 0.3.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a randomly selected graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This field is less popular than business administration. Let's approximate it as 0.05.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam’s personality traits if he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals, this is high. Let's approximate it as 0.8.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam’s personality traits if he is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. As before, let's approximate it as 0.3.

Using Bayes' Theorem and normalizing these values (to account for other fields), we arrive at:

1. **For Business Administration:**

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) \text{ is the same across all fields and can be approximated by normalization.} \]

2. **For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} \]

To avoid actual values and simplify, we'll present the values in terms of their comparative ratios since \( P(E) \) is constant:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.01,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.04
}
```

These values indicate that, based on the given personality sketch, Adam is more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than business administration. Actual final probabilities should be normalized adding the possibilities of other fields.
