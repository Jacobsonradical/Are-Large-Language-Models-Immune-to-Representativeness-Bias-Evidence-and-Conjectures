To address the given problem, let's apply Bayes' rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to estimate:
- \( P(H) \): the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|H) \): the likelihood of observing the personality sketch if Adam is enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): the likelihood of observing the personality sketch if Adam is not enrolled in the given field.

Let's start by making reasonable assumptions for each field based on the provided personality sketch and the context.

### Business Administration

**1. Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
Graduate students in business administration are common but not the most common field overall.
\[ P(H_{\text{business}}) = 0.1 \]

**2. Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
Adam's traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy) do not strongly align with typical traits for business administration students.
\[ P(E|H_{\text{business}}) = 0.05 \]

**3. Negation Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
Given the personality sketch, these traits are more likely associated with other fields and not business administration.
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}}) = 0.2 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

**1. Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
Graduate students in agricultural and veterinary science are less common than some other fields but fit well with Adam's traits.
\[ P(H_{\text{agri_vet}}) = 0.05 \]

**2. Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
Adam's personality sketch strongly aligns with agricultural and veterinary science.
\[ P(E|H_{\text{agri_vet}}) = 0.8 \]

**3. Negation Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
If Adam is not in agricultural or veterinary science but has these traits, it is less likely but still possible.
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{agri_vet}}) = 0.3 \]

### Calculation of Posterior Probabilities

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since \( P(E) \) is constant for both fields and we are only comparing them, we can simplify this to the proportional form:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

### Business Administration

\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) \propto 0.05 \cdot 0.1 = 0.005 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

\[ P(H_{\text{agri_vet}}|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04 \]

After normalization (not required but just to show relative probabilities):

Total = 0.005 + 0.04 = 0.045

Normalized:

\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.045} \approx 0.111 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agri_vet}}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.045} \approx 0.889 \]

### Summary

{
  "business administration": 0.111,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.889
}

These probabilities support that Adam is much more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science based on his personality sketch.
