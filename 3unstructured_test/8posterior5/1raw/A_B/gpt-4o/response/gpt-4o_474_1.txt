To calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to compute the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood under the complement \( P(E|\neg H) \). 

The Bayes' rule formula is:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) \) can be expanded as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

**Hypothetical Values:**

Given that the specifics of the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and counter-likelihoods \( P(E|\neg H) \) aren't provided, we'll make educated guesses based on the sketch's alignment with the characteristics of each field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
   Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals, there's a high likelihood that he could be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   If Adam is in this field, the personality sketch fits very well:
   - Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).

3. **Likelihood under Complement \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   Assuming there's a broad range of other fields where this sketch might only partially fit, the complementary likelihood might not be very high.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Therefore:
\[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.3 \cdot 0.75) = 0.225 + 0.225 = 0.45 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.45} = \frac{0.225}{0.45} = 0.5 \]

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
   Adam's characteristics do not seem to align as closely with business administration, but students in this field can have diverse interests.
   - Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   If Adam were in this field, the personality sketch is less tightly aligned:
   - Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).

3. **Likelihood under Complement \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   The sketch fits various non-business fields better.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

Therefore:
\[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.1) + (0.4 \cdot 0.9) = 0.03 + 0.36 = 0.39 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.39} = \frac{0.03}{0.39} \approx 0.077 \]

A breakdown in JSON format:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.077
}
```

These calculations reflect that Adamâ€™s characteristics are much more likely to be associated with a field related to agricultural and veterinary science than to business administration.
