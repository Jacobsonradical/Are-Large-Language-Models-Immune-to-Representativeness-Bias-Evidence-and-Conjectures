To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayesian inference, we use Bayes' rule, which is stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we don't have exact numerical values for each probability in the problem statement. Therefore, I will make reasonable estimates based on the given personality sketch and the likelihood of enrollment in each field.

### Business Administration:
- **P(H)** (prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration): Graduate programs in Business Administration are fairly common, but given Adam's personality sketch, this field doesn’t strongly match his profile.
  - Estimate: 0.1 (10%)

- **P(E|H)** (probability of Adam having this personality sketch given he is in Business Administration): Business Administration typically includes analytical skills and empathy, but not necessarily a strong connection to nature, plants, or animals.
  - Estimate: 0.1 (10%)

- **P(E|¬H)** (probability of Adam having this personality sketch given he is not in Business Administration): There are many other fields in graduate studies where a strong empathy and connection to nature are more common.
  - Estimate: 0.9 (90%)

\[ P(H|E_{\text{Business}}) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{Business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{Business}})}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is constant across both fields and will cancel out when considering just the ratios:

\[ P(H|E_{\text{Business}}) \approx \frac{0.1 \times 0.1}{0.1 \times 0.1 + 0.9 \times (1 - 0.1)} \]
\[ P(H|E_{\text{Business}}) = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.81} \]
\[ P(H|E_{\text{Business}}) \approx \frac{0.01}{0.82} \]
\[ P(H|E_{\text{Business}}) \approx 0.012 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- **P(H)** (prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science): This field fits well with Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy.
  - Estimate: 0.15 (15%)

- **P(E|H)** (probability of Adam having this personality sketch given he is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science): The personality traits described are a good match for this field.
  - Estimate: 0.8 (80%)

- **P(E|¬H)** (probability of Adam having this personality sketch given he is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science): The overlap with other fields which highly value similar traits but are not as common.
  - Estimate: 0.7 (70%)

\[ P(H|E_{\text{Agricultural}}) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{Agricultural}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{Agricultural}})}{P(E)} \]

Again, since \( P(E) \) is constant and will cancel out when considering just the ratios:

\[ P(H|E_{\text{Agricultural}}) \approx \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.7 \times (1 - 0.15)} \]
\[ P(H|E_{\text{Agricultural}}) = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.595} \]
\[ P(H|E_{\text{Agricultural}}) \approx \frac{0.12}{0.715} \]
\[ P(H|E_{\text{Agricultural}}) \approx 0.168 \]

Putting it all together:

{
  "business administration": 0.012,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.168
}
