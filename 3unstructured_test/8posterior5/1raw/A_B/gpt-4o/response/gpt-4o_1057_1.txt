To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the respective field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in that field.

We use Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We can evaluate \( P(E) \) as a normalization factor, but since we are only asked for relative probabilities and not the total probability, we can focus on the numerator of Bayes' rule: \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

Let's make educated guesses for the values based on the given information:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): This could be relatively low, as only a small proportion of all graduate students are likely enrolled in this field.
   - \( P(E|H) \): This is potentially high because Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align well with this field.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): This could be moderately high, as empathy and intelligence are qualities that could belong to students in many fields.

2. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H) \): This could be more common but still relatively low, as there are many different fields a graduate student may choose. 
   - \( P(E|H) \): Likely quite low, as Adam's personality sketch does not strongly align with common traits needed for success in business administration (like a focus on leadership skills, finance, or strategy).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): This would be higher, as empathy, intelligence, and curiosity about abstract concepts are qualities that fit well in many other fields apart from business.

Given these educated guesses, let's assign some plausible values and compute \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \):

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- \( P(H) = 0.05 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(E) \): Not directly needed as a normalization factor.

\[
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04
\]

### Business Administration

- \( P(H) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.05 \)
- \( P(E) \): Not directly needed as a normalization factor.

\[
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.05 \cdot 0.1 = 0.005
\]

## Final probabilities:

Normalizing these values:

1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[
\frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.005} = \frac{0.04}{0.045} \approx 0.8889
\]

2. Business Administration:
\[
\frac{0.005}{0.04 + 0.005} = \frac{0.005}{0.045} \approx 0.1111
\]

Thus, the results are:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8889,
  "business administration": 0.1111
}
```
