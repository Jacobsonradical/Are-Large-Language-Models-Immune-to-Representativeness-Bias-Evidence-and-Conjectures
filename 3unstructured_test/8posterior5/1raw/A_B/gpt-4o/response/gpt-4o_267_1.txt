To apply Bayes' theorem, we need to evaluate the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \) - The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
2. \( P(E|H) \) - The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in a specific field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in that specific field.
4. \( P(H|E) \) - The posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch.

Bayes' theorem is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to compute \( P(E) \), which can be simplified as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Given the limited information, let's make some reasonable assumptions about these probabilities:

- For the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), we'll assume that it's equally likely for Adam to be enrolled in either field, but since there are many graduate fields of specialization, let's set \( P(H) \) to a small, reasonable value. Let's assume \( P(\mathrm{agricultural\ and\ veterinary\ science}) = 0.05 \) and \( P(\mathrm{business\ administration}) = 0.05 \).

- For the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), we need to evaluate how well Adam's personality sketch fits each field.
  - Agricultural and veterinary science: Given his love for nature, animals, and empathy, it is highly consistent. We'll assign \( P(E|H_{\mathrm{agriculture}}) = 0.8 \).
  - Business administration: This field does not directly align with the provided personality traits as well. We'll assign \( P(E|H_{\mathrm{business}}) = 0.2 \).

- For the likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \), we'll have to consider how likely we are to observe Adam's personality traits in general:
  - Agricultural and veterinary science: Since nature-oriented and empathetic traits might not be as common outside this field, let's set \( P(E|\neg H_{\mathrm{agriculture}}) = 0.3 \).
  - Business administration: Traits such as intelligence and understanding abstract concepts might occur frequently outside this field as well. Let's set \( P(E|\neg H_{\mathrm{business}}) = 0.6 \).

Given these values, let's calculate the posterior probabilities.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\( P(H) = 0.05 \)

\( P(E|H) = 0.8 \)

\( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \)

\( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \)

Since \( P(\neg H) \approx 0.95 \) (considering many other fields),
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.3 \cdot 0.95 = 0.04 + 0.285 = 0.325 \]

So,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.325} = \frac{0.04}{0.325} \approx 0.123 \]

### Business Administration
\( P(H) = 0.05 \)

\( P(E|H) = 0.2 \)

\( P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \)

\( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \)

Since \( P(\neg H) \approx 0.95 \),
\[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.05 + 0.6 \cdot 0.95 = 0.01 + 0.57 = 0.58 \]

So,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.05}{0.58} = \frac{0.01}{0.58} \approx 0.017 \]

Finally, our answer in the requested format:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.123,
  "business administration": 0.017
}
