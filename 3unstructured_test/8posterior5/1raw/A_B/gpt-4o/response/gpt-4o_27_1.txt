To address the Bayesian probability for the two fields, we need to assess prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the complement likelihoods \( P(E| \neg H) \). We then use Bayes' rule to compute posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \).

Here's a structured analysis to arrive at the required probabilities:

### 1. Business Administration
#### Prior Probability \( P(H) \):
Let's assume the probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in Business Administration:
\[ P(\text{BA}) = 0.2 \] (a reasonable assumption based on general graduate field distributions).

#### Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):
The likelihood that Adam, with a strong interest in nature, animals, and high intelligence, is in Business Administration is relatively low but not zero, as these traits are not typically associated with Business Admin:
\[ P(E|\text{BA}) = 0.05 \]

#### Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):
The likelihood that someone with Adam's traits does not fit the broader graduate student population not in Business Admin:
\[ P(E|\neg \text{BA}) = 0.1 \] (moderate, considering that Adam's traits fit more naturally in other fields).

#### Computation using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{BA}) \cdot P(\text{BA})}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

\[ P(E) = (0.05 \cdot 0.2) + (0.1 \cdot 0.8) = 0.01 + 0.08 = 0.09 \]

\[ P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.2}{0.09} = \frac{0.01}{0.09} \approx 0.111 \]

### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
#### Prior Probability \( P(H) \):
The probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(\text{AVS}) = 0.05 \] (reasonably assuming a smaller but significant portion of the graduate population).

#### Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):
The likelihood that Adam, with his love for nature and animals, is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is high:
\[ P(E|\text{AVS}) = 0.7 \] 

#### Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):
The likelihood that someone with Adam's traits does not fit the broader graduate student population not in Agri & Vet Science:
\[ P(E|\neg \text{AVS}) = 0.1 \]

#### Computation using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(\text{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{AVS}) \cdot P(\text{AVS})}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.05) + (0.1 \cdot 0.95) = 0.035 + 0.095 = 0.13 \]

\[ P(\text{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{0.13} = \frac{0.035}{0.13} \approx 0.269 \]
