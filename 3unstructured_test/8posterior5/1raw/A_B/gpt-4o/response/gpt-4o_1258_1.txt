To calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \) - The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
2. \( P(E|H) \) - The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.

We'll assume a general, simplified prior probability for each field since specific prior data is not provided. Let’s denote these priors as \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \) and \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \) respectively for Business Administration and Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

1. Prior Probability, \( P(H) \):
   - Given no specific data, we might assume an equal prior probability for Adam enrolling in either field initially.
   - Thus, \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.1 \) (since Business Administration is a common graduate field).
   - \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.05 \) (since Agricultural and Veterinary Science is a less common field compared to Business Administration).

2. Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \):
   - Given that Adam has a deep love for nature, plants, and animals, along with strong empathy and appreciation for hard work and dedication, these traits strongly correlate with Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
   - So, \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.9 \) (highly likely).
   - For Business Administration, these traits are less directly relevant, but could still somewhat align with management and empathy-related aspects, so \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.2 \).

3. Complement likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \):
   - This would encapsulate the likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in any other graduate field. Let’s assume, on average:
     - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.2 \)
     - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.6 \) (since nature, empathy, and animals could also align with biology or related fields).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E|H) P(H) + P(E|\neg H) P(\neg H)}
\]

**For Business Administration:**
\[
P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{0.2 \times 0.1 + 0.2 \times 0.9}
= \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.18}
= 0.1
\]

**For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[
P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.05}{0.9 \times 0.05 + 0.6 \times 0.95}
= \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.57}
= \frac{0.045}{0.615}
\approx 0.073
\]

Here are the results rounded appropriately:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.073
}
```

Note: These values are indicative based on heuristic assumptions due to lack of concrete prior data. Exact results might vary with specific priors for the given context.
