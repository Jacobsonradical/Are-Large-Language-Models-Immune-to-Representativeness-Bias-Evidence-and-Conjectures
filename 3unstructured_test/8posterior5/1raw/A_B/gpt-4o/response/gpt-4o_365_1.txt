To calculate \( P(H|E) \), we will use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) can be complex to determine precisely without more data, I will focus on the relative values of \( P(H|E) \) for each field based on reasonable estimates of \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). These estimates will be qualitative and based on the given personality sketch.

### Business Administration

- **P(H)**: Since the field of business administration is quite common, we can assume a moderate prior probability. Let's estimate \( P(H) \) as 0.1 (10%).
- **P(E|H)**: The personality traits given - curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and understanding of abstract concepts - do not strongly align with typical traits needed or nurtured in business administration. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) as 0.1 (10%).
- **P(E | \neg H)**: This is the probability of the personality sketch belonging to someone not in business administration. Given the traits, it seems more probable that someone with these qualities is not in business administration. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) as 0.3 (30%).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)**: Given the personality sketch, Adam seems much more aligned with this field. Let's estimate \( P(H) \) as 0.05 (5%) since it's less common than business administration.
- **P(E|H)**: His curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals strongly align with agricultural and veterinary science. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) as 0.9 (90%).
- **P(E | \neg H)**: This is the probability of the personality sketch for someone not in agricultural and veterinary science. Given the traits and small number of fields where these traits are a major requirement or a strong fit, let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) as 0.2 (20%).

#### Calculating \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

1. **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.1}{0.1 \times 0.1 + 0.9 \times 0.05} = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.045} = \frac{0.01}{0.055} \approx 0.1818 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 \times 0.05}{0.9 \times 0.05 + 0.2 \times 0.95} = \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.19} = \frac{0.045}{0.235} \approx 0.1915 \]

Therefore, even though the fields don't match the common intuition of their relatedness based purely on prior probabilities, the personality sketch shows a stronger alignment to agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration.
