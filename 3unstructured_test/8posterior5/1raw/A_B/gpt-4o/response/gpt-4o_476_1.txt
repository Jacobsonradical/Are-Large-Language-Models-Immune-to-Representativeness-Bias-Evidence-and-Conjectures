Sure, let's follow the reasoning process to estimate the probabilities.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science** (denoted as H=Ag)
   
   - \( P(H_{Ag}) \): The prior probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Assuming a balanced distribution of fields, let's assign this a moderate probability. 
     \[
     P(H_{Ag}) \approx 0.1
     \]
   
   - \( P(E|H_{Ag}) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his interest in nature, plants, and animals, this seems quite high.
     \[
     P(E|H_{Ag}) \approx 0.8
     \]
   
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{Ag}) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Considering that such an empathetic nature and love for animals is less common in other fields, this would be relatively lower.
     \[
     P(E|\neg H_{Ag}) \approx 0.2
     \]

   Using Bayes’ Rule:
   \[
   P(H_{Ag}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{Ag}) P(H_{Ag})}{P(E|H_{Ag}) P(H_{Ag}) + P(E|\neg H_{Ag}) (1 - P(H_{Ag}))}
   \]

   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   P(H_{Ag}|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.8 \times 0.1 + 0.2 \times 0.9} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.18} = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \approx 0.308
   \]


2. **Business Administration** (denoted as H=BA)
   
   - \( P(H_{BA}) \): The prior probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in business administration.
     \[
     P(H_{BA}) \approx 0.15
     \]
   
   - \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in business administration. Given his personality traits, this seems less likely.
     \[
     P(E|H_{BA}) \approx 0.1
     \]
   
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in business administration would be slightly higher since he seems unlikely to fit in BA.
     \[
     P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \approx 0.3
     \]

   Using Bayes’ Rule:
   \[
   P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) P(H_{BA})}{P(E|H_{BA}) P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA}) (1 - P(H_{BA}))}
   \]

   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.15}{0.1 \times 0.15 + 0.3 \times 0.85} = \frac{0.015}{0.015 + 0.255} = \frac{0.015}{0.27} \approx 0.056
   \]

Thus, we arrive at the following results:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.308,
  "business administration": 0.056
}
```
