To compute the probabilities, we need to make educated estimations about the prior probabilities \(P(H)\), the likelihoods \(P(E|H)\), and the marginal or complementary likelihoods \(P(E|\neg H)\).

Let's break it down for each field, starting with some reasonable approximations:

### For Business Administration:
1. **Prior probability (\(P(H)\))**: Business administration is a popular and diverse field. Let's assume a prior probability of 0.25.
2. **Likelihood (\(P(E|H)\))**: Adam's personality sketch doesn’t align well with typical qualities one might expect from a business administration student. Let's estimate this likelihood as 0.1.
3. **Complementary likelihood (\(P(E|\neg H)\))**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in business administration—since there are many fields other than business that could align with his interests—might be estimated as 0.3.

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

So,

\[
P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.3 \cdot 0.75) = 0.025 + 0.225 = 0.25
\]

Then,

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.25} = 0.1
\]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
1. **Prior probability (\(P(H)\))**: This field is more niche and specialized. Let's assume a prior probability of 0.05.
2. **Likelihood (\(P(E|H)\))**: Adam’s interest in nature, animals, and plant life fits very well with agricultural and veterinary science. Let's estimate this likelihood as 0.8.
3. **Complementary likelihood (\(P(E|\neg H)\))**: The probability of Adam’s personality sketch given that he is not in agricultural and veterinary science—considering there are other fields that might align with his interests—could be estimated as 0.3 again.

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[
P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.3 \cdot 0.95) = 0.04 + 0.285 = 0.325
\]

Then,

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.325} \approx 0.123
\]

Putting this all together:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.123
}
```

These computations suggest that, based on Adam's personality sketch, it is slightly more probable for him to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration.
