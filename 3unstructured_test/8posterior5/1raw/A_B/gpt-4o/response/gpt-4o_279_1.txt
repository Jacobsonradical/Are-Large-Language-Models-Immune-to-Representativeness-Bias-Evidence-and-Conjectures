To evaluate \( P(H | E) \), we'll use Bayes' theorem, which states:

\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's break down the estimation of each probability:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the field.
2. **P(E | H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given that he is enrolled in the field.
3. **P(E | \neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given that he is not enrolled in the field.
4. **P(E)**: The total probability of observing Adam's personality sketch \( E \), computed as:

\[ P(E) = P(E | H) \cdot P(H) + P(E | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Now let's assign some reasonable values to these probabilities for both fields.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

- **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume this to be around 0.05 (5%), given the variety of fields available.
- **P(E | H)**: Given the personality sketch, it is highly probable that Adam, with his love for nature and animals, is studying agricultural and veterinary science. We might estimate this as 0.8 (80%).
- **P(E | \neg H)**: The probability that a student not in agricultural and veterinary science would exhibit Adam's specific traits is lower. Let's estimate this to be 0.1 (10%).

### Business Administration:

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in business administration could be higher due to the popularity of the field. Let's assume this to be 0.2 (20%).
- **P(E | H)**: Given Adam's traits, it is less likely that he is studying business administration. Let's estimate this as 0.05 (5%).
- **P(E | \neg H)**: The probability that a student not in business administration would exhibit Adam's specific traits is higher. We can estimate this as 0.3 (30%).

Now we can compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.05) + (0.1 \times 0.95) = 0.04 + 0.095 = 0.135 \]
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.135} \approx 0.296 \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(E) = (0.05 \times 0.2) + (0.3 \times 0.8) = 0.01 + 0.24 = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.05 \times 0.2}{0.25} = 0.04 \]

Thus, the probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.296,
  "business administration": 0.04
}
