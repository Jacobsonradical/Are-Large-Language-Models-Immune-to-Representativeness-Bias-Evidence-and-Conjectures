To determine \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch of Adam, we'll utilize Bayes' theorem, calculated as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assuming we don't have detailed statistics about the specific prevalence of students in each field, let's make some reasonable qualitative assumptions based on Adam's interests and how well they correlate with each field.

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of being enrolled in Business Administration without considering the personality sketch. Suppose we assume 20% of graduate students are in business administration (since this is a common field).
   
   \[ P(H_{BA}) = 0.20 \]

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch being true if Adam were enrolled in Business Administration. Considering the given traits, business administration might partly align with appreciation for hard work and intelligence but less so with curiosity about nature, animals, and solving puzzles specific to natural sciences.

   Let's hypothetically assign this a value of:
   
   \[ P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.10 \]

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of the personality sketch being true if Adam were not enrolled in Business Administration. This involves all possible fields except Business Administration. Since many fields (like natural sciences, agricultural sciences, and veterinary sciences) seem more aligned with the sketch, let's suppose:
   
   \[ P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.30 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of being enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. This field is less common than Business Administration, let's assume 5%.

   \[ P(H_{AV}) = 0.05 \]

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch being true if Adam were enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. The sketch perfectly fits this field given the traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, etc.).

   Let's assign this a value of:
   
   \[ P(E|H_{AV}) = 0.90 \]

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of the personality sketch being true if Adam were not enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. This includes fields except Agricultural and Veterinary Science, where some might somewhat align but not as strongly:

   \[ P(E|\neg H_{AV}) = 0.15 \]

### Calculate \( P(H|E) \)

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields, what really matters for comparative purposes is the numerator. So, by focusing on the numerators:

\[ \text{For Business Administration:} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) = 0.10 \times 0.20 = 0.02 \]

\[ \text{For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:} \]
\[ P(H_{AV}|E) \propto P(E|H_{AV}) \cdot P(H_{AV}) = 0.90 \times 0.05 = 0.045 \]

Normalizing these values for convenience:

Sum = \( 0.02 + 0.045 = 0.065 \)

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.065} \approx 0.308 \]

\[ P(H_{AV}|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.065} \approx 0.692 \]

Thus, the probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": 0.308,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.692
}
