To calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in either "agricultural and veterinary science" or "business administration" based on his personality sketch \( E \), we use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here’s how we break it down step-by-step:

1. **Define Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)**:
   - \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = P(A) \)
   - \( P(\text{business administration}) = P(B) \)

2. **Define Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = P(E|A) \)
   - \( P(E|\text{business administration}) = P(E|B) \)

3. **Define Evidence \( P(E) \)**:
   \[ P(E) = P(E|A) \cdot P(A) + P(E|B) \cdot P(B) + P(E|\neg A \cap \neg B) \cdot P(\neg A \cap \neg B) \]

Since we are only considering two fields here, we will assume that \( P(\neg A \cap \neg B) \) is the prior probability of neither field and can be omitted for the conditional calculations:

### Assumptions (subjective):
- **Prior Probabilities**:
  - \( P(A) \): Likelihood that any given graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science.
  - \( P(B) \): Likelihood that any given graduate student is in business administration.

  Let’s assume:
  - \( P(A) = 0.2 \)
  - \( P(B) = 0.3 \)

- **Likelihoods**:
  - **For Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    Adam fits well into this category based on his curiosity about nature, plants, love for animals, and empathy.
    \[ P(E|A) = 0.9 \]

  - **For Business Administration**:
    Adam's warm heart, empathy, and appreciation for dedication are beneficial but less directly aligned with business administration.
    \[ P(E|B) = 0.2 \]

-** Complement Likelihoods**:
  - For other fields not considered in \( A \) or \( B \), let's assume an average fit.
    \[ P(E|\neg A \cap \neg B) = 0.5 \]

### Calculation:

1. **Total Probability \( P(E) \)**:
   \[ P(E) = P(E|A) \cdot P(A) + P(E|B) \cdot P(B) + P(E|\neg A \cap \neg B) \cdot P(\neg A \cap \neg B) \]
   \[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.2) + (0.2 \cdot 0.3) + (0.5 \cdot (1 - 0.2 - 0.3)) \]
   \[ P(E) = 0.18 + 0.06 + 0.25 = 0.49 \]

2. **Posterior Probabilities**:
   - For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
     \[ P(A|E) = \frac{P(E|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(E)} \]
     \[ P(A|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.2}{0.49} \]
     \[ P(A|E) \approx 0.367 \]

   - For Business Administration:
     \[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \]
     \[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{0.49} \]
     \[ P(B|E) \approx 0.122 \]

Resulting in:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.367,
  "business administration": 0.122
}
