Let's analyze this step by step:

#### For business administration:
1. **P(H)** (Prior Probability for business administration)
   - Assuming the proportion of students in business administration among all graduate fields is relatively high but not dominant, let's assign a value around 0.15.

2. **P(E|H)** (Probability of the personality sketch given Adam is in business administration)
   - Adam’s qualities like curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and solving puzzles are not strongly associated with business administration. Thus, let's assign a lower probability, around 0.1.

3. **P(E|\neg H)** (Probability of the personality sketch given Adam is NOT in business administration)
   - Since the personality sketch fits better with fields other than business administration, let's assign a higher probability, around 0.3.

Applying Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{0.1 \cdot 0.15 + 0.3 \cdot 0.85} = \frac{0.015}{0.015 + 0.255} = \frac{0.015}{0.27} \approx 0.0556
\]

#### For agricultural and veterinary science:
1. **P(H)** (Prior Probability for agricultural and veterinary science)
   - Assuming a smaller proportion of students in this field compared to business administration, let's assign a value around 0.05.

2. **P(E|H)** (Probability of the personality sketch given Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science)
   - Adam’s qualities match well with this field. Thus, let's assign a higher probability, around 0.8.

3. **P(E|\neg H)** (Probability of the personality sketch given Adam is NOT in agricultural and veterinary science)
   - Considering that fewer students exhibit such a specific match with these qualities, let's assign a value around 0.25.

Applying Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.25 \cdot 0.95} = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.2375} = \frac{0.04}{0.2775} \approx 0.1442
\]

So, the final probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0556,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.1442
}
```
