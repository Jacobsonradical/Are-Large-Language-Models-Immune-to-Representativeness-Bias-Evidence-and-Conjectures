To use Bayes' rule to compute the probabilities, we need to know the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H) \). Below are my judgments and calculations based on the provided information.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Graduate fields in general are varied, but given Adam's interest in nature and animals, let's assume a reasonably favorable prior. Let’s say \( P(H_1) = 0.1 \).
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: If Adam were studying this field, his personality sketch fits well (curiosity about nature/plants, love for animals). Let's set this high. \( P(E|H_1) = 0.8 \).
   - **Likelihood given negation \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is a bit trickier as it encompasses all the probabilities across all other fields. Given the specificity of interests and empathy, let’s set this to a moderate level. \( P(E|\neg H_1) = 0.2 \).

   Using Bayes’ Rule:
   \[
   P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)}
   \]
   Since we don't have the exact \( P(E) \) but know that \( P(E) = P(E|H_1)P(H_1) + P(E|\neg H_1)P(\neg H_1) \):
   \[
   P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9 = 0.08 + 0.18 = 0.26
   \]
   \[
   P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \approx 0.308
   \]

2. **Business Administration**:
   - **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Business administration is a common graduate field, let's assume it's a bit more common. Let’s say \( P(H_2) = 0.15 \).
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's personality traits don’t align well with typical interests in this field. We might set this low. \( P(E|H_2) = 0.1 \).
   - **Likelihood given negation \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Again, this is tricky but should be moderately high given other possible fields. \( P(E|\neg H_2) = 0.25 \).

   Using Bayes’ Rule:
   \[
   P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)}
   \]
   Since we don't have the exact \( P(E) \) but know that \( P(E) = P(E|H_2)P(H_2) + P(E|\neg H_2)P(\neg H_2) \):
   \[
   P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.15 + 0.25 \cdot 0.85 = 0.015 + 0.2125 = 0.2275
   \]
   \[
   P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.015}{0.2275} \approx 0.066
   \]

The resulting probabilities for Adam being enrolled in each field are:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.308,
  "business administration": 0.066
}
```

These probabilities indicate that based on Adam’s personality sketch, he is more likely to be in the field of agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration.
