To calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in either business administration or agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch \( E \), we need to use Bayes' rule, which can be stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we are dealing with two distinct fields, \( H_{\text{business}} \) and \( H_{\text{agriculture}} \), we will evaluate these individually. We need to assign prior probabilities \( P(H) \), likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the probabilities of observing \( E \) under the negation \( \neg H \).

### Step-by-Step Calculation
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - We need to assume reasonable priors for both fields based on general information about graduate studies.
   - Let's assume the probability that a random graduate student is in business administration \( P(H_{\text{business}}) \) is 0.2.
   - The probability that a random graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science \( P(H_{\text{agriculture}}) \) is perhaps smaller, letâ€™s estimate \( P(H_{\text{agriculture}}) \) as 0.05.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - This represents the probability of Adam fitting the personality sketch given he is in a specific field.
   - For business administration, the sketch does not align strongly with the typical characteristics used in this field, so we could use a smaller likelihood, say \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) = 0.1 \).
   - For agricultural and veterinary science, Adam's characteristics are very consistent with this field, thus, \( P(E|H_{\text{agriculture}}) = 0.9 \).

3. **Marginal Probability \( P(E) \)**:
   - This is the total probability of observing the evidence, computed as:
     \[
     P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{business}}) P(H_{\text{business}}) + P(E|H_{\text{agriculture}}) P(H_{\text{agriculture}}) + \text{probabilities from other fields}
     \]
   - Other fields might contribute to the overall observation, but given the small number of fields compared, we can adjust just including a similar coverage:
     \[ P(E) \approx (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.9 \cdot 0.05) + \text{small adjustments for other fields} \approx 0.02 + 0.045 + 0.1 \approx 0.165 \]

4. **Posterior Calculation**:
   - Using Bayes' rule individually:

For business administration:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business}}) P(H_{\text{business}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.165} \approx 0.121
   \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{agriculture}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agriculture}}) P(H_{\text{agriculture}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.165} \approx 0.273
   \]

### Final Result

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.121,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.273
}
```

_NOTE: These values are numerical approximations and the priors are hypothetical assumptions based on common sense. Real-world priors, likelihoods and additional fields should be more precisely estimated for precise computation._
