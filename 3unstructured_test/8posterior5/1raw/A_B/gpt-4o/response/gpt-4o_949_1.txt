Sure, let's go through the probability assessments and then use Bayes' rule to determine \( P(H|E) \).

### Step 1: Assess Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)
- Let's assume that the base rate for enrollment in business administration is lower than that for agricultural and veterinary science given Adam's interests and traits.
- Let’s set the prior \( P(H) \) for business administration: \( 0.2 \)
- Let’s set the prior \( P(H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science: \( 0.8 \)

### Step 2: Assess Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)
- Based on the personality sketch, the likelihood that Adam, with his genuine curiosity about nature, empathy for animals, and solving puzzles, would enroll in business administration should be relatively low.
- On the other hand, the likelihood that Adam would enroll in agricultural and veterinary science should be high given his love for nature, plants, and animals.

Therefore, we can assign:
- \( P(E|H\text{ for business administration}) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H\text{ for agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.9 \)

### Step 3: Assess Alternative \( P(E|\neg H) \)
- For business administration, \( P(E|\neg H\text{ for business administration}) \) is higher because enrollment in fields other than business administration (which includes agricultural and veterinary science) which are more aligned with Adam's interests, is more probable.
- For agricultural and veterinary science, \( P(E|\neg H\text{ for agricultural and veterinary science}) \) is low because the alternative domains wouldn't align as well with Adam's characteristics.

Let’s set:
- \( P(E|\neg H\text{ for business administration}) = 0.75 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H\text{ for agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.2 \)

### Step 4: Compute Posterior Probability \( P(H|E) \)
Using Bayes' rule, \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \)

Where \( P(E) \) is computed by: \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \):

#### For Business Administration:
\( P(E\text{ for business administration}) = (0.1)(0.2) + (0.75)(0.8) = 0.02 + 0.6 = 0.62 \)

So:
\[ P(H|E\text{ for business administration}) = \frac{(0.1)(0.2)}{0.62} = \frac{0.02}{0.62} \approx 0.032 \]

#### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\( P(E\text{ for agricultural and veterinary science}) = (0.9)(0.8) + (0.2)(0.2) = 0.72 + 0.04 = 0.76 \)

So:
\[ P(H|E\text{ for agricultural and veterinary science}) = \frac{(0.9)(0.8)}{0.76} = \frac{0.72}{0.76} \approx 0.947 \]

Therefore, the resulting posterior probabilities can be approximated as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.032,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.947
}
