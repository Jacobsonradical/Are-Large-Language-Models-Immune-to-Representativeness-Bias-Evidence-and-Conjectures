To compute the probabilities, I'll use Bayes' rule, which states that:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood probability of Adam's personality sketch \( E \given \) that he was in the given field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood probability of Adam's personality sketch \( E \given \) that he was not in the given field.
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was in the given field given his personality sketch.

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant and Bayes' theorem needs to be applied in a relative sense, we can ignore it and focus on calculating:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Let's make some educated estimates.

Firstly, for "agricultural and veterinary science":
- \( P(H_{\text{agri}}) \): The prior probability of being in agricultural or veterinary science. Let's estimate this prior as being relatively moderate for a graduate student. Say \( 0.1 \). 
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) \): Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, and his empathy, the likelihood of this personality in agricultural and veterinary science is quite high. Let's estimate it as \( 0.8 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agri}}) \): The likelihood of this personality sketch in the context of not being in agricultural and veterinary science can be estimated as lower. Say \( 0.3 \).

Now for "business administration":
- \( P(H_{\text{bus}}) \): The prior probability of being in business administration. Let’s estimate this as moderate as well. Say \( 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|H_{\text{bus}}) \): Given Adam's nature-oriented personality, the likelihood of this personality sketch fitting business administration is comparatively lower. Let’s estimate it as \( 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{bus}}) \): The likelihood of this personality sketch in the context of not being in business administration can be estimated as higher. Say \( 0.4 \).

Using our estimates, we compute the relative probabilities:

\[ P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agri}}) = 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{bus}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{bus}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{bus}}) = 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02 \]

Normalizing these (though not necessary since the total doesn't need to add up to 1):

For "agricultural and veterinary science":
\[ \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.02} = 0.8 \]

For "business administration":
\[ \frac{0.02}{0.08 + 0.02} = 0.2 \]

Thus, the estimates are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
