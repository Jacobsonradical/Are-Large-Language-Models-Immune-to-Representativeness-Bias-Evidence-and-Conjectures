To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following information:
1. Prior probability \( P(H) \): The initial probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field, before considering the personality sketch.
2. Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \), given that Adam is enrolled in the hypothesis field \( H \).
3. Evidence \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \), given that Adam is not enrolled in the hypothesis field \( H \).

Bayes' rule formula is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, as \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields, it can be handled as a normalization factor. So, for simplicity, we'll set it aside and just work with the numerators of the fraction for relative comparison.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. \( P(H) \): We don't have specific priors, but let's assume there's an equal initial probability for any field of specialization, hence \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \).
2. \( P(E|H) \): Adam's traits align well with the field of agricultural and veterinary science based on his love for nature, animals, empathy, and understanding hard work. Thus, \( P(E|H) \) is high, say 0.8.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given that there are many other graduate fields, \( P(E|\neg H) \) should be lower. Let's assume it's 0.2 for the sake of comparison.

### Business Administration

1. \( P(H) \): Similarly, we assume an equal prior probability \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \).
2. \( P(E|H) \): Adam's traits are less directly aligned with business administration. Traits like empathy and love for animals might be less predictive of a business administration student. Thus, \( P(E|H) \) is lower, say 0.3.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): Since many other fields might still suit Adam's traits better than business administration, \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \).

### Calculations

Now, we use these estimates to determine \( P(H|E) \) for relative comparison.

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]

#### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.3 \cdot 0.1 = 0.03 \]

### Normalization

To give a comparative posterior probability, we normalize these values:

1. Total: \( 0.08 + 0.03 = 0.11 \)
2. Normalized \( P(H|E) \):

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ \frac{0.08}{0.11} \approx 0.727 \]

For Business Administration:
\[ \frac{0.03}{0.11} \approx 0.273 \]
