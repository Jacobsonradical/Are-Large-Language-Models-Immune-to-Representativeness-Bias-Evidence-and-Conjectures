To evaluate the probabilities, we will use Bayes' theorem, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \),
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \),
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of the evidence \( E \) given the negation of the hypothesis \( \neg H \).

Given that the sketch involves characteristics that are very relevant to the field of agricultural and veterinary science, but are less relevant to business administration, we can infer higher probabilities accordingly.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
   - Given Adam's interests, let's assume he has a moderately high probability of being enrolled in this field based on his love for nature, plants, and animals.
   - Let's estimate \( P(H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science as 0.3.
   
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   - Given that he has a genuine curiosity about nature and a deep love for animals, it's highly likely that he would be in this field.
   - Let's assign \( P(E|H) \) a value of 0.8. 

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   - Given that Adamâ€™s characteristics are less likely to be found in someone not in agricultural and veterinary science, \( P(E|\neg H) \) should be relatively low.
   - Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) as 0.2.

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
   - Based on the description, Adam's characteristics don't align as well with business administration.
   - Let's estimate \( P(H) \) for business administration as 0.1.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   - Adam's characteristics are unlikely to lead him to a business administration program.
   - Let's assign \( P(E|H) \) a value of 0.1.

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   - Many individuals enrolling in other fields could exhibit some of Adam's characteristics (e.g., empathy, intelligence), making it relatively plausible that \( P(E|\neg H) \) for business administration would not be significantly low.
   - Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) as 0.3.

Next, we use Bayes' rule:

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) \text{ can be assumed constant for comparisons.} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} = \frac{0.24}{P(E)} \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) \text{ can be assumed constant for comparisons.} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.01}{P(E)} \]

Given \( P(E) \) as a constant divisor, \( P(H|E) \) for agricultural and veterinary science is much larger than for business administration.

So, the comparative values are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
