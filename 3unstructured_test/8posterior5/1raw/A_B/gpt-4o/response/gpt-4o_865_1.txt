Let's start by defining the variables in a clear manner:

- \(H_{a}\): Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \(H_{b}\): Adam was enrolled in business administration.

We want to use Bayes' theorem to find \(P(H|E)\) for each of these fields. Bayes' theorem states that:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Firstly, let's establish some prior probabilities \(P(H)\) based on typical enrollment rates and what's generally known about these fields. Since we don't have specific data, we'll use reasonable estimates guided by the context. Also, we will need to estimate \(P(E|H)\) and \(P(E|\neg H)\) based on the given personality sketch.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
    - **\(P(H_{a})\)**: Let's estimate that the baseline probability for any random student to be in agricultural and veterinary science is relatively low. We will set \(P(H_{a}) = 0.05\).
    - **\(P(E|H_{a})\)**: The given personality sketch aligns well with the interests and traits of someone in this field. Thus, we can assign a high probability, say \(P(E|H_{a}) = 0.9\).
    - **\(P(E|\neg H_{a})\)**: If Adam is not in this field, the chance of having this personality is significantly lower; let's say \(P(E|\neg H_{a}) = 0.2\).

2. **Business Administration:**
    - **\(P(H_{b})\)**: Business administration is a very common field, so let's assign a higher baseline probability, \(P(H_{b}) = 0.15\).
    - **\(P(E|H_{b})\)**: The personality traits described are not strongly aligned with typical business admin students who might focus more on leadership, management, or economic strategies. Therefore, we will assign a lower probability, say \(P(E|H_{b}) = 0.3\).
    - **\(P(E|\neg H_{b})\)**: If Adam is not in business administration, the likelihood of his personality sketch still remains significantly higher, let's say \(P(E|\neg H_{b}) = 0.6\).

Now, we need \(P(E)\) for normalization. For simplicity, we assume \(P(E)\) can be reasonably derived from these contexts as the sketch aligns better with agricultural and veterinary science.

Using Bayes' Rule:

- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[
P(H_{a}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{a}) \cdot P(H_{a})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)}
\]

- For Business Administration:

\[
P(H_{b}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{b}) \cdot P(H_{b})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)}
\]

We need to find \(P(E)\):

\[
P(E) = P(E|H_{a}) \cdot P(H_{a}) + P(E|H_{b}) \cdot P(H_{b}) + P(E|\neg H_{a}) \cdot P(\neg H_{a}) + P(E|\neg H_{b}) \cdot P(\neg H_{b})
\]

Given only the probabilities defined above and simplifying:

Since \(P(E|\neg H_{a})\) and \(P(E|\neg H_{b})\) would contain overlapping details, we simplify by focusing on \(H_{a}\) and \(H_{b}\):

\[
P(E) \approx P(E|H_{a}) \cdot P(H_{a}) + P(E|H_{b}) \cdot P(H_{b}) = (0.9 \cdot 0.05) + (0.3 \cdot 0.15) 
\]

\[
P(E) = 0.045 + 0.045 = 0.09
\]

Thus,

\[
P(H_{a}|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.09} \approx 0.5
\]

\[
P(H_{b}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.15}{0.09} \approx 0.5
\]

Given the closer alignment of the personality traits and the slight biases towards agricultural science based on the sketch, we slightly tilt estimates.

Thus, the final results:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.55,
  "business administration": 0.45
}
```
