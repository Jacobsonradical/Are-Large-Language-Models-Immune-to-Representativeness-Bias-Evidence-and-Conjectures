To apply Bayes' Rule, we start with the following definitions and equations:

- \( P(H) \) = Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|H) \) = Likelihood of the evidence given that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) = Likelihood of the evidence given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H|E) \) = Posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field given the evidence.

Bayes' Rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

We need to make some reasonable estimates:

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- \( P(H) \): Let's assume the prior probability that any given graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science is quite low, say around 0.05.
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's described characteristics, it seems highly likely (curiosity about nature, love for animals), so we estimate around 0.8.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): This could cover many other fields where different characteristics might dominate, so let's assume a relatively low value of around 0.1.

Compute:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.1 \cdot 0.95 = 0.04 + 0.095 = 0.135 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.135} \approx 0.296 \]

**Business Administration:**
- \( P(H) \): Let's assume the prior probability that any given graduate student is in business administration is relatively higher due to the popularity of the field, say around 0.15.
- \( P(E|H) \): The personality sketch of Adam doesn't align much with typical traits associated with business administration, so we estimate around 0.2.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Similar to the above calculation, let's use a value of around 0.1.

Compute:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) = 0.2 \cdot 0.15 + 0.1 \cdot 0.85 = 0.03 + 0.085 = 0.115 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{0.115} \approx 0.261 \]

Therefore, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.296,
  "business administration": 0.261
}
```
