To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given that he is enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given that he is not enrolled in that field.

Let's consider each hypothesis:

### Hypothesis: Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability of any graduate student being in this field. Let's assume it's relatively low but not negligible, given the multitude of possible graduate fields. Assign a value of \( P(H) \approx 0.05 \).
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, and his empathy, a high probability he could be in this field. Let's assign \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \).
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's characteristics if he is not in this field, considering he could be in many other fields. Let’s assign a value of \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.1 \).

### Hypothesis: Business Administration

- **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability of any graduate student being in this field. Business is quite common, so let's assign \( P(H) \approx 0.15 \).
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's characteristics, it's less aligned with Business Administration, which often values different traits. Assign \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \).
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's characteristics if he is not in this field. Considering many other fields better match his characteristics, let’s assign \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \).

Now, we apply Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) P(H) + P(E|\neg H) P(\neg H) \]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.05) + (0.1 \times 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.095 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.135 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.135} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.135} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.296 \]

### For Business Administration:

\[ P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.15) + (0.3 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.015 + 0.255 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.27 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.15}{0.27} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.015}{0.27} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.056 \]

### Results:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.296,
  "business administration": 0.056
}
```

These values indicate that based on Adam's personality sketch, it is more likely that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science rather than business administration.
