To evaluate the probabilities, we'll use Bayes' rule, which states that:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's suppose the initial (prior) probability \( P(H) \) for both fields is equally likely. Since these are only two fields among many possible fields, \( P(H) \) will be relatively small but let's consider their relative likelihood for simplicity.

We know that \(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}\) aligns quite well with Adam's personality sketch \(E\), whereas \(H_{\text{business administration}}\) does not align as precisely. 

For business administration:
- \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \): Let's assume an equal prior probability, so 0.1 for simplicity.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \): Adam's interest in nature and animals, empathy, and abstract thinking do not strongly suggest business administration. We'll give it a lower probability, say 0.2.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business administration}}) \): Adam's personality fits many other fields much better, so we will consider the complementary high probability of other fields, say 0.9.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
- \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): Equal prior probability, so 0.1.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): Adam's traits are a good match for this field, so we might estimate this probability to be around 0.8.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): Complementary lower probability of other fields fitting his profile, say 0.3.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E|\neg H) \neq P(E) \), and we are not given \( P(E) \), we focus on the relative likelihoods:

{
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{0.2 \times 0.1 + 0.8 \times 0.1} = \frac{0.02}{0.10} = 0.2 \),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.2 \times 0.1 + 0.8 \times 0.1} = \frac{0.08}{0.10} = 0.8 \)
}

Summarizing:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
