To apply Bayes' theorem, we need to calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \). Bayes' theorem states that

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field, \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence given that hypothesis, and \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of observing the evidence.

Since we don't have explicit values for these probabilities, I'll use reasoned assumptions.

### Assumptions and Values
- **P(H)**: Prior probability for each field. Since there are many fields of graduate study, letâ€™s assume a uniform prior for simplicity which implies \( P(H) \approx 0.01 \) (assuming 100 potential fields).
- **P(E|H)**: How likely it is for Adam to exhibit the given characteristics if he were in a particular field.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Likelihood of the characteristics in anyone not in the field.
- **P(E)**: Marginal probability of observing the evidence \( E \). It's a normalizing constant which ensures that the total probability sums to 1.

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: 0.01 (prior)
- **P(E|H)**: High, given his love for animals and curiosity about nature (let's assume 0.8)
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Lower, because not every other field will cater to his traits (let's assume 0.1)

#### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: 0.01 (prior)
- **P(E|H)**: Low, as business administration is less likely associated with his specific interests and personality traits (let's assume 0.05)
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Higher than for Agricultural and Veterinary Science but still low (let's assume 0.15)

Now, using these assumptions in Bayes' theorem:

For *Agricultural and Veterinary Science*:
\[ P(\text{H|E}) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.01}{0.8 \cdot 0.01 + 0.1 \cdot 0.99} \]
\[ = \frac{0.008}{0.008 + 0.099} \]
\[ = \frac{0.008}{0.107} \]
\[ \approx 0.0748 \]

For *Business Administration*:
\[ P(\text{H|E}) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.01}{0.05 \cdot 0.01 + 0.15 \cdot 0.99} \]
\[ = \frac{0.0005}{0.0005 + 0.1485} \]
\[ = \frac{0.0005}{0.149} \]
\[ \approx 0.0034 \]

Given that our probability doesn't need to sum to 1 across all possible fields of specialization, we can leave others out.

Thus, the answers are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.0748,
  "business administration": 0.0034
}
