To estimate the probabilities, let's consider the information provided in the personality sketch and the nature of each field.

Adam has a strong inclination towards nature, plants, animals, and abstract concepts. He also values hard work and dedication. Given this information, we can make educated guesses about the likelihood of each hypothesis \( H \) and the conditional probabilities \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

1. **P(H)** - The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field:
   - Agricultural and veterinary science: This field aligns well with Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals. Let's assume a moderate prior probability, \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
   - Business administration: This field does not align as clearly with Adam's described interests and personality traits. Let's assume a lower prior probability, \( P(H) = 0.05 \).

2. **P(E|H)** - The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in the field:
   - Agricultural and veterinary science: Given the alignment of the field with Adam's interests, this probability is high, \( P(E|H) = 0.80 \).
   - Business administration: Given the limited alignment with Adam's interests, this probability is low, \( P(E|H) = 0.10 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H)** - The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam was NOT enrolled in the field:
   - Agricultural and veterinary science: Since there are many other fields Adam could be in that might weakly align with his interests, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.30 \).
   - Business administration: Similarly, considering the wide range of other fields, \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.30 \).

Using Bayes' rule, we can calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Now, let's compute the posterior probabilities:

1. **Agricultural and veterinary science**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.30 \cdot 0.85} = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.255} = \frac{0.12}{0.375} \approx 0.32
   \]

2. **Business administration**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.10 \cdot 0.05}{0.10 \cdot 0.05 + 0.30 \cdot 0.95} = \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.285} = \frac{0.005}{0.29} \approx 0.017
   \]

So the final probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.32",
  "business administration": "0.017"
}
