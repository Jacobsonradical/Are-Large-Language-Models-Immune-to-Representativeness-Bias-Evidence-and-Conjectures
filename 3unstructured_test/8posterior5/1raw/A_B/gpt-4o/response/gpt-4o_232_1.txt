To calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for both fields of study using Bayes' rule, we first need some estimates for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Let's consider these probabilities based on the provided personality sketch and general knowledge of graduate fields.

Given the personality sketch:
- Adam has a strong curiosity about nature and plants, enjoys solving puzzles, has empathy and a love for animals, is intelligent, and appreciates hard work and dedication.

These attributes align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science than business administration. But let's outline the probabilities and apply Bayes' Rule.

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's estimate it as \( P(H) = 0.05 \) (5% of graduate students might be in this field).
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his attributes, this probability should be high, so let's estimate it as \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is *not* in agricultural and veterinary science. This is likely lower since the given attributes are quite specific to this field, so let's estimate it as \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

Applying Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.1 \cdot 0.95} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.095} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.135} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.296 \]

#### Business Administration
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in business administration. A higher percentage of students might be in this field, so let's estimate \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in business administration. Given his attributes, this probability is likely lower than for agricultural and veterinary science, so let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is *not* in business administration. Since the specified attributes are quite unrelated to business administration, this would be comparable to the others, so let's use \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

Applying Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{0.1 \cdot 0.15 + 0.1 \cdot 0.85} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.015}{0.015 + 0.085} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.015}{0.1} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.15 \]

Now we can summarize the results as follows:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.296,
  "business administration": 0.15
}
```


Based on these calculations, Adam is more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than business administration given his personality sketch.
