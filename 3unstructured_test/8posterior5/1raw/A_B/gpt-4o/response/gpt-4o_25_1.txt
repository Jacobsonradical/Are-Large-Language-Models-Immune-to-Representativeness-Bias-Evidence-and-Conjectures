To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \), we need to apply Bayes' rule, which states that:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we are not given the exact probabilities, we will make educated guesses based on the sketch provided for Adam and the nature of the fields.

Let's decompose the elements:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a random graduate student is in this field. Let's assume this to be moderate, like 0.1 (10%).
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in this field. Given his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, this seems highly likely. Let's assume a high probability, like 0.8.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is NOT in this field. Given the specificity of his traits, this is relatively low. Let's assume 0.2.

Now, applying Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.8 \times 0.1 + 0.2 \times 0.9} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.18} = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \approx 0.3077 \]

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a random graduate student is in this field. This field is very common, so let's assume 0.2 (20%).
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in this field. This seems low because his interests and traits don't align well with business admin. Let's assume 0.1.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is NOT in this field. This would be higher than for the field above but still quite specific. Let's assume 0.25.

Now, applying Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.1 \times 0.2 + 0.25 \times 0.8} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.2} = \frac{0.02}{0.22} \approx 0.0909 \]

So, here are the computed probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3077,
  "business administration": 0.0909
}
