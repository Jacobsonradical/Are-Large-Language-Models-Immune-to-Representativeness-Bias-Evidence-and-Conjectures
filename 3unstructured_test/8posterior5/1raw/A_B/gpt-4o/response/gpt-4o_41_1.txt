To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following probabilities for each field:

1. **Prior probability of enrollment in a specific field \( P(H) \)**
  - This is the general likelihood of a graduate student being enrolled in a certain field, which we assume based on general knowledge.

2. **Likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis \( P(E|H) \)**
  - This is the probability of Adam's personality sketch being true if he is enrolled in a particular field.

3. **Likelihood of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H) \)**
  - This is the probability of Adam's personality sketch being true if he is not enrolled in a particular field.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be expressed as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

### Assumptions for Probabilities:
For simplicity, let's assume the following estimates:

- Let’s assume that the fraction of graduate students enrolled in business administration or agricultural and veterinary science is not skewed.
  - \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.3 \)
  - \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.1 \)

- Given Adam’s personality sketch:

  - \( P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.05 \) (Typically, students in business administration might not have these personality traits)
  - \( P(E| \neg \text{business administration }) = 0.3 \)
  
  - \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.8 \) (More likely to fit Adam’s personality profile)
  - \( P(E| \neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.25 \)

### Calculation for Business Administration:

\[ P(H = \text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(E) = P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) + P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) \cdot P(\neg \text{business administration}) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.05 \cdot 0.3 + 0.3 \cdot 0.7 = 0.015 + 0.21 = 0.225 \]

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.3}{0.225} = \frac{0.015}{0.225} = \frac{1}{15} = 0.067 \]


### Calculation for Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[ P(H = \text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(E) = P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) + P(E|\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.25 \cdot 0.9 = 0.08 + 0.225 = 0.305 \]

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.305} = \frac{0.08}{0.305} \]

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = 0.262 \]

Thus, the final computed probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": 0.067,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.262
}
