Sure, let's proceed with the estimation of probabilities according to Bayes' Rule.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. This might depend on the popularity and enrollment of this field among graduate students. Let's assume a reasonable prior of 0.05.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given the description (love for nature, plants, animals, empathy), this seems highly likely. Let's assume 0.7.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Since the traits described are not very common in general, let's assume this to be 0.1.

Using Bayes Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.05}{0.7 \times 0.05 + 0.1 \times 0.95} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.035}{0.035 + 0.095} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.035}{0.13} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.27 \]

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration. This might also depend on enrollment data. Let's assume a prior of 0.1, as Business Administration is a popular field.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was in Business Administration. The traits (interest in nature, puzzles, empathy) are less typical for this field. Let's assume 0.02.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Similar to before, 0.1. 

Using Bayes Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02 \times 0.1}{0.02 \times 0.1 + 0.1 \times 0.9} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.002}{0.002 + 0.09} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.002}{0.092} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.022 \]

So, our estimates are as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.27,
  "business administration": 0.022
}
```
