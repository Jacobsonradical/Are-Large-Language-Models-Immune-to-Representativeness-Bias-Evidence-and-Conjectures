To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for business administration and agricultural and veterinary science given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, let's use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the provided information, I will make educated guesses for the prior probabilities and likelihoods involved in the calculations. Note that these are approximations and your specific values might differ based on more precise data.

### 1. Business Administration

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration.
  - Given that business administration is a popular field, let's assume a moderate prior: \( 0.15 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in business administration.
  - Business administration typically doesn't align as strongly with Adam's described interests in nature, animals, and puzzles, so let's assume: \( 0.05 \).
- \( P(E| \neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is **not** enrolled in business administration.
  - This includes all other fields where Adam's interests might be a better fit. Since there are many other fields, let's assume: \( 0.35 \).

### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
  - This field aligns well with Adam's interests in nature and animals. Let's assume a prior: \( 0.05 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
  - This field is a strong match for Adam's interests, so let's assume: \( 0.8 \).
- \( P(E| \neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is **not** enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
  - Similar to above but now considering no direct relevance group: \( 0.3 \).

### Calculation

We will use Bayes' rule as mentioned above:

1. **Business Administration**:
   \[
   P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)}
   \]
   Since \( P(E) \) is constant for all calculations, we use relative probabilities:
   \[
   P(\text{business administration}|E) \propto P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) = 0.05 \cdot 0.15 = 0.0075
   \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[
   P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)}
   \]
   Similarly, we calculate:
   \[
   P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \propto P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04
   \]

### Normalization

Finally, to get normalized probabilities, we consider only the proportional values.

Total proportional value:
\[
= 0.0075 + 0.04 = 0.0475
\]

Normalized probabilities:
\[
P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.0075}{0.0475} \approx 0.158
\]
\[
P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.0475} \approx 0.842
\]

So, our final answer will be:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.158,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.842
}
```
