To determine \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis field using Bayes' Rule, we'll consider the prior probability, the likelihood of observing the evidence given the hypothesis, and the probability of the evidence not given the hypothesis. Here’s the step-by-step breakdown for each field:

**1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

1. **Prior \( P(H_1) \):** Let's assume that the prior probability Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is moderate. We can denote this as \( P(H_1) = 0.1 \).
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_1) \):** Given the evidence \( E \) (Adam's love for nature, animals, and his warm heart), it's very likely he could be in this field. We can set \( P(E|H_1) = 0.8 \).
3. **Probability of Evidence \( P(E|\neg H_1) \):** This represents the likelihood of the evidence if Adam is in any other unrelated field. Since Adam's interests are somewhat specialized, this might be lower, say \( P(E|\neg H_1) = 0.2 \).
4. **Bayes' Rule Calculation \( P(H_1|E) \):**

   \[
   P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E|\neg H_1) \cdot P(\neg H_1)}
   \]
   \[
   P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{(0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9)} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.18} = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \approx 0.31
   \]

**2. Business Administration:**

1. **Prior \( P(H_2) \):** Assuming the prior probability Adam is enrolled in business administration is also moderate. Let’s denote this as \( P(H_2) = 0.1 \).
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_2) \):** Given Adam's love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles, it's less likely he would choose a business field. We can set \( P(E|H_2) = 0.2 \).
3. **Probability of Evidence \( P(E|\neg H_2) \):** Similar to above, this would still be lower, so \( P(E|\neg H_2) = 0.2 \).
4. **Bayes' Rule Calculation \( P(H_2|E) \):**

   \[
   P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) + P(E|\neg H_2) \cdot P(\neg H_2)}
   \]
   \[
   P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{(0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9)} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.18} = \frac{0.02}{0.20} = 0.1
   \]

Thus, the results will be:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.31,
  "business administration": 0.10
}
