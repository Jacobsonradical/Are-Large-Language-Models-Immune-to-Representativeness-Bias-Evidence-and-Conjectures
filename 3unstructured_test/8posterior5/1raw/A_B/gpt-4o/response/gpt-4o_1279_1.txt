To compute \( P(H|E) \) for the given fields using Bayes' Rule, we need to estimate the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the overall likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \). Bayes' Rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To simplify, we can consider proportionality since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant common to all hypotheses:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Let's reason through the estimates for each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

**Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:  
Agricultural and Veterinary Science graduate programs are specialized, but they're not extremely common. Let's assume \( P(H) \) to be moderate compared to more general fields.
\[ P(H) = 0.1 \]

**Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:  
Given that Adam has a deep love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work, it is highly likely that this field fits his personality sketch.
\[ P(E|H) = 0.9 \]

**Overall Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:  
The traits mentioned are not exclusive to this field but can be present in several others like biology, environmental science, etc. Let's give this a moderate likelihood.
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \]

### Business Administration

**Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:  
Business Administration is a very common graduate field.
\[ P(H) = 0.3 \]

**Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:  
Adamâ€™s personality sketch does not strongly correlate with the typical traits expected in this field. While intelligence and understanding abstract concepts can be useful, the curiosity about nature and love for animals does not strongly fit.
\[ P(E|H) = 0.2 \]

**Overall Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:  
Given the mismatch, the likelihood would be lower.
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.8 \]

### Calculating Posterior Probabilities

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.09 \]

2. **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \cdot 0.3 = 0.06 \]

Normalizing constants are unnecessary for relative measures, but the sum helps understand proportion:

\[
0.09 + 0.06 = 0.15
\]

Normalized results:

\[
P(H|E)_{agricultural \, and \, veterinary \, science} = \frac{0.09}{0.15} \approx 0.6
\]
\[
P(H|E)_{business \, administration} = \frac{0.06}{0.15} \approx 0.4
\]

So, the probability estimates would be:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.4
}
```

These values indicate the relative likelihood that Adam's field of study matches his personality sketch, given our assumptions and calculations.
