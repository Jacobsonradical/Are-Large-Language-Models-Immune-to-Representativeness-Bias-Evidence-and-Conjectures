Let's denote the following probabilities:
- P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
- P(E|H): The probability of observing the evidence (personality sketch) given that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
- P(E|\neg H): The probability of observing the evidence given that Adam was not enrolled in the given field.
- P(H|E): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field given the evidence (using Bayes' Rule).

Let's work through the provided fields.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. We'll assume this is relatively low, but not negligible. Let's assign a value of 0.05 for the purpose of this calculation.
- **P(E|H)**: The evidence aligns well with characteristics likely found in someone studying agricultural and veterinary science (e.g., love for animals, empathy, appreciation for hard work). Let's assign a value of 0.8.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The chance of anyone having these characteristics but not studying agricultural and veterinary science could still be reasonably high, but not as high as those studying this field. Let's assign a value of 0.3.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

First, compute \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.05) + (0.3 \times 0.95) = 0.04 + 0.285 = 0.325 \]

Next, compute \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.325} = \frac{0.04}{0.325} \approx 0.123 \]

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in business administration. We'll assume this is relatively higher compared to agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assign a value of 0.15.
- **P(E|H)**: The evidence does not align as well with characteristics generally expected in someone studying business administration (e.g., fewer natural science traits). Let's assign a value of 0.1.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The chance of anyone having these characteristics but not studying business administration is high. Let's assign a value of 0.35.

Using the same Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(E) \text{ (recalculated for this field)} = (0.1 \times 0.15) + (0.35 \times 0.85) = 0.015 + 0.2975 = 0.3125 \]

Next, compute \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{0.3125} = \frac{0.015}{0.3125} \approx 0.048 \]
