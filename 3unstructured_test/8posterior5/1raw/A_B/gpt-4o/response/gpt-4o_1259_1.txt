To calculate the probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field of study based on his personality sketch, we need to use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here,
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the field \( H \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in the field \( H \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in the field \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the evidence \( E \).

Given that \( P(E) \) can be quite complex to compute without full information, we'll compare the relative probabilities using the given information.

Let's consider the two hypotheses:
1. \( H_b \): Adam is enrolled in business administration.
2. \( H_a \): Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

### Business Administration
- **\( P(H_b) \)**: Prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in business administration. Let's assume this to be a common field of study and estimate \( P(H_b) = 0.3 \).
- **\( P(E|H_b) \)**: Likelihood of Adam's personality fitting a typical business administration student. Business students might not typically exhibit the described traits like love for nature and animals. Let's set this relatively low, say \( P(E|H_b) = 0.1 \).
- **\( P(E|\neg H_b) \)**: Likelihood of Adam's personality among all other fields. Given many other fields may share some of these traits, assume \( P(E|\neg H_b) = 0.4 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H_b|E) \propto P(E|H_b) \cdot P(H_b) \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **\( P(H_a) \)**: Prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This is a less common field compared to business administration. Let's estimate \( P(H_a) = 0.1 \).
- **\( P(E|H_a) \)**: Likelihood of Adam's personality fitting a typical student in this field. Given Adam's love for nature, animals, and empathy, this seems highly consistent. Set this relatively high, say \( P(E|H_a) = 0.8 \).
- **\( P(E|\neg H_a) \)**: Likelihood of Adam's personality among all other fields. Similar to above, assume \( P(E|\neg H_a) = 0.4 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H_a|E) \propto P(E|H_a) \cdot P(H_a) \]

### Calculations:
#### Business Administration:
\[ P(H_b|E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.3 = 0.03 \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_a|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]

For normalization, we could divide each by the sum of these unnormalized probabilities, but since we're only asked for relative values, we're focusing on proportional comparison.

### Final Values:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.03,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08
}
