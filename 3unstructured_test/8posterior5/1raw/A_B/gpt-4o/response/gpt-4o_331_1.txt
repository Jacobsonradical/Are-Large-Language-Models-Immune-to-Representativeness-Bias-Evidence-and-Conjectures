To determine \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we first need to outline the components:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field before considering the personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in the field.

Then Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we are comparing the probabilities of two hypotheses, we can ignore the denominator \( P(E) \) (as it is the same for both hypotheses) and compare the numerators directly.

### Estimations:
Note: Exact probabilities cannot be derived due to the lack of precise data, but we can make educated estimations based on typical characteristics.

1. **Business Administration**:
    - \( P(H) \): Business Administration is a common graduate program. Let's assume a moderate prior probability, say \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \).
    - \( P(E|H) \): Given the personality sketch, the traits described (e.g., a love for nature, empathy, and animals) are less typical for Business Administration programs. Let's assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \).
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Assuming he is not in Business Administration, these traits still might appear in various other fields, but not specifically tied to any particular field, so let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.15 \).

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - \( P(H) \): This is a less common field compared to Business Administration, but considering the personality sketch traits (e.g., love for nature/animals), let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \).
    - \( P(E|H) \): Given that his traits align closely with this field (e.g., interest in nature, love for animals), let's assume a higher probability, say \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \).
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Assuming he is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, these traits are still relevant but might be found in other fields (e.g., Biology). Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \).

### Applying Bayes' Rule:
For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \approx 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02 \]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \approx 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \]

### Normalization:
To compare:
- \( \text{Business Administration:} \, 0.02 \)
- \( \text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science:} \, 0.08 \)

Given these proportional values, we can see that the probability \( P(H|E) \) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science is much higher than for Business Administration.

### Final Answer:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08
}
