To utilize Bayes' theorem in this context, we need to assess the following probabilities:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in each field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in each field.
- \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field given the personality sketch.

Let's start with approximate estimations:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **\( P(H) \)**: Let’s assume the prior probability for agricultural and veterinary science is a moderate value because it is a relatively common field (say 0.1).
   - **\( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's love for nature, animals, and appreciation for hard work, it seems highly likely he would fit well in this field (say 0.8).
   - **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The likelihood of Adam having such characteristics while not being in this field could be moderate, as other fields may also attract such students (say 0.2).

Now using Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
where \( P(E) \) can be approximated by the total evidence, including all fields.

Let's simplify and just approximate using the given values:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9}
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.18} = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \approx 0.3077
\]

2. **Business Administration**:
   - **\( P(H) \)**: Let’s assume the prior probability for business administration is larger because it is a very common field (say 0.25).
   - **\( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's profile, it seems unlikely he would choose business administration over a field more aligned with his interests (say 0.1).
   - **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This can be assumed to be similar to the first field for simplicity (say 0.2).

Now using Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75}
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.025}{0.025 + 0.15} = \frac{0.025}{0.175} \approx 0.142857
\]

Now, providing the answers in the required format:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3077,
  "business administration": 0.142857
}
```

These are rough approximations based on assumed probabilities and would benefit from more precise data to make more accurate assessments.
