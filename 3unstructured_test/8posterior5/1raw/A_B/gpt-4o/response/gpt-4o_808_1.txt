To calculate the probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate \( P(H) \) (the prior probability of H), \( P(E|H) \) (the likelihood of observing E given H), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) (the likelihood of observing E given not H). Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To simplify, since we're comparing two hypotheses, we can use the ratio form of Bayes' rule and normalize after:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Let's evaluate each hypothesis:

1. **Business Administration**

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in Business Administration. Suppose we assign a general prior based on the popularity of the field.
  - Assume \( P(\text{Business Administration}) = 0.2 \) (arbitrary estimate)

- **P(E|H)**: The probability that a student with Adam's characteristics is enrolled in Business Administration. Given Adam's traits (interest in nature, animals, empathy, etc.), it is less likely, but not impossible.
  - Assume \( P(E|\text{Business Administration}) = 0.1 \)

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that a student with Adam's characteristics is not enrolled in Business Administration. Given the diversity of other fields, it is high.
  - Assume \( P(E|\neg \text{Business Administration}) = 0.9 \)

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Suppose we assign a general prior based on the popularity of the field.
  - Assume \( P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) = 0.05 \) (arbitrary estimate)

- **P(E|H)**: The probability that a student with Adam's characteristics is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Adam's interests closely align with this field.
  - Assume \( P(E|\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) = 0.9 \)

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that a student with Adam's characteristics is not enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given the diversity of other fields, but many other fields do not align with Adam's characteristics as closely.
  - Assume \( P(E|\neg \text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) = 0.1 \)

Now, we compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field, and then normalize:

For Business Administration:
\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) \propto P(E|\text{Business Administration}) \cdot P(\text{Business Administration}) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) \propto P(E|\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) \cdot P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) = 0.9 \cdot 0.05 = 0.045 \]

Normalization:
\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.045} \approx 0.307 \]
\[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.02 + 0.045} \approx 0.693 \]

Results:
{
  "business administration": 0.307,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.693
