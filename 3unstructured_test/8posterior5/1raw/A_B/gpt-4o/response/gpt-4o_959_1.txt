Sure, let's break down the information provided and utilize Bayes' theorem to compute \( P(H|E) \). Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We can compare the two fields of study (agricultural and veterinary science vs. business administration) by estimating the required probabilities.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: The overall probability that a graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's say a rough estimate for this in the U.S. could be around 5%.
  \[ P(H_{\text{agriculture}}) = 0.05 \]

- **P(E|H)**: Given that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science, the probability that he matches the personality sketch \( E \). Since his interests align strongly with this field, this should be quite high. Let's estimate it at 80%.
  \[ P(E|H_{\text{agriculture}}) = 0.8 \]

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam having these personality traits while not being in agricultural and veterinary science. Since such traits can also exist in other fields but less likely than in agriculture, let's estimate this at 10%.
  \[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{agriculture}}) = 0.1 \]

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: The overall probability that a graduate student is in business administration. Business administration is a popular field, so let's estimate this at around 25%.
  \[ P(H_{\text{business}}) = 0.25 \]

- **P(E|H)**: Given that Adam is in business administration, the likelihood he displays these characteristics is relatively low due to the nature of the field, which focuses more on corporate skills rather than empathy towards nature and animals. Let's estimate this at 5%.
  \[ P(E|H_{\text{business}}) = 0.05 \]

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of Adam having these traits while not being in business administration. Given that these traits are less common in business administration, we can estimate this at 15%.
  \[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}}) = 0.15 \]

### Bayes' Theorem Calculations

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[ P(H_{\text{agriculture}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agriculture}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agriculture}})}{P(E) } = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{P(E)} \]

2. **Business Administration**:
   \[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}})}{P(E) } = \frac{0.05 \times 0.25}{P(E)} \]

Given that \( P(E) \) is the same in both equations, we can compare the numerators directly.

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ 0.8 \times 0.05 = 0.04 \]

For business administration:
\[ 0.05 \times 0.25 = 0.0125 \]

Normalizing these to sum to 1 for comparison:
\[ P(H_{\text{agriculture}}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.0125} = \frac{0.04}{0.0525} \approx 0.76 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{0.0125}{0.04 + 0.0125} = \frac{0.0125}{0.0525} \approx 0.24 \]

Therefore, the probabilities given the personality sketch would be:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.76,
  "business administration": 0.24
}
```
