Sure, let's break down the problem using Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \), which is the probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given the field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch (which is constant and can be left out for relative comparisons).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in the field.

Let's assign some subjective probabilities based on the given information:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

   - \( P(H) \): Given Adam's traits, it's reasonable to say there is a moderately high chance he could be in this field. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The personality sketch aligns very well with this field, suggesting a high probability. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of having such a personality sketch while not being in this field can be considered lower. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

   Now we can apply Bayes' Rule:
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.2}{0.9 \cdot 0.2 + 0.1 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.18}{0.18 + 0.08} = \frac{0.18}{0.26} \approx 0.692 \]

2. **Business Administration**

   - \( P(H) \): Based on the traits given, Adam is less likely to be in business administration, but not impossible. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The personality sketch does not strongly align with this field. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The personality sketch while not being in business administration. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.15 \).

   Now we can apply Bayes' Rule:
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.05}{0.2 \cdot 0.05 + 0.15 \cdot 0.95} = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.1425} = \frac{0.01}{0.1525} \approx 0.065 \]

Thus, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.692,
  "business administration": 0.065
}
```
