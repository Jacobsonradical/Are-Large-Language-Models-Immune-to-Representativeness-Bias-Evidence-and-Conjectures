To calculate \( P(H|E) \), which is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch, we need to use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) (the total probability of the personality sketch across all possible fields) is a normalization factor common to all hypotheses (fields), we can omit it when comparing relative probabilities. We will focus on estimating \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for both fields given.

Assumptions (for simplicity):

1. \( P(H) \) - Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field. We assume it's higher for agricultural and veterinary science based on his traits and lower for business administration.
2. \( P(E|H) \) - Likelihood of Adam's personality traits if he was enrolled in the specific field. We assume Adam's traits fit well with agricultural and veterinary science and not as well with business administration.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - Likelihood of Adam's personality traits if he was not enrolled in the specific field. This is an aggregate of how common these traits are across all other fields.


### Estimations:

#### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **\( P(H) = 0.15 \)**: Given Adam's love for nature, animals, and empathy, this seems like a relevant field.
- **\( P(E|H) = 0.80 \)**: Adam's personality fits very well with this field.
- **\( P(E|\neg H) = 0.20 \)**: Many other fields are less likely to have individuals with Adam's specific personality traits.

Using Bayes' rule (ignoring \( P(E) \) for relative comparison):

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.80 \times 0.15 = 0.12 \]

#### 2. Business Administration
- **\( P(H) = 0.10 \)**: This is less likely given Adam's personality traits, which do not align closely with typical business administration profiles.
- **\( P(E|H) = 0.05 \)**: Adam's empathy and love for nature and animals do not fit well with business administration traits.
- **\( P(E|\neg H) = 0.20 \)**: Similar to the first field, the likelihood of Adam's traits across other fields remains constant for comparison.

Using Bayes' rule (ignoring \( P(E) \)):

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.05 \times 0.10 = 0.005 \]


Now, normalizing these values for comparison purposes (sum of proportional values):

\[
\text{Sum} = 0.12 + 0.005 = 0.125
\]

Normalized probabilities:

\[
P(\text{Agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.125} = 0.96
\]

\[
P(\text{Business administration}|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.125} = 0.04
\]

### Final Answer:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.96,
  "business administration": 0.04
}
```
