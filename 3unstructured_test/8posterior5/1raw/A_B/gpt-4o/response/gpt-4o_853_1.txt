To calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need three probabilities for each field:

1. \( P(H) \) - The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \) - The probability that the personality sketch \( E \) is true given that Adam was enrolled in the field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - The probability that the personality sketch \( E \) is true given that Adam was not enrolled in the field.

Bayes’ rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be computed as \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

However, since the problem does not provide specific numbers, we need to make informed guesses about these probabilities based on the provided information.

1. **Business Administration**
   - \( P(H) \): Business Administration is a common graduate field, but not necessarily for someone with Adam’s interests and personality traits. Hence, we’ll assume a lower prior probability, say 0.1 for simplicity.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam’s interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy doesn’t strongly align with Business Administration. So this probability is lower, around 0.1.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given Adam’s traits, they are quite likely to be true if he is not in Business Administration. We can assume this to be higher, around 0.8.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - \( P(H) \): Given Adam’s specific interests in nature, plants, and animals, Agricultural and Veterinary Science is a likely field. We’ll assume a higher prior probability, say 0.3.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam’s personality sketch strongly matches this field, so this probability is high, around 0.9.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): If Adam is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, his traits are less likely to be perfectly correlated, so we assume a medium value, around 0.5.

### Calculations

1. **Business Administration**

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{(0.1 \cdot 0.1) + (0.8 \cdot 0.9)} \]

\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.1) + (0.8 \cdot 0.9) = 0.01 + 0.72 = 0.73 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.73} \approx 0.0137 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.3}{(0.9 \cdot 0.3) + (0.5 \cdot 0.7)} \]

\[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.3) + (0.5 \cdot 0.7) = 0.27 + 0.35 = 0.62 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.27}{0.62} \approx 0.4355 \]
