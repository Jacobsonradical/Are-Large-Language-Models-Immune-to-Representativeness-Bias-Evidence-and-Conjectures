To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in a particular graduate field given his personality sketch \( E \), we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \).

We will make reasonable assumptions regarding the values of these probabilities based on the given personality sketch and the fields in question.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- \( P(H) \): The probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let’s assume this is moderately high for someone with Adam's profile, given his interests in nature and animals. Let’s say \( P(H) = 0.15 \).

- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam, given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science, would have this personality sketch. Given his love for animals and plants, this is quite high. Let’s say \( P(E|H) = 0.85 \).

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that Adam would have this personality sketch if he is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This would be somewhat lower. Let’s say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.25 \).

### Business Administration

- \( P(H) \): The probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in business administration. Given Adam's personality sketch, this probability is likely lower. Let’s assume \( P(H) = 0.10 \).

- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam, given that he is in business administration, would have this personality sketch. Given his empathy and love for abstract concepts, but not matching his primary interests, it’s reasonably low. Let’s say \( P(E|H) = 0.20 \).

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that Adam would have this personality sketch if he is not enrolled in business administration. This might be similar since he could be in another field. Let's say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.30 \).

Given that,

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

### Calculation for Agricultural and Veterinary Science

\[ P(E) = (0.85 \cdot 0.15) + (0.25 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.1275 + 0.2125 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.34 \]

Now,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.85 \cdot 0.15}{0.34} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.375 \]

### Calculation for Business Administration

\[ P(E) \text{ (already calculated as 0.34, same denominator)} \]

Now,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.20 \cdot 0.10}{0.34} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.059 \]

So, the results are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.375,
  "business administration": 0.059
}
