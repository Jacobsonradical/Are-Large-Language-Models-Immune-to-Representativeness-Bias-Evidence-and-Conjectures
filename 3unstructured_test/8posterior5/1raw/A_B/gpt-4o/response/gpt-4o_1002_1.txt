Let's break down the calculations step-by-step using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.

First, we need to assign estimates for these probabilities:

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume that 5% of graduate students are in this field. Thus, \( P(H) = 0.05 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given he is in agricultural and veterinary science. Given that his traits align closely with this field, let's assume this probability is 0.7.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given he is NOT in agricultural and veterinary science. This might be roughly the average across all fields, given the alignment of his traits. Let’s assume it is 0.1.
  
Using Bayes’ theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} \]

For computational convenience, assume \( P(E) = \) (we don't need the exact value since only the relative probabilities matter here).

**Business Administration:**
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in business administration. Let’s assume 15% of graduate students are in this field. Thus, \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given he is in business administration. Given his traits don't align particularly well with business administration, let’s assume this probability is 0.05.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): This probability remains the same: 0.1.
  
Using Bayes’ theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \]

Now, we'll compute the normalized probabilities:

- For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.035}{P(E)} \]

- For **business administration**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.0075}{P(E)} \]

Let's normalize these values to sum to 1 among these two fields:

Total unnormalized value = \( 0.035 + 0.0075 = 0.0425 \)

Thus:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} = 0.035 / 0.0425 \approx 0.8235 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} = 0.0075 / 0.0425 \approx 0.1765 \]

Therefore, the probabilities are approximately:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.824,
  "business administration": 0.176
}
