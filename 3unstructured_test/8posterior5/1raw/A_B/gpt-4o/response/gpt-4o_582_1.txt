To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to assess:

1. \( P(H) \) - the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
2. \( P(E|H) \) - the probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - the probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.

Given \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \), we can use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Since we are only comparing two fields, we do not need to worry about the exact value of \( P(E) \), as it will be constant across our calculations for different fields. Instead, we focus on the relative probabilities.

Let's evaluate each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

- **P(H) (Prior):** This is typically difficult to estimate precisely without more information, but let's assume it's relatively common for someone with Adam's interests. Let's give it a higher prior probability due to his love for nature, plants, and animals. Prior plausibility might be around 0.25.
  
- **P(E|H):** Given that Adam's personality sketch aligns well with the attributes needed for this field (curiosity about nature, love for plants and animals, strong empathy), we can assume a higher conditional probability, say 0.8.
  
- **P(E|\neg H):** This would encompass all other fields. Since many of Adam's traits align well with this specific field, being in another field would be less likely to match all these traits perfectly. Let's estimate this as somewhat lower, say 0.1.

### Business Administration:

- **P(H) (Prior):** This seems less likely given Adam's described interests and personality. Let’s assign a lower prior probability, say 0.1.
  
- **P(E|H):** Business administration usually does not heavily rely on Adam’s specified traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals). Let's assign a lower conditional probability, say 0.2.
  
- **P(E|\neg H):** This includes other fields like agricultural science, which fit Adam’s profile better. Let’s estimate this as less specific compared to the first case but relatively consistent, say 0.3.

Using these evaluations, we'll now compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \):

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[
P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

\[
P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.25
\]

\[
P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} = 0.2
\]

For Business Administration:

\[
P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

\[
P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.1
\]

\[
P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} = 0.02
\]

In normalized form, these are reasonable assessments:

\[
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \approx 0.91, 
  "business administration": \approx 0.09
}
\]

This implies Adam is significantly more likely to have been enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science rather than Business Administration based on his personality sketch.
