To determine the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis using Bayes' rule, we need the following:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of the hypothesis.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis.
4. \( P(E) \): The marginal probability of the evidence (can be calculated using the law of total probability but generally cancels out in the Bayes' rule formula for comparative purposes).

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's estimate each component for the two fields:

### Business Administration
1. **\( P(H_{BA}) \)**: This is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a Business Administration program. Business Administration is a common graduate program, but given Adam's interests and personality, it seems less likely.
   - Estimate: \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.2 \)

2. **\( P(E|H_{BA}) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in business administration. Given his personality sketch, it seems less likely that he would fit perfectly into a typical business administration profile.
   - Estimate: \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.1 \)

3. **\( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in business administration. His qualities seem to fit better with other fields.
   - Estimate: \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.9 \)

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **\( P(H_{AVS}) \)**: This is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in an Agricultural and Veterinary Science program. Adam’s personality traits align well with this field, making it a strong candidate.
   - Estimate: \( P(H_{AVS}) = 0.3 \)

2. **\( P(E|H_{AVS}) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is studying Agricultural and Veterinary Science. His genuine curiosity about nature, plants, animals, and empathy fits well.
   - Estimate: \( P(E|H_{AVS}) = 0.8 \)

3. **\( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not studying Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Considering his interests and traits, it’s likely that a smaller proportion of the remaining fields would match him well.
   - Estimate: \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) = 0.5 \)

Using these estimates and Bayes' rule, we compute \( P(H|E) \).

For business administration:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)} \]

Given that \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields and cancels out in relative comparisons, we calculate the values as:

### Business Administration
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \]

Since the exact values of \( P(E) \) are not given, we compare the magnitudes in the proportional results:
Normalized:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.24} \approx 0.077 \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.24}{0.02 + 0.24} \approx 0.923 \]

Thus, the answers can be summarized as:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.077,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.923
}
