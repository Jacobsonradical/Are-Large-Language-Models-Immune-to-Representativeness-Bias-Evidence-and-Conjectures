To calculate the probabilities \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' Rule, we need to follow these steps:

1. Estimate \(P(H)\), the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field.
2. Estimate \(P(E|H)\), the likelihood of observing the evidence E given that Adam is in a particular field.
3. Estimate \(P(E|\neg H)\), the likelihood of observing the evidence E given that Adam is not in that particular field.
4. Calculate \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' Rule: 

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

Where \(P(E)\) is the marginal likelihood, which can be computed as:

\[P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)\]

However, since we are comparing two fields, we can simplify the problem by comparing the ratios of \(P(H|E)\) for each field. We don't need the exact value of \(P(E)\) since it cancels out when comparing different fields.

Given the information from the personality sketch, let's analyze:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: Given Adam's interests and personality traits, there's a reasonably high prior probability he is in this field, as it aligns closely with his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work.
- **P(E|H)**: High probability, since the evidence E matches well with someone in agricultural and veterinary science.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Lower probability, as this evidence does not match other fields as closely, especially business-related fields.

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: Lower prior probability, given that business administration does not align closely with his traits which are more nature and science-oriented.
- **P(E|H)**: Low probability, as the traits and interests described do not match typical traits for students in business administration fields.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Moderate probability, since these traits are less likely to define someone in a non-science field, but they are not exclusive to it.

Based on these estimates, we can then assign probabilities to \(P(H|E)\) for each field. Here's a judgment based on the described analysis:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.85,
  "business administration": 0.05
}

These values reflect a substantially higher likelihood that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality traits and interests, as opposed to business administration.
