Applying Bayes' Theorem, we need the following probabilities:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the provided personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the provided personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.
4. **P(H|E)**: The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field given the personality sketch.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that \( P(E) \) (the total probability of observing the personality sketch) is constant for both fields, it will cancel out when normalizing later.

### Business Administration

#### P(H): Prior Probability
Assuming that the probability of a graduate student enrolling in business administration is moderate but not overly common, let's assume:
\[ P(H_{\text{business admin}}) = 0.2 \]

#### P(E|H): Likelihood
Given the personality sketch, Adam's interest in nature, empathy, love for animals, etc., are not typical traits closely associated with students of business administration. Thus:
\[ P(E|H_{\text{business admin}}) = 0.1 \]

#### P(E|\neg H): Complement Likelihood
This is the likelihood of observing these traits given Adam is not in business administration. Since there are many other fields other than business admin where these traits can be common, we assign a moderate probability:
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{business admin}}) = 0.6 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

#### P(H): Prior Probability
Given Adam's nature-oriented traits, the likelihood he is in a field like agricultural and veterinary science is higher:
\[ P(H_{\text{agric sciences}}) = 0.15 \]

#### P(E|H): Likelihood
The personality traits match well with someone in agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(E|H_{\text{agric sciences}}) = 0.8 \]

#### P(E|\neg H): Complement Likelihood
Considering Adam might exhibit these traits in some other fields too, let's assume:
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{agric sciences}}) = 0.4 \]

### Calculations Using Bayes' Theorem

#### For Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{\text{business admin}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business admin}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business admin}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business admin}}|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

#### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{agric sciences}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agric sciences}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agric sciences}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agric sciences}}|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \]

Since \(P(E)\) is a normalizing constant, let's calculate the non-normalized probabilities first:

\[ P(H_{\text{business admin}}|E) \text{ (non-normalized)} \approx 0.02 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agric sciences}}|E) \text{ (non-normalized)} \approx 0.12 \]

Normalizing:

Total unnormalized = 0.02 + 0.12 = 0.14

Normalized values:

\[ P(H_{\text{business admin}}|E) \approx \frac{0.02}{0.14} \approx 0.14 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agric sciences}}|E) \approx \frac{0.12}{0.14} \approx 0.86 \]

  "business administration": 0.14,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.86
