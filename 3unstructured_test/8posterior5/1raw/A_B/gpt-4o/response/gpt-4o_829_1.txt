Sure, let's break it down step by step using Bayes' rule. We'll first need to judge the values of \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each hypothesis.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Graduate fields have varying numbers of students, but let's assume we're treating all fields as initially equally likely. Therefore, \( P(H) \) for each field might start as roughly equal. Normally, specific domain knowledge or data would inform this better, but let's say it's around \( 0.1 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Adam's characteristics align strongly with a field centered around nature, plants, and animals, and requiring intelligence and a sense of dedication. Thus, \( P(E|H) \) is high, say around \( 0.9 \).

3. **Evidence \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - Many fields might not fit Adam's profile as well, so we can surmise that \( P(E|\neg H) \) is lower. Let's set this at \( 0.3 \).

Now, using Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

Let's calculate:

\[
P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) = 0.09 + 0.27 = 0.36
\]

Thus:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{0.36} = \frac{0.09}{0.36} = 0.25
\]

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Again, assuming an initially equal probability, \( P(H) \) might be around \( 0.1 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Adam's profile fits less well with business administration, which is more people- and money-oriented and less about nature and animals. Let's set \( P(E|H) \) at around \( 0.2 \).

3. **Evidence \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - Similar to above, let's set this at \( 0.3 \).

Now, using Bayes' rule:

\[
P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) = 0.02 + 0.27 = 0.29
\]

Thus:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.29} = \frac{0.02}{0.29} \approx 0.069
\]

So, the conditional probabilities of Adam being enrolled in the specified fields, given his personality sketch, are as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.25",
  "business administration": "0.069"
}
```
