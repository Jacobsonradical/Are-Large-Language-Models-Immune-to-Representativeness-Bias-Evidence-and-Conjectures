To solve the problem, let's first clearly identify what each term represents in this context:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the personality sketch (E) given that Adam was enrolled in a particular field (H).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the personality sketch (E) given that Adam was not enrolled in a particular field (H).
- \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given the personality sketch (E) (this is what we aim to compute using Bayes' rule).

### Hypothesis 1: Agricultural and Veterinary Science

#### Step 1: Judge the values

- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Since graduate students can choose from numerous fields, let's say it is relatively equally distributed among possible fields. Assign a value of 0.1 for simplicity.
  
- \( P(E|H) \): Given that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, the probability of having such a personality sketch is high, as his characteristics align well with this field. We'll assign a value of 0.8.

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given that Adam was not enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, the probability of having such a personality sketch is lower, as this field is particularly aligned with his characteristics. Let's assign a value of 0.3.

#### Step 2: Compute using Bayes' Rule

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we are focusing only on relative probabilities between the hypotheses and we will adjust later, we don't need the exact value of \( P(E) \). Therefore, we can compute:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) P(H) \]

So, for Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \]

### Hypothesis 2: Business Administration

#### Step 1: Judge the values

- \( P(H) \): Prior probability of Adam being a Business Administration student. Assign a value of 0.1 for simplicity.
  
- \( P(E|H) \): Given that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration, the probability of having such a personality sketch is lower, as his characteristics don't strongly align with this field. We'll assign a value of 0.2.

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given that Adam was not enrolled in Business Administration, the probability of having such a personality sketch is relatively higher compared to being in Business Administration. Let's assign a value of 0.5.

#### Step 2: Compute using Bayes' Rule

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) P(H) \]

So, for Business Administration:

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.2 \times 0.1 = 0.02 \]

### Normalizing (if necessary)

For understanding relative probabilities, normalization might be helpful:

Total \( \propto (0.08 + 0.02) = 0.10 \)

Normalized \( P(H|E) \):

- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \(\frac{0.08}{0.10} = 0.8\)
- Business Administration: \(\frac{0.02}{0.10} = 0.2\)

### Final Answer:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
