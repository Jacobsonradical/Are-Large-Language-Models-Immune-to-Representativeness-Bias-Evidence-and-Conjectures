Let's go through the calculations for each field, starting with Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll make some assumptions for the probabilities based on the personality sketch provided.

**For Business Administration:**
1. \( P(H) \) (the prior probability that Adam is in business administration): Given that business administration is a common field, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
2. \( P(E|H) \) (the likelihood of Adam's personality if he were in business administration): Given that the personality traits described are not typically associated with business administration, let’s assume \( P(E|H) = 0.05 \).
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) (the likelihood of Adam's personality if he were not in business administration): Given that we are comparing it with all other fields and knowing that some other fields might be more compatible, let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.15 \).

We'll need to find \( P(E) \), the total probability of the personality sketch \(E\) across all possible hypotheses. But since we only need relative probabilities here, we can proceed with the comparison using just the values given.

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)}
\]

**For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
1. \( P(H) \): Given that this field aligns well with Adam's personal interests, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
2. \( P(E|H) \): Since the personality traits perfectly match this field, let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given a general match across non-specific fields, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)}
\]

Normalizing these values:

For business administration: 

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.01}{P(E)}
\]

For agricultural and veterinary science:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{P(E)}
\]

To compare just these fields, we ignore \( P(E) \):

{
  "business administration": \(\frac{0.01}{0.08+0.01} \approx 0.1111\),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \(\frac{0.08}{0.08+0.01} \approx 0.8889\)
}

So the probabilities become:

{
  "business administration": 0.1111,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8889
}
