Sure, let's start by estimating the probabilities.

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam’s personality sketch is true given that he was enrolled in each field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that Adam’s personality sketch is true given that he was not enrolled in each field.

### Business Administration
- \( P(H)_{\text{business}} \): Business Administration is a common graduate program, so let's assume a moderate prior probability: 0.2.
- \( P(E|H)_{\text{business}} \): Adam's personality seems less aligned with Business Administration which typically attracts more extroverted and profit-oriented individuals. Let's set this low: 0.05.
- \( P(E|\neg H)_{\text{business}} \): There's a wider array of fields that might fit Adam's personality sketch better, so let's assume this probability is higher: 0.2.
  
Using Bayes' rule: \( P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \)

\[
P(\text{business} | E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business}) \cdot P(\text{business})}{P(E)}
\]

Let's assume \( P(E) \) is roughly the same for each, as we will compute relative probabilities:

\[
P(\text{business} | E) \approx \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = 0.01 / P(E)
\]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H)_{\text{agric-vet}} \): This is a less common field, so let's assign a moderate prior: 0.15.
- \( P(E|H)_{\text{agric-vet}} \): Adam's personality and interests fit well with Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Let's set this high: 0.8.
- \( P(E|\neg H)_{\text{agric-vet}} \): Considering the diversity of graduate fields, this likelihood should be moderate: 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule: 

\[
P(\text{agric-vet} | E) = \frac{P(E|\text{agric-vet}) \cdot P(\text{agric-vet})}{P(E)}
\]

\[
P(\text{agric-vet} | E) \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} = 0.12 / P(E)
\]

### Relative Probabilities
Given these approximate results, let's normalize them for proportional comparison:

- For business administration: \( \approx \frac{0.01}{0.13} \approx 0.076 \)
- For agricultural and veterinary science: \( \approx \frac{0.12}{0.13} \approx 0.923 \)

These values are proportionate within the context:

\[
{
  "business administration": \approx 0.076,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \approx 0.923
}
\]
