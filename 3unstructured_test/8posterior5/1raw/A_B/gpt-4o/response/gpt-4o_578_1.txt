Sure, let's go through the analysis step-by-step.

### Business Administration

1. **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration. Without additional information, we can consider an equal likelihood of enrollment in any field. Let’s assume P(H) = 0.1 for simplicity.
  
2. **P(E|H):** The probability that Adam exhibits these personality traits given that he is enrolled in business administration. Business administration students typically focus on leadership, management, and finance. The given personality sketch is not highly consistent with a typical business administration candidate, but these traits could still be present. Let us conservatively estimate P(E|H) ≈ 0.2.
  
3. **P(E|¬H):** The probability that Adam exhibits these personality traits given that he is not enrolled in business administration. Considering the sketch fits better with other fields like agricultural and veterinary science, we will give P(E|¬H) ≈ 0.5.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

But \( P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \).

\[
P(E) = (0.2 \times 0.1) + (0.5 \times 0.9) = 0.02 + 0.45 = 0.47
\]

Then,
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{0.47} \approx 0.0426
\]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Assume P(H) = 0.1.
  
2. **P(E|H):** The probability that Adam exhibits these personality traits given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. The personality sketch matched well with traits of students in this field. Let us estimate P(E|H) ≈ 0.8.
  
3. **P(E|¬H):** The probability that Adam exhibits these personality traits given that he is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Considering the sketch fits less well with fields other than agricultural and veterinary science, we will give P(E|¬H) ≈ 0.4.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

But \( P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \).

\[
P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.1) + (0.4 \times 0.9) = 0.08 + 0.36 = 0.44
\]

Then,
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.44} \approx 0.1818
\]

### Summary

Using the analysis above, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0426,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.1818
}
