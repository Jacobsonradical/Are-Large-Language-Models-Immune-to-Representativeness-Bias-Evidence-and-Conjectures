To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \), we use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, note that \( P(E) \) is a normalization factor and can be omitted when comparing the relative probabilities across different fields because we are not asked for absolute probabilities but for a comparison. Thus, we can simplify our calculations without explicitly computing \( P(E) \).

To proceed, we first need to estimate:

1. ** \( P(H) \) **: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field.
2. ** \( P(E|H) \) **: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in that field.
3. ** \( P(E|\neg H) \) **: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in that field.

Letâ€™s assign some reasonable estimates for these probabilities:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- ** \( P(H) \) **: Assume there is a moderate chance Adam could be in this field.
  \[ P(H) = 0.15 \]

- ** \( P(E|H) \) **: Since Adam has a love for nature, plants, and animals, this personality sketch fits very well with this field.
  \[ P(E|H) = 0.8 \]

- ** \( P(E|\neg H) \) **: Assuming that not being in agricultural and veterinary science means being in any other field, the likelihood of the personality sketch fitting those fields may be low to moderate.
  \[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \]

Using Bayes' Rule (ignoring \( P(E) \) for relative comparison):
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.15 = 0.12 \]

### Business Administration
- ** \( P(H) \) **: Assume there is a moderate chance Adam could be in this field.
  \[ P(H) = 0.20 \]

- ** \( P(E|H) \) **: The personality sketch of Adam having strong empathy and a warm heart, while helpful in business settings, does not align as strongly as with agricultural and veterinary science.
  \[ P(E|H) = 0.3 \]

- ** \( P(E|\neg H) \) **: Again, the likelihood of the personality sketch fitting other fields may be low to moderate.
  \[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \]

Using Bayes' Rule (ignoring \( P(E) \) for relative comparison):
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} \propto 0.3 \cdot 0.20 = 0.06 \]

### Summary
Comparing the relative results:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} = 0.12 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} = 0.06 \]

So, based on the above estimations and using Bayes' Rule:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.12,
  "business administration": 0.06
}
