To calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following probabilities: \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Here's a brief interpretation of these probabilities for applying Bayes' rule:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in the specific field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in the specific field.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be computed as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

### Business Administration
1. \( P(H) \): Let's assume a general prior probability for business administration among graduate students. This is a subjective estimate, say 0.2.
2. \( P(E|H) \): Given the personality sketch, it doesn't strongly align with typical traits desirable in business administration (e.g., leadership, negotiation). Let's estimate this at 0.1.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): Considering other fields, the sketch might fit better. Let's denote this as 0.6.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. \( P(H) \): Let's assume a prior probability for this field, which might be lower since it is a more specialized field. Let's say 0.1.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The personality sketch fits very well with this field. High empathy, love for animals, curiosity about nature, and plants are ideal traits. Let’s estimate this at 0.8.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): If not enrolled in this field, the sketch might fit less well. Let’s denote this as 0.3.

Now, applying Bayes' rule:

For Business Administration:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.6 \cdot 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.48 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.5 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.04 \]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(E) \text{ (recalculated)} = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.27 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.35 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.35} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.2286 \approx 0.23 \]

So, the final results are:

{
  "business administration": 0.04,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.23
}
