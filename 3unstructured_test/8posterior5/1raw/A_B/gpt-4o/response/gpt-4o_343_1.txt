To determine the probability of Adam being enrolled in each field given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Although we don't have exact numerical values, I will provide a qualitative assessment of the likelihoods. Let's break this down:

1. **Business Administration:**
   - P(H): The prior probability of a graduate student being in business administration is generally moderate because it's a common field.
   - P(E|H): The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given he is in business administration is relatively lower because his traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy, etc.) are not strongly associated with business administration.
   - P(E|¬H): The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given he is not in business administration is relatively higher as his traits relate more to fields focused on nature and animals.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - P(H): The prior probability of a graduate student being in agricultural and veterinary science is lower compared to business administration because it's a more specialized field.
   - P(E|H): The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given he is in agricultural and veterinary science is very high because his traits are a strong match for this field.
   - P(E|¬H): The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given he is not in agricultural and veterinary science is relatively lower.

Given these qualitative assessments, we deduce:
- P(E|business administration) is lower than P(E|¬business administration).
- P(E|agricultural and veterinary science) is higher than P(E|¬agricultural and veterinary science).

Using these qualitative assessments, we can reasonably infer:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}

These values reflect that, given Adam's personality sketch, he is much more likely to be in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration.
