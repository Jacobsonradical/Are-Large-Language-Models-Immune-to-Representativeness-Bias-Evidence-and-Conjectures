To address the given problem, I’ll begin by assessing the probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each hypothesis and then apply Bayes' rule to calculate \( P(H|E) \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **\( P(H) \) (Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science):**
   Since graduate students enroll in various fields, let's assume a modest prior probability:
   \[
   P(H) = 0.1
   \]

2. **\( P(E|H) \) (Probability of observing personality traits \( E \) given \( H \)):**
   Given Adam’s traits (love for nature, empathy for animals), these strongly align with Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
   \[
   P(E|H) = 0.9
   \]

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \) (Probability of observing personality traits \( E \) given not \( H \)):**
   For students not enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, the traits are less common. Still, some overlap may exist in other fields:
   \[
   P(E|\neg H) = 0.3
   \]

4. **\( P(H|E) \) (Posterior probability using Bayes' rule):**
   Using Bayes' theorem,
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   where,
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))
   \]
   \[
   P(E) = 0.9 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot (1 - 0.1) = 0.09 + 0.27 = 0.36
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{0.36} = \frac{0.09}{0.36} = 0.25
   \]

### Business Administration

1. **\( P(H) \) (Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in Business Administration):**
   Business Administration is a common field, so assume a moderate prior probability:
   \[
   P(H) = 0.2
   \]

2. **\( P(E|H) \) (Probability of observing personality traits \( E \) given \( H \)):**
   The personality traits seem weakly consistent (if at all) with Business Administration:
   \[
   P(E|H) = 0.2
   \]

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \) (Probability of observing personality traits \( E \) given not \( H \)):**
   In other fields where Business Administration is excluded, the traits might be more common than in Business Administration:
   \[
   P(E|\neg H) = 0.4
   \]

4. **\( P(H|E) \) (Posterior probability using Bayes' rule):**
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   where,
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))
   \]
   \[
   P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot (1 - 0.2) = 0.04 + 0.32 = 0.36
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.36} = \frac{0.04}{0.36} = 0.111
   \]

Thus, the calculated posterior probabilities \(P(H|E)\) are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.25,
  "business administration": 0.111
}
```
