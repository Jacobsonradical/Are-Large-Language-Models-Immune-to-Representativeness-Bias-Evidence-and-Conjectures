Sure, let's break down the process step-by-step using Bayes' Rule. Bayes' Rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, we'll assume \( P(E) \) is consistent across fields and not compute it directly, and instead focus on the relative values of \( P(H|E) \).

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science (Field 1):
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Given Adam's interests in nature, plants, and animals, there's a relatively high chance that he would be in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
   
   \[ P(H)_{\text{Field 1}} = 0.4 \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's described characteristics make it quite likely he would have these traits if he were studying Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
   
   \[ P(E|H)_{\text{Field 1}} = 0.9 \]

3. **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability that Adam would have these traits if he were in some other field (not Agricultural and Veterinary Science) is lower.
   
   \[ P(E|\neg H)_{\text{Field 1}} = 0.3 \]

Using Bayes' rule (and noting for proportionate comparisons):

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{Field 1}} \propto P(E|H)_{\text{Field 1}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{Field 1}} \]

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{Field 1}} \propto 0.9 \cdot 0.4 = 0.36 \]

### For Business Administration (Field 2):
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Given his quiet nature, love for puzzles, and empathy, it's relatively less likely, but not impossible, that Adam is in Business Administration.
   
   \[ P(H)_{\text{Field 2}} = 0.1 \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: It's less likely that Adamâ€™s traits directly align with Business Administration, but again, not impossible.

   \[ P(E|H)_{\text{Field 2}} = 0.4 \]

3. **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The chances that Adam displays these traits if he is not in Business Administration are higher since these are general positive traits applicable across various fields.
   
   \[ P(E|\neg H)_{\text{Field 2}} = 0.8 \]

Using Bayes' rule (and noting for proportionate comparisons):

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{Field 2}} \propto P(E|H)_{\text{Field 2}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{Field 2}} \]

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{Field 2}} \propto 0.4 \cdot 0.1 = 0.04 \]

### Summary of Results:
Here we will provide the normalized proportions for better clarity:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: 0.36
2. **Business Administration**: 0.04

For relative comparison,

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.36,
  "business administration": 0.04
}
```

These values imply that, given Adam's personality sketch, he is much more likely to be enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science than in Business Administration.
