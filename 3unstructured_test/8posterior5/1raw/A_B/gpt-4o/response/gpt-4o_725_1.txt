Sure, I'll provide the probabilities for each field based on the given personality sketch of Adam. Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, to simplify, we will not calculate \(P(E)\) as we are only comparing \(P(H|E)\) across the two fields.

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- **P(H)**: This is the prior probability of someone being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume the prior probability is moderately low, say 0.1, because not many graduate students choose this specialized field.
- **P(E|H)**: Given agricultural and veterinary science, the personality sketch matches well: a deep love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work. So, this probability would be high, let's assume 0.9.
- **P(E|¬H)**: This is the probability of the personality sketch \(E\) if Adam were not in agricultural and veterinary science. Given that the sketch also fits other fields (like environmental science, biology, etc.) that are not business administration, we can assume a moderate probability, say 0.5.

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.09 \]

### For Business Administration:
- **P(H)**: This is the prior probability of someone being enrolled in business administration. Let's assume this prior probability is higher, say 0.15, given that business administration is a popular field.
- **P(E|H)**: Given business administration, the personality sketch doesn't match as strongly. Traits like a love for animals, nature, and solving puzzles don't necessarily align with typical business traits. We might assume a lower probability, say 0.2.
- **P(E|¬H)**: Given not being in business administration, the personality sketch fitting agricultural and veterinary science or other fields would again merit a moderate probability, say 0.5.

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \cdot 0.15 = 0.03 \]

### Probabilities (normalized for comparison):
When comparing the values, we can see that 0.09 is higher than 0.03. Thus, Adam is more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science based on the given sketch.

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.25
}
```

(Note: These probabilities are relative to each other and are rescaled for clearer comparison, not exact numeric values derived from a full Bayesian calculation which would require the exact \( P(E) \) normalization factor.)
