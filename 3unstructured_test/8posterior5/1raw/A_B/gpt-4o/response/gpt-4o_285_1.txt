To use Bayes' Theorem to compute \( P(H|E) \) (the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch), we need to estimate the following:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality given that he was enrolled in the specific field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality given that he was not enrolled in the specific field.

We then use Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both hypotheses, we can compare the results directly.

Now let’s estimate these probabilities for each field.

### Business Administration
1. **\( P(H_{BA}) \)** - Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration. Business administration is a common field but might not be the most likely for someone with his interests. Let’s estimate this as \( 0.1 \).
2. **\( P(E|H_{BA}) \)** - Probability of observing Adam’s attributes if he was in Business Administration. Adam’s interest in nature, plants, animals, and puzzles, along with his empathy, might not strongly align with a business program. Let’s estimate this as \( 0.05 \).
3. **\( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \)** - Probability of observing Adam’s attributes if he was not in Business Administration. Assuming nature-oriented fields are more probable, we estimate this as \( 0.2 \).

Using Bayes’ Theorem:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = 0.005 / P(E) \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **\( P(H_{AV}) \)** - Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. This field strongly aligns with his interests. Let’s estimate this as \( 0.1 \).
2. **\( P(E|H_{AV}) \)** - Probability of observing Adam’s attributes if he was in Agriculture and Veterinary Science. Given Adam’s characteristics, this is very high. Let’s estimate this as \( 0.8 \).
3. **\( P(E|\neg H_{AV}) \)** - Probability of observing Adam’s attributes if he was not in Agriculture and Veterinary Science. Considerably lower if we assume other fields don’t align as well. Let’s estimate this as \( 0.05 \).

Using Bayes’ Theorem:
\[ P(H_{AV}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AV}) \cdot P(H_{AV})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = 0.08 / P(E) \]

Since we only need relative probabilities, we can compare \( \frac{0.005 / P(E)} \) and \( \frac{0.08 / P(E)} \):

- \( P(H_{BA}|E) = 0.005 \)
- \( P(H_{AV}|E) = 0.08 \)

Thus, the relative probabilities (not normalized) are:

{
  "business administration": 0.005,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08
}
