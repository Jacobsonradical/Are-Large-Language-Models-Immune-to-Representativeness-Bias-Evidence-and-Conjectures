First, let’s break down the provided information and make some logical estimations.

### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: The general probability that a graduate student might be studying agricultural and veterinary science might be relatively low compared to other more common fields (e.g., business, engineering). Suppose we estimate it at 0.05.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is studying this field seems high. His love for nature, plants, animals, empathy, and high intelligence fits well into this field. Let's assume this to be 0.8.
- **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is not studying agricultural and veterinary science is moderate because this mix of traits, while fitting well in agricultural studies, could also fit in some other fields. Let's assume 0.2.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.95 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.19 = 0.23 \]

So,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.23} \approx 0.1739 \]

### 2. Business Administration
- **P(H)**: The general probability that a graduate student might be studying business administration is relatively high, given its popularity. Suppose we estimate it at 0.2.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is studying this field seems lower. While empathy and intelligence fit, his love for nature and animals does not strongly correlate with business administration. Let's assume this to be 0.2.
- **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is not studying business administration could still be somewhat moderate as it fits better into other fields, such as agricultural sciences. Let's assume 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.24 = 0.28 \]

So,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.28} \approx 0.1429 \]

Now putting all this together:
