To solve this, we will use Bayes' theorem, which gives us the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\) as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For our purposes, we need to consider the hypotheses \(H_1\) and \(H_2\) where:

- \(H_1\) is the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \(H_2\) is the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

We will express \(P(E|H)\), \(P(E|\neg H)\), and \(P(H)\) for each hypothesis and then calculate \(P(H|E)\).

Let's assign some reasonable estimates:

### Business Administration:

- **Base Probability \(P(H)\)**: Assuming that a significant number of graduate students might enroll in business programs, we can assign a moderate prior probability. Let's say \(P(H_1) = 0.2\).

- **Probability of Observing Evidence \(P(E|H)\)**: Business administration doesn't typically align with strong empathy, deep love for animals, and curiosity about nature. Therefore, \(P(E|H_1)\) is likely low. Let's estimate \(P(E|H_1) = 0.05\).

- **Probability of Observing Evidence if Not Enrolled \(P(E|\neg H)\)**: This value combines all other fields, many of which (like natural sciences) would match Adam's traits well. Let's set \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.3\).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

- **Base Probability \(P(H)\)**: Fewer students might enroll, but Adam's traits strongly match this field. Let's say \(P(H_2) = 0.1\).

- **Probability of Observing Evidence \(P(E|H)\)**: Adam's traits fit well with agricultural and veterinary sciences. So, \(P(E|H_2)\) is high, perhaps \(P(E|H_2) = 0.8\).

- **Probability of Observing Evidence if Not Enrolled \(P(E|\neg H)\)**: Similar to above but accounting for non-matching with this field. Let's set \(P(E|\neg H_2) = 0.3\).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

### For Business Administration:

\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

Since \(P(E)\) is constant across both calculations, we can use the numerator values to simplify the relative probabilities:

- Business Administration: \(0.05 \cdot 0.2 = 0.01\)
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \(0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08\)

Now we normalize these values to get the posterior probabilities:

\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.08} = \frac{0.01}{0.09} \approx 0.111 \]
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.01 + 0.08} = \frac{0.08}{0.09} \approx 0.889 \]

So, the final probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.111,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.889
}
```

These values suggest that, given Adam's personality sketch, it is much more likely that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration.
