To calculate the probabilities, we need to set some assumptions for the base rates and likelihoods, as detailed data isn't provided. We'll assume some rough estimates based on the personality sketch of Adam.

### Definitions and Assumptions:
- P(H) denotes the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the specific field (business administration or agricultural and veterinary science).
- P(E|H) denotes the conditional probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in the specific field.
- P(E|\neg H) denotes the conditional probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in the specific field.

Let's go through each hypothesis step-by-step.

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: Business administration is a popular field but might not be as common for someone with a deep love for animals and nature. Let's make an approximate estimate of P(H) = 0.2.
- **P(E|H)**: Given someone is in business administration, the likelihood they have the personality described (curiosity about nature, love for animals, solving puzzles) is probably low, as these traits are less typical for this field. Therefore, P(E|H) â‰ˆ 0.1.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Given someone is not in business administration, the likelihood they have this personality sketch could be relatively higher, especially due to other suitable fields (like natural sciences, veterinary sciences). Let's assume P(E|\neg H) = 0.3.

Applying Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) = 0.02 + 0.24 = 0.26 \]

So,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.26} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.26} \approx 0.077 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: This field seems to align well with Adam's personality sketch, so let's assume P(H) = 0.3.
- **P(E|H)**: Given someone is in agricultural and veterinary science, the likelihood of having Adam's personality traits is quite high. Let's assign P(E|H) = 0.8.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Given someone is not in agricultural and veterinary science, the likelihood of having these traits may be lower. Let's assume P(E|\neg H) = 0.2.

Applying Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.3) + (0.2 \cdot 0.7) = 0.24 + 0.14 = 0.38 \]

So,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.3}{0.38} \approx \frac{0.24}{0.38} \approx 0.632 \]

Given these calculations, here is the final answer:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.077,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.632
}
```

These values suggest that, based on the given personality sketch, it's much more likely that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration.
