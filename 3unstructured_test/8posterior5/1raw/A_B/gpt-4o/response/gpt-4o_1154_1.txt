To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we follow the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For each field, we'll estimate the necessary probabilities and use them to calculate \( P(H|E) \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):** Let's assume a rough estimate of the prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. For this exercise, let's assume:

\[ P(H_{\text{AGV}}) = 0.10 \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** Given Adam's personality sketch, it is highly likely that he would be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science because of his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication:

\[ P(E|H_{\text{AGV}}) = 0.90 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):** This is the probability of observing the sketch given that Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's estimate this as relatively lower:

\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{AGV}}) = 0.10 \]

4. **Calculate \( P(E) \):** The overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch, estimated as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{AGV}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AGV}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{AGV}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{AGV}}) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.90 \times 0.10) + (0.10 \times 0.90) = 0.09 + 0.09 = 0.18 \]

5. **Posterior Probability \( P(H|E) \):**

\[ P(H_{\text{AGV}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AGV}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AGV}})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_{\text{AGV}}|E) = \frac{0.90 \times 0.10}{0.18} = \frac{0.09}{0.18} = 0.50 \]

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):** We'll estimate the prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in business administration. Let's assume:

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.20 \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** Given Adam's personality sketch, it seems less likely but not impossible that he would be enrolled in business administration:

\[ P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.20 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):** This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is not in business administration. Let's assume:

\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.15 \]

4. **Calculate \( P(E) \):**

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.20 \times 0.20) + (0.15 \times 0.80) = 0.04 + 0.12 = 0.16 \]

5. **Posterior Probability \( P(H|E) \):**

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.20 \times 0.20}{0.16} = \frac{0.04}{0.16} = 0.25 \]

### Summary
Using the above calculations, the posterior probabilities are:
