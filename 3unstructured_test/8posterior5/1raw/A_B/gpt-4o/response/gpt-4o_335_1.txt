To estimate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \) - The prior probability of enrolling in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \) - The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given enrollment in field \( H \).
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given not enrollment in field \( H \).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
We can simplify this to:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given that the total doesn't need to add up to 1, we don't need to compute \( P(E) \). Instead, we focus on the proportional relationship.

### Hypotheses
- \( H_{\text{agricultural}} \): Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( H_{\text{business}} \): Adam was enrolled in business administration.

### Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)
- \( P(H_{\text{agricultural}}) \): Let's assume a higher baseline probability for Adam enrolling in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality traits.
- \( P(H_{\text{business}}) \): Let's assume a lower baseline probability for Adam enrolling in business administration given that his traits seem less aligned with this field.

Assume \( P(H_{\text{agricultural}}) = 0.3 \) and \( P(H_{\text{business}}) = 0.1 \).

### Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural}}) \): With Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, appreciation for hard work, and curiosity about nature, this likelihood should be high.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \): With Adam's personality traits (especially the empathy and love for animals), it seems less likely that he would end up in business administration.

Assigning values:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural}}) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) = 0.2 \)

### Complementary Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural}}) \): Likelihood of seeing such a personality sketch outside of agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}}) \): Likelihood of seeing such a personality sketch outside of business administration.

We use a lower likelihood comparison:
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural}}) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}}) = 0.5 \)

### Posterior Calculation
Using these estimates in Bayes' rule:

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{agricultural}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural}}) \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural}}|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \]

For business administration:
\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}}) \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.1 = 0.02 \]

These values give us a proportional understanding of the likelihood of Adam being in each field based on his personality sketch.

### Final Answer

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.24,
  "business administration": 0.02
}
