To solve this problem using Bayes' theorem, let's denote:

- \(P(H)\) as the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
- \(P(E|H)\) as the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in the given field.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\) as the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in the given field.
- \(P(H|E)\) as the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field given his personality sketch.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \(P(E)\) is a normalization constant and can be ignored since we are only interested in comparing the relative probabilities.

### For Business Administration:

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H_{\text{BA}})\)**: The probability that any given graduate student might be in business administration. Let's assume it's 0.2 (20%) for this exercise from general population data.
2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H_{\text{BA}})\)**: Given Adam's traits, the likelihood he is in business administration might be relatively low because the traits don't strongly align with typical business administration characteristics. Let's set it to 0.05.
3. **Complement Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}})\)**: The probability that Adam displays these traits if he is not in business administration. Considering fields like agricultural and veterinary science might be more fitting, let's assume it's 0.95.

Using these values, let's compute the posterior probability:

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H_{\text{AV}})\)**: The probability that any given graduate student might be in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume it's 0.1 (10%) from general population data.
2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H_{\text{AV}})\)**: Given Adam's traits, the likelihood is quite high because the traits strongly align with agricultural and veterinary science characteristics. Let's set it to 0.8.
3. **Complement Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{AV}})\)**: The probability that Adam displays these traits if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Considering many fields don't match as closely, let’s assume it’s 0.2.

\[ P(H_{\text{AV}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

Since \(P(E)\) is the same for both, we can ignore it for the purpose of comparing the two hypotheses. 

Now, normalizing the results:

- Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \propto 0.05 \cdot 0.2 = 0.01 \]

- Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{AV}}|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]

### Result:

{
  "business administration": 0.01,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08
}

This calculation illustrates that given Adam's personality sketch, he is more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration.
