To accurately compute \( P(H|E) \), we'll use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the qualitative information about Adam, we can make reasonable assumptions for the probabilities involved. While exact values are unknowable without specific data, we can approximate based on logical understanding.

Let's denote:

- \( H_1 \): Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( H_2 \): Adam was enrolled in business administration.

### Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \):

Given there's no specific information about the distribution of graduate students among different fields in 2021, let's assume some generic priors:

\[ P(H_1) = 0.1 \]
\[ P(H_2) = 0.1 \]

### Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):

We'll assess how well each field aligns with Adam's personality sketch.

1. **Agricultural and veterinary science**:
   - Curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align well.
   
   So,
   \[ P(E|H_1) = 0.8 \]

2. **Business administration**:
   - Interests and personality traits like solving puzzles and high intelligence can apply somewhat, but there is no specific link to nature, plants, or animals.
   
   So,
   \[ P(E|H_2) = 0.2 \]

### Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):

This represents the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is NOT enrolled in the specified field. We will approximate this considering the variety of other fields he could have been in.

Let's assume:
\[ P(E|\neg H_1) = 0.3 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H_2) = 0.7 \]

### Posterior Probability \( P(H|E) \):

We need \( P(E) \) for both computations. Assuming only agricultural and veterinary science, and business administration are the options (for simplicity):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) + P(E|\neg H_1) \cdot P(\neg H_1) + P(E|\neg H_2) \cdot P(\neg H_2) \]

However, we simplify \( P(E) \):
- Assuming \( P(E) \approx 0.5 \) as a fair estimate for normalization (balancing the observed likelihoods).

Now, calculate \( P(H|E) \):

1. **Agricultural and veterinary science**:
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.5} = 0.16 \]

2. **Business administration**:
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.5} = 0.04 \]

Thus, perceptively,

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.16",
  "business administration": "0.04"
}

This suggests Adam is more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science based on his personality sketch.
