To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field given Adam's personality sketch \( E \), we need to assess the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \). Finally, we use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \).

### Step-by-step Calculation:

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - P(H): The probability Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science before considering the personality sketch.
   - Let's assume the prior probability for agricultural and veterinary science is relatively low given the diversity of fields. For illustration, let's assign:
     \( P(H_{\text{ag}}) = 0.10 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - P(E|H): The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is in this field.
   - Considering Adam's love for nature, plants, animals, curiosity about nature, and empathy, the likelihood that he is in agricultural and veterinary science is quite high. Let's assign:
     \( P(E|H_{\text{ag}}) = 0.7 \)

3. **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - P(E|\neg H): The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not in this field.
   - Considering that some of Adam's characteristics might align with other fields but not as strongly, let's assign:
     \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{ag}}) = 0.2 \)

#### Business Administration
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - P(H): The probability Adam was enrolled in business administration before considering the personality sketch.
   - This is a very common field, so we assign a higher prior probability:
     \( P(H_{\text{ba}}) = 0.20 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - P(E|H): The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is in this field.
   - Considering Adam's love for nature and empathy, this seems less likely for a typical business administration student. Let's assign:
     \( P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) = 0.15 \)

3. **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - P(E|\neg H): The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not in this field.
   - Many other fields might fit Adam's profile better, so:
     \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{ba}}) = 0.5 \)

### Applying Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{ag}}|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.1}{0.7 \times 0.1 + 0.2 \times 0.9} = \frac{0.07}{0.07 + 0.18} = \frac{0.07}{0.25} = 0.28
   \]

2. **Business Administration**:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{ba}}|E) = \frac{0.15 \times 0.2}{0.15 \times 0.2 + 0.5 \times 0.8} = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.4} = \frac{0.03}{0.43} \approx 0.07
   \]
