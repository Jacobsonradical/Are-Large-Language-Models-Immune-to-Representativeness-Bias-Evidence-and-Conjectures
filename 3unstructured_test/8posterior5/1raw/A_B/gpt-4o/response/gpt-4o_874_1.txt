To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we will first need to estimate three probabilities for each field: \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

**1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a randomly selected graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. Suppose this is \( 0.05 \) (5%).
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability that Adam has the described personality sketch if he is in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals, this is likely high. Let’s estimate \( 0.8 \) (80%).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability that Adam has the described personality sketch if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science, which might be lower because these traits align more with agricultural and veterinary fields. Let's estimate \( 0.2 \) (20%).

Using Bayes' rule: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.8 \times 0.05 + 0.2 \times 0.95} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.19} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.23} \approx 0.174 \]

**2. Business Administration**

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a randomly selected graduate student is in business administration. Suppose this is \( 0.2 \) (20%).
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability that Adam has the described personality sketch if he is in business administration. Given Adam's traits, this may be lower. Let’s estimate \( 0.1 \) (10%).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability that Adam has the described personality sketch if he is not in business administration. Let’s keep this \( 0.2 \) (20%).

Using Bayes' rule: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.1 \times 0.2 + 0.2 \times 0.8} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.16} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.18} \approx 0.111 \]

Final estimates:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.174,
  "business administration": 0.111
}
