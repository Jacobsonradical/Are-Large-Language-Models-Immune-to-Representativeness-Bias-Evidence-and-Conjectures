To calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we follow the steps of assessing the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the marginal likelihood \( P(E) \). In our simplified scenario, we'll compare the likelihoods for both fields and adjust the priors accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - \( P(H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science: Moderate probability considering Adam's characteristics (he loves nature, plants, and animals).
   - \( P(H) \) for business administration: Lower probability considering his characteristics (more aligned with science than business).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - \( P(E|H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science: High, as this field fits well with Adamâ€™s curiosity about nature, love for animals, and understanding of hard work.
   - \( P(E|H) \) for business administration: Low, as his traits do not strongly align with this field.

3. **Marginal Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - We need to account for the overall probability of Adam's personality sketch being consistent with other fields of study.

Given the provided probabilities are subjective, we'll consider:

### Values:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  - Prior probability \( P(H) \) = 0.4
  - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \) = 0.9
  - Marginal likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \) = 0.2

- **Business Administration**:
  - Prior probability \( P(H) \) = 0.1
  - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \) = 0.2
  - Marginal likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \) = 0.5

### Bayes' Rule Application:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of evidence:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

### Calculations:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  \[
  \begin{align*}
  P(E) &= (0.9 \cdot 0.4) + (0.2 \cdot (1 - 0.4)) \\
  &= 0.36 + 0.12 \\
  &= 0.48 \\
  P(H|E) &= \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.4}{0.48} \\
  &= \frac{0.36}{0.48} \\
  &= 0.75
  \end{align*}
  \]

- **Business Administration**:
  \[
  \begin{align*}
  P(E) &= (0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.5 \cdot (1 - 0.1)) \\
  &= 0.02 + 0.45 \\
  &= 0.47 \\
  P(H|E) &= \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.47} \\
  &= \frac{0.02}{0.47} \\
  &= 0.04255 \approx 0.04
  \end{align*}
  \]

### Result:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.04
}
