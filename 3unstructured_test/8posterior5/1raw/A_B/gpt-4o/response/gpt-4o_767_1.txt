Sure, let's work through the problem step by step using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

We need to provide values for the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: 
   - Let’s say \( P(H_{BA}) \) is somewhat moderate given the broad number of students in business: \( 0.15 \)

2. **P(E|H)**: 
   - The likelihood that a student in business administration has interests and traits like Adam's seems somewhat low, as business students are generally not known for a strong scientific or natural curiosity: \( 0.1 \)

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: 
   - The probability of Adam's traits given he is not studying business administration (includes all other fields not specified) might be moderately high due to inclusivity of other science-based fields: \( 0.8 \)

Let’s calculate:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: 
   - Let’s say \( P(H_{AVS}) \) is fairly low as this is a more specialized field: \( 0.05 \)

2. **P(E|H)**: 
   - The likelihood that a student in agricultural and veterinary science has Adam's traits is high as these interests align closely with the field: \( 0.9 \)

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: 
   - Re-using the generic other fields probability as above which encompasses several potential alternatives: \( 0.8 \)

Let’s calculate:

\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} \]

### Combined Calculation

Since \( P(E) \) is common in both and general form:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) + \text{probabilities of other fields} \]

For simplicity, we approximate \( P(E) \) based on the given context.

Direct Bayes formula calculation which favors probability ratios:

{
  "business administration": "Fairly low value, using rough base comparison, it’s about \frac{0.1 \times 0.15 }{0.1 \times 0.15 + 0.8 \times 0.8} = 0.01875 or approximate ~ 0.02 ",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "Mostly likely high around \frac{0.9 \times 0.05 }{0.9 \times 0.05 + 0.8 \times 0.8 } = 0.056 or approximate ~ 0.06"
}

These are approximated simplified for view indicating Adam’s predominant interest alignment with Agricultural/Veterinary. Further precision aligns construct constraints.

Overall values impact assumptions better refined:

{
  "business administration": "0.02",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.06"
}.
