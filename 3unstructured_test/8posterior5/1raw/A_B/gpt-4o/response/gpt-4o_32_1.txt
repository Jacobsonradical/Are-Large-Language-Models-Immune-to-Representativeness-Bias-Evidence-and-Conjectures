To apply Bayes' rule, we need to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) given the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the normalizing constant \( P(E) \). The general form of Bayes' rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's denote the various fields as \(H_a\) for agricultural and veterinary science and \(H_b\) for business administration.

We need to estimate:

1. \( P(H) \) — The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field.
2. \( P(E|H) \) — The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch would fit someone enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) — The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch would fit someone not enrolled in that field.

Assumptions:
- We assume a uniform prior, which means Adam is equally likely to be in any graduate program due to lack of additional information. 
- \( P(E|H) \) will be estimated based on how well the personality sketch fits the typical student profile of that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is harder to estimate exactly and can vary. However, in the absence of exact values, we will assume a baseline likelihood. 

#### For agricultural and veterinary science:
1. **Prior probability \( P(H_a) \)**: Given a uniform prior:
   \[ P(H_a) = 0.5 \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_a) \)**: High because Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as empathy and a warm heart, align well with this field.
   \[ P(E|H_a) = 0.8 \]

3. **Complement likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_a) \)**: Moderate for the other fields.
   \[ P(E|\neg H_a) = 0.3 \]

Bayes rule calculation for agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H_a|E) = \frac{P(E|H_a) P(H_a)}{P(E)} \]
Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_a) P(H_a) + P(E|\neg H_a) P(\neg H_a) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.3 \times 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.15 = 0.55 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H_a|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.55} = \frac{0.4}{0.55} \approx 0.727 \]

#### For business administration:
1. **Prior probability \( P(H_b) \)**: Given a uniform prior:
   \[ P(H_b) = 0.5 \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_b) \)**: Significantly lower because the personality sketch does not strongly align with typical business-oriented traits.
   \[ P(E|H_b) = 0.2 \]

3. **Complement likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_b) \)**: Moderate for the other fields.
   \[ P(E|\neg H_b) = 0.3 \]

Bayes rule calculation for business administration:
\[ P(H_b|E) = \frac{P(E|H_b) P(H_b)}{P(E)} \]
Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_b) P(H_b) + P(E|\neg H_b) P(\neg H_b) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \times 0.5) + (0.3 \times 0.5) = 0.1 + 0.15 = 0.25 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H_b|E) \approx \frac{0.2 \times 0.5}{0.25} = \frac{0.1}{0.25} = 0.4 \]

Hence, the resulting probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.727,
  "business administration": 0.4
