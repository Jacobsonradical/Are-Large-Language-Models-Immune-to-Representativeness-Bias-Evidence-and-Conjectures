Sure, let's go through the Bayes' theorem application step by step for each field. We need to estimate:

1. **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
2. **P(E|H):** The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is in a particular field.
3. **P(E|¬H):** The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is not in that particular field.
4. **P(H|E):** The posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in that field given his personality traits.

### Field 1: Business Administration

#### Step-by-Step:
1. **P(H) – Prior Probability:**
   - Let's assume the prior probability \( P(H) \) of Adam being in Business Administration is relatively common among graduate students. For simplicity, suppose \( P(H) = 0.2 \) (20%).

2. **P(E|H) – Likelihood:**
   - The personality traits described (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, etc.) are less typical for Business Administration students. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \) (10%).

3. **P(E|¬H) – Likelihood without H:**
   - Given the diverse backgrounds of other fields, the probability of these traits showing up in any field excluding Business Administration might be higher. Let's estimate \( P(E|¬H) = 0.4 \) (40%).

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H)}
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{(0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.4 \cdot 0.8)} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.32} = \frac{0.02}{0.34} \approx 0.059
\]

### Field 2: Agricultural and Veterinary Science

#### Step-by-Step:
1. **P(H) – Prior Probability:**
   - The prior probability \( P(H) \) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science could be lower among the total population of graduate students. Suppose \( P(H) = 0.1 \) (10%).

2. **P(E|H) – Likelihood:**
   - The personality traits (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, etc.) are much more aligned with students in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \) (70%).

3. **P(E|¬H) – Likelihood without H:**
   - Given the same reasoning as above, let's estimate \( P(E|¬H) = 0.4 \) (40%).

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H)}
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{(0.7 \cdot 0.1) + (0.4 \cdot 0.9)} = \frac{0.07}{0.07 + 0.36} = \frac{0.07}{0.43} \approx 0.163
\]
