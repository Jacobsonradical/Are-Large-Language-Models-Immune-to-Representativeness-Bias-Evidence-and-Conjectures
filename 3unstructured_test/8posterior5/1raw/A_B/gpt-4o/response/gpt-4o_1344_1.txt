To utilize Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, we first need to estimate the relevant probabilities: \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Here's how we might think about these values:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: Business Administration is a common field, so let's assume a moderate prior probability. For simplicity, let's take \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
   - **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's personality sketch, it seems unlikely that someone with a deep love for nature, animals, and abstract problem-solving would be in business administration. Let's assign a low likelihood. Assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
   - **Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is the probability that we would observe Adam's traits in someone not studying business administration. With many other fields fitting better, let's assign a higher likelihood. Assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.8 \).

    By Bayes' rule:
    \[
    P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
    \]
    where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

    Let's calculate \( P(E) \):
    \[
    P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.2) + (0.8 \times 0.8) = 0.02 + 0.64 = 0.66
    \]
    Now we compute \( P(H|E) \):
    \[
    P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.66} = \frac{0.02}{0.66} \approx 0.0303
    \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: Agricultural and Veterinary Science is less common than business administration, but let's assume it's still plausible with a prior probability. Assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).
   - **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam’s characteristics, it’s highly likely that he would be in this field. Assign a high likelihood. Assume \( P(E|H) = 0.95 \).
   - **Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is the probability that we would observe Adam's traits in someone not studying agricultural and veterinary science. Given his specific traits, it's lower compared to fields outside this specialization. Assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

    By Bayes' rule:
    Let's calculate \( P(E) \):
    \[
    P(E) = (0.95 \times 0.05) + (0.4 \times 0.95) = 0.0475 + 0.38 = 0.4275
    \]
    Now we compute \( P(H|E) \):
    \[
    P(H|E) = \frac{0.95 \times 0.05}{0.4275} = \frac{0.0475}{0.4275} \approx 0.1111
    \]

Therefore, the results are:

{
  "business administration": 0.0303,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.1111
}
