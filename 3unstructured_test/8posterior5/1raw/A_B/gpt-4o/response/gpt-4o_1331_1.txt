To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' Theorem, which is stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability of hypothesis H given evidence E.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of evidence E given hypothesis H.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis H.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of evidence E.

Let's do this step-by-step for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

   - **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume this field is relatively uncommon among graduate students, so we'll estimate it as \( P(H) = 0.05 \).
   - **P(E|H):** The probability of the evidence (Adam's personality sketch) given he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his love for nature, animals, and plants, we'll estimate this as \( P(E|H) = 0.80 \).
   - **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of the evidence given he was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Since his interests could align with a range of other fields as well, we'll estimate this as \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.10 \).

   Using Bayes' rule:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)}
   \]
   Now, we need to compute \( P(E) \):
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
   \]
   \[
   P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.05) + (0.10 \cdot 0.95) = 0.04 + 0.095 = 0.135
   \]

   So:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.135} \approx 0.2963
   \]

2. **Business Administration:**

   - **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. This field is quite common, so we'll estimate it as \( P(H) = 0.20 \).
   - **P(E|H):** The probability of the evidence (Adam's personality sketch) given he was enrolled in business administration. Given the description, it's less likely but possible, so we'll estimate this as \( P(E|H) = 0.10 \).
   - **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of the evidence given he was not enrolled in business administration. We'll assume it remains \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.10 \).

   Using Bayes' rule:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.10 \cdot 0.20}{P(E)}
   \]

   We already have \( P(E) \) from the previous calculation:
   \[
   P(E) = 0.135
   \]

   So:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.135} \approx 0.1481
   \]

In conclusion:

\[ 
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.2963,
  "business administration": 0.1481
} 
\]
