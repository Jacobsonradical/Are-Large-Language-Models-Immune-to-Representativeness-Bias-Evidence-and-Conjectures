To solve this using Bayes' rule, we need to calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field, given the evidence \( E \). Bayes' rule is \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \).

Let's denote:
- \( P(H_b) \) as the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(H_a) \) as the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H_b) \) as the probability of the evidence given that Adam was in business administration.
- \( P(E|H_a) \) as the probability of the evidence given that Adam was in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H_b) \) as the probability of the evidence given that Adam was not in business administration.
- \( P(E|\neg H_a) \) as the probability of the evidence given that Adam was not in agricultural and veterinary science.

Since we don't have exact numerical values, we will estimate the probabilities based on reasonableness.

Let's break it down:

### Business Administration

1. **Prior probability \( P(H_b) \):**
   Reasonable estimate: 0.1 (10%)
   
2. **\( P(E|H_b) \):**
   Given Adam's interests and personality, the probability that he would exhibit those characteristics if he was in business administration is relatively low.
   Estimate: 0.1 (10%)

3. **\( P(E|\neg H_b) \):**
   Considering all other fields, the probability that Adam exhibits those characteristics not being in business administration is higher.
   Estimate: 0.5 (50%)

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior probability \( P(H_a) \):**
   Reasonable estimate: 0.1 (10%)
   
2. **\( P(E|H_a) \):**
   Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, animals, and empathy, the probability of the evidence given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is very high.
   Estimate: 0.8 (80%)

3. **\( P(E|\neg H_a) \):**
   Considering all other fields, the probability that Adam exhibits those characteristics not being in agricultural and veterinary science is lower.
   Estimate: 0.3 (30%)

Although we don't have the exact value of \( P(E) \), it can be factored out when comparing the two hypotheses since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant. We'll calculate the unnormalized posterior and then normalize them.
 
Using Bayes' Rule:

1. **For business administration (H_b):**
\[ P(H_b|E) \propto P(E|H_b) \times P(H_b) \]
\[ P(H_b|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.1 \ = 0.01 \]

2. **For agricultural and veterinary science (H_a):**
\[ P(H_a|E) \propto P(E|H_a) \times P(H_a) \]
\[ P(H_a|E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.1 \ = 0.08 \]

Normalization:

To find the normalized probabilities, we sum the unnormalized posteriors:
\[ \text{Sum} = 0.01 + 0.08 = 0.09 \]

Then, we divide each term by the sum to get the posterior probabilities:
\[ P(H_b|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.09} = \frac{1}{9} \approx 0.111 \]
\[ P(H_a|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.09} = \frac{8}{9} \approx 0.889 \]

Thus, the approximated posterior probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": 0.111,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.889
