To compute \(P(H|E)\), we use Bayes' rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since \(P(E)\) is the same for both fields and we are interested in comparing the two probabilities directly, we can simplify the calculation by comparing the numerator of Bayes' rule for each field.

Let's start by estimating the probabilities.

1. **Business Administration**
   - **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. For simplicity, let's assume a neutral prior of 0.1.
   - **P(E|H):** The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch corresponds to a business administration student. Given Adam's interest in nature, puzzles, and animals, this seems relatively low. We'll estimate this at 0.05.
   - **P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch for someone not in business administration. Given the broad range of other fields, we'll estimate this at 0.5.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's curiosity about nature and animals, we can reasonably assume this is more likely. Let's estimate this at 0.3.
   - **P(E|H):** The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch corresponds to an agricultural and veterinary science student. Given his interests, this seems high. We'll estimate this at 0.8.
   - **P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch for someone not in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his specific interests, we'll estimate this at 0.4.

Now, we can compute \( P(H|E) \) for both fields, but we can just use the relative comparison of \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for the purpose:

- **Business Administration:**
  \[ P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.05 \cdot 0.1 = 0.005 \]

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
  \[ P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \]

For the sake of completeness, we would also compare \( P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \) but our current comparisons are sufficient to determine the relative likelihoods.

Therefore, in relative terms:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.005,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.24
}
