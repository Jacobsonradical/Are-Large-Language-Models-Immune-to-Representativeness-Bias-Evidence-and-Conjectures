To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in either business administration or agricultural and veterinary science based on the personality sketch E provided, we can use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the field. \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing E given that H is true. \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing E given that H is not true. 

Firstly, we'll assign some reasonable values to these probabilities based on the information provided in the personality sketch.

### For Business Administration:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   Let's assume a lower prior probability for business administration given Adam's described attributes (e.g., curiosity about nature, empathy for animals), which do not strongly align with the typical traits associated with business administration.
   \[ P(H_{\text{business}}) = 0.1 \]

2. **Probability \( P(E|H) \) (Likelihood)**:
   The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch matches someone in business administration might be low given the description provided.
   \[ P(E|H_{\text{business}}) = 0.1 \]

3. **Probability \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   The probability of observing E for someone not in business administration could be relatively higher, considering the many other fields it could match.
   \[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}}) = 0.7 \]

Using Bayes Rule:
\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}})}{P(E)} \]

where,
\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{business}}) \]
\[ = 0.1 \times 0.1 + 0.7 \times 0.9 \]
\[ = 0.01 + 0.63 \]
\[ = 0.64 \]

Thus,
\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.1}{0.64} \approx 0.0156 \]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   Given Adam's actions and traits align well with this field, we'll assign a higher prior probability.
   \[ P(H_{\text{agriculture}}) = 0.3 \]

2. **Probability \( P(E|H) \) (Likelihood)**:
   Given the strong match between E and the typical individual in this field, we'll set a high probability.
   \[ P(E|H_{\text{agriculture}}) = 0.8 \]

3. **Probability \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   The probability of observing E for someone not in this field is relatively lower given the unique match.
   \[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{agriculture}}) = 0.2 \]

Using Bayes Rule:
\[ P(H_{\text{agriculture}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agriculture}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agriculture}})}{P(E)} \]

where,
\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H_{\text{agriculture}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agriculture}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{agriculture}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{agriculture}}) \]
\[ = 0.8 \times 0.3 + 0.2 \times 0.7 \]
\[ = 0.24 + 0.14 \]
\[ = 0.38 \]

Thus,
\[ P(H_{\text{agriculture}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.3}{0.38} \approx 0.6316 \]

Based on these calculations, the probabilities are as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0156,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6316
}
