To address this problem using Bayesian inference, we need to make educated guesses for the probabilities involved. Below are my estimates of the required probabilities for Bayesian updating:

1. \( P(H) \) - The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \) - The probability of observing the evidence (Adam's personality sketch) given that he was enrolled in the specified field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - The probability of observing the evidence given that he was not enrolled in the specific field.
4. \( P(H|E) \) - The updated probability that Adam was enrolled in the specific field given the evidence.

### Definitions

- \( H_{AVS} \): Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( H_{BA} \): Adam was enrolled in business administration.

Let's make educated guesses based on the information given:

1. **Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)**
   - \( P(H_{AVS}) \): Since fewer students enroll in agricultural and veterinary science compared to other fields, let's assume a prior probability of 0.05 (5%).
   - \( P(H_{BA}) \): More students enroll in business administration, so let's assume a prior probability of 0.15 (15%).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**
   - \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \): Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals highly aligns with agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assign a high probability of 0.9.
   - \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): Adam’s personality and interests don't align as closely with business administration. Let's assign a probability of 0.2.

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**
   - This is the probability of observing this personality sketch given that Adam was not in the specified field. Since there are many other fields, this likelihood should be spread across them:
     - For \( \neg H_{AVS} \): Other fields could display similar traits, but they might not as strongly align with the personality. Let's assume 0.3.
     - For \( \neg H_{BA} \): Given the number of fields and that business administration poorly matches the personality, let’s assume 0.8 for non-BA fields.

### Calculation using Bayes' Theorem

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \):

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- \( P(H_{AVS}) = 0.05 \)
- \( P(E|H_{AVS}) = 0.9 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(\neg H_{AVS}) = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95 \)

\[ P(E) = (0.9 \times 0.05) + (0.3 \times 0.95) = 0.045 + 0.285 = 0.33 \]

\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.05}{0.33} = \frac{0.045}{0.33} \approx 0.136 \]

#### Business Administration

- \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(\neg H_{BA}) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 \)

\[ P(E) = (0.2 \times 0.15) + (0.8 \times 0.85) = 0.03 + 0.68 = 0.71 \]

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.15}{0.71} = \frac{0.03}{0.71} \approx 0.042 \]

### Summary of Posterior Probabilities

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.136,
  "business administration": 0.042
}
```

These computed values give an idea of how likely it is that Adam is enrolled in each field, given his personality sketch. They suggest that it is more likely for Adam to be studying agricultural and veterinary science than business administration, though neither field is highly probable.
