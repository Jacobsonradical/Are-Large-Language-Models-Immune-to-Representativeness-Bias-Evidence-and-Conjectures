Let's compute the probabilities step-by-step for each field using Bayes' rule, which can be stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( H \) is the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in a given field.
- \( E \) is the evidence provided by the personality sketch.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen student is in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence assuming the hypothesis is true.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence given the hypothesis is false.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the evidence, which can be computed by marginalizing over all possible fields.

Since we are not explicitly given the prior probabilities or the exact likelihood values, we must make reasonable assumptions based on the given information. 

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

**Assumptions:**
- \( P(H) \): High, because Adam's characteristics align well with interests in animals and nature.
- \( P(E|H) \): High, because a graduate student in this field would likely possess the traits described (love for animals, curiosity about nature).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Lower, as these traits may not be as prevalent in other fields.

Using plausible values:
- \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \) (assuming a reasonable proportion of students might take this field)
- \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \) (high likelihood given the alignment with the field)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \) (traits might still be present, but less likely)

Given \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) = 0.16 + 0.24 = 0.4 \]

So,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{0.4} = \frac{0.16}{0.4} = 0.4 \]

### Business Administration

**Assumptions:**
- \( P(H) \): Lower, given Adam's characteristics don't strongly align with typical traits needed in business administration.
- \( P(E|H) \): Low, as the interest in nature and animals is less relevant to business administration.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Higher, as the traits could be present in many other fields not related to business.

Using plausible values:
- \( P(H) \approx 0.15 \) (assuming fewer students go into this field than the prior one)
- \( P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \) (lower likelihood given the misalignment with the field)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \) (traits might still be present in many other fields)

Given \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.15) + (0.4 \cdot 0.85) = 0.03 + 0.34 = 0.37 \]

So,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{0.37} = \frac{0.03}{0.37} \approx 0.081 \]

### Summary

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.081
}
```

Note: These values are illustrative and based on reasonable assumptions about probabilities in the absence of specific data. Different estimates for the priors and likelihoods could yield different results.
