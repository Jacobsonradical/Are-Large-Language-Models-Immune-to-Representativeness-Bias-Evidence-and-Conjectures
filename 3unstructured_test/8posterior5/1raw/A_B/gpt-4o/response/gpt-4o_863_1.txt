To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in each field given the personality sketch E, we can apply Bayes' rule, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch (which can be broken into \( P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \)).

Since \( P(E) \) is common in both calculations and will cancel out when comparing the relative likelihoods, we can focus on determining relative values for \( P(H|E) \).

Let's make some reasonable assumptions and evaluations:

1. **Prior Probabilities \(P(H)\):**
   - The probability that any given graduate student might be in business administration is relatively higher due to its popularity.
   - The probability that any given graduate student might be in agricultural and veterinary science is lower considering the specific interest but it reflects Adam's apparent interests.

   So, for simplicity, let's assume:
   - \( P(H_{BA}) \text{ (business administration)} = 0.2 \)
   - \( P(H_{AVS}) \text{ (agricultural and veterinary science)} = 0.05 \)

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\) and \(P(E|\neg H)\):**
   - If Adam were enrolled in business administration, the likelihood of him having such a personality sketch is lower since the field typically attracts individuals with different traits.
   - If Adam were enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, the likelihood of him having such a personality sketch is significantly higher given his interests in nature, animals, and empathy.

   Let's estimate:
   - \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.1 \) (because business administration does not align strongly with his traits)
   - \( P(E|H_{AVS}) = 0.8 \) (because this aligns very well with his traits)
   - Negation likelihood:
     - \( P(E| \neg H_{BA}) = 0.6 \)
     - \( P(E| \neg H_{AVS}) = 0.2 \)

3. **Posterior Probabilities \(P(H|E)\):**
   - Use Bayes' rule for calculation:

   For Business Administration:
   \[
   P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)}
   \]
   And \( P(E) \) cancels out when comparing fields directly. Hence:
   \[
   P(H_{BA}|E) \propto P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})
   \]
   \[
   P(H_{BA}|E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02
   \]

   For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
   \[
   P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)}
   \]
   \[
   P(H_{AVS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})
   \]
   \[
   P(H_{AVS}|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04
   \]

So, by comparing the relative values to each other:

\[
P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.04} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.33
\]
\[
P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.02 + 0.04} = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.67
\]

{
  "business administration": 0.33,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.67
