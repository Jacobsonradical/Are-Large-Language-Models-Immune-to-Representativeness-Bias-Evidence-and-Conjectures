To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \) - The prior probability of hypothesis \( H \) (the field in which Adam might be enrolled).
2. \( P(E|H) \) - The probability of observing evidence \( E \) given that hypothesis \( H \) is true.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - The probability of observing evidence \( E \) given that hypothesis \( H \) is not true.
4. \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \) - The overall probability of observing evidence \( E \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

### Analysis for Business Administration:
- **\( P(H_{business}) \)**:
  Since many students enroll in business administration programs, we can assume a moderate prior probability, let's say \( P(H_{business}) = 0.2 \).

- **\( P(E|H_{business}) \)**:
  Business administration students are generally expected to have interests in leadership, management, and economics rather than nature, animals, or puzzles. So, \( P(E|H_{business}) \) would be low, let's say \( 0.05 \).

- **\( P(E|\neg H_{business}) \)**:
  The evidence \( E \) (Adam's personality sketch) suggests interests more aligned with other fields, so \( P(E|\neg H_{business}) \) might be higher. Given the multitude of other fields, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{business}) = 0.2 \).

### Calculation for Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{business}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{business}) \cdot P(H_{business})}{P(E|H_{business}) \cdot P(H_{business}) + P(E|\neg H_{business}) \cdot P(\neg H_{business})} \]

\[ P(H_{business}|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.2}{0.05 \cdot 0.2 + 0.2 \cdot 0.8} \]

\[ P(H_{business}|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.16} \]

\[ P(H_{business}|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.17} \approx 0.059 \]

### Analysis for Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- **\( P(H_{agri-vet}) \)**:
  Given that agricultural and veterinary sciences are less commonly pursued than business administration but still substantial, let's assign \( P(H_{agri-vet}) = 0.1 \).

- **\( P(E|H_{agri-vet}) \)**:
  Adam's interests strongly align with agricultural and veterinary science, so \( P(E|H_{agri-vet}) \) should be high, let's say \( 0.8 \).

- **\( P(E|\neg H_{agri-vet}) \)**:
  Since the evidence fits well with this field, \( P(E|\neg H_{agri-vet}) \) will be lower, let's assume \( 0.15 \).

### Calculation for Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_{agri-vet}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{agri-vet}) \cdot P(H_{agri-vet})}{P(E|H_{agri-vet}) \cdot P(H_{agri-vet}) + P(E|\neg H_{agri-vet}) \cdot P(\neg H_{agri-vet})} \]

\[ P(H_{agri-vet}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.15 \cdot 0.9} \]

\[ P(H_{agri-vet}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.135} \]

\[ P(H_{agri-vet}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.215} \approx 0.372 \]

### Result:
{
  "business administration": 0.059,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.372
}
