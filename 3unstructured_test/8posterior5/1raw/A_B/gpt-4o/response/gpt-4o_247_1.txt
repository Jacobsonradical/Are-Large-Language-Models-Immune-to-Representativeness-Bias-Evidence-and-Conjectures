To apply Bayes' theorem \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \), we'll need to estimate the probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Let's denote:
- \( H_1 \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( H_2 \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in business administration.

We'll make rough estimates for these probabilities.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H_1) \): Prior probability based on general popularity of the field among all graduate students. Since agricultural and veterinary science is less common compared to business, we'll guess it might be around 5% (0.05).
   - \( P(E|H_1) \): Given Adam's strong affinity for nature, plants, and animals, it's very likely he'd match this description if he was in this fieldâ€”let's say around 80% (0.80).
   - \( P(E|\neg H_1) \): The probability of another field fitting this description could be lower because the sketch specifically matches agricultural and veterinary science well. Let's assume, generously, a 10% (0.10).

2. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H_2) \): Prior probability based on the popularity of this field among all graduate students. Business administration is very common, estimate it at around 20% (0.20).
   - \( P(E|H_2) \): However, Adam's personality sketch is less aligned with general traits of business administration students. Let's estimate it at 5% (0.05).
   - \( P(E|\neg H_2) \): This represents the probability of Adam's sketch coming from a non-business administration background. Let's assume the remaining percentage after excluding business fields, we'll estimate it at 15% (0.15).

Now let's compute \( P(H_1|E) \) and \( P(H_2|E) \):

For agricultural and veterinary science,
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]
Let's assume \(P(E)\) is a common normalizing factor and not calculate it explicitly since we are just comparing \( P(H_1|E) \) and \(P(H_2|E) \).

For \( H_1 \):
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.04}{P(E)} \]

For business administration,
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.20}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.01}{P(E)} \]

Even without computing the exact value of \(P(E)\), we can conclude that:
\[
P(H_1|E) \gg P(H_2|E)
\]

So, the relative probabilities (bringing them between 0 and 1 for simplicity):
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.80", 
  "business administration": "0.20"
}
