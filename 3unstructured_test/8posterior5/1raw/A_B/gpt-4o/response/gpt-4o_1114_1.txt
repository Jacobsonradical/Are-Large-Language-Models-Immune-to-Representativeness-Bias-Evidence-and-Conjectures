Let's break down the problem step by step using Bayes' theorem:

Bayes' theorem:  
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the fields we need to evaluate:

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H_agricultural)**: The general probability that a graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. In reality, a lower proportion of students might choose this field compared to business administration. Let's assume \( P(H_agricultural) = 0.05 \).

2. **P(E|H_agricultural)**: The probability of Adam having the described personality if he's in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's love for nature, animals, and a deep appreciation for hard work, it's highly consistent. Let's assume \( P(E|H_agricultural) = 0.9 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H_agricultural)**: The probability of Adam having the described personality if he's not in agricultural and veterinary science. This could be lower since the described personality fits agricultural and veterinary science quite well. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_agricultural) = 0.2 \).

Now we need to compute \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.9 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.95 = 0.045 + 0.19 = 0.235 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H_agricultural|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.235} = \frac{0.045}{0.235} \approx 0.191 \]

### For Business Administration
1. **P(H_business)**: The general probability that a graduate student is in business administration. This proportion is likely higher than agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume \( P(H_business) = 0.2 \).

2. **P(E|H_business)**: The probability of Adam having the described personality if he's in business administration. Adam's academic focus seems more aligned with nature and animals rather than business, so let's assume \( P(E|H_business) = 0.1 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H_business)**: The probability of Adam having the described personality if he's not in business administration. Since this personality aligns more with other fields like agricultural sciences, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_business) = 0.3 \).

Now we need to compute \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8 = 0.02 + 0.24 = 0.26 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H_business|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.26} = \frac{0.02}{0.26} \approx 0.077 \]

Putting it all together:
