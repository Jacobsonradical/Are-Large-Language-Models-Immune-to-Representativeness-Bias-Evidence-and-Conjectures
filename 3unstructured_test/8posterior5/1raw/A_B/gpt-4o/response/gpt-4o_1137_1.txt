To determine the conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' theorem, we apply the formula: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis.

We also use the total probability law:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

1. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H) \): Assume business administration is a fairly common graduate field, but probably less so for someone with Adam's described traits. Let's say \( P(H) = 0.05 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Traits like love for nature, interest in puzzles, empathy, and a love for animals do not align well with typical business administration student traits. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.02 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): For the rest of the fields, Adam's traits seem to fit better. So let's set \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).
   
   Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.02 \times 0.05}{(0.02 \times 0.05) + (0.2 \times 0.95)} = \frac{0.001}{0.001 + 0.19} = \frac{0.001}{0.191} \approx 0.0052
   \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): This field is more aligned with Adam's traits (interest in nature, plants, and animals). Let's say \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adamâ€™s traits are highly consistent with this field. So, \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): For the rest of the fields, his traits fit less well. Assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).
   
   Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{(0.8 \times 0.1) + (0.2 \times 0.9)} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.18} = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \approx 0.3077
   \]

Based on these calculations, the conditional probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0052,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3077
}
```
