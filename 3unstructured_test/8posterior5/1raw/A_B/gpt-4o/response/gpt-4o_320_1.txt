To determine \( P(H|E) \) for "agricultural and veterinary science" and "business administration," we need to gather some plausible estimates for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). 

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- \( P(H) \): The likelihood that any given graduate student is in this field. Let's assume it's moderately likely:
  - \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in this field. Given his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy, this is high.
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is not in this field. Since other fields could still fit some of Adam's traits, this value is considerably lower than \( P(E|H) \), but not zero.
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \)

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.1}{0.9 \times 0.1 + 0.2 \times 0.9} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.18} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.27} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.333 \]

### Business Administration:
- \( P(H) \): The likelihood that any given graduate student is in this field. This is typically a popular field.
  - \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in this field. Given his traits, this is not very high, as curiosity about nature and love for animals are not strongly associated.
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is not in this field. Given that many other fields could fit Adam's traits better:
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \)

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.1 \times 0.2 + 0.3 \times 0.8} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.24} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.077 \]

Here are the posterior probabilities:
