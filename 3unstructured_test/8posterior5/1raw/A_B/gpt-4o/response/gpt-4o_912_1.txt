To determine P(H|E) for each field, we'll need to estimate the prior probability P(H), the likelihood P(E|H), and the likelihood P(E|\neg H). Then we'll use Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior probability P(H|E).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)** (Prior Probability): Agricultural and veterinary science is a less common field than business administration, but it's not rare. A rough estimate could be that 10% of graduate students might be in this field.
   ```math
   P(H) ≈ 0.10 
   ```

2. **P(E|H)** (Likelihood if H is true):
   - Adam's personality and interests strongly align with this field. His curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals are highly compatible with agricultural and veterinary science.
   ```math
   P(E|H) ≈ 0.90
   ```

3. **P(E|\neg H)** (Likelihood if H is false):
   - If Adam were not in agricultural and veterinary science, his personality sketch might not fit as well with other random fields. It's less likely that his combination of traits perfectly matches another field.
   ```math
   P(E|\neg H) ≈ 0.30 
   ```

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)** (Prior Probability): Business administration is a very common field among graduate students. A rough estimate could be that 20% of graduate students are in this field.
   ```math
   P(H) ≈ 0.20
   ```

2. **P(E|H)** (Likelihood if H is true):
   - Adam's traits don’t strongly align with business administration. His interests in nature, empathy, and animals are not typically associated with this field.
   ```math
   P(E|H) ≈ 0.10
   ```

3. **P(E|\neg H)** (Likelihood if H is false):
   - If Adam were not in business administration, his combination of traits could still fit better with other fields, giving this a moderately low probability.
   ```math
   P(E|\neg H) ≈ 0.35
   ```

### Calculations

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

\[ P(E) = (0.90 \times 0.10) + (0.30 \times 0.90) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.09) + (0.27) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.36 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.90 \times 0.10}{0.36} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.36} \]
\[ P(H|E) ≈ 0.25 \]

#### Business Administration

\[ P(E) = (0.10 \times 0.20) + (0.35 \times 0.80) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.02) + (0.28) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.30 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.10 \times 0.20}{0.30} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.30} \]
\[ P(H|E) ≈ 0.067 \]

### Conclusion

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.25,
  "business administration": 0.067
}
```

This analysis suggests that it is significantly more likely that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration based on the given personality sketch.
