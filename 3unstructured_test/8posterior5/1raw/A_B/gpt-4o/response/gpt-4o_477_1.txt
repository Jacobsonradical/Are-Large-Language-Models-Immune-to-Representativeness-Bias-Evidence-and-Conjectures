To compute the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\), we can use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that \(P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)\), and assuming that the sum of the probabilities for the different fields adds up to 1, we need to estimate \(P(H)\), \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E|\neg H)\) for agricultural and veterinary science and business administration. We also assume that \( \neg H \) encompasses all other graduate fields.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \(P(H)\): Given Adam's deep love for animals, genuine curiosity about nature and plants, and high empathy, it's reasonable to assume a higher prior probability that he would be enrolled in this field. Let's estimate \(P(H) = 0.3\).
   - \(P(E|H)\): If Adam were in this field, it highly matches his personality sketch. Thus, \(P(E|H) = 0.8\).
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\): If Adam were not in this field, it's less likely he would have his described personality traits. Let's estimate \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.1\).

2. **Business Administration:**
   - \(P(H)\): Given Adam's traits, it's less likely he would be in a field that doesn't align as closely with his interest in nature, puzzles, and animals. Let's estimate \(P(H) = 0.1\).
   - \(P(E|H)\): If Adam were in this field, it doesnâ€™t quite match his personality traits. Thus, \(P(E|H) = 0.2\).
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\): If Adam were not in this field, given the wide range of other possible fields, the probability for his personality traits could still be less likely. We'll use \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.1\).

### Calculations:

For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.3) + (0.1 \cdot 0.7) = 0.24 + 0.07 = 0.31 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.3}{0.31} \approx 0.774 \]

For **business administration**:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.1 \cdot 0.9) = 0.02 + 0.09 = 0.11 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.11} \approx 0.182 \]
