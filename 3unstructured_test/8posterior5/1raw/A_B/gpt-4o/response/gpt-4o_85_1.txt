To determine the probabilities, we need to evaluate the likelihoods \(P(E|H)\) and \(P(E|\neg H)\) for each field, and use them along with the prior \(P(H)\) to apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given:

1. **Prior Probability** \(P(H)\): Let's assume no initial bias towards any specific field (without additional information, we could assume equal probability for any field).

2. **Likelihood** \(P(E|H)\): This is the probability of observing Adam's traits given that he is enrolled in the field. We evaluate this based on how well Adam's personality sketch matches typical attributes of graduates in the given field.

3. **Likelihood** \(P(E|\neg H)\): This is the probability of observing Adam's traits given that he is *not* enrolled in the field. It involves evaluating Adam's personality against the broader set of other possible fields.

Using these principles to evaluate each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS)

- **Prior (P(H))**: This could be relatively higher given his attributes related to nature, plants, and animals.
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: High, since his love for animals, nature, and strong empathy align well with typical characteristics of students in AVS.
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Lower, as the interest in nature and animals may be less emphasized in many other fields.

### Business Administration (BA)

- **Prior (P(H))**: Could be considered lower given his specific interests.
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: Low, since his traits such as strong empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature might not align as well with typical attributes of business administration students.
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Higher, as these traits could better match fields other than business administration.

### Quantitative estimates:

Without exact probabilities (numbers), let's assume:

- For AVS:
  - \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \)
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \)
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \)
  
- For BA:
  - \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \)
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \)
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.7 \)

Bayes' Rule application:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.16}{P(E)}
   \]

2. **Business Administration**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.02}{P(E)}
   \]

Since \(P(E)\) is common for normalization but not required for relative comparison:

\[
\frac{P(H|E)}{P(E)} \text{ for AVS} = 0.16
\]

\[
\frac{P(H|E)}{P(E)} \text{ for BA} = 0.02
\]

Relative probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.89 (approximate relative probability after normalization),
  "business administration": 0.11 (approximate relative probability after normalization)
}

Thus, Adam is much more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration, based on his personality sketch.
