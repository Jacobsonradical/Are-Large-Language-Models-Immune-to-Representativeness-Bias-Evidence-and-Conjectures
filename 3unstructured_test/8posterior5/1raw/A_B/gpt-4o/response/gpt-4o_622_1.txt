To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field, I will use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since \( P(E) \) is constant across comparisons, we can focus on finding the relative values of \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for each field, without needing its absolute value.

Firstly, let's denote:

- \( H_1 \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in "agricultural and veterinary science"
- \( H_2 \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in "business administration"

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **P(H):** Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in each field.

    - \( P(H_1) \): Agricultural and veterinary science.
      - Given Adam's personality sketch, it is reasonable to assume a higher prior probability for agricultural and veterinary science because these fields typically attract individuals who love nature, animals, and have empathy towards them.
      - Let's say \( P(H_1) = 0.3 \).
      
    - \( P(H_2) \): Business administration.
      - This field does not naturally align with Adam's empathy for animals and nature. Thus, we would expect a lower prior probability.
      - Let's say \( P(H_2) = 0.1 \).

2. **P(E|H):** Probability of Adam’s personality sketch given each field.

    - \( P(E|H_1) \): Probability that Adam has this personality sketch given he is in agricultural and veterinary science.
      - This is high, as the field matches Adam's love for nature, animals, and empathy.
      - Let's say \( P(E|H_1) = 0.8 \).
      
    - \( P(E|H_2) \): Probability that Adam has this personality sketch given he is in business administration.
      - This is low, as these traits are less correlated with business administration.
      - Let's say \( P(E|H_2) = 0.1 \).
      
3. **P(E|\neg H):** Probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is not enrolled in the field.

    - This is calculated more generally by considering that Adam may be in other fields not listed here. Generally, we focus on \( P(E|H) \) directly.

### Bayes' Rule Application

To find \( P(H|E) \), we assume \( P(E) \) is the normalizing constant. We focus on the numerator:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

For \( H_1 \):
\[ P(H_1|E) \propto P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \]

For \( H_2 \):
\[ P(H_2|E) \propto P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) = 0.1 \cdot 0.1 = 0.01 \]

Since we use proportional values, we just need to provide the numbers directly:

### Final Answer:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.24,
  "business administration": 0.01
}
```

These values are proportional to the posterior probabilities. If normalized over all possible fields, we’d find \( P(H|E) \) for those fields rescaled appropriately.
