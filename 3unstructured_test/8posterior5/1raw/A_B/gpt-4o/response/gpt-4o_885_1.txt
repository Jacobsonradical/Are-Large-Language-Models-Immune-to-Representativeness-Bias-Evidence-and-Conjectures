To calculate the probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, we'll use Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood that the personality sketch \( E \) fits given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood that the personality sketch fits given that Adam is not enrolled in that field.

### Hypothesis 1: Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This depends on general statistics of graduate enrollments. Let's assume a rough estimate:
   \[
   P(\text{business administration}) = 0.20
   \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Given the personality sketch that Adam enjoys nature, animals, and solving puzzles, a person like him would less likely be in business administration compared to some other field like agricultural and veterinary science:
   \[
   P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.05
   \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is the probability of the personality sketch given Adam is not in business administration. As this includes a broad range of other fields, let's estimate:
   \[
   P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) = 0.15
   \]

### Hypothesis 2: Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Let's assume a rough estimate based on enrollment statistics:
   \[
   P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.10
   \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's personality traits, he very well fits into agricultural and veterinary science:
   \[
   P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.7
   \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is the probability of the personality sketch given he's not in agricultural and veterinary science:
   \[
   P(E|\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.2
   \]

Now, let's compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)}
\]
\[
P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)}
\]

Since \( P(E) \) is same for both computations, it cancels out when comparing proportionality. We only need relative values for comparison.

Internal computations:

Business Administration:
\[
P(\text{business administration}|E) \propto P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) = 0.05 \cdot 0.20 = 0.01
\]

Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[
P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \propto P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.7 \cdot 0.10 = 0.07
\]

Given proportionality constants, normalized results approximately:

\[
P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.07} = \frac{0.01}{0.08} = 0.125
\]
\[
P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.07}{0.01 + 0.07} = \frac{0.07}{0.08} = 0.875
\]

So, the computed probabilities are:

\{
  "business administration": "0.125",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.875"
\}
