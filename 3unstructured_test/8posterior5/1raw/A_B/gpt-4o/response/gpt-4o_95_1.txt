Sure, let's go through the details and calculate \( P(H | E) \) for each hypothesis using Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is constant across the different hypotheses, it will cancel out in our comparative analysis. Therefore, we will assess the relative values of \( P(E | H) \cdot P(H) \).

1. **Business Administration:**

- \( P(H) \): Business administration is a common graduate field, but based on Adam's personality sketch, it's less likely that he would be drawn to a field significantly driven by abstract business concepts and financial studies, rather than natural sciences and empathy-driven fields. Let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \).

- \( P(E | H) \): The personality traits of curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work are not typically aligned with business administration. Thus, let's assume \( P(E | H) \approx 0.1 \).

- \( P(E | \neg H) \): Given that Adam's personality traits align more with natural sciences, \( P(E | \neg H) \) would be relatively higher. Let’s assume \( P(E | \neg H) \approx 0.8 \).

Thus, \( P(H | E) \propto P(E | H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \).

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

- \( P(H) \): Assuming that this is not the most common field but aligns well with Adam's personality traits, let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \).

- \( P(E | H) \): Adam's curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals are highly relevant to this field. Thus, \( P(E | H) \approx 0.9 \).

- \( P(E | \neg H) \): Given that Adam's personality traits are well-aligned with this field, \( P(E | \neg H) would be lower. Let’s assume \( P(E | \neg H) \approx 0.2 \).

Thus, \( P(H | E) \propto P(E | H) \cdot P(H) = 0.9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.09 \).

Now, we can normalize these values to get the relative probabilities:

- For business administration: 
\[ \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.09} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.11} \approx 0.18 \]

- For agricultural and veterinary science: 
\[ \frac{0.09}{0.02 + 0.09} \approx \frac{0.09}{0.11} \approx 0.82 \]

Therefore, the approximate probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.18,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.82
}
```
