To solve the problem using Bayes' rule, we need to understand the relevant probabilities:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being in a given field, before considering the personality sketch \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is in a given field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not in a given field.
- \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability of Adam being in a given field based on the personality sketch \( E \).

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We don't need to explicitly compute \( P(E) \) since we're only comparing the relative probabilities among the given fields and assuming they are independent of each other. Instead, we will directly compare the values of \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for each hypothesis.

Let's first assign rough values to \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) based on the given personality sketch of Adam.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H)_{\text{ag}} \): The prior probability of a graduate student being in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Let's assume this is not very high but greater than average because it's a niche field. Suppose \( P(H)_{\text{ag}} = 0.1 \).

- \( P(E|H)_{\text{ag}} \): Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, it's highly likely he'd be in this field. We can set \( P(E|H)_{\text{ag}} = 0.8 \).

- \( P(E|\neg H)_{\text{ag}} \): The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) occurring given Adam is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Because \( E \) strongly matches this field, let's assume it's less probable if he's not in this field. Suppose \( P(E|\neg H)_{\text{ag}} = 0.2 \).

### Business Administration
- \( P(H)_{\text{bus}} \): The prior probability of a graduate student being in Business Administration. This is higher than Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Suppose \( P(H)_{\text{bus}} = 0.2 \).

- \( P(E|H)_{\text{bus}} \): Given that Adam's personality sketch fits more with nature and empathy rather than business, the likelihood \( P(E|H)_{\text{bus}} \) should be relatively low. Suppose \( P(E|H)_{\text{bus}} = 0.1 \).

- \( P(E|\neg H)_{\text{bus}} \): The probability of the personality sketch occurring given Adam is not in Business Administration is higher because many fields other than Business Administration could match his personality. Suppose \( P(E|\neg H)_{\text{bus}} = 0.8 \).

Now we compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{ag}} \propto P(E|H)_{\text{ag}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{ag}} = 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{bus}} \propto P(E|H)_{\text{bus}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{bus}} = 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02 \]

Now normalize these values:

- Sum of the proportional probabilities: \( 0.08 + 0.02 = 0.10 \)
- Normalize:
  - \( P(H|E)_{\text{ag}} = \frac{0.08}{0.10} = 0.8 \)
  - \( P(H|E)_{\text{bus}} = \frac{0.02}{0.10} = 0.2 \)

So, the answer is:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
