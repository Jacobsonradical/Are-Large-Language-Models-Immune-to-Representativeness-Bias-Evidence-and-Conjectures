To estimate P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need to do the following steps:

1. Determine P(H): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field.
2. Determine P(E|H): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is in that field.
3. Determine P(E|\neg H): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is NOT in that field.
4. Compute P(H|E) using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that P(E) is relatively complex to compute without more information, we will focus on estimating the rest of the terms and using them relatively.

Let's go through each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: Since it's one of many possible fields, let's assume P(H) is relatively low, say 0.1 (10%).
2. **P(E|H)**: Adam's personality sketch aligns well with this field because of his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and understanding of hard work. Let's set P(E|H) high, say 0.8 (80%).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of this personality sketch occurring if Adam were not in this field could be considered moderate-to-low. Let's assume this is 0.2 (20%).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have a direct value for P(E), we'll compare it relatively:

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: Again, considering it as one of many possible fields, let's assume it has a typical prior of 0.1 (10%).
2. **P(E|H)**: Business administration is less aligned with Adam's personality sketch, particularly his specific interests and hobbies. Let's set P(E|H) lower, say 0.2 (20%).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch occurring if he were not in business administration could be considered moderate, similar to above. Let's assume this is 0.2 (20%), the same as previously.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

Comparatively:

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.1 = 0.02 \]

### Summary

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08,
  "business administration": 0.02
}

Note: These numbers are relative and conditional on our assumptions for the prior probabilities and likelihoods. They do not add up to 1 by design, as they are meant to compare the relative likelihoods given the same evidence.
