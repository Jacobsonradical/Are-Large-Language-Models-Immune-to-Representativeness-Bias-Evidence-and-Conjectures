To compute P(H|E), which is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given the personality sketch E, we will use Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule is given by the equation:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(H|E)\) = the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- \(P(E|H)\) = the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis
- \(P(H)\) = the prior probability of the hypothesis
- \(P(E)\) = the probability of the evidence

Given the following personality traits of Adam and considering the fit of these traits to the fields of business administration and agricultural and veterinary science:

**Business administration:**
- P(H) (prior) – It's a general estimate of the proportion of graduate students studying business administration. Let’s assume P(H) = 0.2.
- P(E|H) (likelihood) – Given Adam’s traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy), these qualities are not particularly aligned with business administration but rather specialized typically towards other fields. Therefore, let's assume P(E|H) = 0.1.
- P(E|¬H) (likelihood of evidence given not business administration) – Considering other fields, his traits align better with them rather than business administration. Let’s assign a value of P(E|¬H) = 0.7.

**Agricultural and veterinary science:**
- P(H) (prior) – Let’s assume P(H) = 0.1 as fewer people pursue this compared to business administration generally.
- P(E|H) (likelihood) – Adam's personality sketch fits strongly with agriculture and veterinary science given his curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals. So, let’s assign P(E|H) = 0.7.
- P(E|¬H) – For individuals not in this field, these traits are less common. Let’s assign P(E|¬H) = 0.3.

Given these assumptions, let’s compute \(P(H|E)\):

### Business Administration:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.1 * 0.2 + 0.7 * 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.56 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.58 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) * P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 * 0.2}{0.58} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.034 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.7 * 0.1 + 0.3 * 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.07 + 0.27 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.34 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) * P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 * 0.1}{0.34} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.206 \]

Final results in JSON format:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.034,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.206
}
```

These calculations suggest that given Adam’s personality sketch, he is more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration.
