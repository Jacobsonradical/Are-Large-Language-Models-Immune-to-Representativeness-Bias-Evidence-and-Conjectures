Let's break down the probabilities for each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

**P(H): Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science**
- Given Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy, it is reasonably likely that he would be interested in this field.
- Assigning a moderate prior probability, let's assume: \( P(H) = 0.3 \)

**P(E|H): Probability of Adam's personality features given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science**
- Considering the descriptors, such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, and a warm heart, these features align well with someone in agricultural and veterinary sciences.
- Thus, we can assign a high value: \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \)

**P(E|¬H): Probability of Adam's personality features given that he is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science**
- While these characteristics could apply to someone in other fields, they are less likely outside this field compared to within it.
- Assigning a slightly lower value: \( P(E|¬H) = 0.4 \)

Using Bayes Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot (1 - P(H))} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.3}{0.8 \cdot 0.3 + 0.4 \cdot 0.7} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.24}{0.24 + 0.28} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.24}{0.52} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.462 \]


### Business Administration

**P(H): Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration**
- Given Adam's attributes, it's less likely that someone with a deep love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles would pursue business administration.
- We can assign a lower prior probability: \( P(H) = 0.1 \)

**P(E|H): Probability of Adam's personality features given that he is enrolled in business administration**
- Business administration does not specifically align with Adam's interests and personality traits. There might be some overlap regarding intelligence and understanding abstract concepts.
- Assigning a low value: \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \)

**P(E|¬H): Probability of Adam's personality features given that he is not enrolled in business administration**
- These features are reasonably common outside of business administration, so we can add a higher value.
- Assigning a higher value: \( P(E|¬H) = 0.5 \)

Using Bayes Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot (1 - P(H))} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.5 \cdot 0.9} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.45} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.47} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.043 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.462,
  "business administration": 0.043
}
```
