Let's start with the first step, estimating the probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

### Business Administration:
- \( P(H) \): This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Given that this is one of many fields, let’s consider it relatively common among graduate students. Suppose \( P(H) \) could be around 0.1.
  
- \( P(E|H) \): This is the likelihood that Adam’s personality sketch matches someone in business administration. Business administration students might not typically exhibit a strong interest in nature and plants, solving puzzles, and a deep love for animals. Let's set \( P(E|H) \) as quite low, say, 0.05.

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): This is the likelihood that Adam’s personality sketch matches someone who is not studying business administration. Given the diverse range of other fields and their potential relevance to Adam's interests, let's estimate this at a higher value, say 0.15.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.1}{0.05 \times 0.1 + 0.15 \times 0.9}
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.135} = \frac{0.005}{0.14} \approx 0.036
\]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- \( P(H) \): This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Since this is a much narrower field compared to all possible fields, let's assume a lower prior probability, e.g., 0.05.

- \( P(E|H) \): This is the likelihood that Adam’s personality sketch matches someone in agricultural and veterinary science. Adam’s interest in nature, plants, and animals strongly suggests a high \( P(E|H) \). Let's assume this to be high, say 0.7.

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): This is the likelihood that Adam’s personality sketch matches someone not studying agricultural and veterinary science. Given that his interests particularly align with agricultural and veterinary science, we would estimate this to be fairly low. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) \) to be 0.1.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.05}{0.7 \times 0.05 + 0.1 \times 0.95}
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.035}{0.035 + 0.095} = \frac{0.035}{0.13} \approx 0.269
\]

The final output:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.036,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.269
}
