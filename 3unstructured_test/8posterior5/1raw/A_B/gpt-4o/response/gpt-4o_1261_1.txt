To compute the posterior probabilities using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the following:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam exhibits the given personality traits given that he is enrolled in that particular field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that Adam exhibits the given personality traits given that he is not enrolled in that particular field.
4. \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality traits.

For simplicity, we'll assume that:

- The prior probabilities (\( P(H) \)) are equal for each field since we don't have any specific information about the population distribution of graduate students in different fields. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.5 \) for both fields.

- The conditional probabilities (\( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \)) are based on how well Adam's personality traits match with the typical characteristics of students in those fields.

### Business Administration

- \( P(H) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(E|H) \): Business administration students might have a variety of personalities, including those who appreciate hard work and dedication, but might not necessarily have a strong curiosity about nature, plants, or animals.
  - Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The personality traits described are less typical for business administration students.
  - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \)

Applying Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Since we don't know \( P(E) \) definitively, we'll use the normalization factor across the two fields, so the relative comparison makes sense.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- \( P(H) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(E|H) \): These students are likely to have a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, a deep love for animals, and strong empathy.
  - Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The personality traits fit the description of a student in agricultural or veterinary sciences very well.
  - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \)

Applying Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

### Calculation

For simplification, let's denote the normalizing constant as \( P(E) \).

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} \]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E)_{AVS} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} \]

We need to normalize these two probabilities so they sum up to 1 relative to each other.

\[ P(H|E)_{total} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} + \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{total} = \frac{0.1 + 0.4}{P(E)} = \frac{0.5}{P(E)} \]

Normalize:
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.1}{0.5} = 0.2 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{AVS} = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Therefore:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```
