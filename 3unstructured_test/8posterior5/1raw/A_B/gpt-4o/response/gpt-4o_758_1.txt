To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to evaluate three elements for each field:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in the field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in the field.

Since precisely calculating these probabilities requires specific data, I'll make reasonable assumptions based on the personality sketch and the nature of each field.

### For Business Administration:
- **P(H)**: The baseline probability Adam is studying this field. Let's assume a generic prior. Given the numerous fields of graduate study, I will set this at \(0.1\) (fairly common field).
- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's characteristics if he is in Business Administration. The characteristics described (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, solving puzzles) do not strongly align with business administration. I'll assume this is low, say \(0.01\).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of observing these characteristics if Adam is not in Business Administration. This can be reasonably high since his traits are quite general and common among many fields, say \(0.2\).

Using Bayes’ Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01 \cdot 0.1}{0.01 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.001}{0.001 + 0.18} = \frac{0.001}{0.181} \approx 0.0055 \]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- **P(H)**: Again, assuming a generic prior, I will set this at \(0.05\) (less common field).
- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's characteristics if he is in this field. This aligns very well with his traits such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy. I'll assume this to be fairly high, say \(0.8\).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of observing these characteristics if Adam is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. This is similar to the value earlier, say \(0.2\).

Using Bayes’ Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.95} = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.19} = \frac{0.04}{0.23} \approx 0.1739 \]

Therefore, the final answers are:

{
  "business administration": 0.0055,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.1739
}
