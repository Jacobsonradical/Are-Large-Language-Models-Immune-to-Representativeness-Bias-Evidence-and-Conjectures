To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field based on his personality sketch (E), we can use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given:
- \( P(H) \) = prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field
- \( P(E|H) \) = likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is in that specific field
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) = likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in that specific field

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: Let's assume a general prior probability for enrollment in agricultural and veterinary science is moderate for graduate students. For simplicity, let's say \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
2. **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's traits—curiosity about nature, love for animals, understanding hard work—this field seems highly likely. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of these traits in other fields (not related to nature and animals) might still be notable but lower. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: The general prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in business administration. A reasonable assumption might be \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
2. **P(E|H)**: Adam’s personality does not strongly fit business traits (like leadership and management). Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: It’s more likely to encounter Adam’s traits in fields other than business. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

Now, we'll use Bayes' rule to update our beliefs:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let’s calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9 = 0.08 + 0.27 = 0.35 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.35} = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \approx 0.229 \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.8 = 0.04 + 0.4 = 0.44 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.44} = \frac{0.04}{0.44} \approx 0.091 \]

Thus, the computed probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.229,
  "business administration": 0.091
}
