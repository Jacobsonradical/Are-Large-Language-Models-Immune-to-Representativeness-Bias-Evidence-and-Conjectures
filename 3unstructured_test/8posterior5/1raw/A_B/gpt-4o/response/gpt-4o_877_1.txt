To solve this problem using Bayes' rule, we will follow these steps for each field of study (business administration and agricultural and veterinary science):

1. **Define Hypotheses (H):**
   - H(BA): Adam was enrolled in business administration.
   - H(AVS): Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

2. **Assign Prior Probabilities P(H):**
   - P(H(BA)): Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration.
   - P(H(AVS)): Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

3. **Assess Likelihoods P(E|H):**
   - P(E|H(BA)): Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was enrolled in business administration.
   - P(E|H(AVS)): Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

4. **Assess Complementary Likelihoods P(E|¬H):**
   - P(E|¬H(BA)): Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was not enrolled in business administration.
   - P(E|¬H(AVS)): Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

5. **Compute Bayes' Rule:**
   - P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)
   - Since we're comparing only two fields among many, the evidence term P(E) remains constant and we can proportionally compare the results.

### Given Assumptions:

1. **Prior Probabilities P(H):**
   - Let's assume a low prior probability for both fields, e.g., 0.1 for each.

2. **Likelihoods P(E|H):**

   - Given the personality sketch, Adam's traits (nature curiosity, empathy, love for animals) align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science than business administration.

   - We can assign higher likelihoods to these traits for H(AVS):
     - **P(E|H(AVS))**: High, let's assume 0.8.
     - **P(E|H(BA))**: Low, let's assume 0.2.

3. **Complementary Likelihoods P(E|¬H):**

   - Given the field count in graduate programs, P(E|¬H(BA)): Assume 0.5.
   - Given the field count in graduate programs, P(E|¬H(AVS)): Assume 0.3.

### Using the values:

- **P(H(BA)|E) = [P(E|H(BA)) * P(H(BA))] / [P(E|H(BA)) * P(H(BA)) + P(E|¬H(BA)) * P(¬H(BA))]**
- **P(H(AVS)|E) = [P(E|H(AVS)) * P(H(AVS))] / [P(E|H(AVS)) * P(H(AVS)) + P(E|¬H(AVS)) * P(¬H(AVS))]**

Now plug in the values:

- **P(H(BA)|E) ≈ (0.2 * 0.1) / (0.2 * 0.1 + 0.5 * 0.9)**
- **P(H(AVS)|E) ≈ (0.8 * 0.1) / (0.8 * 0.1 + 0.3 * 0.9)**

Let's compute:

- **P(H(BA)|E) = 0.02 / (0.02 + 0.45) ≈ 0.02 / 0.47 ≈ 0.0426**
- **P(H(AVS)|E) = 0.08 / (0.08 + 0.27) ≈ 0.08 / 0.35 ≈ 0.2286**

Thus:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0426,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.2286
}
```
