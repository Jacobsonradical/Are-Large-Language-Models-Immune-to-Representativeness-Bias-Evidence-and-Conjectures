To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science (\(P(H|E)\)) or business administration (\(P(H|E)\)), based on the personality sketch provided, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of Adam being in the particular field.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in the particular field.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in the particular field.

Let's break down the components for each field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **Prior Probability (\(P(H)\)):**
  The likelihood that a random student is in agricultural and veterinary science. This is generally low compared to fields like business administration, but given Adam's interests, we can assign it a moderate value.
- **Probability of Evidence Given Hypothesis (\(P(E|H)\)):**
  Adam's curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and love for animals align well with this field. Thus, \(P(E|H)\) should be high.
- **Probability of Evidence Given Not Hypothesis (\(P(E|\neg H)\)):**
  The probability of having Adam's traits if he is in another field like business administration is lower. Thus, \(P(E|\neg H)\) is lower.

### Business Administration
- **Prior Probability (\(P(H)\)):**
  The likelihood that a random student is in business administration is fairly high given its popularity.
- **Probability of Evidence Given Hypothesis (\(P(E|H)\)):**
  Adam's traits do not strongly align with typical traits seen in business administration students. Thus, \(P(E|H)\) is lower.
- **Probability of Evidence Given Not Hypothesis (\(P(E|\neg H)\)):**
  If Adam is not in business administration, his traits can be better explained by other fields like agricultural and veterinary science.

Based on these reasonings, here are the tentative values for each component:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \(P(H)\): 0.2 (Given its less common compared to business administration but fits Adam's interests)
   - \(P(E|H)\): 0.8 (Adam's traits fit well with this field)
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\): 0.3 (Given his traits are less explained in other fields)

2. **Business Administration:**
   - \(P(H)\): 0.3 (High due to its popularity)
   - \(P(E|H)\): 0.2 (Traits are less likely for a business administration student)
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\): 0.7 (Traits are more likely to be explained by other fields)

Now we apply Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \(P(E)\) can be calculated as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

Keep in mind that \(P(\neg H)\) is \( 1 - P(H) \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) = 0.16 + 0.24 = 0.4 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{0.4} = 0.4 \]

### Business Administration

\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.3) + (0.7 \cdot 0.7) = 0.06 + 0.49 = 0.55 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{0.55} \approx 0.109 \]

So, with these calculations,

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.109
}
