To determine the probabilities of Adam being enrolled in business administration (H1) and agricultural and veterinary science (H2), we need to use Bayes' rule, which is stated as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence.

### Calculating for Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H1) \)**:
   Let's assume that business administration is a relatively common field for graduate students, but not overly so. We'll assign a moderate prior probability of \( P(H1) = 0.2 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H1) \)**:
   Adam's personality sketch, emphasizing a love for nature, animals, and an appreciation for hard work, does not strongly correlate with the typical traits of a business administration student. Therefore, the likelihood is relatively low. We'll estimate \( P(E|H1) = 0.1 \).

3. **Non-Hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H1) \)**:
   This is the probability of the evidence given that Adam is not enrolled in business administration. Since there are many other fields that align better with Adam's interests, we will set this higher. We'll estimate \( P(E|\neg H1) = 0.3 \).

Now we can calculate \( P(H1|E) \):

\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1)}{P(E)} \]

To complete this calculation, we need \( P(E) \), which can be complex to determine directly. We can simplify by comparing relative probabilities.

### Calculating for Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H2) \)**:
   This field aligns well with Adam's interests in nature and animals, making it more likely. We'll assign a higher prior probability of \( P(H2) = 0.15 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H2) \)**:
   Given the strong congruence between Adam's interests and this field, we'll assign a high likelihood here, say \( P(E|H2) = 0.7 \).

3. **Non-Hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H2) \)**:
   This is the probability of the evidence given that Adam is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Since other fields might not fit his personality sketch as well, we'll keep this lower. We'll estimate \( P(E|\neg H2) = 0.2 \).

Now we can calculate \( P(H2|E) \):

\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2)}{P(E)} \]

### Relative Probability Calculation

For simplicity, we note that we only need relative comparisons of the numerators because \( P(E) \) will cancel out in a final ranking.

For business administration:
\[ P(H1|E) \approx P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H2|E) = P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2) = 0.7 \cdot 0.15 = 0.105 \]

### Normalized Probability (relative to these two fields)

Let's normalize these to make them comparable within the context of these two fields:

Total Relative Probability = \( 0.02 + 0.105 = 0.125 \)

Normalized probabilities:
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.125} \approx 0.16 \]
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.105}{0.125} \approx 0.84 \]

So the final answer is:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.16,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.84
}
```
