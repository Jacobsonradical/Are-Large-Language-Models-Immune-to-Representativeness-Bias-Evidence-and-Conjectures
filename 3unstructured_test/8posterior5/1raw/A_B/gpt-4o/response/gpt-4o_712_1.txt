To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following probabilities for each field:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in this field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam was in this field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam was not in this field.

Finally, we will apply Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields and will cancel out when comparing \( P(H|E) \) for different fields, we can focus on comparing the numerators \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \). Given the constraints of not having concrete numerical values, our estimates will be qualitative.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam could be enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Let's estimate this as relatively higher due to his interest in nature, plants, and animals.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability that Adam, being in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, would exhibit the traits described in \( E \) is high.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the sketch \( E \) without him being in Agricultural and Veterinary Science (considering other fields like business or humanities) would be relatively lower.

Given these qualitative estimates:
- \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \) (Moderate likelihood based on interests)
- \( P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \) (High likelihood given alignment)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.1 \) (Relatively low elsewhere)

Calculating \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.3}{0.9 \cdot 0.3 + 0.1 \cdot (1 - 0.3)} = \frac{0.27}{0.27 + 0.07} = \frac{0.27}{0.34} \approx 0.79 \]

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam could be enrolled in Business Administration. Let's estimate this as lower given his interests.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability that Adam, being in Business Administration, would exhibit the traits described in \( E \) is relatively low.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the sketch \( E \) without him being in Business Administration (considering other fields like agricultural sciences) would be higher.

Given these qualitative estimates:
- \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \) (Lower likelihood based on interests)
- \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \) (Low likelihood)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.8 \) (Higher elsewhere)

Calculating \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.1 \cdot 0.1 + 0.8 \cdot (1 - 0.1)} = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.72} = \frac{0.01}{0.73} \approx 0.014 \]

By comparing the probabilities, we get:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.79,
  "business administration": 0.014
