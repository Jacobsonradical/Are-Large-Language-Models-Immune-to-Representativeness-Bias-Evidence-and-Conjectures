To calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch \( E \) through Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's evaluate the components for each field:

### 1. Business Administration
- **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \):**
  Assume a rough estimate for P(H) given the popularity of the field among graduate students.
  \[ P(H)_{\text{Business Administration}} \approx 0.2 \]

- **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \):**
  Given Adam's personality sketch, it seems less likely he would be in Business Administration as it does not directly connect to his love for nature, animals, and abstract thinking.
  \[ P(E|H)_{\text{Business Administration}} = 0.05 \]

- **Evidence, \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
  This is the probability of the evidence occurring among those not in Business Administration. Assuming there are many fields that might better fit Adam's personality:
  \[ P(E|\neg H)_{\text{Business Administration}} = 0.25 \]
  
  Using above values,
  \[ P(H|E)_{\text{Business Administration}} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.2}{0.25} = 0.04 \]

### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \):**
  A rough estimate considering this less common field.
  \[ P(H)_{\text{Agricultural Science}} \approx 0.1 \]

- **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \):**
  Adam's interests and personality are quite aligned with this field, for it involves nature, plants, animals, and a good amount of scientific research.
  \[ P(E|H)_{\text{Agricultural Science}} = 0.8 \]

- **Evidence, \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
  As before, considering other fields Adam might fit into.
  \[ P(E|\neg H)_{\text{Agricultural Science}} = 0.3 \]

  Using above values,
  \[ P(H|E)_{\text{Agricultural Science}} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.3} = 0.27 \]

Thus, the probabilities would look as follows:

{
  "business administration": 0.04,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.27
}
