To determine the probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, where \( H \) is the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in a particular field and \( E \) is the personality sketch of Adam, we need three probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in the field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in the field.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( P(E) \) can be derived from the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Since we are only concerned with a comparison between two fields (business administration and agricultural and veterinary science), we need to leverage the proportionality that Bayes' rule offers when comparing probabilities:

\[ P(H_1|E) \propto P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) \]
\[ P(H_2|E) \propto P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]

### Business Administration

**Assumptions and Estimates:**

- \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): Moderate to low, as business administration programs are quite common but may not heavily emphasize nature and animals. Let's estimate it as \( 0.05 \).
- \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): Low, as the personality traits of curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy are less central to business administration. Let's estimate it as \( 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \): Higher, considering the same reasons, let's estimate it as \( 0.5 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

**Assumptions and Estimates:**

- \( P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) \): Higher than business administration, as these fields align more closely with Adam's personality. Let's estimate it as \( 0.15 \).
- \( P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \): High, since the personality sketch strongly aligns with interests in nature, empathy, and animals. Let's estimate it as \( 0.8 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AgVet}}) \): Lower, as not enrolling in this field means having fewer of those specific interests. Let's estimate it as \( 0.3 \).

### Calculation Using Bayes' Rule

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) \]
\[ \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.05 \]
\[ \propto 0.005 \]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{AgVet}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) \]
\[ \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.15 \]
\[ \propto 0.12 \]

### Normalizing

To provide a normalized comparison, sum those proportional probabilities and divide each by the total:

\[ \text{Sum} = 0.005 + 0.12 = 0.125 \]

Normalized probabilities:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.125} = 0.04 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{AgVet}}|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.125} = 0.96 \]
