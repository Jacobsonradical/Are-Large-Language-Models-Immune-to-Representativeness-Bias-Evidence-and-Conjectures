To compute the probabilities of Adam being enrolled in specific fields in 2021 based on his personality sketch, we need to consider the following steps using Bayes' rule:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the specific fields, such as agricultural and veterinary science or business administration. 

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch E given enrollment in the specific field.

3. **P(E|Â¬H)**: The probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam was not enrolled in the specific field.

4. **P(H|E)**: The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the specific field, given his personality sketch (computed using Bayes' rule).

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

### Before Assigning Values:
Let's make plausible qualitative assumptions:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  - Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work highly align with this field.
  - Therefore, \( P(E|H) \) for this field should be high.
  - Generally, enrollment in specific fields and inherent traits may not have significant prior biases unless specific data is available.

- **Business Administration**:
  - Despite Adam's high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and warm heart, his personality sketch doesn't strongly align with business administration.
  - Therefore, \( P(E|H) \) for this field should be lower than for Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
  - Enrollment in this field is typically quite common, so prior probability might not be extremely low.

### Assigning Qualitative Values:
- Let's assume a moderate prior probability for Agricultural and Veterinary Science (\( P(H) \approx 0.05 \)) and Business Administration (\( P(H) \approx 0.15 \)).
- \( P(E|H) \) is higher for Agricultural and Veterinary Science (\( \approx 0.8 \)) compared to Business Administration (\( \approx 0.1 \)).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of Adam's traits being present even if not enrolled in these fields (say 0.3 for both, given that other fields might align better).

### Calculation:
For each field, compute \( P(H|E) \) using the values assumed:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.3 \cdot 0.95) = 0.04 + 0.285 = 0.325 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.325} \approx 0.123 \]

2. **Business Administration**:
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.15) + (0.3 \cdot 0.85) = 0.015 + 0.255 = 0.27 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{0.27} \approx 0.056 \]

Now, presenting your required answer format:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.123,
  "business administration": 0.056
}
```

These values provide a sense of how likely Adam is to be enrolled in each field given his personality sketch while acknowledging that these are estimates based on assumed probabilities.
