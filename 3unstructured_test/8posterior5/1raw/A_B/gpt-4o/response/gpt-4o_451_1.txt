To apply Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis, we'll use the following formulas:

1. Bayes' Rule: 
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

2. Consider the hypothesis:
   - \( H_1 \): Adam was enrolled in business administration.
   - \( H_2 \): Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   
3. We also need the complements:
   - \( \neg H_1 \): Adam was not enrolled in business administration.
   - \( \neg H_2 \): Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Let's break down each hypothesis:

### Business Administration

- **P(H_1)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Suppose we assume that among all graduate fields, the proportion of students in business administration is relatively high but not dominant. Let's estimate it at 0.2.
- **P(E|H_1)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in business administration. Given Adam's characteristics (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals), it's quite low that such a profile would align with a typical business administration student. Let's estimate this at 0.05.
- **P(E|\neg H_1)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was not enrolled in business administration. Among all other fields, there are many where his profile would fit better. Let's estimate this at 0.2.

We can apply Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)}
\]

We don't have \( P(E) \) explicitly, but we know it's constant across hypotheses, so it will cancel out when comparing relative probabilities.

\[
P(H_1|E) \propto P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) = 0.05 \cdot 0.2 = 0.01
\]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H_2)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given the nature of a typical distribution, let's assume this is relatively low, say 0.05.
- **P(E|H_2)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Highly likely given his empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature. Let's estimate this at 0.8.
- **P(E|\neg H_2)**: As earlier, estimating the probability of observing Adam's characteristics given he was not in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume it's around 0.15.

Applying Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H_2|E) \propto P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04
\]

Note that comparisons of these relative probabilities give an indication of which hypothesis is more likely, but absolute values will be missing \( P(E) \).

Finally, compiling the results:

\[
{
  "business administration": 0.01,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.04
}
\]
