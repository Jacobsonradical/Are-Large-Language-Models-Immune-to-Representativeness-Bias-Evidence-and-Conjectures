To use Bayes' Rule to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field based on the given personality sketch of Adam, we need to assess the following:

1. **Prior probability \( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of the observed personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in each field.
3. **Complementary likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of the observed personality sketch E given that Adam was not enrolled in each field.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant and the same for all fields, we primarily focus on comparing the numerator:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Let's assume a reasonable prior \( P(H) \) for an average graduate student being enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Sciences to be 0.1 (10%).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, it is highly plausible that he would be enrolled in a field related to agricultural and veterinary science. 
   - Let's assign \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \) (90%).

3. **Complementary Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - For fields other than agricultural and veterinary science, it is less likely though still possible that the personality traits fit. 
   - Let's assign \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \) (20%).

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Let's assume a reasonable prior \( P(H) \) for an average graduate student being enrolled in Business Administration to be 0.15 (15%).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Given Adam's personality sketch, it is less likely that his interest and traits align with business administration, which typically does not emphasize nature and animals.
   - Let's assign \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \) (10%).

3. **Complementary Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - For fields other than business administration, particularly those aligning with Adam's traits, the likelihood would be higher.
   - Let's assign \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.25 \) (25%).

Using these values:

### Calculations

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.9 \cdot 0.1 \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.09 \]

#### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.15 \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.015 \]

Normalizing these values:
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.015} \approx 0.857 \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.015}{0.09 + 0.015} \approx 0.143 \]
