To solve this problem, we need to calculate \( P(H|E) \), the probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch. We'll use Bayes' rule for this, which is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's consider each field separately.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

#### Prior Probability \( P(H) \)
Adam has a passion for nature, plants, and animals, which aligns closely with agricultural and veterinary science. Graduate students in agricultural and veterinary science make up a reasonable portion but not the majority of graduate students overall.

Estimate: \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \)

#### Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)
Given that Adam's interests and traits match well with agricultural and veterinary science (curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy), it's highly likely that someone with these traits would be in this field.

Estimate: \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \)

#### Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)
This is the probability of Adam's traits given that he is in any other field. Since his traits are quite specific to fields involving nature and animals, this is relatively low.

Estimate: \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \)

#### Posterior Probability \( P(H|E) \)
Using Bayes' rule,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Plugging in the values,

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.1) + (0.2 \times 0.9) = 0.08 + 0.18 = 0.26 \]

So,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.26} \approx 0.3077 \]

### Business Administration

#### Prior Probability \( P(H) \)
Graduate students in business administration are quite common. However, Adam’s traits do not align closely with the typical skills and interests of this field.

Estimate: \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \)

#### Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)
Adam’s traits do not correspond well with business administration (focus on nature, empathy, and animals). Thus, it’s unlikely someone with his traits would be in this field.

Estimate: \( P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \)

#### Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)
This is the probability of Adam’s traits if he is not in business administration. Since business students are quite common, it's relatively more likely for someone with Adam’s traits to be found outside this field.

Estimate: \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \)

#### Posterior Probability \( P(H|E) \)
Using Bayes' rule,

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Plugging in the values,

\[ P(E) = (0.2 \times 0.2) + (0.4 \times 0.8) = 0.04 + 0.32 = 0.36 \]

So,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.36} \approx 0.1111 \]
