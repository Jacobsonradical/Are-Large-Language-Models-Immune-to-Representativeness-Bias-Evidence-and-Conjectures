To utilize Bayes' theorem to evaluate the probabilities, we need to make educated estimates for each of the prior probabilities \(P(H)\), the likelihoods \(P(E|H)\), and the marginal probabilities \(P(E|\neg H)\) for both fields: agricultural and veterinary science, and business administration.

Let’s denote:
- \(H_{ag} =\) Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \(H_{ba} =\) Adam was enrolled in business administration.

### Hypothesis: Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H_{ag})\)**:
   - It’s reasonable to assume that a non-trivial but small proportion of graduate students might be enrolled in this field. For estimation, let's set \(P(H_{ag}) = 0.1\).

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H_{ag})\)**:
   - Given Adam's characteristics (curiosity about nature, love for animals, appreciation for hard work), these traits align well with agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, let's set \(P(E|H_{ag}) = 0.9\).

3. **Marginal Probability \(P(E|\neg H_{ag})\)**:
   - This is the probability of observing Adam’s characteristics if he is not in the agricultural and veterinary science field. These characteristics are somewhat more rare in other fields, so let’s estimate \(P(E|\neg H_{ag}) = 0.2\).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H_{ag}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{ag}) \cdot P(H_{ag})}{P(E|H_{ag}) \cdot P(H_{ag}) + P(E|\neg H_{ag}) \cdot P(\neg H_{ag})} \]

Let's compute:
\[ P(H_{ag}|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.1}{0.9 \times 0.1 + 0.2 \times 0.9} \]
\[ P(H_{ag}|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.18} \]
\[ P(H_{ag}|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.27} \approx 0.33 \]

### Hypothesis: Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H_{ba})\)**:
   - Business administration is a common field, thus we can set a higher prior, \(P(H_{ba}) = 0.2\).

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H_{ba})\)**:
   - Adam’s characteristics are not typically associated with business administration but they are not impossible either. Let’s set \(P(E|H_{ba}) = 0.1\).

3. **Marginal Probability \(P(E|\neg H_{ba})\)**:
   - Here, we need to consider the inverse proportion, \(P(E|\neg H_{ba})\). Given the rarity, let's set \(P(E|\neg H_{ba}) = 0.3\).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{ba}) \cdot P(H_{ba})}{P(E|H_{ba}) \cdot P(H_{ba}) + P(E|\neg H_{ba}) \cdot P(\neg H_{ba})} \]

Let's compute:
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.1 \times 0.2 + 0.3 \times 0.8} \]
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.24} \]
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.26} \approx 0.077 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.33,
  "business administration": 0.077
}
```
