To apply Bayes' rule, we need to calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \). Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the fields "agricultural and veterinary science" and "business administration", we need to evaluate these probabilities:

### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

#### Priors (P(H)):
- **P(H)**: The probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume a prior probability, say \( P(\text{AgSci}) = 0.1 \) as a rough estimate.

#### Likelihoods (P(E|H)):
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, and his empathy, let's say \( P(E|\text{AgSci}) = 0.8 \).

#### Complement Likelihoods (P(E|¬H)):
- **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is *not* enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given the specificity of his traits towards nature and animals, let's assume \( P(E|\neg \text{AgSci}) = 0.2 \).

Using Bayes' rule, we compute \( P(\text{AgSci}|E) \):

\[ P(\text{AgSci}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{AgSci}) \cdot P(\text{AgSci})}{P(E|\text{AgSci}) \cdot P(\text{AgSci}) + P(E|\neg \text{AgSci}) \cdot P(\neg \text{AgSci})} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(\text{AgSci}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9} \]
\[ P(\text{AgSci}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.18} \]
\[ P(\text{AgSci}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \]
\[ P(\text{AgSci}|E) \approx 0.31 \]

### 2. Business Administration

#### Priors (P(H)):
- **P(H)**: The probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in business administration. Let's assume a prior probability, say \( P(\text{BusAd}) = 0.2 \) as a rough estimate.

#### Likelihoods (P(E|H)):
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in business administration. Given that Adam's traits are not typically associated with business administration, let's say \( P(E|\text{BusAd}) = 0.1 \).

#### Complement Likelihoods (P(E|¬H)):
- **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is *not* enrolled in business administration. This can be evaluated similar to before, \( P(E|\neg \text{BusAd}) = 0.3 \).

Using Bayes' rule, we compute \( P(\text{BusAd}|E) \):

\[ P(\text{BusAd}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{BusAd}) \cdot P(\text{BusAd})}{P(E|\text{BusAd}) \cdot P(\text{BusAd}) + P(E|\neg \text{BusAd}) \cdot P(\neg \text{BusAd})} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(\text{BusAd}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8} \]
\[ P(\text{BusAd}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.24} \]
\[ P(\text{BusAd}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.26} \]
\[ P(\text{BusAd}|E) \approx 0.08 \]

### Final Results

Given these calculations, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.31,
  "business administration": 0.08
}
```
These values reflect our best estimates given the assumptions and available data.
