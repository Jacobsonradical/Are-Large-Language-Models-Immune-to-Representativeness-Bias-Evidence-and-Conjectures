To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following probability values:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in each field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in each field.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be computed as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

We make some educated assumptions about these probabilities based on Adam's personality sketch and the typical traits associated with each field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **\( P(H) \)**: Let's assume that the prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is relatively moderate. Say, \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's characteristics (love for nature, animals, high intelligence, empathy, appreciation for hard work), it's very probable that he would be in this field. Let's assign a high probability to this, say \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Assuming that these traits are less common in fields other than agricultural and veterinary science, but not entirely rare either. We might set \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

### Business Administration

- **\( P(H) \)**: Let's assume that the prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in business administration is relatively high. Say, \( P(H) = 0.25 \).
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's characteristics, it's less likely but still possible that he would be in this field. Let's assign a moderate probability here, say \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Assuming that these traits are more common in fields other than business administration, we might set \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.7 \).

Now we use these to compute \( P(H|E) \).

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[ P(E) = (P(E|H) \cdot P(H)) + (P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.15) + (0.3 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.135 + 0.255 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.39 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.15}{0.39} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.346 \]

### For Business Administration:

\[ P(E) = (P(E|H) \cdot P(H)) + (P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.7 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.05 + 0.525 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.575 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.575} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.087 \]

Thus, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.346,
  "business administration": 0.087
}
```
