To calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) through Bayes' rule, we follow the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence.

Since we don't have exact numbers, we'll use our judgment based on the personality sketch.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

**P(H):**
The prior probability that Adam chose this field. Assuming a neutral stance but considering his interests:
- \( P(H) \) = 0.2 (20%)

**P(E|H):**
The probability of observing the personality sketch (E) given Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science:

Given his strong curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and understanding of hard work, it's very likely:
- \( P(E|H) \) = 0.9 (90%)

**P(E|\neg H):**
The probability of observing this personality sketch given Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science:

While still possible, it's less likely:
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) = 0.4 (40%)

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]

To find \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.9 \times 0.2) + (0.4 \times 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.18 + 0.32 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.5 \]

So:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.2}{0.5} = \frac{0.18}{0.5} = 0.36 \]

### Business Administration

**P(H):**
The prior probability that Adam chose this field. Assuming a neutral stance but considering typical choices:
- \( P(H) \) = 0.2 (20%)

**P(E|H):**
The probability of observing the personality sketch (E) given Adam is in business administration:

Given his curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals, it's less likely:
- \( P(E|H) \) = 0.2 (20%)

**P(E|\neg H):**
The probability of observing this personality sketch given Adam is not in business administration:

Higher than the specific case of business administration:
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) = 0.55 (55%)

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]

To find \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \times 0.2) + (0.55 \times 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.44 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.48 \]

So:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.2}{0.48} = \frac{0.04}{0.48} \approx 0.083 \]

The final probabilities \( P(H|E) \):
