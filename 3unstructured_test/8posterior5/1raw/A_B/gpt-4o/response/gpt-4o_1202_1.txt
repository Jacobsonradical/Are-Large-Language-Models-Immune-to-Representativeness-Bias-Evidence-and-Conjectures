To solve this problem using Bayes' Rule, we need to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field of specialization. This rule is given by: 

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field, given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch, given that Adam is enrolled in the specific field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the specific field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch. 

First, the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) should realistically depend on the proportion of graduate students in each field. Though exact figures are not provided, let's assume some hypothetical reasonable proportions:
- Probability of Adam being in agricultural and veterinary science (P(AG)): 0.10 (10%)
- Probability of Adam being in business administration (P(BA)): 0.15 (15%)

Now we estimate \( P(E|H) \), the probability of Adam's personality traits given his field. Based on the sketch:
- \( P(E|AG) \) (Aligns with his interest in nature, empathy towards animals, and might require abstract thinking): 0.8
- \( P(E|BA) \) (Less likely as business focuses more on administration and less on nature and animals): 0.2

Finally, estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \), that is the likelihood of Adam's personality regardless of these specific fields. Since our data for other fields is limited, letâ€™s balance the overall sketch presence in a general graduate population:
- Let's assume \( P(E|\neg AG) = 0.3 \)
- And \( P(E|\neg BA) = 0.4 \)

Using Bayes' rule for Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[ P(AG|E) = \frac{P(E|AG) \cdot P(AG)}{P(E)} \]

For calculation, we assume \( P(E) \) as an overall probability encompassing both considered fields plus others, assumed as average. For simplicity, let's set \( P(E) = 0.5 \).

\[ P(AG|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.10}{0.5} = 0.16 \]

Using Bayes' rule for Business Administration:

\[ P(BA|E) = \frac{P(E|BA) \cdot P(BA)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(BA|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.15}{0.5} = 0.06 \]

Hence,

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.16,
  "business administration": 0.06
}
```

The calculations and assumptions above provide posterior probabilities based on hypothetical prior and conditional probabilities to illustrate the application of Bayes' theorem. Adjusting exact proportion or field likelihoods may change these specific outcomes.
