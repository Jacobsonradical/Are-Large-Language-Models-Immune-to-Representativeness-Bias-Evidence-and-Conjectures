To determine \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we'll use Bayes' rule as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence given that the hypothesis is true.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence given that the hypothesis is false.
- \( P(E) \) can be derived from the law of total probability: 

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H)) \]

Let's make reasonable estimates for these values based on the supplied information:

### Business Administration (H1)
- **Prior Probability (\( P(H_{BA}) \)):** Assume the prior probability that any graduate student is enrolled in business administration is moderate, around \(0.2\).
- **Likelihood (\( P(E|H_{BA}) \)):** The likelihood that someone with Adam's traits is in business administration is likely low since the field moderately involves nature and animals. Let's assume \(0.1\).
- **Likelihood of the Evidence Given Not the Hypothesis (\( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \)):** The broad likelihood that someone outside this particular hypothesis (business administration) has Adam's traits might be higher, say, \(0.6\).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H2)
- **Prior Probability (\( P(H_{AVS}) \)):** Assume the prior probability that any graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is lower, around \(0.1\).
- **Likelihood (\( P(E|H_{AVS}) \)):** The likelihood that someone with Adam's traits is in agricultural and veterinary science is very high, given his interest and love for nature, plants, and animals, say \(0.8\).
- **Likelihood of the Evidence Given Not the Hypothesis (\( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \)):** The probability of observing someone with Adam's characteristics outside this particular field might be lower, say \(0.4\).

Now, calculating \( P(E) \) for both hypotheses:

### For Business Administration:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{BA})) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.6 \cdot 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.48 = 0.50 \]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) + P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{AVS})) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.4 \cdot 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.36 = 0.44 \]

Now, calculating posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \):

### For Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.50} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.50} = 0.04 \]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.44} \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.44} = 0.182 \]

Thus, the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.04,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.182
}
