To compute the required probabilities, we need to make educated estimations based on the information provided. Let's proceed step by step:

### Hypotheses

1. \(H_1\): Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
2. \(H_2\): Adam was enrolled in business administration.

### Prior Probabilities \(P(H_1)\) and \(P(H_2)\)

Since these are two possible fields among many, let’s assign initial non-zero prior probabilities, given the scenario:

- \(P(H_1)\): The probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \(P(H_2)\): The probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.

Assuming a rough estimate among many similar fields, let's use \(P(H_1) = 0.1\) and \(P(H_2) = 0.1\). These values are not exact but reasonable in a context where multiple fields exist.

### Likelihoods \(P(E|H_1)\) and \(P(E|H_2)\)

- \(P(E|H_1)\): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch \(E\) given he was in agricultural and veterinary science.
  - Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals aligns well with agricultural and veterinary sciences. Also, his empathy and appreciation for hard work fit nicely.
  - Let's assign a high probability \(P(E|H_1) = 0.9\).

- \(P(E|H_2)\): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch \(E\) given he was in business administration.
  - Business administration typically aligns more with analytical and management skills. While his intelligence and puzzle-solving may fit, his empathy and love for animals don't directly align.
  - Let's assign a lower probability \(P(E|H_2) = 0.3\).

### Complementary Likelihoods \(P(E|\neg H_1)\) and \(P(E|\neg H_2)\)

- \(P(E|\neg H_1)\): The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch if he was not in agricultural and veterinary science.
  - Since there are many other fields, let's assume a moderate likelihood matching other fields, say \(P(E|\neg H_1) = 0.4\).

- \(P(E|\neg H_2)\): The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch if he was not in business administration.
  - Similar logic applies, let's use \(P(E|\neg H_2) = 0.6\).

### Posterior Probabilities \(P(H_1|E)\) and \(P(H_2|E)\)

Using Bayes’ Rule:

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]
\[P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)\]

#### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[P(E) = P(E|H_1)P(H_1) + P(E|\neg H_1)P(\neg H_1)\]
\[P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.1) + (0.4 \cdot 0.9) = 0.09 + 0.36 = 0.45\]

\[P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{0.45} \approx 0.2\]

#### For Business Administration:

\[P(E) = P(E|H_2)P(H_2) + P(E|\neg H_2)P(\neg H_2)\]
\[P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.1) + (0.6 \cdot 0.9) = 0.03 + 0.54 = 0.57\]

\[P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.57} \approx 0.053\]

Based on the calculations, the posterior probabilities are:

```
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.053
}
```

These calculations suggest that Adam is more likely to be in the field of agricultural and veterinary science than business administration given his personality sketch.
