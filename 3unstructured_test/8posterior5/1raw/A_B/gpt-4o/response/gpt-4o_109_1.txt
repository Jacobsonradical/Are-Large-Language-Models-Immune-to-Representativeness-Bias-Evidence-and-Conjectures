To estimate the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we'll consider the following values:

- \( P(H): \) The prior probability that Adam enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H): \) The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is in a particular field.
- \( P(E|\neg H): \) The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is not in the particular field.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Assuming that \( P(E) \) is constant for normalization and can be ignored for comparison purposes, we can focus on \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for each field.

### Business Administration:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability for business administration might be relatively moderate since it is a common graduate field. Let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \).
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability that someone in business administration has Adam's personality characteristics is likely lower. For instance, the empathy and love for animals are not typically associated with business administration. Let's say \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of having Adam's traits if not in business administration could be higher due to other fields fitting better. We can assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.7 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability for agricultural and veterinary science might be lower as it is a more specialized field. Let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \).
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam's traits fit within agricultural and veterinary science is very high given his curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals. Hence, \( P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of having Adam's traits if not in agricultural and veterinary science is lower since this field matches his traits well. We might set \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \).

Now, we compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H)
\]

For business administration:
\[
P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.3 = 0.03
\]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[
P(H|E) \propto 0.9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.09
\]

Given these proportional values, we normalize to compare relative probabilities:

\[
{
  \text{business administration}: \approx \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.09} = 0.25,
  \text{agricultural and veterinary science}: \approx \frac{0.09}{0.03 + 0.09} = 0.75
}
\]

Therefore, the probability estimates are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.25,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75
}
