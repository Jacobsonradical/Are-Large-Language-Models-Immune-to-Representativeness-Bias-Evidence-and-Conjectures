Let's evaluate the probabilities for each field first.
1. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H_{BA}) \): This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a Business Administration graduate program. Since we don't have specific information on this, let's assume a moderate baseline probability. Suppose we set \( P(H_{BA}) \) to 0.2 (20%).
   - \( P(E | H_{BA}) \): This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in a Business Administration program. Adam's traits like a curiosity about nature, love for solving puzzles, empathy for animals, etc., don't strongly align with typical traits expected in Business Administration. So, let's assume \( P(E | H_{BA}) \) to be 0.1 (10%).
   - \( P(E | \neg H_{BA}) \): This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in any field other than Business Administration. Given the broad nature of other possible fields, let's set this to something more probable, say 0.3 (30%).
   
   Using Bayes' rule:

   \[
   P(H_{BA} | E) = \frac{P(E | H_{BA}) \times P(H_{BA})}{P(E)}
   \]

   Since \( P(E) = P(E | H_{BA}) \times P(H_{BA}) + P(E | \neg H_{BA}) \times P(\neg H_{BA}) \):

   \[
   P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.2) + (0.3 \times 0.8) = 0.02 + 0.24 = 0.26
   \]

   So:

   \[
   P(H_{BA} | E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.26} \approx 0.077
   \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H_{AVS}) \): This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in an Agricultural and Veterinary Science program. Since his traits align more closely with this field, let's assume a higher baseline probability. Suppose we set \( P(H_{AVS}) \) to 0.1 (10%).
   - \( P(E | H_{AVS}) \): This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Traits like a curiosity about nature, empathy for animals, and appreciation for dedication align strongly with this field. So, let's assume \( P(E | H_{AVS}) \) to be 0.7 (70%).
   - \( P(E | \neg H_{AVS}) \): This is the probability of observing Adamâ€™s personality sketch given that he was enrolled in any field other than Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Conservatively, let's set this to be 0.2 (20%).
   
   Using Bayes' rule:

   \[
   P(H_{AVS} | E) = \frac{P(E | H_{AVS}) \times P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)}
   \]

   Since \( P(E) = P(E | H_{AVS}) \times P(H_{AVS}) + P(E | \neg H_{AVS}) \times P(\neg H_{AVS}) \):

   \[
   P(E) = (0.7 \times 0.1) + (0.2 \times 0.9) = 0.07 + 0.18 = 0.25
   \]

   So:

   \[
   P(H_{AVS} | E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.1}{0.25} = 0.28
   \]

Given these computations:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.077,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.28
}
