To compute \( P(H|E) \), Bayes' Rule is used as follows:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given two fields, business administration and agricultural and veterinary science, we need to evaluate the probabilities for each field.

### Assumptions and Assigned Probabilities:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - The field of agricultural and veterinary science is less common than business administration among graduate students, but more aligned with Adam’s described interests. 
   - Assume a modest prior probability for both fields:
     - \( P(H_{\text{bus}}) \): 0.3 (business administration)
     - \( P(H_{\text{agri}}) \): 0.1 (agricultural and veterinary science)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Given Adam’s personality sketch, it is more likely that his interests and characteristics align with agricultural and veterinary science than business administration.
     - \( P(E|H_{\text{bus}}) \): 0.1 (business administration)
     - \( P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) \): 0.6 (agricultural and veterinary science)

3. **Complementary Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - Less likely that Adam’s personality aligns with business administration given all other fields.
   - Unlikely that his personality aligns perfectly with many other fields, but still somewhat possible for fields related to social sciences or humanities.
     - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{bus}}) \): 0.2
     - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agri}}) \): 0.3

Bayes' Rule will be applied to each field.

### Calculation:

1. **Business Administration**:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{bus}})P(H_{\text{bus}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{bus}})P(\neg H_{\text{bus}}) \]
\[ P(E_{\text{bus}}) = 0.1 \times 0.3 + 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.03 + 0.14 = 0.17 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{bus}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{bus}}) \times P(H_{\text{bus}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{bus}}|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.3}{0.17} \approx 0.176 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{agri}})P(H_{\text{agri}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{agri}})P(\neg H_{\text{agri}}) \]
\[ P(E_{\text{agri}}) = 0.6 \times 0.1 + 0.3 \times 0.9 = 0.06 + 0.27 = 0.33 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) \times P(H_{\text{agri}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.1}{0.33} \approx 0.182 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are as follows:

{
  "business administration": 0.176,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.182
}
