To calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to assess the following probabilities for each field of study:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in each field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the evidence (the personality sketch) given that Adam is enrolled in each field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is not enrolled in each field.

The Bayes' rule formula is:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assuming the base rates (prior probabilities) \( P(H) \) for simplifying, let's assign:
- \( P(H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science: 0.1
- \( P(H) \) for business administration: 0.1

And for the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \):
- Given the evidence, Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy strongly align with agricultural and veterinary science.
- Given the evidence, Adam's characteristics do not strongly align with business administration.

Thus, let's assume:
- \( P(E|H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science: 0.9
- \( P(E|H) \) for business administration: 0.2

And for the likelihoods \( P(E|\neg H) \):
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) would be lower for fields that are unrelated to the evidence provided.

Assuming \(*). Let's adopt:
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science: 0.05
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) for business administration: 0.5

Based on Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is a normalization constant;
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.1) + (0.05 \cdot 0.9) = 0.09 + 0.045 = 0.135 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{0.135} = 0.666 \]

For business administration:
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.5 \cdot 0.9) = 0.02 + 0.45 = 0.47 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.47} \approx 0.0426 \]

So the results are:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.666,
  "business administration": 0.0426
}
