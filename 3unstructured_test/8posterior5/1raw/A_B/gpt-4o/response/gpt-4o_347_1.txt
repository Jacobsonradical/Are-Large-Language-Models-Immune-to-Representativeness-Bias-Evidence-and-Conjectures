To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which states that:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field, given his personality sketch.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch, given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch, given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.

Since we are comparing probabilities for two fields, \( P(E) \) is a constant and will not affect the relative comparison between the fields, hence it can be ignored for now.

Let's estimate reasonable values for each term:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work, it seems highly consistent with a field related to agriculture and veterinary science.

- \( P(H) \): Considering the relative number of students enrolled in various fields, let's reasonably assume a prior probability of 0.05.
- \( P(E|H) \): Given that this field fits very well with Adam's personality sketch, a high likelihood of 0.9 seems reasonable.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): For fields other than agricultural and veterinary science, the likelihood of this personality sketch being observed might be moderate, say 0.2.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) + P(E|H) \cdot P(H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.2 \cdot 0.95 + 0.9 \cdot 0.05} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.19} \approx 0.237 \]

### Business Administration

Adam's personality traits seem less closely aligned with business administration, which may value different characteristics such as strategic thinking and leadership, rather than empathy and love for nature.

- \( P(H) \): Considering the popularity of business administration programs, we might assign a higher prior probability of 0.2.
- \( P(E|H) \): Since the personality sketch does not closely fit business administration, let's assume a moderate likelihood of 0.2.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): For fields other than business administration, the likelihood of this personality sketch might be similar, say 0.3.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) + P(E|H) \cdot P(H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.3 \cdot 0.8 + 0.2 \cdot 0.2} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.24 + 0.04} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.28} \approx 0.143 \]

Based on these calculations, the probabilities are as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.237,
  "business administration": 0.143
}
```

These values indicate that, given Adam's personality sketch, it is more likely that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary sciences compared to business administration.
