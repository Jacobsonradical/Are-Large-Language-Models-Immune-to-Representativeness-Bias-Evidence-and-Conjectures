To compute the probabilities, we'll use Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given the personality sketch, \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch being true given the specific field, \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in that field, and \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the personality sketch, which can be broken down into:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For simplicity, I'll provide approximate values:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: Being a graduate student in Agricultural and Veterinary Science in a U.S. university can be assumed to be relatively uncommon, so let's estimate this at 0.05.
- **P(E|H)**: Given his characteristics, it is very likely that someone with Adam's profile would be drawn towards Agricultural and Veterinary Science due to his love for nature, plants, and animals. We'll estimate a high probability here, say 0.8.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Among people not studying Agricultural and Veterinary Science, there would be fewer people with Adam’s attributes, but still a significant number in other fields (like biology, environmental science). We can estimate this at 0.1.

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: Being a graduate student in Business Administration is relatively common, so let's estimate this at 0.15.
- **P(E|H)**: Given Adam’s profile, it is not very likely he would be enrolled in Business Administration because his interests do not align well. We'll estimate this at 0.05.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Among people not studying Business Administration, the probability of having Adam's profile is higher since nature and animals are not typical interests in Business Administration. We can estimate this at 0.2.

Now, let's compute \( P(H|E) \):

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.05) + (0.1 \times 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.095 = 0.135 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.135} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.135} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.296 \]

### For Business Administration
\[ P(E) = (0.05 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.0075 + 0.17 = 0.1775 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.15}{0.1775} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.0075}{0.1775} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.042 \]

So, the final probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.296,
  "business administration": 0.042
}
```
