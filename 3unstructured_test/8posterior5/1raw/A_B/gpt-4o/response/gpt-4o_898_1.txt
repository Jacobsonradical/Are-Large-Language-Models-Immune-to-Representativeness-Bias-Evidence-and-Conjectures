Before I proceed to compute the values based on Bayes rule, let's break down the necessary components for each hypothesis.

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science (denoted as Hypothesis H₁):
- P(H₁): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in this field.
- P(E|H₁): The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is in this field.
- P(E|¬H₁): The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in this field.

For Business Administration (denoted as Hypothesis H₂):
- P(H₂): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in this field.
- P(E|H₂): The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is in this field.
- P(E|¬H₂): The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in this field.

### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- P(H₁): A rough estimate for this field might be moderate given Adam's interests and empathy towards animals. Let's set this at 0.15.
- P(E|H₁): The personality sketch fits very well with interests in nature, high intelligence, and empathy. Let's assign a high likelihood, 0.8.
- P(E|¬H₁): The probability that someone with Adam's personality sketch would be in another field, much lower. Let's say 0.2.

### 2. Business Administration:
- P(H₂): This field is less aligned with Adam's personality sketch. Let's set this prior to 0.05.
- P(E|H₂): A personality focusing on nature, animals, and empathy is less likely in business administration, so we'll set this to 0.1.
- P(E|¬H₂): Given a strong personality match with other non-business fields, let's set this to 0.3.

Now, applying Bayes rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) \) is calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) P(H) + P(E|\neg H) P(\neg H) \]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H₁):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H₁) P(H₁) + P(E|¬H₁) P(¬H₁) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]
\[ P(H₁|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.414 \]

For Business Administration (H₂):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H₂) P(H₂) + P(E|¬H₂) P(¬H₂) = (0.1 \times 0.05) + (0.3 \times 0.95) = 0.005 + 0.285 = 0.29 \]
\[ P(H₂|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.05}{0.29} = \frac{0.005}{0.29} \approx 0.017 \]

Therefore, the results are:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.414,
  "business administration": 0.017
}
