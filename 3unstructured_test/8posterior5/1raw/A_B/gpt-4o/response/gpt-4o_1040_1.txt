To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Rule, we need prior probabilities \( P(H) \), conditional probabilities \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Assume equal priors for simplicity unless otherwise specified. The formula for Bayes’ Rule is as follows:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where:

\(
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\)

Let's break down each field with some reasonable assumptions:

### 1. Business Administration

- **P(H):** Let's assume the prior probability \( P(H) \) for Adam being enrolled in business administration is relatively low. Given Adam's personality traits, such as his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy, this field might be less likely. Let's say \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

- **P(E|H):** The probability that Adam's personality sketch (E) fits someone in business administration might also be low due to the mismatch between interests and typical personality traits in this field. Let's say \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

- **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of the personality sketch regardless of enrollment in business administration. Assuming all other graduate fields, this probability might be higher since Adam's personality fits many other fields better. Let's say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \).

### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H):** Given the strong alignment between Adam’s interests (nature, plants, and animals) and this field, the prior probability \( P(H) \) should be higher. Let's say \( P(H) = 0.4 \).

- **P(E|H):** The likelihood that Adam fits the personality sketch if he is in this field should be high. Let's say \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

- **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of the personality sketch regardless of not being in agricultural and veterinary science. Let’s say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

### Calculations Using Bayes' Rule

1. **Business Administration**

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

\[
P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.6 \cdot 0.8 = 0.02 + 0.48 = 0.5
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.5} = 0.04
\]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

\[
P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.4 + 0.3 \cdot 0.6 = 0.32 + 0.18 = 0.5
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.4}{0.5} = 0.64
\]

### Final Answer:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.04,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.64
}
```

These probabilities reflect that Adam is significantly more likely, given his personality sketch, to have been enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration.
