To determine \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to estimate the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he is enrolled in that given field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he is not enrolled in that given field.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) \) can be derived from:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

We assume reasonable values for these probabilities based on the provided personality sketch and general tendencies:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Since it's less common than business administration but still a field Adam's traits fit into well, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam’s traits if he is in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, let's set \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam’s traits if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume that these traits are somewhat common across other fields, so \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Using these values:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9 = 0.08 + 0.27 = 0.35 \]

Then,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.35} \approx 0.229 \]

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration. Business administration is a common graduate field, so let's set \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam’s traits if he is in business administration. Since his traits do not particularly align with typical traits associated with business administration, let’s set \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam’s traits if he is not in business administration. Same as above, \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Using these values:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8 = 0.04 + 0.24 = 0.28 \]

Then,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.28} \approx 0.143 \]
