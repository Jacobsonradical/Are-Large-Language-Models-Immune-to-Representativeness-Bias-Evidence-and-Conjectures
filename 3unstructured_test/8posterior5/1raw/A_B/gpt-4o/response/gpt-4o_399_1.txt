We can use Bayes' rule to calculate \( P(H|E) \), the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch. Bayes' rule is defined as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the evidence.

Since \( P(E) \) is constant for all calculations, we can simplify our comparison by focusing on the numerator \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

Let's analyze each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): Given his curiosity about nature and love for animals, this field seems like a strong fit for Adam. Let's assume a reasonably high prior probability, say 0.2 (since we don't know the exact distribution of students in different fields).
- \( P(E|H) \): The personality sketch fits very well with this field, as it involves nature, plants, and animals. We might put this at 0.9.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability that someone with Adam's personality sketch would end up in a field other than agricultural and veterinary science might be moderate, say 0.1.

Using these values, we get:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.9 \cdot 0.2 = 0.18 \]

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): His interests and strengths (nature, animals, solving puzzles, empathy) do not strongly indicate a fit for business administration. Let's assume a lower prior probability, say 0.05.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of someone with Adam's personality sketch choosing business administration seems quite low; let's assume 0.1.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Maintaining the previous assumption of a moderate probability, say 0.1.

Using these values, we get:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.05 = 0.005 \]

#### Summary

Normalizing to get values between 0 and 1:

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} \approx \frac{0.18}{0.18 + 0.005} = \frac{0.18}{0.185} \approx 0.973 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} \approx \frac{0.005}{0.18 + 0.005} = \frac{0.005}{0.185} \approx 0.027 \]

Thus:
