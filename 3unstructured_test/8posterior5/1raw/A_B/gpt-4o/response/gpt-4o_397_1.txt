To determine the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we'll follow these steps:

1. Estimate \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field.
2. Estimate \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in each field.
3. Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in that field.
4. Use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \).

### Estimations:

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)**: Graduate students in agricultural and veterinary science are less common compared to some other fields, but given Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, we will assign a prior chance, say 0.1.
- **P(E|H)**: If Adam is in this field, it is highly likely that his personality traits fit, especially his love for nature and animals. This could be quite high, let's assign 0.8.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: If Adam is not in this field, other fields may not match his traits quite as well, so this chance can be lower, say 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H)) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) = 0.08 + 0.27 = 0.35 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.35} = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \approx 0.229 \]

#### Business Administration

- **P(H)**: Graduate students in business administration are quite common, but considering Adam's personality sketch does not strongly align with typical business characteristics, we can assign this reasonably, say 0.2.
- **P(E|H)**: If Adam is in this field, the fit in terms of empathy and intelligence might be present, but the love for nature, plants, and animals is not typical, say low, 0.2.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: For other fields, the fit might be more common, especially in sciences or vet, let this be 0.4.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H)) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.2) + (0.4 \cdot 0.8) = 0.04 + 0.32 = 0.36 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.36} = \frac{0.04}{0.36} \approx 0.111 \]

Here is the completed answer:

  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.229,
