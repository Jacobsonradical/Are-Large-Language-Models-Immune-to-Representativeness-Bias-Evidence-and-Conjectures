To calculate P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probability P(H), the likelihood P(E|H), and the evidence P(E). The formula we will use is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have exact values, we'll make reasonable assumptions based on the provided personality sketch and the chosen fields of study.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability (P(H) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science)**:
   - Let's assume that the probability of someone being enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science as a graduate student in the U.S. is modestly probable, given the number of specializations available.
   - P(H) ≈ 0.1 (10%)

2. **Likelihood (P(E|H) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science)**:
   - Adam's characteristics (curiosity about nature, love for animals, appreciation for hard work) strongly align with a field like Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
   - P(E|H) ≈ 0.8 (80%)

3. **Likelihood of Evidence Given Not The Hypothesis (P(E|¬H) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science)**:
   - There are other specialized fields that may also align with Adam's personality traits, such as biology, ecology, etc., but to a slightly lesser extent.
   - P(E|¬H) ≈ 0.2 (20%)

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability (P(H) for Business Administration)**:
   - Let's assume that Business Administration is a common field of study, thus initially receiving a slightly higher prior probability.
   - P(H) ≈ 0.2 (20%)

2. **Likelihood (P(E|H) for Business Administration)**:
   - Adam's traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy) do not strongly align with Business Administration, except for his intelligence and potential appreciation of hard work, which are valuable traits in any field.
   - P(E|H) ≈ 0.3 (30%)

3. **Likelihood of Evidence Given Not The Hypothesis (P(E|¬H) for Business Administration)**:
   - Given the specific interest in nature and animals, other fields might match better, reducing the likelihood that a different field fits this personality sketch.
   - P(E|¬H) ≈ 0.8 (80%)

### Applying Bayes' Rule

We also need to calculate the evidence P(E), which can be found by considering the total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

Since we have two hypotheses for simplicity, we'll assume:

\[ P(\text{agri}) = 0.1, \quad P(\text{bus}) = 0.2 \]

Let's compute these for both fields:

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E)_{agri} = (P(E|H) \cdot P(H)) + (P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H)) \]

\[ P(E)_{agri} = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) = 0.08 + 0.18 = 0.26 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{agri} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.26} = \frac{0.08}{0.26} ≈ 0.307 \]

#### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E)_{bus} = (P(E|H) \cdot P(H)) + (P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H)) \]

\[ P(E)_{bus} = (0.3 \cdot 0.2) + (0.8 \cdot 0.8) = 0.06 + 0.64 = 0.7 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{bus} ≈ \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.7} = \frac{0.06}{0.7} ≈ 0.086 \]

Therefore, the values are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.307,
  "business administration": 0.086
}
