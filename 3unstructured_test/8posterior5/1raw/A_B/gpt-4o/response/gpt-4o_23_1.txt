To use Bayes' rule for updating the likelihood that Adam is studying a particular field given his personality sketch, we first need to define our probabilities. 

Bayes' rule can be articulated as follows:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of H given E.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of E given H.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of H.
- \( P(E) \) is the evidence probability, which can be seen as a normalization factor.

For simplicity, let’s assign hypothetical values and compute the posterior for the two fields: business administration and agricultural and veterinary science.

### Business Administration
- **P(H):** Probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration. Let's assume it is 0.15 (since there are many fields, this is moderately probable).
- **P(E|H):** Probability of Adam’s personality sketch if he were in business administration. Given that business administration is not necessarily closely tied to a deep love for nature, animals, abstract concepts, or solving puzzles, this might be relatively low. Let’s assume 0.02.
- **P(E|\(\neg\)H):** Probability of Adam’s personality sketch given he is not in business administration. Considering that the personality traits are not typical for business administration, this could be higher. Let’s assume 0.1.

Now, compute P(H|E):
\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]
Note: \( P(E) \) is the sum of probabilities across all fields but for the sake of simplicity, we’ll approximate it by considering the given fields only.

\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) \approx (0.02 \times 0.15) + (0.1 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.003 + 0.085 = 0.088 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02 \times 0.15}{0.088} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.034 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H):** Probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let’s assume it is 0.05 (less common but relevant to his interests).
- **P(E|H):** Given Adam’s personality, this field is closely aligned with his love for nature, plants, animals, and appreciation of hard work. We'll assume a high value, say 0.7.
- **P(E|\(\neg\)H):** Given the personality sketch, if Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science, this probability would involve all other fields, so we might assume it’s lower than the specific field. Let’s assume 0.04.

Now, compute P(H|E):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) \approx (0.7 \times 0.05) + (0.04 \times 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.035 + 0.038 = 0.073 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.05}{0.073} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.479 \]

### Summary

  "business administration": 0.034,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.479
