Let's analyze each field in more detail.

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a business administration program. Given a large number of graduate fields, let's assume:
   - P(H) for business administration: 0.1 (since business administration is a popular field but there are many options).
   
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is enrolled in business administration.
   - While curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals might not align directly with typical traits of a business administration student, intelligence and appreciation for hard work do. In this case, we'll assign:
   - P(E|H) for business administration: 0.2.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is not enrolled in business administration.
   - Given that E is somewhat specific to a person with natural curiosity and empathy (more aligned with science fields), this probability would be moderate:
   - P(E|\neg H): 0.4 (as there could be considerable fields matching this profile better than business administration).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.4 \cdot 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.36 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.38 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.38} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.38} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.053 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Considering this field is less enrolled in relative to others: 
   - P(H) for agricultural and veterinary science: 0.05.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - The characteristics like love for nature, empathy, and animals are highly aligned with this field. Therefore:
   - P(E|H) for agricultural and veterinary science: 0.7.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Given similar logic to the business administration section:
   - P(E|\neg H): 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.95 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.7 \cdot 0.05 + 0.3 \cdot 0.95 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.035 + 0.285 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.32 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{0.32} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.035}{0.32} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.109 \]

Thus, the calculated probabilities are summarized as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.053,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.109
}
