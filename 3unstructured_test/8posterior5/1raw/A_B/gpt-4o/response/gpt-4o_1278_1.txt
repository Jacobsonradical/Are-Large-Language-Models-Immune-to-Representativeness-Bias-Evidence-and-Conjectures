To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study using Bayes' rule, we need to start with the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the marginal likelihood \( P(E) \). We'll approximate these probabilities based on the information provided and general assumptions about graduate studies in these fields.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
**Hypothesis (H):** Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Graduate students enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science represent a smaller subset of the total graduate population compared to more common fields like business administration. Let's approximate this as 0.05.

- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy, it's very likely he would fit into this field. Let's set this high, at around 0.9.

- **Marginal Probability \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Considering the same characteristics are less common but not absent in other fields, let's approximate this as 0.1.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.9 \cdot 0.05 + 0.1 \cdot 0.95} = \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.095} = \frac{0.045}{0.14} \approx 0.321 \]

### Business Administration
**Hypothesis (H):** Adam was enrolled in business administration.

- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Business administration is a very common field. Let's approximate this as 0.2.

- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam’s interests and personality traits do not strongly align with a typical business administration profile, but it’s not impossible. Let’s estimate this likelihood as 0.2.

- **Marginal Probability \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This would be somewhat higher as Adam’s profile better fits non-business fields. Let's set this at 0.8.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.2 \cdot 0.2 + 0.8 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.64} = \frac{0.04}{0.68} \approx 0.059 \]

### Summary
Based on the calculations:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.321,
  "business administration": 0.059
}
```

Note: These values are based on the given sketch and logical assumptions made about the relative sizes and fit of these fields to the personality traits described. The probabilities would require real-world data to be precisely accurate.
