To determine the probabilities of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science or business administration, we'll use the given personality sketch (E) and apply Bayes' rule.

Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in the specified field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence, which can be derived from \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Let's evaluate each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

   - \( P(H) \): We assume a relatively moderate prior probability that Adam might be enrolled in this field, say 0.1, since it's a specialized field.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, which fits well with agricultural and veterinary science, we might assign a high probability, say 0.8.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): For the fields other than agricultural and veterinary science, the given personality traits are not as strongly correlated. We might assign a lower probability, say 0.2.

2. **Business Administration**

   - \( P(H) \): We assume a higher prior probability that Adam might be in a more common and diverse field like business administration, say 0.2.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's traits, business administration isn't a perfect fit but isn't entirely implausible either. We might assign a moderate probability, say 0.3.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): For the fields other than business administration, the given personality traits are more likely to fit relatively well. We might assign a moderate probability, say 0.5.

Now, let's calculate \( P(H|E) \):

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

   \[
   P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) = 0.08 + 0.18 = 0.26
   \]
   
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.26} = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \approx 0.308
   \]

2. **Business Administration**

   \[
   P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) = (0.3 \cdot 0.2) + (0.5 \cdot 0.8) = 0.06 + 0.4 = 0.46
   \]

   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.46} = \frac{0.06}{0.46} \approx 0.130
   \]

Therefore, the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.308,
  "business administration": 0.130
}
