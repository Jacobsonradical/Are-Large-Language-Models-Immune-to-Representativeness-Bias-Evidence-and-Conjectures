To apply Bayes' Rule, we need to determine the conditional probabilities involved. Bayes' Rule is computed as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) if the hypothesis \( H \) is true.
- \( P(E| \neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) if the hypothesis \( H \) is false.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence \( E \).

For this specific problem, the overall probability \( P(E) \) can be factored out in the relative likelihoods comparisons since we're only comparing the probabilities across different hypotheses. Instead, we focus on the ratios.

Let's evaluate accordingly:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H): \) Prior probability that a random graduate student is in this field (could be estimated from known statistics, likely less than business but not negligible).
   - \( P(E|H): \) Likelihood of Adam's personality sketch, given he is in this field (high since his interests in nature and animals align well).
   - \( P(E| \neg H): \) Likelihood of Adam's personality sketch, given he is not in this field (lower because his attributes fit well with this field).

2. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H): \) Prior probability that a random graduate student is in this field (likely higher given its popularity).
   - \( P(E|H): \) Likelihood of Adam's personality sketch, given he is in this field (lower since his interests and personality align less well with this field).
   - \( P(E| \neg H): \) Likelihood of Adam's personality sketch, given he is not in this field (higher given his interests in nature and animals).

Based on these qualitative evaluations:

\[
\begin{aligned}
P(H|E) & \approx \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \\
\text{"agricultural and veterinary science"} & \approx 0.7 \quad \text{(Higher likelihood due to personality alignment)} \\
\text{"business administration"} & \approx 0.2 \quad \text{(Lower likelihood due to less alignment with personality)}
\end{aligned}
\]

So, the computational values for \( P(H|E) \) using these qualitative assessments are:

\[
\text{{{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}}}
\]
