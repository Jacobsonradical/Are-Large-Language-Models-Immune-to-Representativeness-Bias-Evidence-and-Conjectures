To apply Bayes' Rule, we need to evaluate the following probabilities for each field:

1. \( P(H) \) - The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field before considering his personality sketch.
2. \( P(E|H) \) - The probability of Adam having the personality sketch E given he was enrolled in a particular field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - The probability of Adam having the personality sketch E given he was not enrolled in that field.
4. \( P(H|E) \) - The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch.

Using Bayes' Theorem: 

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the personality sketch E, which can be computed using:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For simplicity, we'll assume reasonable values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) based on the description and common knowledge about those fields.

### Evaluating Probabilities for Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H) (prior probability)**  
   Suppose the prior probability \( P(H) \) for a random graduate student to be in agricultural and veterinary science is approximately 0.05.

2. **P(E|H) (likelihood)**  
   Given Adam's keen interest in nature, plants, and animals, the probability of his personality sketch given that he's in agricultural and veterinary science is quite high. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H) (likelihood for all other fields)**  
   The probability of having Adam's personality sketch if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science is lower, as not all fields match his interests so closely. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

### Evaluating Probabilities for Business Administration

1. **P(H) (prior probability)**  
   Suppose the prior probability \( P(H) \) for a random graduate student to be in business administration is approximately 0.1.

2. **P(E|H) (likelihood)**  
   Given Adam's interests, the probability of having his personality sketch if he is in business administration is lower. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H) (likelihood for all other fields)**  
   The probability of having Adam's personality sketch if he is not in business administration is very similar to the overall, let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.25 \).

### Calculations

Let's calculate these values step-by-step:

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \)  
   \( P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.95 \)  
   \( P(E) = 0.04 + 0.19 \)  
   \( P(E) = 0.23 \)

2. Using Bayes' Rule:   
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]  
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.23} \]  
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.23} \]  
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.174 \]

#### Business Administration
1. \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \)  
   \( P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.1 + 0.25 \cdot 0.9 \)  
   \( P(E) = 0.01 + 0.225 \)  
   \( P(E) = 0.235 \)

2. Using Bayes' Rule:   
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]  
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.235} \]  
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.235} \]  
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.043 \]

### Final Output
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.174,
  "business administration": 0.043
}
```

Note: These are approximate values based on reasonable assumptions. Actual probabilities might differ with more precise data.
