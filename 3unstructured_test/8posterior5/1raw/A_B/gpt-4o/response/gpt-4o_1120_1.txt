To apply Bayes' rule, we need to determine the following probabilities for each field:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in the given field.

Additionally, using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) (the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) regardless of the field) is constant for all fields we are comparing, we can compare the relative values directly without knowing \( P(E) \).

Let's make the following educated assumptions:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Relatively high, because Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and a deep love for animals.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Relatively high, because the personality traits align well with the field.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Lower, as it would be less common to have someone with these traits outside this field.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): Relatively low, because the personality traits don’t strongly align with typical characteristics of this field.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Low, as the personality traits are less indicative of someone in business administration.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Higher, because someone with these traits is less likely to be in business administration.

Based on these assumptions, let’s assign tentative numerical values and calculate:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) = 0.3 \): Assumed a higher prior probability.
- \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \): High due to strong alignment.
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \): Lower probability when not in the field.

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) = 0.1 \): Assumed a lower prior probability.
- \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \): Low due to weak alignment.
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.8 \): Higher probability when not in the field.

Using Bayes' rule for \( P(H|E) \):

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  \[
  P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.3}{(0.8 \cdot 0.3) + (0.2 \cdot 0.7)} = \frac{0.24}{0.24 + 0.14} = \frac{0.24}{0.38} \approx 0.632
  \]

- **Business Administration**:
  \[
  P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{(0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.8 \cdot 0.9)} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.72} = \frac{0.02}{0.74} \approx 0.027
  \]

So the results are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.632,
  "business administration": 0.027
}
```

These calculations suggest a much higher probability that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science compared to Business Administration, given his personality sketch.
