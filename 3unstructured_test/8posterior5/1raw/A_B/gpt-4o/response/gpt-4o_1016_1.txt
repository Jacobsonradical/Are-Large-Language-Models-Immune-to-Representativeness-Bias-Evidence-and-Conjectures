Sure, let's break down the probabilities step by step for each of the fields.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
   - Graduate students in the U.S. enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science are relatively common, but not as common as some other fields like business or engineering. Let's assume a prior probability of 0.05 (5%).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing E given that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
   - Given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, it is very likely that he would fit into this field. Let's assume this probability to be 0.9 (90%).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing E given that Adam is not enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
   - While Adam's characteristics could apply to other fields, they are not as strongly aligned as with Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Let's assume this probability to be 0.1 (10%).

Using Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)} \):

\( P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.05}{0.9 \times 0.05 + 0.1 \times 0.95} \)
\( P(H|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.095} \)
\( P(H|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.14} = 0.321 \)

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration.
   - Business is one of the most common graduate fields in the U.S. Let's assume a prior probability of 0.2 (20%).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing E given that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration.
   - Adam's characteristics are not particularly aligned with those typically found in business students. Let's assume this probability to be 0.1 (10%).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing E given that Adam is not enrolled in Business Administration.
   - The observation E is not negated significantly when Adam is in other fields. Let's assume this probability to be 0.2 (20%).

Using Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \):

\( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)} \)

\( P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.1 \times 0.2 + 0.2 \times 0.8} \)
\( P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.16} \)
\( P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.18} = 0.111 \)

Putting the results together:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.321,
  "business administration": 0.111
