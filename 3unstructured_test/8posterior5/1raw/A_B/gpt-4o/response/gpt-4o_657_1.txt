To apply Bayes' rule, we need to know the following probabilities:
1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a certain field.
2. \( P(E | H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E | \neg H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in that field.
4. \( P(H | E) \): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field given his personality sketch.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we are comparing between "agricultural and veterinary science" and "business administration", we don't need the absolute values of \( P(H) \) and \( P(E) \); we can provide a relative comparison.

### Hypotheses
- \( H_1 \): Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( H_2 \): Adam was enrolled in business administration.

Given Adam's personality sketch (E), we can make educated guesses about the probabilities:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H_1) \): Prior probability, let's assume to be moderate since it's a plausible graduate field for Adam.
- \( P(E | H_1) \): High, because his love for nature, animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work align well with agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E | \neg H_1) \): Moderate, considering other fields may also accommodate some of his traits, but not as strongly.

### Business Administration
- \( P(H_2) \): Prior probability, let's assume to be lower because it's less aligned with his interests and personality traits.
- \( P(E | H_2) \): Low, because his personality and interests don't align strongly with typical characteristics of business administration students.
- \( P(E | \neg H_2) \): Relatively high, considering many other fields could better suit his personality.

### Calculation
To estimate the values:
- \( P(E | H_1) \approx 0.8 \)
- \( P(E | \neg H_1) \approx 0.3 \)
- \( P(E | H_2) \approx 0.2 \)
- \( P(E | \neg H_2) \approx 0.4 \)

Without exact prior probabilities \( P(H_1) \) and \( P(H_2) \), we'll assume a moderate prior probability for each (say 0.2 for both).

### Bayes' Calculation
\[ P(H_1 | E) \approx \frac{P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]
\[ \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_2 | E) \approx \frac{P(E | H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E)} \]
\[ \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both, we compare the numerators directly.
\[ P(H_1 | E) \propto 0.16 \]
\[ P(H_2 | E) \propto 0.04 \]

Based on these calculations:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
