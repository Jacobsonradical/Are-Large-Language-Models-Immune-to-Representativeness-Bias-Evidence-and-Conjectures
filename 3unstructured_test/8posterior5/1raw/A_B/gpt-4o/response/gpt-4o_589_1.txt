To calculate the probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the fields given his personality sketch, we will use Bayes' theorem. The theorem is formulated as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

Let's assign values to these probabilities for each field.

### Business Administration

- Prior Probability \( P(H) \):
  Let's assume that the probability of a graduate student studying business administration is 0.20 (this is a rough estimate). 

- Probability of Evidence Given Hypothesis \( P(E|H) \):
  The traits of Adam do not strongly align with the typical traits of a business administration student. However, there might be some overlap since strong intelligence and problem-solving are useful in business. Let's assign \( P(E|H) \) a relatively low value, say 0.10.

- Probability of Evidence Given Not Hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H) \):
  Considering that many other fields might align more closely with Adam's traits, let’s assign this a higher value, say 0.05.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.10 \cdot 0.20}{P(E)} \]
We don't have the exact value for \( P(E) \), but it's used as a normalizing constant when comparing probabilities.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- Prior Probability \( P(H) \):
  Let's assume that the probability of a graduate student studying agricultural and veterinary science is 0.10.

- Probability of Evidence Given Hypothesis \( P(E|H) \):
  The personality traits of Adam align very well with agricultural and veterinary science (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals). Let's assign \( P(E|H) \) a high value of 0.80.

- Probability of Evidence Given Not Hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H) \): 
  Let’s assign 0.05 again as we compare against other fields.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.10}{P(E)} \]

### Final Calculation

We are comparing the probabilities, and we can ignore \( P(E) \) as it's a normalizing constant:

\[ P(H|E) \text{ for business administration} = \frac{0.10 \cdot 0.20}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) \text{ for agricultural and veterinary science} = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.10}{P(E)} \]

Let's normalize these values to sum up to 1:

First, calculate the intermediate values:

1. For business administration:
\[ 0.10 \cdot 0.20 = 0.02 \]

2. For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ 0.80 \cdot 0.10 = 0.08 \]

Sum the values: 
\[ 0.02 + 0.08 = 0.10 \]

Normalize:
- For business administration: \( \frac{0.02}{0.10} = 0.20 \)
- For agricultural and veterinary science: \( \frac{0.08}{0.10} = 0.80 \)

So, the final answer is:

{
  "business administration": 0.20,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.80
}
