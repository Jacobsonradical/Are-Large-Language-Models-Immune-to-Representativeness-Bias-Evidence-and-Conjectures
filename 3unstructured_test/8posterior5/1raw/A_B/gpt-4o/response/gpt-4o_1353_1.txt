To estimate the probabilities for Adam being enrolled in the fields of business administration and agricultural and veterinary science based on his personality sketch, we'll use Bayes' rule. 

Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \) (that Adam is enrolled in a specific field).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given not \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the overall likelihood of Adam's personality sketch, which could be calculated by the law of total probability but isn't necessary to compare relative probabilities in this case.

Let's denote:
- \( H_{BA} \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( H_{AVS} \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Firstly, let's assign the initial probabilities intuitively:

1. \( P(H_{BA}) \): The probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Since this field is quite common, we might assume a prior probability of around 0.15.
2. \( P(H_{AVS}) \): The probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his interest in nature and animals, this could be somewhat likely, so let's assume 0.10.

Next, we consider \( P(E|H) \):

1. \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he was in business administration. Given his specific interests which are less aligned with this field, this might be low, say 0.05.
2. \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he was in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his interests and nature, this might be high, say 0.70.

Finally, we consider the complementary likelihoods \( P(E|\neg H) \):

1. \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \): The likelihood of Adam’s personality sketch given any field other than business administration. This could be reasonably higher, say 0.20.
2. \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \): The likelihood of Adam’s personality sketch given any field other than agricultural and veterinary science. This could be lower, considering his alignment with AVS, say 0.30.

Now, we calculate using Bayes' rule adjusted for comparison:

\[
P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E) }
\]
Since we are comparing, we simplify relatively:

\[
P(H_{BA}|E) \propto P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) = 0.05 \cdot 0.15 = 0.0075
\]

\[
P(H_{AVS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) = 0.70 \cdot 0.10 = 0.070
\]

Here are the relative probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0075,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.070
}
```

Please note these values do not necessarily sum up to 1, as there are other possible fields of graduate specialization, but they indicate that based on the personality sketch, Adam is significantly more likely to be in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration.
