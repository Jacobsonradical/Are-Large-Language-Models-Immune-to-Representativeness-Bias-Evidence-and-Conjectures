To calculate \(P(H|E)\), we can use Bayesâ€™ rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll need estimates for \(P(H)\), \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E|\neg H)\) for each field.

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **\(P(H)\)**: The prior probability that any random graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume this is relatively moderate since it's a specialized field.
   \[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.1 \]

2. **\(P(E|H)\)**: Probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his interest in nature, animals, and his empathy, this probability is high.
   \[ P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.8 \]

3. **\(P(E|\neg H)\)**: Probability of observing Adam's personality traits given he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Given the uniqueness of his interests and traits aligning with this field, this probability is lower.
   \[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.2 \]

### For Business Administration

1. **\(P(H)\)**: The prior probability that any random graduate student is in business administration. This is likely higher due to its popularity and broader appeal.
   \[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.2 \]

2. **\(P(E|H)\)**: Probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is enrolled in business administration. His interests and disposition do not align as strongly with business administration.
   \[ P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.2 \]

3. **\(P(E|\neg H)\)**: Probability of observing Adam's personality traits given he is not in business administration. Since business administration is quite different from his interests, this probability can be somewhat higher.
   \[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.5 \]

### Calculating \(P(H|E)\)

#### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
1. Numerator \(P(E|H) \cdot P(H)\):
\[0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \]

2. Denominator \(P(E)\):
\[P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)\]
\[P(E) = 0.8 \times 0.1 + 0.2 \times (1 - 0.1)\]
\[P(E) = 0.08 + 0.18 = 0.26 \]

3. \(P(H|E)\):
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \approx 0.3077 \]

#### For Business Administration:
1. Numerator \(P(E|H) \cdot P(H)\):
\[0.2 \times 0.2 = 0.04 \]

2. Denominator \(P(E)\):
\[P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)\]
\[P(E) = 0.2 \times 0.2 + 0.5 \times (1 - 0.2)\]
\[P(E) = 0.04 + 0.4 = 0.44 \]

3. \(P(H|E)\):
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.44} \approx 0.0909 \]
