To compute the probability of Adam being enrolled in each field given his personality sketch, we'll use Bayes' rule. Specifically, we'll calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant that is the same for all fields, we can focus on the proportional scores. Let's denote:
- \( P(H) \) as the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) as the likelihood of Adam’s personality traits given the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) as the likelihood of Adam’s personality traits given he is not in that field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: This could be the prior probability that any given graduate student would be in this field. Let's assume this is a moderate probability.
- **P(E|H)**: The personality sketch fits very well with this field. High empathy, love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work are all very relevant.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of these traits if not in this field is lower but not negligible, as they might be present in other scientific fields.

For estimation:
- Let \( P(H) \approx 0.15 \)
- Let \( P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \)
- Let \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \)

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that any given graduate student would be in business administration might be moderate-high given general student enrollment trends.
- **P(E|H)**: The personality traits are less associated with business administration. While empathy and appreciation for hard work can be relevant, the deep love for nature and animals, and the enjoyment of puzzles abstract concepts, are less aligned.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Higher, as these traits are less indicative of exclusion from non-business fields.

For estimation:
- Let \( P(H) \approx 0.20 \)
- Let \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \)
- Let \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.6 \)

Using Bayes' rule:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ 
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.9 \cdot 0.15 = 0.135 
\]

### Business Administration
\[ 
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.3 \cdot 0.20 = 0.06 
\]

Normalizing these values (total probability adds up to 1):
\[ 
P_{\text{total}} = 0.135 + 0.06 = 0.195 
\]

\[ 
P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} = \frac{0.135}{0.195} \approx 0.692 
\]

\[ 
P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} = \frac{0.06}{0.195} \approx 0.308 
\]

Thus, calculated probabilities are:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.692,
  "business administration": 0.308
}
```
