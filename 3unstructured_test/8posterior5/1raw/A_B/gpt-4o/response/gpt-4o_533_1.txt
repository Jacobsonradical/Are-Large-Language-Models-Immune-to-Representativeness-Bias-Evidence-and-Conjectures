Let's start by estimating the different probabilities for each field based on the given personality sketch of Adam.

### Business Administration

**P(H)**: The prior probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in business administration. Let's assume it's relatively common, so we'll set this at 0.3.

**P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in business administration. Given Adam’s traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy), these are less typical for a business administration student. Let's estimate this as 0.1.

**P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in business administration. Adam’s traits might be more likely in other fields, so we'll estimate this as 0.8.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Substitute the values:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.3}{0.1 \cdot 0.3 + 0.8 \cdot 0.7} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.56} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.03}{0.59} \approx 0.051 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

**P(H)**: The prior probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This is less common than business administration, so we'll set this at 0.15.

**P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. His traits are highly typical for this field, so let's estimate this as 0.9.

**P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Since his traits are quite specific, we’ll set this lower, at 0.2.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Substitute the values:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.15}{0.9 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.135}{0.135 + 0.17} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.135}{0.305} \approx 0.442 \]

So, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.051,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.442
}
```
