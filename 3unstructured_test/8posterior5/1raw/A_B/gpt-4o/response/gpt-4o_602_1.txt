To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis (H) of Adam being enrolled in business administration and agricultural and veterinary science, we need to make certain assumptions about the probabilities involved. Let's denote these as follows:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the evidence (personality sketch) given that Adam is in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the evidence given that Adam is not in that field.
- \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability of Adam being in that field given the personality sketch.

We'll assume the following for simplicity:
- \( P(H) \) is a rough prior probability. Let's assume there are many fields of graduate study, around 10 for simplicity, giving each field a prior probability of around \(0.1\).
- We need to estimate \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \) based on how well the personality sketch fits with the typical characteristics of students in that field.

Let's break it down field by field.

### Business Administration
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Assume approximately \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Students in business administration may not typically have a strong love for nature, animals, or high empathy. 
   - \( P(E|H \text{ for business administration}) \approx 0.2 \)

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - For fields other than business administration, a curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals may be more common.
   - \( P(E|\neg H \text{ for business administration}) \approx 0.8 \)

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Since \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \times 0.1) + (0.8 \times 0.9) = 0.02 + 0.72 = 0.74 \]

Therefore,
\[ P(H|E \text{ for business administration}) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{0.74} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.74} \approx 0.027 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Assume approximately \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Students in this field likely have a strong empathy for animals and curiosity about nature.
   - \( P(E|H \text{ for agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.8 \)

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - For fields other than agricultural and veterinary science, such characteristics may be less common.
   - \( P(E|\neg H \text{ for agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.2 \)

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E \text{ for agricultural and veterinary science}) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Since \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.1) + (0.2 \times 0.9) = 0.08 + 0.18 = 0.26 \]

Therefore,
\[ P(H|E \text{ for agricultural and veterinary science}) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.26} \approx \frac{0.08}{0.26} \approx 0.308 \]

So, the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) given the personality sketch \( E \) for each field are:

{
  "business administration": 0.027,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.308
}
