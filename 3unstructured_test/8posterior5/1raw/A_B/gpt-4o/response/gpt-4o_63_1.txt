Let's go through the reasoning step-by-step for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **P(H)**: This represents the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given his strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, we might assign a relatively high prior probability. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.3 \).
   - **P(E|H)**: This is the probability of the evidence (Adam's personality sketch) given that he is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. His traits appear to align well with this field, so we'd assign a high probability. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: This is the probability of the evidence given that Adam is not enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Assuming his traits might be somewhat less likely in other fields, we might assign a lower probability. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

   Using Bayes rule:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   Here, 
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
   \]
   Let's calculate \( P(E) \):
   \[
   P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.3) + (0.4 \cdot 0.7) = 0.27 + 0.28 = 0.55
   \]

   Now, we calculate \( P(H|E) \):
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.3}{0.55} \approx 0.4909
   \]

2. **Business Administration**:
   - **P(H)**: This represents the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration. Given his traits, it seems less likely he'd be in this field compared to Agricultural and Veterinary Science, so let's assign a lower prior probability. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
   - **P(E|H)**: This is the probability of the evidence (Adam's personality sketch) given that he is enrolled in Business Administration. His traits don't particularly align with this field, so we'd assign a lower probability. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: This is the probability of the evidence given that Adam is not enrolled in Business Administration. Assuming his traits align more with fields outside of Business Administration, we might assign a higher probability. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \).

   Using Bayes rule:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   Here, 
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
   \]
   Let's calculate \( P(E) \):
   \[
   P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.6 \cdot 0.9) = 0.02 + 0.54 = 0.56
   \]

   Now, we calculate \( P(H|E) \):
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.56} \approx 0.0357
   \]

Thus, we have:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4909,
  "business administration": 0.0357
}
