Let's analyze each field with respect to the provided personality sketch (E) of Adam:

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Considering the general population of graduate students, let's assume business administration is a common field. So, we might assign a moderate prior probability, say 0.2.

2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in business administration. His traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, etc.) are not typical for this field. Let's assign a low probability, say 0.05.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in business administration. Since his traits would fit better in other fields, let's assign a higher probability, say 0.2.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We don't have the exact value of \(P(E)\), but we can compare the relative values.
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.05 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.01}{P(E)} \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This field is less common than business administration but not rare. Let's assign a moderate probability, say 0.1.

2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science. His traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy) fit this field well. So, we assign a high probability, say 0.8.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. This might be lower since his traits are particularly well-suited for this field. Let's assign a lower probability, say 0.15.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.08}{P(E)} \]

Without the exact value of \(P(E)\), we can still see that agricultural and veterinary science is significantly more likely compared to business administration.

### Final Values
These values are relative, not absolute. They indicate which field is more likely given Adam's personality sketch.
