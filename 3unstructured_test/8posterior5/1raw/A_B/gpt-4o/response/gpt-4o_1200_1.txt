To apply Bayes' rule and compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in each field given the personality sketch, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Define the components**:
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch fits if he is enrolled in a particular field.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch fits if he is not enrolled in that particular field.
   - \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch.

2. **Assign the probabilities**:
   - Prior probabilities \( P(H) \) should be reflective of how common each field is among graduate students.
   - Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \) should be reflective of how well Adam's personality fits with the typical student in that field.

3. **Calculate using Bayes' rule**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   where \( P(E) \) is the normalizing constant, but we'll focus on proportional comparison.

Let's start by assigning some reasonable probabilities:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**:
   - Prior: Let's assume that the prior probability of a graduate student being in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is relatively moderate, say 0.1 (as it could be less common than fields like business but more than niche fields).

2. **P(E|H)**:
   - Likelihood: Adam's fascination with plants, animals, and nature fits well; let's assign it a high value, say 0.9.
   
3. **P(E|\neg H)**:
   - Likelihood that Adam fits the personality sketch given he is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science may still be moderately high because other fields might still capture similar personalities, especially those related to natural sciences. Let's assign this a value of 0.4.

Then, Bayesian updating gives us:

\[
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.9 \times 0.1 = 0.09
\]

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**:
   - Prior: Business Administration is quite common among graduate students, so let's assign it a higher prior, say 0.3.

2. **P(E|H)**:
   - Likelihood: Adam's empathy, abstract thinking, and modest appreciation for hard work might fit business profiles, but less so than Agricultural and Veterinary Science; let's assign it 0.3.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**:
   - Likelihood of matching the personality sketch outside of Business Administration might still be similar, around 0.4.

Then, Bayesian updating gives us:

\[
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09
\]

Now, we bring these calculations together in the required format:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.09,
  "business administration": 0.09
}
```

This suggests that based on Adam's personality sketch, both fields have a moderate probability. However, the calculations would need posterior predictive normalization with other potential fields to get the exact probabilities, but relative to each other, they display an equivalent fit.
