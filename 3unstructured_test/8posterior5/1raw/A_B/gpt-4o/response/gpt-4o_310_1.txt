To determine the probabilities, we'll use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

While we do not have explicit values for all probabilities, we can make educated estimates based on the given personality sketch of Adam. 

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1)**
   - **P(H1):** Let's assume this probability given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals. We'll estimate it on the higher side, perhaps around \(0.1\) given the wide range of other graduate fields available.
   - **P(E|H1):** Since Adam's personality sketch aligns well with interests in agricultural and veterinary science, we estimate this to be quite high, perhaps \(0.9\).
   - **P(E|\neg H1):** Given that there are many fields that might not fit Adam's personality as well, we might estimate this around \(0.1\).

2. **Business Administration (H2)**
   - **P(H2):** Business Administration seems unlikely given Adam's interests and personality, but it is still possible. We might estimate this to be low, around \(0.05\).
   - **P(E|H2):** Adam's personality does not strongly suggest a fit for Business Administration. We can estimate this to be low, perhaps \(0.2\).
   - **P(E|\neg H2):** This should be similar to the previous case, around \(0.1\).

To apply Bayes' theorem effectively, we also need \(P(E)\), which we can consider in relative terms given the probabilities of the hypotheses under consideration.

Let:
- \( P(E) = 0.1 \times 0.9 + 0.05 \times 0.2 + P(E|other fields) \times P(other fields) \)

For simplicity, let's assume all other fields have a combined P(E) that roughly balances out to our calculations, and is not directly computed here but inferred intuitively. 

Now, we'll calculate for each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ 
P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.9 \times 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.09}{P(E)}
\]

### Business Administration
\[ 
P(H2|E) = \frac{P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.2 \times 0.05}{P(E)} = \frac{0.01}{P(E)}
\]

Given the preliminary assumptions, normalization would keep these values proportional:

\[
P(Agricultural and Veterinary Science) \approx \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.01} = 0.9
\]
\[
P(Business Administration) \approx \frac{0.01}{0.09 + 0.01} = 0.1
\]

So, the final output will be:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.9,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```
