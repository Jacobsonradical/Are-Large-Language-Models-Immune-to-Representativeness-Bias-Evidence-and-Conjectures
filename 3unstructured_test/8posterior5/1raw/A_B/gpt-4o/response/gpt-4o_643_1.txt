To apply Bayes' theorem, we need to evaluate the relevant probabilities for each field. Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis H (Adam being enrolled in a specific field).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the conditional probability of observing the evidence E given the hypothesis H.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the evidence E.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence E given the hypothesis is not true.

Since \( P(E) \) can be broken down into \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \), we can ignore the exact value of \( P(E) \) for relative comparisons since it is a normalization factor that would be the same for both fields.

### Evaluations

1. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of seeing the traits described in E given that Adam is studying business administration.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of seeing the traits described in E if Adam is not studying business administration.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of seeing the traits described in E given that Adam is studying agricultural and veterinary science.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of seeing the traits described in E if Adam is not studying agricultural and veterinary science.

**Estimations for Business Administration:**
- \( P(H) \) might be relatively low since Adam's personality sketch does not particularly align with typical traits associated with business administration.
- \( P(E|H) \) is likely very low since the personality traits of curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy are not typically aligned with business administration.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) would be higher because Adam's traits could make it likely for him to enroll in a variety of other fields.

**Estimations for Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- \( P(H) \) would be relatively higher since Adam's traits strongly align with a natural interest in animals and empathy.
- \( P(E|H) \) would be very high, as his personality sketch matches common traits in this field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) would be lower but not zero, as some people with Adam's traits might study other related fields (e.g., biology, environmental science).

Using these qualitative estimations to derive approximate values:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",  // Low probability given the mismatch in traits.
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"  // High probability given the strong alignment in traits.
}
```

These values reflect the relative probability that Adam's study field aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration based on the provided personality sketch.
