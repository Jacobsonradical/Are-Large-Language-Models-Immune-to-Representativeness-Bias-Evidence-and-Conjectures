To compute the probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for each field given the personality sketch \(E\) of Adam, we need to apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll assume some estimated probabilities for each step in the calculation process. Note that these estimates involve some informed guesswork based on the personality sketch provided.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his personality traits, it's reasonable to assume that people with a deep love for animals and nature are more likely to be in this field compared to business administration. Let's estimate this prior probability as:
   \[ P(H) \approx 0.20 \]
   
2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing the evidence if Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his traits, the evidence strongly aligns with this field. Therefore:
   \[ P(E|H) \approx 0.80 \]

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of observing the evidence if Adam is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This includes enrollment in any other field. Given his personality, the evidence is less likely if he’s in a different field. Let’s estimate it as:
   \[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.30 \]

Now applying Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.20) + (0.30 \cdot 0.80) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.16 + 0.24 = 0.40 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.20}{0.40} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.16}{0.40} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.40 \]

### Business Administration
1. **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration. This field generally requires different personality traits not strongly indicated by the sketch. Let's estimate this prior probability as:
   \[ P(H) \approx 0.10 \]
   
2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing the evidence if Adam is enrolled in business administration. The sketch does not strongly align with this field. Therefore:
   \[ P(E|H) \approx 0.15 \]

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of observing the evidence if Adam is not enrolled in business administration. This includes enrollment in any other field. The evidence is more likely here. Let’s estimate it as:
   \[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.35 \]

Now applying Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.15 \cdot 0.10) + (0.35 \cdot 0.90) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.015 + 0.315 = 0.33 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.15 \cdot 0.10}{0.33} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.015}{0.33} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.045 \]

So, the calculated probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.40,
  "business administration": 0.045
}
```
