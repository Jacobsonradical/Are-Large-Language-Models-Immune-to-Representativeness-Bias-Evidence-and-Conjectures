To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to follow Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we are considering two hypotheses \( H \) (business administration and agricultural and veterinary science), we'll explicitly define the necessary probabilities for each hypothesis.

Let's make reasonable assumptions for the respective probabilities:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Business Administration has a high number of students generally, let's assume \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.3 \).
   - Agricultural and Veterinary Science has fewer students, let's assume \( P(H_{AV}) = 0.1 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - The personality sketch (curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, love for animals) aligns poorly with Business Administration, let's assume \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.1 \).
   - The personality sketch aligns strongly with Agricultural and Veterinary Science, let's assume \( P(E|H_{AV}) = 0.8 \).

3. **Marginal Probability \( P(E) \)**:
   - This is the same for both hypotheses and represents the total probability of the evidence. We calculate it using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{BA})P(H_{BA}) + P(E|H_{AV})P(H_{AV}) + \text{probabilities from other fields} \]

However, since we are not given the exact probabilities for other fields, we will assume those don't affect our relative calculations:

\[ P(E) \approx 0.1 \cdot 0.3 + 0.8 \cdot 0.1 + \text{probabilities from other fields} \approx 0.03 + 0.08 = 0.11 \]

Now, plug these into Bayes' rule for each hypothesis:

1. **Business Administration**:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.3}{0.11} \approx \frac{0.03}{0.11} \approx 0.273 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:

\[ P(H_{AV}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AV}) P(H_{AV})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.11} \approx \frac{0.08}{0.11} \approx 0.727 \]

So the values are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.273,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.727
}
```
