To determine the probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to assess the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in either business administration or agricultural and veterinary science, given the personality sketch \( E \).

Bayes' Rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of \( E \) (constant across hypotheses).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in that field.

Let's break it down:

**1. Business Administration**

- \( P(H) \): Let's assume a relatively low prior probability since business students typically aren't as aligned with nature and animals (hypothetically: 0.2).
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that a business administration student matches the personality sketch of Adam. Given his interest in nature, warm-heartedness, and empathy, this seems low (hypothetically: 0.1).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing such a personality sketch in someone who is not in business administration. This would be higher than \( P(E|H) \) since those traits could be more aligned with other fields (hypothetically: 0.4).
- \( P(E) \): This is the normalization constant but is not needed for the relative comparison.

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

**2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

- \( P(H) \): A higher prior probability because the field aligns well with Adam's interests (hypothetically: 0.4).
- \( P(E|H) \): High, as students in this field are likely to have a deep love for nature and animals (hypothetically: 0.7).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Lower because if Adam is not in this field, these traits are less common but still possible (hypothetically: 0.3).

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.7 \cdot 0.4 = 0.28 \]

To create a relative comparison without the explicit normalization constant \( P(E) \):

- Business Administration: \( 0.02 \)
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( 0.28 \)

Normalized (using proportional values):

- \( \text{Normalized Business Administration} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.28} = \frac{0.02}{0.30} \approx 0.0667 \)
- \( \text{Normalized Agricultural and Veterinary Science} = \frac{0.28}{0.02 + 0.28} = \frac{0.28}{0.30} \approx 0.9333 \)

Thus, in the required format:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0667,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.9333
}
