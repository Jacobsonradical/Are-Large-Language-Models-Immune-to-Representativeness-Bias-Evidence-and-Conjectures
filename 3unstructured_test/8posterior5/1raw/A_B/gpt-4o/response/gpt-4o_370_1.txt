Sure, let's start by assessing the probabilities for each field, taking into account Adam's personality sketch and academic background.

### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's deep love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work, it seems quite plausible that he might choose this field. Let's approximate this value as relatively highâ€”let's say 0.4.
- **P(E|H)**: This is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is studying agricultural and veterinary science. Given that his traits are strongly aligned with this field, this value should be quite high. Let's use 0.8.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: This is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given any other field of study. For simplicity, let's assume there are 10 other fields, and the likelihood of observing these traits in any one of them is lower, say 0.1.

Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.4) + (0.1 \cdot 0.6) = 0.32 + 0.06 = 0.38 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.4}{0.38} = \frac{0.32}{0.38} \approx 0.842 \]

### 2. Business Administration
- **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Given Adam's personality and interests, it is less likely compared to agricultural and veterinary science. Let's choose a lower value, say 0.1.
- **P(E|H)**: This is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is studying business administration. Since business is generally not strongly correlated with his personality traits, let's assign a relatively low value, say 0.2.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: As calculated before, the likelihood of observing these traits in another field is 0.1.

Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.1 \cdot 0.9) = 0.02 + 0.09 = 0.11 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.11} = \frac{0.02}{0.11} \approx 0.182 \]

Based on these calculations:
