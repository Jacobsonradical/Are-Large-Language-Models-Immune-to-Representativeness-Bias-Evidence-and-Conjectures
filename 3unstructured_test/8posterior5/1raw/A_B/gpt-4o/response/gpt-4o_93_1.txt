To estimate the probabilities, let's start by qualitatively assessing the likelihoods, which we can then translate into numerical values.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

#### P(H): Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, various plants, and deep love for animals, it's reasonable to assume he might be inclined toward this field.
- P(H) = 0.3

#### P(E|H): The probability of Adam's personality traits given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
Adam's traits seem to strongly align with this field.
- P(E|H) = 0.7

#### P(E|¬H): The probability of Adam's personality traits given that he is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
While someone with Adam's personality could be in other fields, his traits are less likely in fields unrelated to nature and animals.
- P(E|¬H) = 0.2

Now apply Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.3}{0.7 \cdot 0.3 + 0.2 \cdot 0.7} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.21}{0.21 + 0.14} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.21}{0.35} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.6 \]

### Business Administration

#### P(H): Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
Adam's personality does not suggest a strong inclination towards a field focused on business, given his interests.
- P(H) = 0.1

#### P(E|H): The probability of Adam's personality traits given that he is enrolled in business administration.
It's less likely that someone with Adam's traits is found in this field, although not impossible.
- P(E|H) = 0.1

#### P(E|¬H): The probability of Adam's personality traits given that he is not enrolled in business administration.
Adam's traits are rare in business-related fields but common elsewhere.
- P(E|¬H) = 0.3

Now apply Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.1 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.27} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.28} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.036 \]
