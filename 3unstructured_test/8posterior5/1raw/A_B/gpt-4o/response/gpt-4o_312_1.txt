To address the problem, we need to estimate the values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field. 

Let's start by breaking down the probabilities for each field.

1. **Business Administration**

   **P(H):** Estimate the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a business administration program. Business administration is a common field, but given Adam's interests and characteristics, it seems less probable compared to fields that directly relate to his sketch. Let's assign a lower prior here. 
   - \( P(H)_{\text{business administration}} \approx 0.1 \)

   **P(E|H):** The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in a business administration program. Adam’s interests and attributes do not strongly align with the stereotypical business administration student.
   - \( P(E|H)_{\text{business administration}} \approx 0.1 \)

   **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is *not* in a business administration program. Since Adam's interests are more aligned with other fields, this should be higher.
   - \( P(E|\neg H)_{\text{business administration}} \approx 0.9 \)

   Using Bayes' rule:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))}
   \]

   \[
   P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.1}{0.1 \times 0.1 + 0.9 \times 0.9} = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.81} \approx 0.012
   \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

   **P(H):** Estimate the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This field strongly matches Adam's interests and characteristics. 
   - \( P(H)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} \approx 0.2 \)

   **P(E|H):** The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his curiosity about nature, plants, animals, and empathy, this is a very high probability.
   - \( P(E|H)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} \approx 0.8 \)

   **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given that he is *not* in agricultural and veterinary science. This should be lower since his interests fit well with this field.
   - \( P(E|\neg H)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} \approx 0.3 \)

   Using Bayes' rule:

   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))}
   \]

   \[
   P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.2}{0.8 \times 0.2 + 0.3 \times 0.8} = \frac{0.16}{0.16 + 0.24} = \frac{0.16}{0.40} = 0.4
   \]

Using the computations above, we have:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.012,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4
}
```
