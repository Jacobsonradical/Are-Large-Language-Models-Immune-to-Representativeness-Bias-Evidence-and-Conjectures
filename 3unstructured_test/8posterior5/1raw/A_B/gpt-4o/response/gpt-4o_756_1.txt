Let's break down the problem using Bayes' Theorem, which is \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \).

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given the personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch, regardless of the field.

Let's estimate the values for each field:

### Business Administration
1. **P(H) for Business Administration**: Business Administration is a common field of study. Assuming a balanced environment, let's hypothetically set \( P(H) \) to around 0.2 (20%).
2. **P(E|H) for Business Administration**: Given Adam's love for nature, plants, animals, and his high empathy, the likelihood of this personality sketch is relatively low for someone in Business Administration. Let’s put it at 0.1 (10%).
3. **P(E|\neg H) for Business Administration**: The overall probability that someone not in Business Administration still has Adam’s characteristics. Considering his traits (which are more aligned with fields like natural sciences), let’s set it to 0.5 (50%).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}. \]

Let's assume P(E) is a constant normalization factor, we don't need to compute it as we only compare relative probabilities.

\[ P(H|E)_{Business} \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02. \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: While this field is more specialized, it aligns well with Adam’s personality. Let's set it to 0.1 (10%).
2. **P(E|H) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam’s interests and empathy are a strong match for this field. Let’s set it at 0.8 (80%).
3. **P(E|\neg H) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given these traits are particularly suited to this field, the probability that someone not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science has these characteristics is lower. Let’s set this to 0.4 (40%).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E)_{Agriculture} \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08. \]

Let's compile these relative probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08
}
