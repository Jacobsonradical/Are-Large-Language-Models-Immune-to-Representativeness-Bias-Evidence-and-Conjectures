To answer this question, we'll need to:

1. Estimate the prior probability \(P(H)\) for each field.
2. Estimate the likelihood \(P(E|H)\) of observing the personality traits \(E\) given that Adam is in field \(H\).
3. Estimate the likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\) of observing the personality traits \(E\) given that Adam is not in field \(H\).
4. Use Bayes' Rule to compute the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\) for each field.

Firstly, let's make some reasonable assumptions for \(P(H)\):

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's love for nature, plants, animals, and his empathy, it seems reasonably likely he might choose this field. Let's assign a prior probability \(P(H)\) of 0.15.
- **Business Administration**: This field does not seem to align well with Adam's described interests and personality. We'll assign a lower prior probability \(P(H)\) of 0.05.

Next, let's estimate \(P(E|H)\) for each field, which is the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is in the respective field:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's traits align closely with this field, so we can assign \(P(E|H)\) a value of 0.8.
- **Business Administration**: Adam's traits do not align well with typical business administration traits, so \(P(E|H)\) might be around 0.2.

Now, let's estimate \(P(E|\neg H)\), the likelihood of Adam having these traits given that he is not in the respective field. Since there are many other fields of study, we'll need to consider a general likelihood of these traits for other fields:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Considering the general population of graduate students, the likelihood of someone having these traits if they are not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science might be around 0.3.
- **Business Administration**: The likelihood of having these traits if someone is not in Business Administration might be higher since Adam's traits are fairly common among many other fields; let's assign it a value of 0.5.

Finally, using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To find \(P(E)\):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Due to the calculations being quite contextual and relative, we'll directly infer using the Bayes' formula approximated:

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.3 \cdot 0.85} = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.255} = \frac{0.12}{0.375} \approx 0.32 \]

For **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.05}{0.2 \cdot 0.05 + 0.5 \cdot 0.95} = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.475} = \frac{0.01}{0.485} \approx 0.021 \]

So, the posterior probabilities \(P(H|E)\) are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.32,
  "business administration": 0.021
}
