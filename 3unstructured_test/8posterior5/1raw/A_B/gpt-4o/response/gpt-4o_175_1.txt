To compute the probabilities using Bayes' rule, we need the priors \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the complementary likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \). 

Given Adam's personality sketch, it's reasonable to infer some qualitative estimates of these probabilities. While exact numbers would require more data, we can make educated guesses based on the information provided.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in this field. Let's assume a moderate prior since this is a relatively common field for someone with Adam's interests.
     - Estimate: 0.10 (10%)
     
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam would have the given personality sketch if he were enrolled in this field. Given his love for nature, animals, and an appreciation for hard work, this is quite high.
     - Estimate: 0.70 (70%)
     
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that Adam would have the personality sketch if he were not enrolled in this field. Given the variety of fields, this would be lower.
     - Estimate: 0.20 (20%)

   Using Bayes' Rule: 
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))}
   \]
   Plugging in values:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.70 \cdot 0.10}{0.70 \cdot 0.10 + 0.20 \cdot (1 - 0.10)} = \frac{0.07}{0.07 + 0.18} = \frac{0.07}{0.25} = 0.28
   \]

2. **Business Administration**

   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in this field. While business administration is a common graduate field, it less likely fits Adam's detailed interests.
     - Estimate: 0.15 (15%)
     
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam would have this personality sketch if he were enrolled in business administration. This is lower than for agricultural and veterinary science.
     - Estimate: 0.10 (10%)
     
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that Adam would have the personality sketch if he were not enrolled in business administration.
     - Estimate: 0.20 (20%)
   
   Using Bayes' Rule:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.10 \cdot 0.15}{0.10 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot (1 - 0.15)} = \frac{0.015}{0.015 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85} = \frac{0.015}{0.015 + 0.17} = \frac{0.015}{0.185} = 0.081
   \]
   
So the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.28,
  "business administration": 0.081
}
```
