To use Bayes' rule, we need the following components:

1. \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
2. \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood of observing Adam's characteristics given that he is enrolled in the specific field.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): The likelihood of observing Adam's characteristics given that he is not enrolled in the specific field.
4. \(P(E)\): The overall probability of observing Adam's characteristics.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \(P(E)\) can be treated as a constant when comparing probabilities across different fields, we can focus on evaluating the numerators \(P(E|H) \cdot P(H)\) for each field to determine the relative probabilities.

Based on the given personality sketch of Adam, let's evaluate each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **\(P(H)\)**: The likelihood that any random graduate student was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This could be estimated from national statistics. Let's assume \(P(H_{agricultural}) = 0.05\).
- **\(P(E|H)\)**: Given Adam’s interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy, it's quite likely that his traits are consistent with someone in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume \(P(E|H_{agricultural}) = 0.8\).
- **\(P(E|\neg H)\)**: The likelihood of someone with Adam's traits not being in agricultural and veterinary science should be relatively lower, as these traits align well with the field. Let's assume \(P(E|\neg H_{agricultural}) = 0.2\).

### Business Administration
- **\(P(H)\)**: The likelihood that any random graduate student was enrolled in business administration. This could be higher given the popularity of the field. Let's assume \(P(H_{business}) = 0.2\).
- **\(P(E|H)\)**: The traits given do not strongly align with typical characteristics of a business administration student. Let's assume \(P(E|H_{business}) = 0.1\).
- **\(P(E|\neg H)\)**: Given how broad the field is, the probability of someone outside business administration having Adam’s traits can still remain moderate. Let's assume \(P(E|\neg H_{business}) = 0.9\).

Combining these hypothetical parameters into Bayes' rule calculations for relative comparison:

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H_{agricultural}|E) \propto P(E|H_{agricultural}) \cdot P(H_{agricultural}) \] 
\[ P(H_{agricultural}|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04 \]

#### Business Administration
\[ P(H_{business}|E) \propto P(E|H_{business}) \cdot P(H_{business}) \]
\[ P(H_{business}|E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

Given these computations:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.04,
  "business administration": 0.02
}
```

These numbers illustrate the relative probabilities under our chosen assumptions. Actual values would depend on more precise data and distributions.
