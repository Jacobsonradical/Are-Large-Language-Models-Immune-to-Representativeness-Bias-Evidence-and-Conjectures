To compute the probabilities, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the data, we need to make reasonable assumptions for the probabilities. Let's start by approximating each term (in a simplified way) for both fields:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field. Let's consider these fields to have roughly equal popularity among graduate students. 
   - \( P(H_{BA}) \): Prior for Business Administration.
   - \( P(H_{AG}) \): Prior for Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given Adam was enrolled in each field.
   - \( P(E | H_{BA}) \)
   - \( P(E | H_{AG}) \)

3. \( P(E | \neg H) \): The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given Adam was not enrolled in the respective field.

Given Adam's keen interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy, it's more likely that \( P(E|H_{AG}) \) is higher than \( P(E|H_{BA}) \).

### Assumptions:
- \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(H_{AG}) = 0.3 \) (Assuming the rest 0.4 is split between other fields)

### Expected \( P(E|H) \):
- \( P(E | H_{BA}) = 0.2 \) (Lower probability because the personality description fits less with business-related fields)
- \( P(E | H_{AG}) = 0.7 \) (Higher fit with agricultural and vet science)

### Expected \( P(E | \neg H) \):
We simplify this by assuming an average probability of the personality sketch appearing in non-specified fields.
- \( P(E | \neg H_{BA}) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(E | \neg H_{AG}) = 0.5 \)

Using Bayes' theorem:

### For Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be considered as a normalization constant.

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_{AG}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AG}) \cdot P(H_{AG})}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is common for both fields and we are comparing, it cancels out in proportional terms:

### Results:
1. Business Administration: 
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} = \frac{0.06}{P(E)} \]

2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 
\[ P(H_{AG}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} = \frac{0.21}{P(E)} \]

Comparing \( P(H|E) \) values for normalization:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.21} = \frac{0.06}{0.27} \approx 0.222 \]

\[ P(H_{AG}|E) \approx \frac{0.21}{0.06 + 0.21} = \frac{0.21}{0.27} \approx 0.778 \]

Final answers:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.222",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.778"
}
