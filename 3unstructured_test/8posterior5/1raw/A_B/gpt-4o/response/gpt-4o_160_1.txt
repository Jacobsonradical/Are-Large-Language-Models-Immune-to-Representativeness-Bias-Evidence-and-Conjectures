To compute the posterior probabilities P(H|E) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate the following:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.

To simplify the computation, we can compare the relative likelihoods of each field rather than computing exact probabilities:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): Let's assume the prior probability is moderate for a random graduate student interested in Agricultural and Veterinary Science (\(P(H) = 0.1\)).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for dedication, it is highly probable that he fits well in this field (\(P(E|H) = 0.9\)).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability that Adam has these characteristics but is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science could still be significant but lower (\(P(E|\neg H) = 0.3\)).

   Using Bayes' rule:
   \[
   P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.09
   \]

2. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H) \): Let's assume the prior probability for a random graduate student interested in Business Administration (\(P(H) = 0.2\)).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's characteristics do not strongly correlate with Business Administration, but some aspects like intelligence and problem-solving can be relevant (\(P(E|H) = 0.2\)).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam having these characteristics and not being in Business Administration could still be relatively high (\(P(E|\neg H) = 0.6\)).

   Using Bayes' rule:
   \[
   P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \cdot 0.2 = 0.04
   \]

From these calculations, we can see that the likelihood ratios indicate a stronger fit for Agricultural and Veterinary Science based on the given personality sketch. Thus:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.09,
  "business administration": 0.04
}
