To solve this problem using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihoods of the complement \( P(E|\neg H) \). Then we use these values to compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \).

Let's define the probabilities based on the profile of Adam.

### Step 1: Define the Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)

Since we don't have specific information about the distribution of graduate students across different fields, we will assume that the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field are equal for simplicity. Assuming there are 10 prominent fields of study (an arbitrary but plausible number):

\[ P(H) = \frac{1}{10} = 0.1 \]

### Step 2: Define the Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)

The profile suggests that Adam has traits and interests that align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science than with business administration.

- **Business Administration:** The characteristics of curiosity about nature, love for animals, and a warm heart are less directly relevant.
  - \( P(E|H_{business}) \): Let's assign a low probability, say 0.1.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** These characteristics highly correlate with this field.
  - \( P(E|H_{agricultural}) \): Let's assign a high probability, say 0.8.

### Step 3: Define the Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)

This reflects the probability of the characteristics given that Adam is not in a specific field. 

For the relative fields:
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) for **Business Administration** might be typical among other random fields:
  - Let's say it’s about 0.2.

- \( P(E|\neg H) \) for **Agricultural and Veterinary Science** could be lower, as they might be more unique to this field:
  - Let’s assign it approximately 0.3.

### Step 4: Calculate the Posterior Probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule

Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
For simplicity:
\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.9 \]

#### For Business Administration:
\[ P(E_{business}) = (0.1 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) = 0.01 + 0.18 = 0.19 \]
\[ P(H_{business}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.19} ≈ 0.0526 \]

#### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(E_{agricultural}) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) = 0.08 + 0.27 = 0.35 \]
\[ P(H_{agricultural}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.35} ≈ 0.2286 \]

### Step 5: Normalize (If required for specific interpretations among the choices):
{
  "business administration": 0.0526,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.2286
}
