To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule for each field, we need to understand the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), the prior \( P(H) \), and the likelihood of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H) \). Let's break down each field:

1. **Business Administration**
   - **Prior \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \)**: Graduate students in business administration are quite numerous, but without specific statistics, let's assume a prior of 0.2 (20%).
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \)**: Adam's personality sketch doesn't strongly align with the typical characteristics of a business administration student; let's assign a low probability of 0.05.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality in fields other than business administration could be relatively high, say 0.5.

   Using Bayes' rule for business administration:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.2}{0.5} = 0.02
   \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - **Prior \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \)**: This field may be less common than business administration, so let's assume a prior of 0.1 (10%).
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \)**: Adam's description fits well with this field, given his love for nature, animals, and empathy. A high probability of 0.8 seems reasonable.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality outside this field is moderate, say 0.3.

   Using Bayes' rule for agricultural and veterinary science:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.3} = 0.267
   \]

Given these values, our results are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.267
}
```
