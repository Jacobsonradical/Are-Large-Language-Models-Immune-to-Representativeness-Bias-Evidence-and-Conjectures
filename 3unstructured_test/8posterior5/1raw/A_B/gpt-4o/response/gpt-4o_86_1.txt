To calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch \( E \), we will use Bayes' Theorem, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we are interested in calculating the posterior probabilities for each field, we will need the following:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not in that field.
- \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing the personality sketch, which can be decomposed as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For simplicity, let's assume \( P(H) \) (the prior probability of being in either field) is roughly even, since we lack specific statistical information.

We can reason about the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \) based on the compatibility of Adam's interests and personality with each field.

1. **Business Administration**
   - \( P(H) \): Let’s assume the prior probability \( P(H_{\text{business}}) = 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that someone with Adam's detailed personality sketch would enroll in Business Administration is likely low, given his deep curiosity about nature, plants, animals, and aversion to business analytics. Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) = 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of his personality traits if he is not in business administration could be higher. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}}) = 0.5 \).

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - \( P(H) \): Let’s assume the prior probability \( P(H_{\text{agri}}) = 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that someone with Adam's traits would enroll in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is quite high. Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) = 0.8 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of his personality traits if he is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science might be lower. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agri}}) = 0.4 \).

Now let's compute \( P(H|E) \):

1. **For Business Administration:**

\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}})}{P(E)} \]

Assume \( P(E) \approx (P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}}) + P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agri}})) \):

\[ P(E) \approx (0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.8 \cdot 0.1) = 0.02 + 0.08 = 0.10 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.10} = \frac{0.02}{0.10} = 0.2 \]

2. **For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

\[ P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agri}})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.10} = \frac{0.08}{0.10} = 0.8 \]

Based on these calculations, the posterior probabilities are as follows:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}
