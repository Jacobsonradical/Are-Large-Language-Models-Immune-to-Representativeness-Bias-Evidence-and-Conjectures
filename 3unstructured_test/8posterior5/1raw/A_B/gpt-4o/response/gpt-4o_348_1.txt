To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \). The formula for Bayes' rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we are considering multiple fields, we can focus on the relative probabilities rather than computing the exact values. This will allow us to infer the most likely field for Adam based on his personality sketch (E).

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \) (a plausible but relatively common field of study).
2. **P(E|H)**: Since Adam's interests are deeply rooted in nature, animals, and abstract concepts, it seems unlikely that someone with such traits would enroll in business administration. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: This is trickier but, given Adam’s traits, the probability that he would fit such a profile rather than any other one is probably higher. Let's estimate it as \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.8 \) (as there are many other fields where Adam's personality traits would fit better).

Plugging these into Bayes’ rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the same for both computations and we don't need the actual value to compare relative probabilities.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \) (a less common but highly plausible field of study for someone with Adam's traits).
2. **P(E|H)**: Given Adam’s traits, this field is very likely. We assume \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Given our previous assumption, the complementary probability of Adam's traits fitting another field would be similar. Let's estimate it as \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.8 \).

Plugging these into Bayes’ rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

### Comparing the Results

We compare the two results. Since \( P(E) \) is a normalization constant, we focus on relative magnitudes:

- Business Administration: \( \frac{0.02}{P(E)} \)
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( \frac{0.09}{P(E)} \)

Therefore, the relative probabilities become clear:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.09
}
```

Adam is much more likely to have been enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science compared to Business Administration based on his personality sketch.
