To determine \(P(H|E)\) for the fields "business administration" and "agricultural and veterinary science," we need to consider the likelihood of Adam being in those fields given his personality sketch \(E\).

Let's denote:

- \(P(H_{\text{BA}})\) as the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration (BA).
- \(P(H_{\text{AV}})\) as the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science (AVS).
- \(P(E|H_{\text{BA}})\) as the probability of the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam is enrolled in BA.
- \(P(E|H_{\text{AV}})\) as the probability of the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam is enrolled in AVS.
- \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}})\) as the probability of \(E\) given that Adam is not enrolled in BA.
- \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{AV}})\) as the probability of \(E\) given that Adam is not enrolled in AVS.
- \(P(E)\) as the total probability of the personality sketch \(E\).

We apply Bayes' rule to find \(P(H_{\text{BA}}|E)\) and \(P(H_{\text{AV}}|E)\):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

From the personality sketch \(E\), Adam's traits strongly indicate a high likelihood of being in a field related to nature, empathy, animals, and hard work—traits more aligned with AVS rather than BA.

### For Business Administration:

- P(H_{\text{BA}}): The prior probability of someone being in BA could be considered common for graduate students, but based on Adam's traits, this likelihood should be lower than average.
- P(E|H_{\text{BA}}): Given his curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals, it's less likely that his personality sketch fits well with the typical BA student.
- P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}): Since his traits are more aligned with AVS.

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

- P(H_{\text{AV}}): The prior probability of Adam being in AVS can be considered higher given his traits.
- P(E|H_{\text{AV}}): Very high, as his traits match very well with someone in AVS.
- P(E|\neg H_{\text{AV}}): Less likely than for someone in BA.

Given rough estimates based on the personality sketch:

1. P(H_{\text{BA}}) ≈ 0.1
2. P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) ≈ 0.05
3. P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) ≈ 0.95
4. P(H_{\text{AV}}) ≈ 0.6
5. P(E|H_{\text{AV}}) ≈ 0.95
6. P(E|\neg H_{\text{AV}}) ≈ 0.05

Using these estimates:

### Calculations:

For \(P(H_{\text{BA}}|E)\):

\[
P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)}
\]

For \(P(H_{\text{AV}}|E)\):

\[
P(H_{\text{AV}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AV}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AV}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.95 \cdot 0.6}{P(E)}
\]

Given that \(P(E)\) would be a common term for normalization and relatively higher for AVS:

\[
{
  "business administration": \approx 0.03,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \approx 0.57
}
\]

These are approximate values intended to align with the qualitative descriptors provided. They reflect the stronger alignment of Adam's characteristics with AVS over BA.
