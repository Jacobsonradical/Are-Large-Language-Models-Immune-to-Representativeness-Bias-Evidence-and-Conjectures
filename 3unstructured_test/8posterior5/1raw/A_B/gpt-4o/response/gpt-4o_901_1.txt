Let's apply Bayes' Rule to calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in each field given the personality sketch \( E \). We'll denote:
- \( P(H) \) as the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|H) \) as the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) as the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in the field.
- \( P(H|E) \) as the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in the field given the personality sketch.

**Assumptions:** 
- Since exact data is not provided, we will make informed assumptions based on typical characteristics of students in each field.

### Business Administration

#### Assumptions:
- \( P(H_{BA}) \): Prior probability that a random graduate student is in Business Administration. Assume it's relatively high due to the popularity of the field. Let's say \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): Likelihood of having traits described in \( E \) if Adam is in Business Administration. Given that the traits suggest a scientific inclination and empathy for animals, this is relatively low. Let's say \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.05 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \): Likelihood of having these traits if Adam is not in Business Administration. This includes a broad range of fields, some of which may fit the traits better. Assume \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.1 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]

Assuming \( P(E) \) (the overall probability of the personality sketch) is normalized later, we focus on the ratio:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) = 0.05 \cdot 0.2 = 0.01 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

#### Assumptions:
- \( P(H_{AVS}) \): Prior probability that a random graduate student is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Assume it's less common compared to Business Administration. Let's say \( P(H_{AVS}) = 0.05 \).
- \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \): Likelihood of having traits described in \( E \) if Adam is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. This fits very well given his love for nature, animals, and empathy. Let's say \( P(E|H_{AVS}) = 0.9 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \): Likelihood of these traits if Adam is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Assume \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) = 0.1 \) (same as above for comparability).

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)} \]

Again, we focus on the ratio:

\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{AVS}) = 0.9 \cdot 0.05 = 0.045 \]

### Normalization and Comparison

Now we compare the unnormalized posterior probabilities:

- Business Administration: \( 0.01 \)
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( 0.045 \)

Normalize these to sum to 1 (for comparison):

- Total \( = 0.01 + 0.045 = 0.055 \)
- Business Administration: \( \frac{0.01}{0.055} = \approx 0.182 \)
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( \frac{0.045}{0.055} = \approx 0.818 \)

Final answer:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.182,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.818
}
