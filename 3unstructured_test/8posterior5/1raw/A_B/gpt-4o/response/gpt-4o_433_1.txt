To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \), \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is in field \( H \), \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing \( E \) given that Adam is not in field \( H \), and \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing \( E \).

Firstly, let's make some assumptions for the sake of this example:

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that an average graduate student is in business administration. Let's assume it's relatively common, so \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given he's in business administration. Given the traits described, this seems less likely since business students are not typically characterized by a deep love for animals and nature, so \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given he's not in business administration. Since these traits match well with fields like agricultural and veterinary science, they are more likely if he is not in business, so \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that an average graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. This field is less common than business administration, so let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given he's in agricultural and veterinary science. These traits strongly align with this field, so let's set this high, \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given he's not in agricultural and veterinary science. These traits are less common in other fields, so \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

#### Posterior Probabilities

Now, we need to compute the normalized \( P(H|E) \). However, we'll focus on the non-normalized \( P(H|E) \) for each field. 

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.9 \cdot 0.05 = 0.045 \]

Therefore, based on the relative proportions:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.045
}
```

Please note these values are proportional and not normalized probabilities. If required, normalization can be done based on the sum of the values and taking them as a fraction of that sum.
