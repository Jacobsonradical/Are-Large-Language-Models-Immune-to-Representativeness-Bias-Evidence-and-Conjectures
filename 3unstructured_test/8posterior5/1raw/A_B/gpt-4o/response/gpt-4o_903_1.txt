Let's break down the probabilities for each field:

### 1. Business Administration

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Since graduate students are distributed across many fields, let's assume there's a moderate chance, say 0.1, that a random graduate student is in business administration.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's characteristics if he were in business administration. Considering Adam's traits (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals), these traits are not typically associated with business administration. Hence, let's assume a low probability, maybe 0.05.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's characteristics if he were not in business administration. These traits are more commonly associated with fields such as science, veterinary, or psychology. Let's assume a higher probability, say 0.2.

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.1}{0.05 \times 0.1 + 0.2 \times 0.9} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.18} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.185} \approx 0.027 \]

### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume it is less prevalent but more likely than business admin for someone with Adam's traits, say 0.05.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's traits if he were in this field. Considering his love for animals, nature, and empathy, this is a high probability, say 0.6.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's traits if he were not in agricultural and veterinary science. These characteristics are associated with many other fields, perhaps the same as before, 0.2.

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.05}{0.6 \times 0.05 + 0.2 \times 0.95} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.19} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.22} \approx 0.136 \]

The results for the two fields are:

{
  "business administration": 0.027,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.136
