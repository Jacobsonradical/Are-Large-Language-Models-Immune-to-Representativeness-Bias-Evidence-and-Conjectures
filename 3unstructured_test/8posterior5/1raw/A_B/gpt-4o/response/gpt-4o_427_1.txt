To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field (business administration and agricultural and veterinary science), we'll use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of being enrolled in that field,
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing personality sketch \( E \) given \( H \),
- \( P(\neg H) \) is the prior probability of not being enrolled in that field,
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing personality sketch \( E \) given \( \neg H \),
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing personality sketch \( E \).

Since we only need relative probabilities to compare between fields, we can normalize them later if needed. Let's start with:
1. Business administration
2. Agricultural and veterinary science

### Business Administration
#### Prior Probability \( P(H) \)
Let's assume the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a business administration program is low due to his personality traits, which align less with typical business administration traits.

\[ P(H) \approx 0.1 \]

#### Probability of \( E \) Given \( H \) \( P(E|H) \)
Business administration students typically are less associated with deep knowledge of nature, plants, and animals, solving puzzles, or empathy-driven fields but more towards corporate, management, and leadership skills.

\[ P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \]

#### Probability of \( E \) Given \( \neg H \) \( P(E|\neg H) \)
Considering that when Adam isn't in business administration, he could be in any other field exhibiting his traits inherently.

\[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
#### Prior Probability \( P(H) \)
Let's assume that the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is higher due to his traits closely matching this field.

\[ P(H) \approx 0.5 \]

#### Probability of \( E \) Given \( H \) \( P(E|H) \)
Given Adam's traits (love of nature, animals, empathy), it's highly probable he fits within agricultural and veterinary science.

\[ P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \]

#### Probability of \( E \) Given \( \neg H \) \( P(E|\neg H) \)
When Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science, there are still other empathetic and nature-related fields he could be in, but they are fewer in comparison to general fields.

\[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \]

### Computing \( P(H|E) \):
Normalizing within our smaller scope, we can compute:

\[ P(H_{business}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{business}) \cdot P(H_{business})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_{agri}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{agri}) \cdot P(H_{agri})}{P(E)} \]

with assumed \( P(E) \approx \text{lower weighted average for simplicity normalization.}\)

### Results

\[ P(H_{business}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{agri}|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} \]

\[
\text{Normalizing } => P(H_{business}|E), P(H_{agri}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.1+0.45}, \frac{0.45}{0.1+0.45}
\]

Finally:
\[
\boxed{
\{
  "business administration": \approx 0.04, 
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \approx 0.90 
\}
}
\]

Simplified results:

\[
\boxed{
\{
  "business administration": 0.04, 
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.90 
\}
}
\]

These indicate that Adam is much more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science based on his personality sketch.
