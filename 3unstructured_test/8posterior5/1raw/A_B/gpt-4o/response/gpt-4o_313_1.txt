To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) given the personality sketch \( E \) and the field hypotheses \( H \), we'll follow Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E) \) can be ignored for relative comparisons since we are interested in \( P(H|E) \) for each field separately rather than absolute values (hence \( P(E) \) will cancel out when comparing).

### For "agricultural and veterinary science"

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**
  - Let's assume the prior probability that a random graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science is low, due to the relatively smaller size of this field compared to more common fields like business administration.
  - Let's set \( P(H_{\text{agri}}) \approx 0.05 \).

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**
  - Given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, we expect a high likelihood for the personality sketch if he were in agricultural and veterinary science.
  - Let’s set \( P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) = 0.9 \).

3. **Complement Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**
  - The probability that Adam has this personality sketch while being in any other field is less, but not extremely low because other fields can potentially have similar personality traits.
  - Let’s estimate \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agri}}) = 0.1 \).

### For "business administration"

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**
  - Let's assume the prior probability that a random graduate student is in business administration is higher, due to the popularity of this field.
  - Let’s set \( P(H_{\text{bus}}) \approx 0.2 \).

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**
  - Given that business administration typically isn't strongly associated with love for nature and animals, the likelihood is fairly low.
  - Let’s set \( P(E|H_{\text{bus}}) = 0.2 \).

3. **Complement Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**
  - The probability of Adam having this personality sketch in fields other than business administration could be similar to or higher than in business administration.
  - Let’s estimate \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{bus}}) = 0.1 \).

Now, we apply Bayes' rule to get the posterior probabilities:

### "agricultural and veterinary science"

\[ P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agri}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) \propto 0.9 \cdot 0.05 \approx 0.045 \]

### "business administration"

\[ P(H_{\text{bus}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{bus}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{bus}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{bus}}|E) \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.2 = 0.04 \]

### Final Results
We can ignore \( P(E) \) for comparative purposes. Hence, the posterior probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.045,
  "business administration": 0.04
}

This suggests that, based on Adam's personality sketch, he is slightly more likely to have been enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration.
