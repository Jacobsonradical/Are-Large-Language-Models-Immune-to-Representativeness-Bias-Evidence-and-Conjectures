To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the following probabilities:
1. \( P(H) \) - the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \) - the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in each field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not enrolled in each field.

### Hypothesis: Agricultural and Veterinary Science
#### Prior Probability (\( P(H) \))
Given that agricultural and veterinary science is a niche field, let's assume a prior probability of 0.03. 

#### Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \))
Given Adam's deep love for animals, his strong empathy, and his curiosity about nature and plants, it seems highly likely that he would be in this field if he fits this personality sketch. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) as 0.8.

#### Complement Likelihood (\( P(E|\neg H) \))
Given there are many other fields where these traits might be observed, let's assume the likelihood of observing this personality sketch outside agricultural and veterinary science is relatively low but not negligible. Let's set \( P(E|\neg H) \) at 0.2.

#### Posterior Probability (\( P(H|E) \))
Using Bayes' rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]
\[
P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.03) + (0.2 \cdot 0.97) = 0.024 + 0.194 = 0.218
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.03}{0.218} \approx 0.11
\]

### Hypothesis: Business Administration
#### Prior Probability (\( P(H) \))
Business administration is a common field, so let's assume a prior probability of 0.15.

#### Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \))
Adam's traits do not strongly align with a typical business administration profile. Therefore, let's set \( P(E|H) \) at 0.1.

#### Complement Likelihood (\( P(E|\neg H) \))
Assuming many other fields align better with Adam's personality sketch, we will keep this at 0.2.

#### Posterior Probability (\( P(H|E) \))
Using Bayes' rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

\[
P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) = 0.015 + 0.17 = 0.185
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{0.185} \approx 0.081
\]
