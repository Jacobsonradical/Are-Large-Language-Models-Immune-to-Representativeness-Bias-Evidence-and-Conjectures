Certainly! Let's first break down the probabilities for each field, given the information:

1. **Business Administration (BA)**
   - **P(H₁)**: Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration. Let's assume a fairly common field, so we can estimate around 0.2.
   - **P(E|H₁)**: Probability of personality sketch E given Adam was in Business Administration. Considering his traits like empathy and intelligence are beneficial in BA but curiosity about nature and love for animals don't align well, we might estimate this around 0.2.
   - **P(E|¬H₁)**: Probability of personality sketch E given Adam was not in Business Administration. Assume this is relatively higher given how his profile matches more closely to other fields like environmental science, let's say around 0.5.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS)**
   - **P(H₂)**: Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Considering it might be less common than BA, let's estimate around 0.1.
   - **P(E|H₂)**: Probability of personality sketch E given Adam was in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given the profile matches very well with AVS due to his interest in nature, love for animals, and empathy, we might estimate this around 0.8.
   - **P(E|¬H₂)**: Probability of personality sketch E given Adam was not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given he has traits fitting AVS well, notably lower than P(E|¬H₁), so let's assume around 0.4.

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H)}\]

We calculate:

1. **Business Administration:**

\[P(H₁|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.2 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.4} = \frac{0.04}{0.44} ≈ 0.091\]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

\[P(H₂|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.4 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.36} = \frac{0.08}{0.44} ≈ 0.182\]

So, the final results would be:

{
  "business administration": 0.091,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.182
}
