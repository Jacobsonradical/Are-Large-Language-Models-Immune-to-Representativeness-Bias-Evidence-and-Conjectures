Certainly, let's use Bayes' rule to evaluate the probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields of study. Bayes' rule can be stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that \(P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)\) for our calculations, we will need estimations of these values.

Let's start with some reasonable assumptions for each field:

**For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- \( P(H_{ag}) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume it is moderately likely as many graduate students are in various science fields. Assume \(0.2\).
- \( P(E|H_{ag}) \): The probability that Adam exhibits these personality traits given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his traits, it is highly likely. Assume \(0.7\).
- \( P(E|\neg H_{ag}) \): The probability that Adam exhibits these traits but is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Traits like empathy and love for animals can be present in other fields too. Assume \(0.3\).

**For Business Administration:**
- \( P(H_{ba}) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration. Given his personality, we might assume it is less likely. Assume \(0.05\).
- \( P(E|H_{ba}) \): The probability that Adam exhibits these personality traits given that he is enrolled in business administration. Might be possible but less likely. Assume \(0.1\).
- \( P(E|\neg H_{ba}) \): The probability that Adam exhibits these traits but is not enrolled in business administration. Again, traits could appear in a variety of fields. Assume \(0.5\).

### Calculate \(P(E)\):
For both fields, let's assume:

\[ P(E) = (P(E|H_{ag}) \cdot P(H_{ag})) + (P(E|\neg H_{ag}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{ag}))) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) = 0.14 + 0.24 = 0.38 \]

\[ P(E) = (P(E|H_{ba}) \cdot P(H_{ba})) + (P(E|\neg H_{ba}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{ba})) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.05) + (0.5 \cdot 0.95) = 0.005 + 0.475 = 0.48 \]

Now, let's plug into Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H_{ag}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{ag}) \cdot P(H_{ag})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.38} \approx 0.368 \]

\[ P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{ba}) \cdot P(H_{ba})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.05}{0.48} \approx 0.0104 \]

These values suggest that Adam is more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than business administration based on his personality traits.

So, the answers can be summarized as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.368,
  "business administration": 0.0104
}
