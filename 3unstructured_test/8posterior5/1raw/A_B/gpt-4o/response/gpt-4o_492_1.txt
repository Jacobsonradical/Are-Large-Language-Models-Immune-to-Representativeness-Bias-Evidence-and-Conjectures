Sure, let's use Bayes' theorem to compute the probabilities.

Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given we are not asked to normalize the probabilities to sum to 1, we can focus on the unnormalized form:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

For each hypothesis \(H\):

1. **Business Administration**
   - \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration. Let's assume it's a moderate general probability, say \(0.2\).
   - \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood of the given evidence \(E\) if Adam is enrolled in Business Administration. Given the personality sketch, it's less likely but not impossible, so maybe \(0.1\).
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\): The likelihood of the given evidence if Adam is not enrolled in Business Administration. If Adam is not in Business Administration, the provided characteristics might better match other fields, so let's assume \(0.3\).

   Using Bayes' theorem:

   \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given his interests and personality traits, let's assume a higher prior probability, say \(0.3\).
   - \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood of the given evidence \(E\) if Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given his personality sketch, this is quite high, maybe \(0.7\).
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\): The likelihood of the given evidence if Adam is not enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Assuming most other fields don't align as well with the sketch, let's say \(0.2\).

   Using Bayes' theorem:

   \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.7 \cdot 0.3 = 0.21 \]

Now, we compare these proportional probabilities. While the absolute values are not normalized, they indicate the relative likelihoods.

Thus, the outputs would be:

{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.21
}
