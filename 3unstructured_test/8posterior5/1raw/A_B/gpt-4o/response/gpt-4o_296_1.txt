To calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to understand the components involved:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here we need:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam having the given personality traits if he is in the specified field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam having the given personality traits if he is not in the specified field.

We can then use these to evaluate \( P(H|E) \). Since we don't have exact data, I'll make reasonable estimates based on the given situation and the typical profile of students in various fields.

### For Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: Let's assume the general prior probability that any graduate student in the U.S. is in Business Administration is relatively high, say \( 0.15 \) (15%).
2. **P(E|H)**: Given that Business Administration students are typically more interested in business aspects rather than nature and animals, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is low, say \( 0.05 \).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: This is the probability that Adam has the given personality traits despite not being in Business Administration. Given his traits align more with other fields, let's say this is \( 0.1 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.15}{P(E)} \]
\( P(E) \) can be found through the law of total probability, but for simplicity, we'll assume the sum of \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for various hypotheses roughly equals 1.
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.05 \times 0.15 = 0.0075 \]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: Assume the prior probability that any graduate student in the U.S. is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is lower, say \( 0.05 \) (5%).
2. **P(E|H)**: This field aligns well with Adam's traits (interest in nature, animals). Let's assume \( P(E|H) \) is high, say \( 0.7 \).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Based on the personality sketch, if Adam is not in this field, the probability of having these traits would be lower, say \( 0.05 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.05}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.7 \times 0.05 = 0.035 \]

To express the relative probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.0075,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.035
}

These values indicate that given Adam's personality traits, it is more probable he is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science compared to Business Administration.
