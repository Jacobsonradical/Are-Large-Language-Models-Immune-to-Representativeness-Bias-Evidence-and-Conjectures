To judge the probabilities P(H), P(E|H), P(E|¬H), and use Bayes' rule to compute P(H|E) for the fields of business administration and agricultural and veterinary science, we need to consider how Adam's personality sketch matches the typical profiles of students in those fields.

### Business Administration (B)
1. **Prior Probability P(H_B)**: This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Without specific data, we can assume that a small but non-negligible fraction of graduate students are in business administration. Let's assume P(H_B) = 0.15.

2. **Likelihood P(E|H_B)**: This is the probability of observing the evidence E (Adam's personality sketch) given that he is enrolled in business administration. Adam's traits such as genuine curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals do not particularly match a typical business administration student profile. We can estimate this likelihood to be relatively low, say P(E|H_B) = 0.10.

3. **Likelihood P(E|¬H_B)**: This is the probability of observing the evidence E given that he is not enrolled in business administration. Given the broad range of other fields that might align better with his personality, this value should be higher, say P(E|¬H_B) = 0.50.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H_B|E) = \frac{P(E|H_B) * P(H_B)}{P(E|H_B) * P(H_B) + P(E|¬H_B) * P(¬H_B)} \]

\[ P(H_B|E) = \frac{0.10 * 0.15}{0.10 * 0.15 + 0.50 * (1 - 0.15)} \]

\[ P(H_B|E) = \frac{0.015}{0.015 + 0.425} = \frac{0.015}{0.44} \approx 0.034 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science (A)
1. **Prior Probability P(H_A)**: Let's assume that the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is also moderate, given the typical distribution of graduate fields. Assume P(H_A) = 0.10.

2. **Likelihood P(E|H_A)**: Given Adam's traits like curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals, these match well with a student in agricultural and veterinary science. We can estimate this likelihood to be quite high, say P(E|H_A) = 0.70.

3. **Likelihood P(E|¬H_A)**: Given the aforementioned analysis for business administration, this value can be closer to the mid-point but adjusted considering other fields too. Assume P(E|¬H_A) = 0.30.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H_A|E) = \frac{P(E|H_A) * P(H_A)}{P(E|H_A) * P(H_A) + P(E|¬H_A) * P(¬H_A)} \]

\[ P(H_A|E) = \frac{0.70 * 0.10}{0.70 * 0.10 + 0.30 * (1 - 0.10)} \]

\[ P(H_A|E) = \frac{0.07}{0.07 + 0.27} = \frac{0.07}{0.34} \approx 0.206 \]

Given the above calculations, here is the final result for P(H|E):
