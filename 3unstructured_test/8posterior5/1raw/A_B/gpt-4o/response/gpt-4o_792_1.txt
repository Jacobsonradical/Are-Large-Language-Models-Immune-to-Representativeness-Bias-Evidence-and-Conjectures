To apply Bayes' rule, we need to first establish the subjective probabilities for each term in the formula \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \).

We need \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field. Note that \( P(E) \) is a normalizing factor and does not need to be explicitly calculated here since we are interested in relative comparisons.

Since we don't have specific numerical values, we will use reasonable estimates for these probabilities based on Adam's personality sketch and the nature of each field.

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is in the field of Business Administration is relatively low given his personality traits which align more with natural sciences. Let's assume:
    - \( P(H_{\text{Business Administration}}) = 0.1 \)

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is in Business Administration is also relatively low, as the traits do not strongly align with the typical personality of someone in this field. Let's assume:
    - \( P(E|H_{\text{Business Administration}}) = 0.2 \)

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is not in Business Administration could be higher, as his traits might be more common in other fields. Let's assume:
    - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{Business Administration}}) = 0.6 \)

Now, using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Note that \(P(E)\) is a normalizing constant and does not impact the relative comparison.

\[ P(H_{\text{Business Administration}}|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is in the field of Agricultural and Veterinary Science is relatively higher given his strong interest in nature and animals. Let's assume:
    - \( P(H_{\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}}) = 0.4 \)

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is relatively high. Let's assume:
    - \( P(E|H_{\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}}) = 0.8 \)

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science could be lower. Let's assume:
    - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}}) = 0.4 \)

Now, using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_{\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.4}{P(E)} \]

### Relative Probability

You don't need \( P(E) \) for relative comparison, but we will outline the relative values:

For **Business Administration**:
\[ \tilde{P}(H_{\text{Business Administration}}|E) = 0.2 \times 0.1 = 0.02 \]

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ \tilde{P}(H_{\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}}|E) = 0.8 \times 0.4 = 0.32 \]

Normalizing these values to establish relative probabilities:

\[ P(H_{\text{Business Administration}}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.32} = \frac{0.02}{0.34} \approx 0.059 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}}|E) = \frac{0.32}{0.02 + 0.32} = \frac{0.32}{0.34} \approx 0.941 \]

So, in the format requested:
```json
{
  "business administration":  0.059,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.941
}
