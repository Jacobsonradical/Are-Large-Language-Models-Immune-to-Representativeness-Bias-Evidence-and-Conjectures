Sure, let's break this down using Bayes' rule:

Bayes' rule states: 

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence given the hypothesis is true.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence given the hypothesis is not true.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the evidence.

Let's denote:
- \( H_1 \): Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( H_2 \): Adam is enrolled in business administration.
 
Now to apply Bayes' Rule, we need to estimate \( P(H_1) \), \( P(H_2) \), \( P(E|H_1) \), \( P(E|H_2) \), and \( P(E) \).

Assumptions:
- \( P(H_1) \): The probability that any random graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume a rough estimate of 0.1.
- \( P(H_2) \): The probability that any random graduate student is in business administration. Let's assume a rough estimate of 0.2.
- \( P(E|H_1) \): The likelihood that Adam’s characteristics fit someone in agricultural and veterinary science. Considering his love for nature, plants, and animals, let's estimate this as 0.7.
- \( P(E|H_2) \): The likelihood that Adam’s characteristics fit someone in business administration. Given his love for animals and plants, which is less typical in business administration, let's estimate this as 0.2.
- \( P(E) \): The total probability of observing evidence \( E \). This can be approximated as \( P(E) = P(E|H_1)P(H_1) + P(E|H_2)P(H_2) + \ldots \), incorporating other fields, but for simplicity, let's assume it's roughly estimated.

Now let's calculate these:

1. For agricultural and veterinary science:
   \[
   P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)}
   \]

   Assuming \( P(E) \) is normalized and other fields are less likely, we can simplify:
   \[
   P(H_1|E) \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.07}{P(E)}
   \]

2. For business administration:
   \[
   P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E)}
   \]

   \[
   P(H_2|E) \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.04}{P(E)}
   \]

Since overall likelihood needs normalization:
\[
P(E) \approx 0.07 + 0.04 + \ldots \approx 0.11
\]

Finally:
1. \[
P(H_1|E) \approx \frac{0.07}{0.11} \approx 0.636
\]
2. \[
P(H_2|E) \approx \frac{0.04}{0.11} \approx 0.363
\]

Therefore, the final probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.636,
  "business administration": 0.363
}
