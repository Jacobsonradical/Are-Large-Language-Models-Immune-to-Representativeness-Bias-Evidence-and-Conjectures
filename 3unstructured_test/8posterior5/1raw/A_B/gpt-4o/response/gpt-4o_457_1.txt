To determine \( P(H|E) \), we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

While we may not have precise values for all probabilities, we can make educated estimates based on the information provided. Let's denote:

- \(H_{AV}\) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \(H_{BA}\) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in business administration.

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

#### Estimates for Probabilities:
- \(P(H_{AV})\): The probability that any randomly selected graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This field is relatively specialized. Let's estimate this at 5%.
  
- \(P(E|H_{AV})\): Given that Adam was in agricultural and veterinary science, how likely is it to observe his personality traits (E)? Given his love for nature and animals and his empathy, this seems highly likely. Let's estimate this at 90%.

- \(P(E|\neg H_{AV})\): Given that Adam was not in agricultural and veterinary science, how likely is it to observe his personality traits (E)? These traits are less likely but still possible in other fields. Let's estimate this at 30%.

### For Business Administration:

#### Estimates for Probabilities:
- \(P(H_{BA})\): The probability that any randomly selected graduate student is enrolled in business administration. This field is quite common. Let's estimate this at 20%.

- \(P(E|H_{BA})\): Given that Adam was in business administration, how likely is it to observe his personality traits (E)? These traits seem less typical for this field. Let's estimate this at 10%.

- \(P(E|\neg H_{BA})\): Given that Adam was not in business administration, how likely is it to observe his personality traits (E)? These traits seem common in other specialized fields. Let's estimate this at 50%.

### Calculations Using Bayes' Theorem:

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[ P(H_{AV}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AV}) \cdot P(H_{AV})}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing E across all fields, but for our purposes, we will compare relative values since we are only interested in ratios here.

\[ P(H_{AV}|E) \approx \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} = \frac{0.045}{P(E)} \]

#### Business Administration:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]

Similar approximation:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.02}{P(E)} \]

### Relative Values:

Since \( P(E) \) is a common term in both calculations, we can compare the numerators directly to find relative likelihoods.

\[
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.045,
  "business administration": 0.02
}
\]

So, Adam is relatively more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration given his personality sketch.
