In order to determine the probabilities P(H|E) for each field under consideration, we'll use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, for simplicity, instead of determining the exact value of P(E), we'll focus on the relative likelihoods. 

Let's denote:
- \( P(H_{BA}) \) as the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(H_{AVS}) \) as the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \) as the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \) as the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \) as the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was not enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \) as the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H_{BA})\):**
   - Let's assume \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.10 \) (an arbitrary but reasonable prior assuming a modest probability).

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H_{BA})\):**
   - Adam's traits such as empathy, love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles do not strongly correlate with typical business administration profiles.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.05 \).

3. **Complementary Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H_{BA})\):**
   - Given the general nature of empathy and love for animals, itâ€™s more likely outside business administration.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.20 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H_{AVS})\):**
   - Let's assume \( P(H_{AVS}) = 0.05 \) (an arbitrary but reasonable prior indicating a lower probability based on the general population).

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H_{AVS})\):**
   - Adam's traits strongly align with interests in plants, animals, and empathy, correlating well with agricultural and veterinary science profiles.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|H_{AVS}) = 0.85 \).

3. **Complementary Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H_{AVS})\):**
   - Given Adam's profile, his characteristics might slightly align outside this field, though less strongly.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) = 0.10 \).

### Bayes' Rule Application

We only need the numerators for comparison as we are interested in relative probabilities:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) \]

Calculate these:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto 0.05 \cdot 0.10 = 0.005 \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \propto 0.85 \cdot 0.05 = 0.0425 \]

Normalize these values to sum to 1:

\[ \text{Normalization factor} = 0.005 + 0.0425 = 0.0475 \]

Thus,
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.0475} \approx 0.105 \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.0425}{0.0475} \approx 0.895 \]

So, the probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": 0.105,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.895
}
