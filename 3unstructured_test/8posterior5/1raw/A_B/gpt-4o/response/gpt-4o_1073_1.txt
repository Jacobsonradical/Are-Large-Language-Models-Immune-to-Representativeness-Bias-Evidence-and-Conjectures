To calculate \( P(H|E) \) for the given fields using Bayes' theorem, we'll follow the format:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where,
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam having the personality sketch E given that he was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of Adam having the personality sketch E.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of Adam having the personality sketch E given that he was not enrolled in the field.

To simplify our calculations, we'll approximate as follows:
1. Assign reasonable priors (\( P(H) \)) based on general enrollment rates or field prominence among graduate students.
2. Estimate the likelihoods (\( P(E|H) \)) based on how well Adam's traits match each field.
3. Assume \( P(E) \), the total probability of Adam having the personality sketch, is a constant that gets normalized out.

Given Adam's personality traits and interests, he shows a deep empathy, love for animals, and a strong understanding of hard work, which align well with fields like agricultural and veterinary science. The fit is less certain for business administration.

Let's assign some values:

1. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H) \): Let's assume that business administration has a relatively high enrollment rate among graduate students, but not particularly tailored to Adam's interests.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Traits like curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals are less relevant.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that Adam has these traits not being in business administration is higher.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): Less common than business administration but highly relevant to Adam's traits.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Very high, as this field perfectly matches his personality sketch.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Lower because fewer fields would fit his traits as well.

Assume the following approximated values:
- \( P(H_{\text{business}}) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}}) = 0.7 \)

- \( P(H_{\text{ag&vet}}) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{ag&vet}}) = 0.9 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{ag&vet}}) = 0.4 \)

For normalization and simplicity, assume \( P(E) = 1 \).

Now, calculate Posterior Probabilities using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{1} = 0.02 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{ag&vet}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{ag&vet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ag&vet}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{1} = 0.09 \]

Finally, here is the output in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.09
