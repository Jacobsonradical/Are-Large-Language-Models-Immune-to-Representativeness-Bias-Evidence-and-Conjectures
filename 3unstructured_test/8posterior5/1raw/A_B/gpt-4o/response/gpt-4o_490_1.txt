To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or agricultural and veterinary science, given his personality sketch, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Here's the format of Bayes' theorem we'll use:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch.

For simplicity, let's assume \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields as we're comparing relative probabilities.

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: Graduate students are typically spread across various fields, but business administration is a common field.
  - Let's assume \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.2 \).
  
- **P(E|H)**: Given his personality sketch, it doesn't strongly indicate traits or interests (like curiosity about nature, empathy for animals) that align closely with business administration.
  - Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1 \).

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is not in business administration would likely be higher than if he were in business administration.
  - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.25 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: Agricultural and veterinary science is less common but fits well with Adam's interests in nature, empathy for animals, and understanding hard work.
  - Let's assume \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.05 \).

- **P(E|H)**: The personality traits strongly align with agricultural and veterinary science.
  - Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.7 \).

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science is lesser compared to the previous case.
  - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.15 \).

Now we calculate Bayesian posterior probabilities:

### Business Administration

\[ 
P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} 
= \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} 
= \frac{0.02}{P(E)} 
\]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

\[ 
P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}})}{P(E)} 
= \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} 
= \frac{0.035}{P(E)} 
\]

Now normalizing the probabilities relative to each other (removing \( P(E) \) as it would be the same for both fields):

\[ 
P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) : P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) 
= \frac{0.02}{P(E)} : \frac{0.035}{P(E)} 
= 0.02 : 0.035 
= \frac{2}{3.5} 
= 0.4 
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = 1 - P(H_{\text{BA}}|E)
= 1 - 0.4
= 0.6
\]

Therefore, the results are as follows:

```
{
  "business administration": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
```
