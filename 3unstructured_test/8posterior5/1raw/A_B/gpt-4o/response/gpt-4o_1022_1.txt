To compute the probabilities, we need to follow a structured approach using Bayes' rule, which states that:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To make things more manageable, let's estimate the probability values based on the information provided. 

1. **Prior Probability (\(P(H)\)):**
   - \( P(H) \) for each field represents the general likelihood of Adam being enrolled in that specific field without considering the personality sketch.
   - Given Adam's characteristics, let's establish some reasonable priors based on typical enrollments in these fields:
     - Agricultural and veterinary science (A&VS) students: modest likelihood.
     - Business administration (Business Admin) students: generally average likelihood but probably lower considering Adam's specific personality traits.

2. **Likelihood (\(P(E|H)\)):**
   - This represents how likely the personality sketch is if Adam is in that field.
   - A&VS: High likelihood given his love for nature, plants, and animals.
   - Business Admin: Lower probability since empathy and love for plants and animals are not typically correlated with business administration.

3. **Complement Likelihood (\(P(E|\neg H)\)):**
   - This represents how likely the personality sketch is if Adam is not in that field.
   - Given Adam's personality aligns more with A&VS, we assume P(E|\neg A&VS) is lower.

Let's assume:
- \(P(H_{\text{A&VS}}) = 0.2\)
- \(P(H_{\text{Business Admin}}) = 0.1\)
- \(P(E|H_{\text{A&VS}}) = 0.8\)
- \(P(E|H_{\text{Business Admin}}) = 0.2\)
- \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{A&VS}}) = 0.3\)
- \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{Business Admin}}) = 0.7\)

Now, let's calculate the marginal probability of \(E\) using the law of total probability:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{A&VS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{A&VS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{A&VS}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{A&VS}})
\]

Assuming there are more fields, let's use a simplified average for \(\neg H_{\text{A&VS}}\):

\[
P(E|\neg H_{\text{A&VS}}) = 0.3
\]

Thus:

\[
P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8 \approx 0.16 + 0.24 = 0.4
\]

Using Bayes' rule for A&VS:

\[
P(H_{\text{A&VS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{A&VS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{A&VS}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{0.4} = 0.4
\]

For Business Admin using similar calculations:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{Business Admin}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{Business Admin}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{Business Admin}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{Business Admin}})
\]

Assuming complement:

\[
P(E|\neg H_{\text{Business Admin}}) = 0.7
\]

Thus:

\[
P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.7 \cdot 0.9 = 0.02 + 0.63 = 0.65
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{Business Admin}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{Business Admin}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{Business Admin}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.65} \approx 0.03
\]

So, the final probabilities based on the provided values and assumptions are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.03
}
```
