To estimate the probabilities, we use Bayes' Rule \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \). However, without prior specific knowledge, we need to make reasonable assumptions. 

Here's how we can think about the estimates:

1. **P(H)**: Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the given field.
2. **P(E|H)**: Likelihood of seeing the personality sketch given Adam is in the given field.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: Likelihood of seeing the personality sketch given Adam is in any other field. This is more challenging to estimate accurately without more data, but we'll assume it's relatively low compared to relevant fields.

### 1. Business Administration

- **P(H)**: Business Administration is a very common field for grad students, but doesn't align particularly well with Adam's personality sketch. Let's assume P(H) = 0.1 (10% chance Adam is in this field).
- **P(E|H)**: The personality sketch of curiosity in nature, quietness, and love for animals doesn't strongly suggest a business field. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.05.
- **P(E|¬H)**: Assuming this probability when Adam is involved in other fields, given the diversity of these fields, let's estimate P(E|¬H) = 0.01.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.05 \times 0.1}{0.01} = 0.5 \]

### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)**: Fields like agricultural and veterinary science are less common than business but align much better with the personality sketch provided. Let's assume P(H) = 0.05 (5% chance Adam is in this field).
- **P(E|H)**: Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy strongly aligns with this field. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.5.
- **P(E|¬H)**: Similar estimate to the above, let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.01.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.5 \times 0.05}{0.01} = 2.5 \]

But since probabilities must be within the range of 0 to 1, we'll normalize it by the sum of all probabilities:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{2.5}{2.5 + 0.5} = \frac{2.5}{3} \approx 0.83 \]

Therefore, here is the format requested:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.5",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.83"
}
```

Please note that these computations are based on subjective estimates for illustrative purposes and assumptions about the priori distribution and likelihoods, which might vary in actual contexts with real data.
