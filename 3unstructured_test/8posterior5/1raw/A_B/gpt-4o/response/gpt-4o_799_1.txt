To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in either business administration or agricultural and veterinary science, we will apply Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where \( P(E) \) is the normalization constant that can be computed as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}}) + P(E|H_{\text{agricultural}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural}}) + \text{other terms for other graduate fields} \]

Let's break down our reasoning and make some rough estimations.

### 1. Business Administration

**Prior Probability \( P(\text{business}) \):**
- Business administration is a common field, but it is less likely for someone who enjoys nature, plants, and animals as deeply.
- Let's assume a moderate probability: \( P(\text{business}) \approx 0.2 \)

**Likelihood \( P(E|\text{business}) \):**
- Adam's traits do not particularly align with a typical business administration student, especially given his love for nature and animals.
- Let's assume a low probability: \( P(E|\text{business}) \approx 0.1 \)

**Likelihood \( P(E|\neg \text{business}) \):**
- This is higher given Adam’s deep interest in animals and nature, which might be seen in many non-business fields.
- We will assume a high probability: \( P(E|\neg \text{business}) \approx 0.8 \)

### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

**Prior Probability \( P(\text{agricultural}) \):**
- Agricultural and veterinary science is less common but highly consistent with Adam’s interests.
- Let's assume a moderate probability: \( P(\text{agricultural}) \approx 0.1 \)

**Likelihood \( P(E|\text{agricultural}) \):**
- Adam’s characteristics perfectly align with someone in agricultural and veterinary sciences.
- Let's assume a high probability: \( P(E|\text{agricultural}) \approx 0.9 \)

**Likelihood \( P(E|\neg \text{agricultural}) \):**
- This would be somewhat lower as Adam’s traits strongly point towards nature, animals, and empathy.
- Let’s assume a moderate probability: \( P(E|\neg \text{agricultural}) \approx 0.3 \)

### Posterior Probabilities

We do not need a detailed calculation of \( P(E) \) as the problem suggests to focus primarily on the specific fields provided. Rather, we’ll focus on the ratios.

#### For Business Administration:
\[ P(\text{business}|E) \propto P(E|\text{business}) \cdot P(\text{business}) \approx 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

#### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(\text{agricultural}|E) \propto P(E|\text{agricultural}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural}) \approx 0.9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.09 \]

Given these estimates, we might roughly normalize them:
\[ P(\text{business}|E) \approx \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.09} = \frac{0.02}{0.11} \approx 0.182 \]
\[ P(\text{agricultural}|E) \approx \frac{0.09}{0.02 + 0.09} = \frac{0.09}{0.11} \approx 0.818 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are approximately:

{
  "business administration": 0.182,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.818
}
