To calculate the probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the specified fields based on the given personality sketch (E), we need to use Bayes' Rule. Bayes' Rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

Let's denote the two hypotheses as follows:
- \( H_1 = \) Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( H_2 = \) Adam was enrolled in business administration.

### Setting Initial Probabilities

#### P(H1) and P(H2):
Given no specific information about the distribution of graduate students across various fields, we can assume some prior probabilities. For simplicity, let's assume:

- \( P(H_1) \approx 0.1 \): A reasonable guess that about 10% of graduate students might be in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(H_2) \approx 0.15 \): A reasonable guess that about 15% of graduate students might be in business administration.

#### P(E|H1):
Given Adam's traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, etc.), it seems quite likely that he would be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science:

- \( P(E|H1) \approx 0.8 \): High likelihood because his interests align well with this field.

#### P(E|H2):
Adam's traits seem to be less aligned with business administration:

- \( P(E|H2) \approx 0.1 \): Low likelihood because his interests do not seem to align well with this field.

#### P(E|¬H1) and P(E|¬H2):
To find \( P(E|\neg H1) \) and \( P(E|\neg H2) \), we need to consider the likelihood of Adam's traits given that he is not in the specified fields. Given that Adam’s traits are quite specific, these probabilities could be low:

- \( P(E|\neg H1) \approx 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H2) \approx 0.3 \)

Since calculating \( P(E) \) directly can be complex and unnecessary for this comparison, we'll focus on the numerator in Bayes’ Rule, as the denominator would be the same for both hypotheses.

### Bayesian Update

#### P(H1|E):
\[ P(H1|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H1) \times P(H1)}{P(E|H1) \times P(H1) + P(E|\neg H1) \times P(\neg H1)} \]

Using the values:
\[ P(H1|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.8 \times 0.1 + 0.2 \times 0.9} \]
\[ P(H1|E) \approx \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.18} \]
\[ P(H1|E) \approx \frac{0.08}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H1|E) \approx 0.3077 \]

#### P(H2|E):
\[ P(H2|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H2) \times P(H2)}{P(E|H2) \times P(H2) + P(E|\neg H2) \times P(\neg H2)} \]

Using the values:
\[ P(H2|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \times 0.15}{0.1 \times 0.15 + 0.3 \times 0.85} \]
\[ P(H2|E) \approx \frac{0.015}{0.015 + 0.255} \]
\[ P(H2|E) \approx \frac{0.015}{0.27} \]
\[ P(H2|E) \approx 0.0556 \]

### Results

Therefore, we have the following probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3077,
  "business administration": 0.0556
}
```

These probabilities indicate that based on Adam’s personality traits, it is much more likely that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration.
