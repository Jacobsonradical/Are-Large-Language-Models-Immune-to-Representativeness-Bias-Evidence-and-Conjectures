To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the hypotheses that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or agricultural and veterinary science, we need to apply Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to estimate the following:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in a particular field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is *not* enrolled in that particular field.
4. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.

Since the data provided does not give us the exact probabilities, we will make educated guesses based on the information available.

1. **Business Administration**
    - **\( P(H) \)**: Business administration is a common field, so let's estimate a moderate prior, say 0.1.
    - **\( P(E|H) \)**: Business administration usually does not strongly correlate with a love for nature and animals, but it might still attract people with a warm heart and curiosity. Estimate 0.1.
    - **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: For someone not in business administration, Adam's sketch might be more likely. Estimate 0.3.

    By Bayes' rule:
    \[
    P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.1 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot (1-0.1)} = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.27} \approx 0.036
    \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
    - **\( P(H) \)**: Agricultural and veterinary science is less common but fits Adam's traits well. Estimate 0.05.
    - **\( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's personality sketch fits very well with agricultural and veterinary science. Estimate 0.8.
    - **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: We might see Adam's sketch less frequently in non-agricultural and non-veterinary fields. Estimate 0.2.

    By Bayes' rule:
    \[
    P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot (1-0.05)} = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.19} \approx 0.174
    \]
