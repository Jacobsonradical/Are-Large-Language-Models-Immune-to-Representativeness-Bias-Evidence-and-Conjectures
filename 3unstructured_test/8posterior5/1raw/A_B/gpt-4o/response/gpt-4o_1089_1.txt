To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for the hypothesis \( H \) that Adam was enrolled in a particular field based on the provided personality sketch \( E \), we can apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For each field, we will estimate the values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

### Field 1: Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Considering that agricultural and veterinary science is a specialized field, the prior probability might not be very high given the wide range of fields. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Given the personality sketch, Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy strongly align with the characteristics suitable for agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).
- **Likelihood of Evidence \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Given the number of other fields that might not align as well with Adam's characteristics, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.05 \). This indicates a lower likelihood of the same personality traits occurring in other fields.

### Field 2: Business Administration
- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Business administration is a common field with a higher prior probability in general. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.3 \).
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The personality sketch of Adam does not strongly align with typical traits needed for business administration. Thus, let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
- **Likelihood of Evidence \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The general likelihood can be assumed to be similar to all non-business fields, \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

Now, applying Bayes' rule for each:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \]
To keep it proportional without exact \( P(E) \):
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agri\_vet}} \propto 0.07 \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.3}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{business}} \propto 0.03 \]

Considering \( P(E) \) for normalization isn't strictly necessary for proportional results. To compare within given fields:

### Normalization (Comparison Basis)
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agri\_vet}} \approx 0.07 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{business}} \approx 0.03 \]

Thus:

### Final Answer
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
