To employ Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the specified field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch would be observed given that he is enrolled in the specified field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch would be observed given that he is not enrolled in the specified field.

Let's take the two fields mentioned:

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: The base rate of students enrolled in business administration. Assume a moderate value common among various graduate students, say 0.10.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality traits fitting someone in business administration. Given that business administration typically doesn't align closely with a love for animals, nature, and solving puzzles, let's assume a low value, perhaps 0.02.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam's traits being seen in a student not in the business administration field. Since his traits seem more suited to the sciences, we’ll assume a higher value, maybe 0.20.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We can approximate \( P(E) \) using:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.02 \cdot 0.10) + (0.20 \cdot 0.90) = 0.002 + 0.18 = 0.182 \]

So:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02 \cdot 0.10}{0.182} = \frac{0.002}{0.182} \approx 0.011 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: The base rate of students enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Suppose it's lower than business administration, say 0.05.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality traits fitting in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his love for nature, animals, and puzzles, we'll assign a high value, perhaps 0.60.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam’s traits being seen in students not in agricultural and veterinary science. Given these traits are less common outside sciences, assume a lower value, like 0.10.

Using Bayes' Rule again:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Estimate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.60 \cdot 0.05) + (0.10 \cdot 0.95) = 0.03 + 0.095 = 0.125 \]

So:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.60 \cdot 0.05}{0.125} = \frac{0.03}{0.125} = 0.24 \]

Summarizing, we have the following probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.011,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.24
}
