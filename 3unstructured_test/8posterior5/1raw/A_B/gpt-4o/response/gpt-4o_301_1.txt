To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) of Adam being enrolled in either Business Administration or Agricultural and Veterinary Science given the personality sketch \( E \), we can use Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Given the fields:

1. **Business Administration**
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

Let's start by estimating the relevant probabilities.

### Business Administration

1. **Prior probability, \( P(H) \)**:
   - Without specific data, we could assume that the enrollment in Business Administration programs might be relatively common, but not as related to a curiosity about nature and animals.
   - Estimate: \( P(H) = 0.3 \)

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - The personality sketch does not strongly align with typical traits associated with Business Administration (e.g., interest in nature vs. interest in commerce).
   - Estimate: \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \)

3. **Complement likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - For general graduate students not in Business Administration, Adam's traits might be more common.
   - Estimate: \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \)

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior probability, \( P(H) \)**:
   - The enrollment in Agricultural and Veterinary Science might be less common overall but aligns more closely with interests in plants and animals.
   - Estimate: \( P(H) = 0.1 \)

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - The personality sketch closely matches traits valued in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
   - Estimate: \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \)

3. **Complement likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - For general graduate students not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, similar characteristics might be less common.
   - Estimate: \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \)

### Bayes' Rule Application

First, we need the overall probability \( P(E) \) which can be computed as:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)
\]

For Business Administration:
\[
P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.3) + (0.4 \cdot 0.7) = 0.03 + 0.28 = 0.31
\]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[
P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) = 0.07 + 0.27 = 0.34
\]

### Final Probabilities

1. **Business Administration**:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.3}{0.31} \approx 0.097
\]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.34} \approx 0.206
\]

So the estimated probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": 0.097,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.206
}
```
