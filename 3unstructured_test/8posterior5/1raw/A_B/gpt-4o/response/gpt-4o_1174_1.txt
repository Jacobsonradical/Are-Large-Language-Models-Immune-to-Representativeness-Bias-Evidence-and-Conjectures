To compute \( P(H|E) \), I'll use Bayes' theorem, which is stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis \( H \) is not true.

Let's analyze the hypotheses for each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H)**:
   - Given Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, it seems plausible he would enter a field related to agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assign \( P(H) = 0.3 \).

2. **P(E|H)**:
   - If Adam is enrolled in this field, the likelihood of his personality sketch matching would be high. Let's assign \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**:
   - If Adam is not enrolled in this field, the likelihood of his personality sketch matching is relatively lower but could still be moderate due to overlapping interests in other fields. Let's assign \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)**:
   - Given Adam's personality traits, it's less likely but not impossible for him to be in business administration. Let's assign \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

2. **P(E|H)**:
   - If Adam is enrolled in this field, the likelihood of his personality sketch matching is lesser, given his strong affinity towards nature and empathy, which is less associated with business administration. Let's assign \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**:
   - If Adam is not enrolled in this field, the likelihood of his personality sketch matching is higher. Let's assign \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

To compute \( P(H|E) \), we'll also need \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = \sum_{i} P(E|H_i) \cdot P(H_i) + P(E|\neg H_i) \cdot P(\neg H_i) \]

However, since we only have two specific hypotheses without the total context, we focus more on the relative comparisons between these fields. Given that we are not provided with a comprehensive total context, we'll focus on the relative calculations of \( P(H|E) \) using these relative values.

### Calculations:

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.3}{?} \]

For **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{?} \]

Since we are comparing these two fields, their proportional values would give us insights.

### Conclusion:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.583",
  "business administration": "0.083"
}

These values reflect the relative plausibility of Adam being enrolled in either field, given his personality traits and interests. Agricultural and Veterinary Science appears significantly more likely given the provided information.
