To use Bayes' rule to compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch, we need the following probabilities:

- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in the field \( H \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in field \( H \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in field \( H \).

Then we compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don’t have the exact numbers for the prior probabilities and likelihoods, we will make reasonable assumptions for those values based on the given information.

### Assumptions:

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.1 \) (Assuming 10% of graduate students are in business administration)
   - \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.05 \) (Assuming 5% of graduate students are in agricultural and veterinary science)
   
2. **Likelihoods**:
   - **Business Administration**:
     - \( P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.2 \) (The traits described for Adam are moderately unlikely for business administration, but not impossible)
     - \( P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) = 0.05 \) (Assuming most other fields are even less likely to match Adam’s traits, except those closely related to nature)
   - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
     - \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.8 \) (The traits fit very well with this field)
     - \( P(E|\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.1 \) (Most other fields are quite unlikely to match Adam’s traits)

### Calculations:

#### Business Administration:
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(E) = P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) + P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) \cdot P(\neg \text{business administration}) \]

\[ P(E) \approx (0.2 \times 0.1) + (0.05 \times 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.045 = 0.065 \]

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{0.065} \approx 0.3077 \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(E) = P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) + P(E|\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \]

\[ P(E) \approx (0.8 \times 0.05) + (0.1 \times 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.095 = 0.135 \]

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.135} \approx 0.2963 \]

So, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3077,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.2963
}
```
