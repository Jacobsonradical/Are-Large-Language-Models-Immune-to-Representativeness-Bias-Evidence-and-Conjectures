Let's denote:

- \(P(H_{BA})\) as the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \(P(H_{AV})\) as the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \(P(E|H_{BA})\) as the likelihood of observing E given that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \(P(E|H_{AV})\) as the likelihood of observing E given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \(P(E|\neg H_{BA})\) as the likelihood of observing E given that Adam was not enrolled in business administration.
- \(P(E|\neg H_{AV})\) as the likelihood of observing E given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Bayes' rule states:

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

Given the description of Adam, we make the following assumptions for simplicity:
1. **Business Administration**:
   - Prior: Let's assume business administration is a fairly common field, so \(P(H_{BA}) = 0.1\).
   - Likelihood: Adam's personality does not strongly align with typical traits of students in business administration (such as a strong interest in nature and animals). So, \(P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.05\).
   - Complementary likelihood: \(P(E|\neg H_{BA})\) might be higher given his alignment with nature-related fields, say \(0.5\).

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Prior: This field seems more aligned with Adam's interests, but it's less common. So, let's assume \(P(H_{AV}) = 0.05\).
   - Likelihood: Adam's personality strongly aligns with this field. Therefore, \(P(E|H_{AV}) = 0.8\).
   - Complementary likelihood: \(P(E|\neg H_{AV})\) might be lower than for business fields, say \(0.2\).

Now to find the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\) for each field:

### For Business Administration:
\[P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)}\]

\[P(E) = P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \cdot P(\neg H_{BA})\]
\[P(E) = 0.05 \cdot 0.1 + 0.5 \cdot 0.9\]
\[P(E) = 0.005 + 0.45 = 0.455\]

\[P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{0.455} \approx 0.011\]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[P(H_{AV}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AV}) \cdot P(H_{AV})}{P(E)}\]

\[P(E) = P(E|H_{AV}) \cdot P(H_{AV}) + P(E|\neg H_{AV}) \cdot P(\neg H_{AV})\]
\[P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.95\]
\[P(E) = 0.04 + 0.19 = 0.23\]

\[P(H_{AV}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.23} \approx 0.174\]

Thus, the posterior probabilities for the given fields are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.011,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.174
}
```
