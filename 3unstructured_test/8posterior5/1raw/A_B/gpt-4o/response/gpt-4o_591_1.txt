To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need some initial estimates and assumptions. Given that the exact probabilities are not specified, I will provide reasonable estimates based on the personality sketch of Adam.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (that Adam was enrolled in the specific field).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given not-H.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence, which can be computed as:
  \[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Note: For simplicity, we assume \( P(\neg H) \approx 1 \). The probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) are estimated based on common knowledge.

**Estimations:**

- For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
  - \( P(H) \) might be moderately high because Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals aligns well with this field.
  - \( P(E|H) \) would be high since the evidence matches very well with this field.
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \) might be lower because fewer fields align perfectly with this description.

- For **business administration**:
  - \( P(H) \) might be lower due to less alignment of interest.
  - \( P(E|H) \) would be lower since the evidence does not align well with typical business administration traits.
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \) would be higher because more fields are likely to align with Adam's personality than just business administration.

**Assigned Probabilities (Estimates)**:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": {
    "P(H)": 0.3,
    "P(E|H)": 0.9,
    "P(E|\neg H)": 0.2
  },
  "business administration": {
    "P(H)": 0.1,
    "P(E|H)": 0.4,
    "P(E|\neg H)": 0.6
  }
}
```

**Calculations**:

1. **Agricultural and veterinary science**:
   - \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \)
   - \( P(E) = (0.9 \times 0.3) + (0.2 \times 0.7) = 0.27 + 0.14 = 0.41 \)
   - \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.3}{0.41} \approx 0.659 \)

2. **Business administration**:
   - \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \)
   - \( P(E) = (0.4 \times 0.1) + (0.6 \times 0.9) = 0.04 + 0.54 = 0.58 \)
   - \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.1}{0.58} \approx 0.069 \)

**Final Results**:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.659,
  "business administration": 0.069
}
