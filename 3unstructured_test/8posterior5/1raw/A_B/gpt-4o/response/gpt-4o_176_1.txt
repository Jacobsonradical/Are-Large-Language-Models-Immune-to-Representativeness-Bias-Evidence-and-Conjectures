To compute the probabilities using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate the following where \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field, \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of observing his personality sketch given the hypothesis \(H\), and \(P(E|\neg H)\) is the likelihood of observing his personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in that particular field. The posterior probability \(P(H|E)\) combines these values.

Considering the provided personality sketch of Adam and the provided fields:

1. **agricultural and veterinary science**: Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, a deep love for animals, and high intelligence which aligns well with agricultural and veterinary sciences.

   - \(P(H)\): This is the prior probability of Adam being in agricultural and veterinary science. Let’s assume it is modest given the variety of fields one might choose. Let's set \(P(H)\approx 0.2\).
   - \(P(E|H)\): Given that Adam fits the attributes of someone who might study agricultural and veterinary sciences, this probability should be high. Let's assign \(P(E|H)\approx 0.9\).
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\): This represents the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch if he weren't in agricultural and veterinary science. Given the sketch, it's possible someone with his profile might be in some other related fields as well but less likely. Thus, let's say \(P(E|\neg H)\approx 0.3\).
   
   Using Bayes' Rule:
   \(P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \)

   \(P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.2}{(0.9 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8)} \)
   
   \(P(H|E) = \frac{0.18}{0.18 + 0.24} \)
   
   \(P(H|E) = \frac{0.18}{0.42} \approx 0.429\)

2. **business administration**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has a high level of intelligence which might fit business administration roles requiring problem-solving skills and understanding of abstract concepts, but the rest of his personality sketch (e.g., nature, animals) doesn't align as well.

   - \(P(H)\): Let's assume the prior is the same, \(P(H)\approx 0.2\).
   - \(P(E|H)\): The personality fit is less strong here even with some plausible connections. Let’s assign \(P(E|H)\approx 0.4\).
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\): This would likely be the same given we are considering the negation, \(P(E|\neg H)\approx 0.3\).
   
   Using Bayes' Rule:
   \(P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \)

   \(P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{(0.4 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8)} \)
   
   \(P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.24} \)
   
   \(P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.32} \approx 0.25\)

The resulting probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.429,
  "business administration": 0.25
}
