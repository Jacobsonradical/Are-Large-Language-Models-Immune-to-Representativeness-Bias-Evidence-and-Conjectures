Sure, let's denote the fields as follows:
- H₁: Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- H₂: Adam was enrolled in business administration.

Given:
- E: The personality sketch of Adam.

We need to use Bayes' theorem, which states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here's how we can proceed for the calculations:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H₁):** This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Without additional information about the base rates of each field, we might assign a general prior probability for this field. Let's assume a base rate of 0.1 for illustration (since these fields might be less common compared to business administration).

2. **P(E|H₁):** The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Based on the sketch, it's likely that this field aligns well with Adam's interests and characteristics (e.g., love for nature and animals, appreciation for hard work). Therefore, let's assign a relatively high value, say 0.8.

3. **P(E|¬H₁):** The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was NOT enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Since Adam's traits are somewhat specific to this field, let's assign a lower value, say 0.2.

### Business Administration

1. **P(H₂):** This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Business administration might be more common, so let's assume a higher base rate, say 0.3 for illustration.

2. **P(E|H₂):** The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in business administration. Adam's traits are less specific to this field, so let's assign a lower value compared to agricultural and veterinary science, say 0.3.

3. **P(E|¬H₂):** The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was NOT enrolled in business administration. This could be similar to above, say 0.7.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can compute the posterior probabilities. We need the marginal likelihood \( P(E) \), which can be computed as follows:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H₁) \cdot P(H₁) + P(E|¬H₁) \cdot (1 - P(H₁)) \]

and similarly for business administration.

Let's compute:

#### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H₁) \cdot P(H₁) + P(E|¬H₁) \cdot (1 - P(H₁)) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot (1 - 0.1) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.18 = 0.26 \]

\[ P(H₁|E) = \frac{P(E|H₁) \cdot P(H₁)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H₁|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H₁|E) \approx 0.3077 \]

#### For Business Administration:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H₂) \cdot P(H₂) + P(E|¬H₂) \cdot (1 - P(H₂)) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.3 \cdot 0.3 + 0.7 \cdot (1 - 0.3) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.09 + 0.49 = 0.58 \]

\[ P(H₂|E) = \frac{P(E|H₂) \cdot P(H₂)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H₂|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.3}{0.58} \]
\[ P(H₂|E) \approx 0.1552 \]

Therefore, the final posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3077,
  "business administration": 0.1552
}
```

These values are only illustrative and would be more precise with actual base rates and more detailed conditional probabilities.
