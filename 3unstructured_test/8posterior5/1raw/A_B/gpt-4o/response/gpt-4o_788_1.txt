To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field of study given his personality sketch, we will use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in the specific field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the specific field.
- \( P(E) \) is the evidence, which normalizes the result. Since we're comparing probabilities for different fields, we can ignore \( P(E) \) in the comparison as it is the same for all hypotheses.

Given:
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability of the field given no additional information.
- \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood that the specific field aligns with Adam's personality sketch.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likelihood that fields other than the specific field align with Adam's personality sketch.

### Assumptions for Prior Probability P(H):
- Assume an equal likelihood for all graduate fields, noting that this implicitly means that individual field probabilities \( P(H) \) are small due to the large number of possible fields.
- However, since we are comparing relative probabilities, we focus on how well Adam's personality fits each field.

### Likelihood of Personality Traits Given Fields:

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H₁):**
- \( P(H) \): Relatively moderate likelihood considering all graduate fields.
- \( P(E|H) \): Very high likelihood as his curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and understanding of hard work fits well.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Moderate to low, as this personality sketch aligns strongly with Agricultural and Veterinary Science but not necessarily with unrelated fields.

**Business Administration (H₂):**
- \( P(H) \): Relatively moderate likelihood considering all graduate fields.
- \( P(E|H) \): Low to moderate likelihood. Business administration does not heavily align with empathy towards animals or nature, though some traits like high intelligence and appreciation for hard work might fit.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Higher than Agricultural and Veterinary Science as other non-related fields (especially nature-oriented ones) are less likely to fit this personality sketch.

### Calculations:
Given that precise numerical values are not provided, we'll make educated estimates for \( P(E|H) \) based on reasoning.

Let's make some assumptions:
- Prior probability for each field \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \) (assuming equal initial distribution among 10 major fields).

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \) (very high, due to strong alignment)
   - \( P(H) = 0.1 \)

   Using Bayes' rule:
   \[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = 0.09 \]

2. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \) (low to moderate, reasonable overlap in traits)
   - \( P(H) = 0.1 \)

   Using Bayes' rule:
   \[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = 0.03 \]

Thus, the estimated probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.09,
  "business administration": 0.03
}
```

Note: These numbers are relatively comparative and meant to reflect the relative strength of the match of the personality to the fields in question.
