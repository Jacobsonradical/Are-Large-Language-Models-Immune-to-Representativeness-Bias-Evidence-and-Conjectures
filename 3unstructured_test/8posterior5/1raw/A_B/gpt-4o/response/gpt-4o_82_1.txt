To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following steps:

1. **Prior Probability** \( P(H) \): The probability Adam was enrolled in the given field before considering the personality sketch.
2. **Likelihood** \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in the field \( H \).
3. **Normalization Term** \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \), computed as \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \).

We then use Bayes' rule: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)}.\]

Let's estimate the required values:

- **P(H1)**: Prior probability for Business Administration
- **P(H2)**: Prior probability for Agricultural & Veterinary Science
- **P(E|H1)**: Likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is in Business Administration
- **P(E|H2)**: Likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is in Agricultural & Veterinary Science

### Prior Probability Estimates:
Given Adam's background, the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) are challenging to estimate without specific data. However, we can use reasonable approximations:

- **Business Administration (H1)**: Let's assume \( P(H1) = 0.1 \), given that business administration programs are quite common but considering Adam's interests, it might not be the most likely field for him.
- **Agricultural & Veterinary Science (H2)**: Let's assume \( P(H2) = 0.05 \), as it fits Adam's personality better but is statistically less common among graduate students.

### Likelihood Estimates:
Based on the personality sketch:

- **P(E|H1)**: Likelihood of Adam having the given characteristics if he is enrolled in Business Administration. A reasonable estimate might be low, perhaps \( P(E|H1) = 0.02 \), since the sketch fits less with typical business administration students.
- **P(E|H2)**: Likelihood of Adam having the given characteristics if he is enrolled in Agricultural & Veterinary Science. A reasonable estimate might be high, perhaps \( P(E|H2) = 0.7 \), since the sketch fits well with this field.

### Normalization Term \( P(E) \):
To normalize the probabilities, consider others not provided but sum probabilities such that importance is coherent. Without exact complementary probabilities, focus on sketches:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H1)P(H1) + P(E|H2)P(H2) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H1) - P(H2)). \]

For simplicity, approximate overall normalization focused mainly on provided fields as sketch-directed.

### Applying Bayes' Rule:

1. **Business Administration:**

\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1) P(H1)}{P(E)}. \]

2. **Agricultural & Veterinary Science:**

\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{P(E|H2) P(H2)}{P(E)}. \]

Assuming external fit adds slight effect; normalizing \(P(E)\) falls mainly under field-approximate normalization.

### Final Estimates:
```json
{
  "business administration": "0.03",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.33"
}
```
(Note: Actual thorough estimations would need wider characteristic and field data-range calculations for higher fidelity outputs.)
