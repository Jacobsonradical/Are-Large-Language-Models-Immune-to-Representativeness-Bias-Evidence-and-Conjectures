To compute the probabilities using Bayes' rule, let's evaluate the following for each field:

1. **P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field.**
2. **P(E|H): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he was enrolled in the field.**
3. **P(E|¬H): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he was not enrolled in the field.**

For simplicity, let's assume the following general priors based on the likelihood of students enrolling in each field:

- P(H_agricultural and veterinary science) = 0.10 (10%)
- P(H_business administration) = 0.10 (10%)

Next, we'll make subjective estimates for P(E|H) based on the given personality sketch.

- **Agricultural and veterinary science:**
  - P(E|H): Given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, it's very likely he is in this field.
  - Let's estimate P(E|H_agricultural and veterinary science) = 0.80 (80%)

  - P(E|¬H): Given he doesn't fit the typical personality types of many other fields, let's assign a lower probability.
  - Let's estimate P(E|¬H_agricultural and veterinary science) = 0.20 (20%)

- **Business administration:**
  - P(E|H): Given Adam's personality, it's less likely he'll choose a field typically characterized by different personality traits.
  - Let's estimate P(E|H_business administration) = 0.05 (5%)

  - P(E|¬H): Given his interests, it's more likely than specific non-matching fields, but still relatively low.
  - Let's estimate P(E|¬H_business administration) = 0.40 (40%)

Now applying Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.10) + (0.20 \cdot 0.90) = 0.08 + 0.18 = 0.26 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.10}{0.26} = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \approx 0.3077 \]

For business administration:
\[ P(E) = (0.05 \cdot 0.10) + (0.40 \cdot 0.90) = 0.005 + 0.36 = 0.365 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.10}{0.365} = \frac{0.005}{0.365} \approx 0.0137 \]

So, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3077,
  "business administration": 0.0137
}
```

These computed probabilities suggest that based on Adam's personality sketch, it is more likely that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science rather than business administration.
