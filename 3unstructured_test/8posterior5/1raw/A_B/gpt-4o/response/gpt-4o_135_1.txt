To compute the probabilities, we need to consider the prior probability \( P(H) \), the probability of observing the evidence given the hypothesis \( P(E|H) \), and the probability of observing the evidence given the hypothesis is not true \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Let's briefly discuss each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: 
   Agricultural and veterinary science is relatively common, but not all graduates pursue this field. Let’s assume a modest prior.
   
   \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \)

2. **Probability of Evidence Given the Hypothesis \( P(E|H) \)**:
   Given Adam’s curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for dedication, it is likely he could be in this field.
   
   \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \)

3. **Probability of Evidence Given the Hypothesis is False \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   Even if Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science, his personality traits might still align with other fields. However, the match isn't as strong.
   
   \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \)

Using Bayes’ Rule to compute \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.27} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.229 \]

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   Business administration is a very common field for graduate studies.
   
   \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \)

2. **Probability of Evidence Given the Hypothesis \( P(E|H) \)**:
   Given Adam’s interests and personality, it’s less likely for him to be in business administration; he seems more aligned with science or natural studies.
   
   \( P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \)

3. **Probability of Evidence Given the Hypothesis is False \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   The likelihood of these traits fitting another non-business field related to Adam’s interests is relatively higher.
   
   \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.7 \)

Using Bayes’ Rule to compute \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.2 \cdot 0.2 + 0.7 \cdot 0.8} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.56} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.60} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.067 \]

To summarize the calculations in the required format:
