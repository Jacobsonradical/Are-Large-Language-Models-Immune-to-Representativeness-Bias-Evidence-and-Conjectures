To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) (the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given the personality sketch), we will use Bayes' Rule. The formula for Bayes' Rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since \( P(E) \) is the same for both hypotheses being compared, it will cancel out in the relative comparison. Consequently, we only need \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) to compare the two fields.

Let’s start by defining our terms:

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence (the personality sketch) given that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given that Adam was not enrolled in the field.

Given that the total probabilities don't need to sum to 1, we will assign plausible values to \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) based on the description, and then use those values to provide our estimates of \( P(H|E) \):

1. **agricultural and veterinary science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Given Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals, a higher prior probability here might be around 0.25 because graduate students in this field are relatively specialized.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The evidence (personality sketch) strongly matches this field. Let’s assign this a high probability, say 0.9.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \):  For other fields, this personality would be less common, so we use a lower probability, say 0.1.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.9 \cdot 0.25 = 0.225 \]

2. **business administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): This field is quite broad, so a graduate student’s prior probability might be moderate, say around 0.1.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The evidence does not particularly match a typical business administration student. Let's assign a lower probability, say 0.2.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): For non-business fields, the personality trait would be more common in specific fields like arts or human sciences over business. Say 0.8.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \cdot 0.1 = 0.02 \]

Now, comparing the relative magnitudes:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.225,
  "business administration": 0.02
}
```

Note: These values do not need to sum up to 1 as we are primarily comparing these specific fields. The actual posterior probabilities depend on normalization which is not essential for the relative comparison here.
