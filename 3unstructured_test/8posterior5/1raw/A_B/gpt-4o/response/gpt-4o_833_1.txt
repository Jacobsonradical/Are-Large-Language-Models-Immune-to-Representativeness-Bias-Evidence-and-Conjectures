In this scenario, we want to estimate the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration or agricultural and veterinary science, given his personality sketch \( E \). We will utilize the Bayesian formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

### Business Administration
1. **Assume P(H) for Business Administration**: 
   - Let's say graduate students in business administration make up about 0.2 (20%) of the population.
   
2. **Estimate P(E|H) for Business Administration**:
   - The attributes in the personality sketch (curiosity about nature, love for animals, etc.) do not strongly correlate with business administration, which is more about management, finance, etc.
   - We might estimate this to be relatively low, let's say 0.1.
   
3. **Estimate P(E|\neg H)**:
   - P(E|\neg H) represents how likely the personality traits are given that Adam is *not* in business administration.
   - Given the prevalence of students in other fields that might align with these traits, let's assume it's moderately high, say 0.4.

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we don't actually know P(E), we can compare ratios and infer relative likelihoods directly.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **Assume P(H) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Let's say students in agricultural and veterinary science make up about 0.1 (10%) of the population.
   
2. **Estimate P(E|H) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - The personality traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, etc.) strongly correlate with this field.
   - We might estimate this to be quite high, let's say 0.7.

3. **Estimate P(E|\neg H)**:
   - Again, P(E|\neg H) is the likelihood of seeing these traits outside this field.
   - Let's assume a moderate value of 0.4, since there are many other fields where these traits might still be relevant.

Again using Bayes' rule and comparing ratios:

### Final Calculations
We will normalize these probabilities for comparison.

1. **business administration**: 
   - \( P(H) = 0.2 \)
   - \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \)
   - Relative \( P(H|E) \text{ for business administration} \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.4} = 0.05 \)

2. **agricultural and veterinary science**: 
   - \( P(H) = 0.1 \)
   - \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \)
   - Relative \( P(H|E) \text{ for agricultural and veterinary science} \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.4} = 0.175 \)

Normalize these values (for simplicity, since they are not actual probabilities but proportional values):

The total is \( 0.05 + 0.175 = 0.225 \). The normalized probabilities can be calculated as:

\[ P(H|E) \text{ for business administration} = \frac{0.05}{0.225} \approx 0.22 \]
\[ P(H|E) \text{ for agricultural and veterinary science} = \frac{0.175}{0.225} \approx 0.78 \]
