First, let's outline the probabilities needed to apply Bayes' Rule for these fields:

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field, without any additional information.
2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: The probability of Adam having his described characteristics given that he is in a specific field.
3. **Marginal Probability \(P(E|\neg H)\)**: The probability of Adam having his characteristics given that he is not in the specified field.

### Business Administration

#### Assumptions and Probability Estimates:
- **P(H for Business Administration)**: Let's assume that approximately 10% of graduate students are enrolled in business administration programs.
  - \(P(H) \approx 0.10\)
- **P(E|H for Business Administration)**: Business administration students might also have empathy and high intelligence, but they are less likely to have a strong love for nature, plants, and animals compared to agricultural and veterinary science students. Let's estimate this to be low.
  - \(P(E|H) \approx 0.05\)
- **P(E|\neg H)**: This is the probability of Adam having these characteristics if he is not enrolled in business administration. Given the description fits better with fields related to nature and animals, this might be moderately high.
  - \(P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.30\)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Plugging in the values for business administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.10}{0.05 \cdot 0.10 + 0.30 \cdot 0.90} = \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.27} \approx \frac{0.005}{0.275} = 0.018 \]

So, \( P(H|E) \) for business administration is approximately 0.018 (~1.8%).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

#### Assumptions and Probability Estimates:
- **P(H for Agricultural and Veterinary Science)**: Let's assume that approximately 2% of graduate students are enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science programs.
  - \(P(H) \approx 0.02\)
- **P(E|H for Agricultural and Veterinary Science)**: The likelihood of having Adam's characteristics in this field is very high.
  - \(P(E|H) \approx 0.90\)
- **P(E|\neg H)**: If Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary sciences, the probability of him having these characteristics might be lower compared to fields involving nature and animals.
  - \(P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.20\)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Plugging in the values for agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.90 \cdot 0.02}{0.90 \cdot 0.02 + 0.20 \cdot 0.98} = \frac{0.018}{0.018 + 0.196} \approx \frac{0.018}{0.214} = 0.084 \]

So, \( P(H|E) \) for agricultural and veterinary science is approximately 0.084 (~8.4%).
