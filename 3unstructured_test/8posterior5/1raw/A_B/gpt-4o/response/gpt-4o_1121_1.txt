Let's go through the process of estimating \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each hypothesis regarding Adam's field of graduate study. Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We will assume \( P(E) \) is constant for both hypotheses since we are trying to compare the probabilities given the same evidence.

### Hypothesis 1: Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: The general probability that a student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Let's assume the probability is moderate given the context of a graduate student in the U.S. It could be around 0.05, because this field is less common than some other fields.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Given Adam's love for nature, animals, and plants, it aligns very well. Thus, we'll assume a high probability for this: let's say 0.8.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is **not** in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Since many other fields do not naturally align with his described interests as well as agricultural and veterinary science, this might be lower. Let's assume it is 0.2.

### Hypothesis 2: Adam is enrolled in Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: The general probability that a student is enrolled in business administration.
   - This is a fairly common field, so let's assume a higher probability, say 0.2.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is in business administration.
   - His love for nature, animals, and plants is not typically associated with business administration, so this probability might be low. Let's assume it is 0.1.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is **not** in business administration.
   - Since this covers a lot of fields, including those that might align better with the sketch, we'll assume this is moderate. Let's say 0.3.

Now, let's compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule and normalize the results for comparison.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.05
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = 0.04
   \]

2. **Business Administration**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.2
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = 0.02
   \]

Given the proportional values, we can see that the likelihood is higher for agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration.

Here's the final result in the requested format:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.04,
  "business administration": 0.02
}
