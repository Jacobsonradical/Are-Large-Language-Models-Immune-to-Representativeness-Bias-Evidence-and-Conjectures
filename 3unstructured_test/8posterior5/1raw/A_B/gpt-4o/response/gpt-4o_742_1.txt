To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' theorem, we need the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the marginal likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each hypothesis. I’ll make reasonable assumptions based on the information given.

Let’s break this down step by step for both fields: agricultural and veterinary science, and business administration.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Assumption: Given that Adam is a graduate student in the U.S., let’s assume a reasonable prior of about 5% that a random graduate student might be in this field. Thus, \( P(H) = 0.05 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Given interests in nature, plants, animals, and empathy, it is highly likely Adam would be in this field.
   - Assumption: We can assign a high likelihood, say \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).

3. **Marginal Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - This is the probability of observing Adam’s characteristics if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Assumption: Since there are many other fields, we might assume a lower probability of these characteristics with other fields, say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Assumption: Let’s assume about 10% of graduate students might be in business administration given the popularity of MBA programs. Thus, \( P(H) = 0.10 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Given Adam's interests and empathy, it is less likely, but not impossible, that he would be in business administration.
   - Assumption: We can assign a moderate likelihood, say \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).

3. **Marginal Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - This is the probability of observing Adam’s characteristics if he is not in business administration.
   - Assumption: Given the broad array of other fields that might align better with his interests, \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.7 \).

### Compute \( P(H|E) \) Using Bayes' Theorem

Using \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \), where \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \):

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) = (0.9 \times 0.05) + (0.2 \times 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.045 + 0.19 = 0.235 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{(0.9)(0.05)}{0.235} \approx 0.191 \]

#### Business Administration
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) = (0.2 \times 0.10) + (0.7 \times 0.90) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.63 = 0.65 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{(0.2)(0.10)}{0.65} \approx 0.031 \]
