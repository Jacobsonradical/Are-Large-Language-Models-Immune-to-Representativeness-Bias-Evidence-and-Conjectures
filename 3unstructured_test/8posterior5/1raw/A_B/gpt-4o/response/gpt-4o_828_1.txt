To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \): Total probability of the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given that \( H \) is not true.

Let's break it down:

### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. For simplicity, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \) (This could be adjusted based on actual data).
- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood that Adam exhibits the given personality if he is studying agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's strong empathy, curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, this field aligns well. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood that Adam exhibits these traits if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Considering there are many fields outside agricultural and veterinary science and not all would align as well, let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

We simplify the problem by assuming the normalization factor \( P(E) \) remains the same for each calculation.

### 2. Business Administration
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is in business administration. For simplicity, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (Again, this could be adjusted based on actual data).
- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood that Adam exhibits the given personality if he is studying business administration. While some aspects of his personality might align (e.g., solving puzzles, appreciation for hard work), others (e.g., love for animals, curiosity about nature) may not. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood that Adam exhibits these traits if he is not in business administration. This remains the same as for other fields outside business administration, let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

Now, using Bayes' Rule:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science} | E) = \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)} \]

Let \( P(E) \) be a normalization constant \( k \).

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science} | E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{k} \]

### Business Administration

\[ P(\text{business administration} | E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(\text{business administration} | E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{k} \]

### Probability Calculation (Relative Comparison)
Since we use a constant \( k \) for comparison, focus only on the numerator for relative probability comparison.

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04 \]

#### Business Administration:
\[ 0.2 \cdot 0.15 = 0.03 \]

Now, we normalize these values to sum to 1:

Given sum for normalization \( S = 0.04 + 0.03 = 0.07 \)

\[
\begin{align*}
P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science} | E) &= \frac{0.04}{0.07} \approx 0.571 \\
P(\text{business administration} | E) &= \frac{0.03}{0.07} \approx 0.429
\end{align*}
\]

So, the estimated probabilities in JSON format are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.571,
  "business administration": 0.429
}
```
