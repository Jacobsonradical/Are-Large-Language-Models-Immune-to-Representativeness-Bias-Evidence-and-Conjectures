To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' theorem, we need to evaluate the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood under the complement hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H) \). Here is the Bayes' theorem formula for reference:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We can simplify this to only compare relative probabilities between different fields, avoiding the exact computation of \( P(E) \). Let's assign reasonable estimates based on the given personality sketch, which aligns more with agricultural and veterinary sciences but less with business administration.

### Evaluation:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - **P(H):** Let's assume a relatively modest prior probability that a random graduate student might enroll in this field, say 0.10.
   - **P(E|H):** Given Adam's traits such as curiosity about nature, empathy for animals, and appreciation for hard work, it's very likely he fits this description, so let's assign 0.80.
   - **P(E|\neg H):** For other graduate fields where such traits might be less expected (e.g., Business), we assume a lower likelihood, perhaps 0.20.

2. **Business Administration:**
   - **P(H):** Given the number of graduate students in various disciplines, let's assume business administration has a higher prior, say, 0.20.
   - **P(E|H):** Adam's traits do not strongly align with typical traits sought in business administration, so let's assign a lower likelihood, say, 0.10.
   - **P(E|\neg H):** For other fields outside business administration, his traits could be slightly more common, let's assume 0.30.

Now, let's compute the posterior probabilities:

### Calculations:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   \[
   P(H|E)_{agricultural \& veterinary} = \frac{P(E|H)_{agricultural \& veterinary} \cdot P(H)_{agricultural \& veterinary}}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.10}{0.80 \cdot 0.10 + 0.20 \cdot 0.90}
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   P(H|E)_{agricultural \& veterinary} \approx \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.18} = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \approx 0.31
   \]

2. **Business Administration:**
   \[
   P(H|E)_{business} = \frac{P(E|H)_{business} \cdot P(H)_{business}}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.10 \cdot 0.20}{0.10 \cdot 0.20 + 0.30 \cdot 0.80}
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   P(H|E)_{business} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.24} = \frac{0.02}{0.26} \approx 0.08
   \]

### Final Values:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.31,
  "business administration": 0.08
}
```
These posterior probabilities indicate that, given Adam's personality sketch, he is more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration.
