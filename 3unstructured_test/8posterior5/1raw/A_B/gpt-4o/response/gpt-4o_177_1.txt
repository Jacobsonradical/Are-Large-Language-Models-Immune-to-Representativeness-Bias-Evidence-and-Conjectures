To use Bayes' rule for calculating the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \), we need to understand the basic components of the breakdown:

1. **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field.
2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch \( E \) is accurate given he was enrolled in the specific field \( H \).
3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch \( E \) is accurate given he was **not** enrolled in the specific field \( H \).

Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the two fields specified:

### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **\( P(H) \)**: This field's popularity among graduate students isn't extraordinarily high or low; we can estimate a moderate baseline. Let's say 0.1 (making this up for our calculation).
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's characteristics such as a love for nature, animals, and empathy strongly fit the profile for someone in agricultural and veterinary science. We can estimate this high: 0.8.
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Given that not everyone in graduate studies has such a personality, but assuming the personality sketch could fit other fields too, let's estimate this at 0.3.

### 2. Business Administration

- **\( P(H) \)**: Business administration is a popular field. We'll use an average prior value of 0.2.
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: These personality traits don't fit the typical profile for someone in business administration as closely as they do for agricultural and veterinary science. Let's estimate this as low: 0.2.
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability that someone not in business administration fits Adamâ€™s personality might be generally higher than 0.3 due to broader options. Let's conservatively use 0.2.

Now, to calculate \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

We'll compute \( P(E) \) separately for each field.

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

\[ P(E) = (P(E|H) \cdot P(H))_{Ag/Vet} + (P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.27 = 0.35 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.35} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \approx 0.229 \]

#### Business Administration

\[ P(E) = (P(E|H) \cdot P(H))_{BusAdmin} + (P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.2) + (0.2 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.16 = 0.2 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.2} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.2} = 0.2 \]

So the results would be in the following format:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.229,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```
