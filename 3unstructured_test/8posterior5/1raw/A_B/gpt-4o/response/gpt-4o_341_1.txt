To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Rule, we need to consider the following:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in the specific field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in the specific field.
- \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the specific field given his personality sketch.

Bayes' Rule is expressed as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the evidence, computed as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{1}) \cdot P(H_{1}) + P(E|H_{2}) \cdot P(H_{2}) + \ldots \]

For simplification, since we are only comparing two hypotheses at a time, we can skip calculating \( P(E) \):

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: Let's assume the prior probability \( P(H) \) of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is fairly common among those interested in nature and animals.
  \( P(H) = 0.2 \)

- **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's personality sketch — genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and high empathy — this is highly consistent with agricultural and veterinary science.
  \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \)

- **P(E|\neg H)**: Among the remaining fields, Adam's personality traits might not fit as well compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
  \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \)

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: Let's assume the prior probability \( P(H) \) of Adam being enrolled in business administration is common but less likely given his personality sketch.
  \( P(H) = 0.1 \)

- **P(E|H)**: Adam’s personality traits like empathy might benefit business administration (e.g., in human resources), but his love for nature and animals isn’t typical.
  \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \)

- **P(E|\neg H)**: Business administration is a broad field; many who aren't in business administration might still have the traits Adam possesses.
  \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \)

Applying Bayes' Rule for each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.2}{0.9 \cdot 0.2 + 0.2 \cdot 0.8} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.18}{0.18 + 0.16} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.18}{0.34} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.529 \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.3 \cdot 0.1 + 0.6 \cdot 0.9} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.54} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.57} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.053 \]

Final answers:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.529",
  "business administration": "0.053"
}
