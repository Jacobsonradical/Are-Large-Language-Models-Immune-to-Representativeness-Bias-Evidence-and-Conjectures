To determine the probabilities, we'll need to apply Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields when calculating relative probabilities, we can disregard it for direct comparisons. We'll focus on estimating \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field.

Let's break down the probabilities for each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H\_agri):** The prior probability that a graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's estimate this as 0.05.
- **P(E|H\_agri):** The probability that Adam has the given personality traits given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals, this is likely high. Let's estimate this as 0.8.
- **P(E|not\_H\_agri):** The probability that Adam has the given personality traits given that he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. This would be lower, but not negligible, because a small number of people in other fields might share these traits. Let's estimate this as 0.2.

### Business Administration

- **P(H\_bus):** The prior probability that a graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in business administration. This field is more commonly chosen compared to agricultural and veterinary science. Let's estimate this as 0.2.
- **P(E|H\_bus):** The probability that Adam has the given personality traits given that he is in business administration. Given his personality traits, it seems less likely that he would choose this field. Let's estimate this as 0.05.
- **P(E|not\_H\_bus):** The probability that Adam has the given personality traits given that he is not in business administration. This would be higher than the field-specific probability. Let's estimate this as 0.25.

With these estimates, let's calculate \( P(H|E) \):

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} 
\approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)}
\]

#### Business Administration
\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\approx \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)}
\]

Let's normalize these:

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[
P(H\_agri|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.05 \cdot 0.2}
= \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.01} = \frac{0.04}{0.05} \approx 0.8
\]

For Business Administration:
\[
P(H\_bus|E) \approx \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.2}{0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.05 \cdot 0.2}
= \frac{0.01}{0.04 + 0.01} = \frac{0.01}{0.05} \approx 0.2
\]

The answers are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
