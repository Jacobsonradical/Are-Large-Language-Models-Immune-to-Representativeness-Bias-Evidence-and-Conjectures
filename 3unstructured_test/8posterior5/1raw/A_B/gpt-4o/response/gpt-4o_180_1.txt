Let's use Bayes' theorem to compute the probabilities. 

Bayes' theorem states that:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To simplify, we assume:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not in that field.
- \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \) is the total probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.

We need to make reasonable assumptions about these probabilities based on the given information:

**1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- Given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, we would expect \( P(E|H) \) to be high.
- The general likelihood of students in graduate programs being in this field \[ P(H) \], will be lower than some more common fields, but not negligible.
- For simplicity, \( P(E|\neg H) \) would be lower since his personality aligns more with this field than others.

Based on these assumptions:
- \( P(H) \) could be around 0.05 (5%)
- \( P(E|H) \) might be around 0.9 (90%)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) might be around 0.1 (10%)

**2. Business Administration:**
- Adam's personality traits do not strongly align with the typical business administration focus, so \( P(E|H) \) would be lower.
- \( P(H) \) for business administration is likely higher due to its popularity as a graduate field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) would be higher since Adam's traits do not heavily disfavor this field but are not strongly suggestive.

Based on these assumptions:
- \( P(H) \) could be around 0.15 (15%)
- \( P(E|H) \) might be around 0.2 (20%)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) might be around 0.1 (10%)

**Calculations:**

**1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.05) + (0.1 \cdot 0.95) = 0.045 + 0.095 = 0.14 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.14} = \frac{0.045}{0.14} \approx 0.32 \]

**2. Business Administration:**
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.15) + (0.1 \cdot 0.85) = 0.03 + 0.085 = 0.115 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{0.115} = \frac{0.03}{0.115} \approx 0.26 \]

Returning the formatted probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.32,
  "business administration": 0.26
}
```

Remember, these are rough estimates based on the assumptions made, and the actual probabilities may vary with more detailed information.
