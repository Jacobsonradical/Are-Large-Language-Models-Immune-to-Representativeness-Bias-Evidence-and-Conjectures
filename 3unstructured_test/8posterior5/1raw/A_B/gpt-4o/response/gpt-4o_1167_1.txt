To determine the probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we are provided with two fields, let's denote them as follows:
- \( H_1 \): Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( H_2 \): Adam was enrolled in business administration.

We need to estimate:
- \( P(H_1) \): The initial probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H_1) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H_1) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(H_2) \): The initial probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|H_2) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in business administration.
- \( P(E|\neg H_2) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in business administration.

Based on Adam's personality sketch, it seems more compatible with agricultural and veterinary science than business administration. Hence, we might assign higher conditional probabilities for those who match his personality sketch.

Let's assume the following values:
- \(P(H_1) = 0.1\): A small but plausible percentage of graduate students might be in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \(P(E|H_1) = 0.8\): Adam's traits are highly compatible with agricultural and veterinary science.
- \(P(E|\neg H_1) = 0.2\): Adam's traits are somewhat less common among those not in agricultural and veterinary science.

- \(P(H_2) = 0.2\): A more significant portion of graduate students may be in business administration.
- \(P(E|H_2) = 0.1\): Adam's traits are less compatible with business administration.
- \(P(E|\neg H_2) = 0.5\): Adam's traits have intermediate compatibility among those not in business administration.

Next, let's apply Bayes' theorem.

1. For \( H_1 \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E|\neg H_1) \cdot P(\neg H_1) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.18 = 0.26 \]

\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.26} \approx 0.3077 \]

2. For \( H_2 \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) + P(E|\neg H_2) \cdot P(\neg H_2) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.4 = 0.42 \]

\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.42} \approx 0.0476 \]

Thus, the calculated probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3077,
  "business administration": 0.0476
}
```
