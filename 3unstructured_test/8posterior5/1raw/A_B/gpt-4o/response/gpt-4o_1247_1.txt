To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Estimate the prior \( P(H) \)**: The probability that Adam was enrolled in the respective field without knowing his personality sketch.
2. **Estimate \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in the respective field.
3. **Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in the respective field.

**Bayes' rule** tells us:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We will assume \( P(E) \) to be a normalizing constant that makes sure our posteriors add up to 1 across all possible fields, but since we only need relative values to compare, we'll omit it from our calculations.

Let’s break this down for each of the fields:

### Business Administration (BA)

- **P(H)**: Moderate probability, as Business Administration is a common graduate program.
  - Estimated \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \)
- **P(E|H)**: Lower probability that someone in Business Administration would have Adam's personality sketch, which is more focused on nature and empathy over business metrics.
  - Estimated \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \)
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Moderate probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he were in other fields.
  - Estimated \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \)

Applying Bayes' rule (ignoring \( P(E) \) as a constant):

\[ P(H|E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS)

- **P(H)**: Moderate probability, less common than Business Administration but still significant.
  - Estimated \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \)
- **P(E|H)**: High probability that someone in AVS would have Adam's personality sketch, which fits well with nature, animals, empathy, and hard work.
  - Estimated \( P(E|H) \approx 0.7 \)
- **P(E|\neg H)**: This would be lower since fewer other fields align so perfectly with Adam’s interests and personality.
  - Estimated \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \)

Applying Bayes' rule (ignoring \( P(E) \) as a constant):

\[ P(H|E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E)_{AVS} = 0.7 \cdot 0.1 = 0.07 \]

Now, normalizing (so the total considerations add up relatively):

Business Administration: 
\[ \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.07} = \frac{0.02}{0.09} \approx 0.222 \]

Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 
\[ \frac{0.07}{0.02 + 0.07} = \frac{0.07}{0.09} \approx 0.778 \]

Thus, the normalized probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.222,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.778
}
```
