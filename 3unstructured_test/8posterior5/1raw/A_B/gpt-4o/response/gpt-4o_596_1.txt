First, let's outline the probabilities:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field (business administration or agricultural and veterinary science).
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in that specific field.

For each field, we will compute the prior probabilities and the conditional probabilities, then apply Bayes' Rule:

### Business Administration

1. **P(H):** Let's assume that the prior probability of randomly selecting a graduate student enrolled in business administration is moderate, say \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
2. **P(E|H):** Given the personality sketch, the traits don't align strongly with typical business administration students. So, \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \).
3. **P(E|\neg H):** This is more complex as it encompasses all other fields. Given the traits listed, they are more likely to align with other fields such as those related to nature and animals. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \):
\[ P(E) \approx 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8 = 0.02 + 0.32 = 0.34 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.02}{0.34} \approx 0.0588 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H):** Let's assume the prior probability for agricultural and veterinary science is lower since itâ€™s a more specialized field, \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
2. **P(E|H):** Given the personality sketch, the traits align strongly with someone in this field. Thus, \( P(E|H) \approx 0.7 \).
3. **P(E|\neg H):** Given the traits, it's less likely to find this combination elsewhere. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \):
\[ P(E) \approx 0.7 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9 = 0.07 + 0.27 = 0.34 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.07}{0.34} \approx 0.2059 \]

The estimates in standard precision are:
