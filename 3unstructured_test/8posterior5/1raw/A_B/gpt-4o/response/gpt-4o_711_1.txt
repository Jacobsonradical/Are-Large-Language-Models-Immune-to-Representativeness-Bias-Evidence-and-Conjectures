To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis \( H \) (enrollment in a particular field) given the evidence \( E \) (the personality sketch of Adam), we need the following:

1. **Base rate \( P(H) \)**: The general prior probability that a student would be enrolled in a specific field.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of the evidence given the hypothesis.
3. **Marginal likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of the evidence given that the hypothesis is not true.

We'll need to use Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, because we are comparing different fields, we don't need the exact value of \( P(E) \). We only need to compare the numerators (i.e., \( P(E|H)P(H) \)) across the different hypotheses.

Let's make some reasonable assumptions:

1. **Base rates**:
   - Assume that the prior probability \( P(H) \) for any field of specialization (before considering the evidence) is relatively low but more or less similar for any academic system. Let's assume:
     - For business administration students: \( P(H_{\text{business}}) = 0.2 \)
     - For agricultural and veterinary science students: \( P(H_{\text{agri\_vet}}) = 0.1 \)

2. **Likelihoods**:
   - Given the personality sketch, Adam seems more aligned with agricultural and veterinary science due to his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. This means \( P(E|H_{\text{agri\_vet}}) \) should be high.
   - For business administration, which is more focused on human organizational behavior rather than nature and animals, the likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \) should be lower. Let's assume:
     - For business administration: \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) = 0.1 \)
     - For agricultural and veterinary science: \( P(E|H_{\text{agri\_vet}}) = 0.7 \)

3. **Marginal likelihood**:
   - Probability \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence if Adam is not enrolled in the respective field. Given there's a wide range of other possible fields that might have traits fitting the sketch, let's assume:
     - Neglecting the normalization factor for \( \neg H \) to illustrate relative comparison purposes.

Plugging these into Bayes' rule:

- For business administration:
  \[
  P(H_{\text{business}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}}) = 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02
  \]

- For agricultural and veterinary science:
  \[
  P(H_{\text{agri\_vet}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{agri\_vet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agri\_vet}}) = 0.7 \times 0.1 = 0.07
  \]

Given these computations, relative scores suggest a higher likelihood for agricultural and veterinary science than business administration. To normalize:

- Total factors = \( 0.02 + 0.07 = 0.09 \)

Now, normalizing relative likelihoods:
- \( P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.09} \approx 0.22 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{agri\_vet}}|E) = \frac{0.07}{0.09} \approx 0.78 \)

Thus, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.22,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.78
}
