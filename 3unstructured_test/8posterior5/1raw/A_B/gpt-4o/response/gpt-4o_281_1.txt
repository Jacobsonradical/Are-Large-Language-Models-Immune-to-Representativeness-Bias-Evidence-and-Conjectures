Sure, let's begin by evaluating the probabilities.

**For Business Administration:**
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration as a graduate student (without any additional information) could be considered a bit lower compared to some other fields because his personality traits do not strongly align with typical characteristics of business students. Let's assume P(H) = 0.10.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in Business Administration is likely low because his interests and traits do not closely match this field. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.05.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in Business Administration might be higher because his traits are more consistent with other fields. Let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.20.

Now, using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.10}{0.05 \cdot 0.10 + 0.20 \cdot 0.90} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.18} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.185} \approx 0.027 \]

**For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science might be considered relatively higher given his interests and traits. Let's assume P(H) = 0.20.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is likely high because his personality aligns well with this field. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.75.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science would be lower. Let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.10.

Now, using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.75 \cdot 0.20}{0.75 \cdot 0.20 + 0.10 \cdot 0.80} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.08} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.15}{0.23} \approx 0.652 \]

So the final results would be:

{
  "business administration": 0.027,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.652
}
