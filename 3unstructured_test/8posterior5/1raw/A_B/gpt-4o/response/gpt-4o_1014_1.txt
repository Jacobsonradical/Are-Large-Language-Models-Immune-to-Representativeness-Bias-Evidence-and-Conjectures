To estimate \( P(H|E) \), the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch, we need to apply Bayes' Rule. Bayes' Rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we need to compute this for two different fields (business administration and agricultural and veterinary science), proper estimation of \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) is required. Note that the exact values cannot be precisely determined without more specific data, so I'll provide reasonable estimates based on typical assumptions and known characteristics of each field.

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Business administration is a common field of study. Let's assume a moderate prior probability.
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Given the personality sketch, it seems less likely that Adam's personality aligns with typical traits needed in business administration (e.g., people skills, assertiveness). However, it’s not impossible.
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \)

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of the personality sketch given other fields. Since many fields may suit Adam's traits, let's assume this is moderately high.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.25 \)

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This field is less common than business administration, but still fairly significant given Adam's traits.
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's interest in nature, plants, empathy, and animals highly aligns with this field.
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.7 \)

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: As before, many other fields might fit Adam’s personality. Let’s assume this is same as for business administration.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.25 \)

Now, applying Bayes' Rule:

1. **For Business Administration**:
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
   Approximating \( P(E) \approx P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H)) \),
   \[ P(E) \approx 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.25 \cdot 0.8 = 0.02 + 0.2 = 0.22 \]

   So,
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.22} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.22} \approx 0.091 \]

2. **For Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
   Approximating \( P(E) \approx P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H)) \),
   \[ P(E) \approx 0.7 \cdot 0.1 + 0.25 \cdot 0.9 = 0.07 + 0.225 = 0.295 \]

   So,
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.295} \approx \frac{0.07}{0.295} \approx 0.237 \]

Therefore, based on these estimated probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.091,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.237
}
```
