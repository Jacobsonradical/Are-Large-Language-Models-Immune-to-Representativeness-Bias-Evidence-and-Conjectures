To apply Bayes' rule and compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study, we need to estimate the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in each field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in each field.

We can then use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of \( E \):

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

For simplicity in calculation, let's assume that prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field are roughly equal due to lack of specific enrollment data. We will assume reasonable estimates for the likelihoods based on the given personality sketch.

### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: Let's assume \( P(H) \) to be 0.1 (10% chance of choosing this field amongst varied choices).
- **Likelihood of personality given this field, \( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, the likelihood is high. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).
- **Likelihood of personality given not this field, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Less likely, but not extremely unlikely. Assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

### 2. Business Administration
- **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: Again, assume \( P(H) \) to be 0.1.
- **Likelihood of personality given this field, \( P(E|H) \)**: Traits such as empathy and intelligence are useful but not directly aligned with scientific curiosity about nature and animals. Assume \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).
- **Likelihood of personality given not this field, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Similar reasoning as before, \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

### Computation Using Bayes' Rule

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.7 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.07}{0.07 + 0.18} = \frac{0.07}{0.25} = 0.28
\]

2. **Business Administration**
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.3 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.18} = \frac{0.03}{0.21} = 0.143
\]

Thus, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.28,
  "business administration": 0.143
}
```
