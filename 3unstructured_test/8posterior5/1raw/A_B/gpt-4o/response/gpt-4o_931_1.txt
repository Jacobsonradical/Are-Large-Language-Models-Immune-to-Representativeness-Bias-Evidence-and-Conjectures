To calculate the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch, we will use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.

To apply this formula, let's assign values:
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science** (H₁):
    - \( P(H₁) \): Let’s assume a prior probability of 0.1 (10%) as a rough estimate.
    - \( P(E|H₁) \): The personality sketch aligns strongly with this field. Let’s set it at 0.8 (80%).
    - \( P(E|\neg H₁) \): This represents the probability of observing Adam's personality in other fields. Assuming there are many other fields, let’s set this conservatively at 0.3 (30%).

2. **Business Administration** (H₂):
    - \( P(H₂) \): Let’s assume a prior probability of 0.2 (20%) as a rough estimate.
    - \( P(E|H₂) \): The personality sketch does not strongly align with business administration. Let’s set it at 0.1 (10%).
    - \( P(E|\neg H₂) \): This represents the probability of observing Adam's personality in other fields. Let’s set it at 0.7 (70%).

To apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to find \( P(E) \). The value of \( P(E) \) might be complicated to compute without all the other fields' data, so we'll focus on relative probabilities using just the above fields for simplicity.

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H₁|E) = \frac{P(E|H₁) \cdot P(H₁)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

### For Business Administration:
\[ P(H₂|E) = \frac{P(E|H₂) \cdot P(H₂)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

We need \( P(E) \). If we normalize these calculations:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H₁) \cdot P(H₁) + P(E|H₂) \cdot P(H₂) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.08 + 0.02 = 0.1 \]


### Normalize each probability (You do not need to normalize them as the sum need not be 1):
\[ P(H₁|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.1} = 0.8 \]
\[ P(H₂|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.1} = 0.2 \]

Based on these calculations, the relative probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
