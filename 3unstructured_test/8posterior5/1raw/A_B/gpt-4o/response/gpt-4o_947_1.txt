To compute the probabilities that Adam is enrolled in either business administration or agricultural and veterinary science based on his personality sketch, we will follow the given format. 

Firstly, let's denote:

- \(P(H_b)\) as the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration.
- \(P(H_a)\) as the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \(P(E|H_b)\) as the probability of the personality sketch given Adam is enrolled in business administration.
- \(P(E|H_a)\) as the probability of the personality sketch given Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \(P(E|\neg H_b)\) as the probability of the personality sketch given Adam is not enrolled in business administration.
- \(P(E|\neg H_a)\) as the probability of the personality sketch given Adam is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

We can then compute:

- \(P(H_b|E)\) as the probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration given the personality sketch.
- \(P(H_a|E)\) as the probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given the personality sketch.

Since we are provided with a sketch that includes specific traits (nature curiosity, love for animals, intelligence, empathy, etc.), we can infer:

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - \(P(H_b)\): Business administration is a common field, let's assume a moderate prior, say \(0.3\).
   - \(P(H_a)\): Agricultural and veterinary science is a less common field, but Adam's traits strongly suggest this interest. Let's assume a higher prior, say \(0.4\).

2. **Likelihoods**:
   - \(P(E|H_b) = 0.1\): A business administration student is less likely to have a strong love for nature, animals, and empathy as academically relevant traits.
   - \(P(E|H_a) = 0.8\): A student in agricultural and veterinary science is highly likely to exhibit these traits.

3. **Complementary Probabilities**:
   - \(P(E|\neg H_b) = 0.7\): People not in business administration may still highly exhibit these traits, though not as highly as the agricultural and veterinary science students.
   - \(P(E|\neg H_a) = 0.2\): Higher likelihood than business but less compared to the focused field.

Now, applying Bayesâ€™ Rule:

\[
P(H_b|E) = \frac{P(E|H_b) \cdot P(H_b)}{P(E)}
\]
\[
P(H_a|E) = \frac{P(E|H_a) \cdot P(H_a)}{P(E)}
\]

To determine \(P(E)\), we can use the Law of Total Probability:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H_b) \cdot P(H_b) + P(E|H_a) \cdot P(H_a) + P(E|\neg H_b) \cdot P(\neg H_b) \times 0.7 + P(E|\neg H_a) \cdot P(\neg H_a) \times 0.6
\]

Given the information, let's assume \(P(H_c)\) for other fields sums to 1. Thus we are limited in total.\(P(\neg H_b) = 0.7\) and \(P(\neg H_a) = 0.6\), we estimate:

\[
P(E) = 0.1 \times 0.3 + 0.8 \times 0.4 + 0.7 \times 0.7 \times 0.6 + 0.2 \times 0.6 = 0.273
\]

Calculations for posteriors:

\[
P(H_b|E)  = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.3}{0.273} \approx 0.109
\]
\[
P(H_a|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.4}{0.273} \approx 1.17
\]

Thus, given the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.109",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "1.17"
}
```
