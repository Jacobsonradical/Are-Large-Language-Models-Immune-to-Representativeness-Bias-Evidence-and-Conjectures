To compute the posterior probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for each field of study using Bayes' rule, we need to follow these steps:

1. Assign prior probabilities \(P(H)\) for each hypothesis.
2. Judge the likelihood \(P(E|H)\) of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in that field.
3. Judge the likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\) of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in that field.
4. Use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probabilities \(P(H|E)\).

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We do not need to explicitly calculate \(P(E)\) because we are interested in the relative probabilities, and \(P(E)\) serves as a normalizing constant.

### Calculation for Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**: Considering the variety of graduate fields in the U.S., let's assume \(P(H)\) is moderately low but not too low. Let's set it as \(P(H) = 0.05\).
2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, and his empathy strongly correlate with agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assign \(P(E|H) = 0.8\).
3. **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)**: In any field other than agricultural and veterinary science, the chances are lower for someone to have such a strong alignment with E. Let's assign \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.2\).

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.95} \approx \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.19} \approx \frac{0.04}{0.23} \approx 0.1739 \]

### Calculation for Business Administration
1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**: Considering the prevalence of business administration programs, let's start with \(P(H) = 0.1\).
2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: Adam's empathy and love for animals don't strongly correlate with business administration. Let's assign \(P(E|H) = 0.1\).
3. **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)**: The same assessment as above; let's assign \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.2\).

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.1 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9} \approx \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.18} \approx \frac{0.01}{0.19} \approx 0.0526 \]
