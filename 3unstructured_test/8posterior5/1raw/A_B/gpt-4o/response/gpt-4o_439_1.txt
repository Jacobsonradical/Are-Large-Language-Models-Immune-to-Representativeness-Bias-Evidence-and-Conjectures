To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field given his personality sketch \( E \), we'll use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field, \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in that field, and \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in that field. 

While we don't have exact probabilities, we can make reasonable assumptions based on the sketch and the field's characteristics. Let's analyze each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

1. **P(H):** This is the prior probability of Adam being in agricultural and veterinary science. Considering that this field attracts individuals with a love for nature, plants, and animals, we’ll assign this a moderately high rough probability.
   
   Estimate: \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \)

2. **P(E|H):** The probability of Adam's personality profile given that he is in this field:
   - Genuine curiosity about nature
   - Deep love for animals
   - Warm heart and empathy
   - High intelligence
   
   High correspondence with the field suggests a high probability.

   Estimate: \( P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \)

3. **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of Adam's personality profile given he's not in this field:
   - This field is specific and highly aligned with his personality, so there’s a lower probability of matching this exact profile if he's in another field.
   
   Estimate: \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \)

\[ P(H|E)_{agricultural} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.2}{0.9 \cdot 0.2 + 0.2 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.18}{0.18 + 0.16} = \frac{0.18}{0.34} \approx 0.529 \]


### Business Administration:

1. **P(H):** This is the prior probability of Adam being in business administration. This field may not attract individuals with a specific interest in nature or animals, so we assign it a lower probability.
   
   Estimate: \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \)

2. **P(E|H):** The probability of Adam's personality profile given that he is in business administration:
   - The traits mentioned do not particularly align with business administration, so we estimate a lower probability.
   
   Estimate: \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \)

3. **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of Adam's personality profile given he's not in this field:
   - Given the broad scope of other fields, the likelihood remains similar to the above case.
   
   Estimate: \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \)

\[ P(H|E)_{business} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.3 \cdot 0.1 + 0.4 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.36} = \frac{0.03}{0.39} \approx 0.077 \]

So according to our simplified Bayesian analysis, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.529,
  "business administration": 0.077
}
```
