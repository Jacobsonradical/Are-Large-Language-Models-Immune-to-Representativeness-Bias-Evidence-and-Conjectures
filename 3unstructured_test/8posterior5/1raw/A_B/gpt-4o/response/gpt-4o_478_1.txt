To calculate \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' Rule, we will use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(H|E)\) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in the field given the personality sketch.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \(P(E)\) is the probability of the personality sketch.

Since \(P(E)\) remains constant for all comparisons and is complex to compute without additional data, we can compare the relative likelihoods of each field by focusing on the numerator \(P(E|H) \cdot P(H)\).

### Business Administration
- \(P(H)\): The probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration.
  - This is relatively low given the personality sketch.
  - Suppose \(P(H) = 0.1\) (an arbitrary prior estimate).

- \(P(E|H)\): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in Business Administration.
  - Students in Business Administration typically have a focus more on economics, management, and leadership rather than an intense curiosity about nature and plants.
  - Say \(P(E|H) = 0.2\) (Adam’s characteristics don’t strongly align with typical business students).

- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in Business Administration.
  - This would be the sum of all probabilities across other fields.
  - Let’s say this is normalized to \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.8\).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \(P(H)\): The probability that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
  - Higher given the personality sketch which aligns with nature, plants, and animals.
  - Suppose \(P(H) = 0.4\) (an arbitrary prior estimate).

- \(P(E|H)\): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
  - Students in this field are likely to have a strong interest in nature and animals, fitting the description.
  - Say \(P(E|H) = 0.8\).

- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
  - This would include other fields, excluding Business Administration too.
  - Let’s say this is normalized to \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.2\).

### Calculations
To find \(P(H|E)\), we apply Bayes' Rule:

**Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.4}{P(E)} \]

Since \(P(E)\) is the same in both cases, we can compare:
- Relative to each other, the probability that Adam is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is significantly higher than the probability that Adam is in Business Administration.

### Final Estimate:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.32
}
```

Note: These numbers are relative probabilities rather than absolute probabilities. The raw estimates used are illustrative; normally, these would be refined with precise data.
