To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \), which tells us the probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch \( E \). Bayesâ€™ rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of observing the personality sketch, which can be computed as \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \).

Let's set reasonable estimates for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) based on common sense and the context provided.

### Estimates:

1. **Business administration**:
   - \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration could be set relatively low given his strong interests in nature, animals, and abstract concepts, which are less directly associated with business administration. Let's set it to 0.1.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): The likelihood that Adam has these personality features if he is in business administration. Given these features do not particularly align with typical characteristics of business admin students, let's set it to 0.2.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \): The likelihood that Adam has these personality features if he is not in business administration. Let's set this to a moderate probability considering it includes those enrolled in all other fields, some of which may align well with his personality traits. Let's set it to 0.4.

2. **Agricultural and veterinary science**:
   - \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science should be higher given his interests. Let's set it to 0.4.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \): The likelihood that Adam has these personality features if he is in agricultural and veterinary science is high given the alignment with his interests. Let's set it to 0.8.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \): The likelihood that Adam has these personality features if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science should be lower. Let's set it to 0.3.

### Calculation:

#### 1. Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.2) \cdot (0.1) + (0.4) \cdot (0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.36 = 0.38 \]

Thus,
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.38} = \frac{0.02}{0.38} \approx 0.0526 \]

#### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}})}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8) \cdot (0.4) + (0.3) \cdot (0.6) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.32 + 0.18 = 0.50 \]

Thus,
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.4}{0.50} = \frac{0.32}{0.50} = 0.64 \]

### Results:

{
  "business administration": 0.0526,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.64
