To tackle this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem to compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field \( H \) given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam. Bayes' theorem is stated as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we are only comparing two fields, we don't need the exact value of \( P(E) \); we need to evaluate the relative probabilities. However, for completeness, we should still consider the likelihood of observing the sketch given each hypothesis and the prior probabilities.

Let's start by estimating the necessary probabilities:

### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that any given graduate student is studying agricultural and veterinary science. Given the broad array of fields, let's estimate the prior probability:
  - **\( P(H_{\text{ag}}) \approx 0.05 \)** (5%).

- **\( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is studying agricultural and veterinary science:
  - Adam's curiosity about nature and love for animals strongly align with this field. High empathy can also correlate with veterinary care.
  - **\( P(E|H_{\text{ag}}) \approx 0.8 \)**.

- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is not studying agricultural and veterinary science. Since his traits are quite specific to nature and animals but can also apply to a few other fields, this probability might be lower:
  - **\( P(E|\neg H_{\text{ag}}) \approx 0.3 \)**.

### 2. Business Administration

- **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that any given graduate student is studying business administration:
  - **\( P(H_{\text{ba}}) \approx 0.1 \)** (10%).

- **\( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is studying business administration:
  - Adam's sketch does not strongly align with typical traits for business administration which tends to emphasize leadership, organizational skills, and less emphasis on nature and animals.
  - **\( P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) \approx 0.05 \)**.

- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is not studying business administration. Since his traits are strongly against whatâ€™s typical of business administration:
  - **\( P(E|\neg H_{\text{ba}}) \approx 0.5 \)**.

### Applying Bayes' Rule:

We are ultimately interested in the relative values, so normalization is not necessary as long as we maintain consistency in our approach.

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[ P(H_{\text{ag}}|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H_{\text{ag}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ag}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ \approx \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{P(E)} \]
\[ \approx 0.04 / P(E) \]

#### Business Administration:

\[ P(H_{\text{ba}}|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ba}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ \approx \frac{0.05 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \]
\[ \approx 0.005 / P(E) \]

Since we are comparing relative probabilities and \( P(E) \) is a common denominator:

\[ \frac{P(H_{\text{ag}}|E)}{P(H_{\text{ba}}|E)} = \frac{0.04 / P(E)}{0.005 / P(E)} = \frac{0.04}{0.005} = 8 \]

Thus, based on our estimates, the probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is significantly higher than being enrolled in business administration.

To give relative values between 0 and 1:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

These numbers indicate the strengths of the fields in explaining Adam's traits; they don't sum to 1 as there are other potential fields not considered.
