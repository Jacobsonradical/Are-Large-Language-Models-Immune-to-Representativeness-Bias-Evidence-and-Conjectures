To use Bayes' rule and compute P(H|E), we need to follow the steps and define the various probabilities as requested. Here's how we'll do it:

1. Define P(H) for each hypothesis as the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in that field.
2. Define P(E|H) as the probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in that field.
3. Define P(E|\neg H) as the probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in that field.

Then, use Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We don't need to calculate the exact value of P(E) since it will be the same for both fields and thus will cancel out when comparing the probabilities.

### Step-by-Step Judgments:

1. **Business Administration:**
   - P(H): Graduate enrollment probability in Business Administration programs is significant but not the most likely for someone with Adam's described personality.
   - Let's assume P(H) = 0.2 (20%).
   - P(E|H): Given his personality, it's less likely he's in a Business Administration program. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.1 (10%).
   - P(E|\neg H): Given he's not in Business Administration, the probability of his personality sketch being the same remains higher. Let's estimate P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 (40%).

\[ P(\text{business|E}) = \frac{P(E|\text{business}) \cdot P(\text{business})}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing factor common for both fields, we focus on:

\[ P(\text{business|E}) \propto P(E|\text{business}) \cdot P(\text{business}) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - P(H): More likely given Adam's interests and personality. Assume P(H) = 0.1 (10%).
   - P(E|H): Highly probable Adamâ€™s personality fits someone in this field. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.8 (80%).
   - P(E|\neg H): If Adam isn't in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, the traits he exhibits are less uniquely descriptive. Let P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 (30%).

\[ P(\text{agricultural|E}) = \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural})}{P(E)} \]

Again, for the purpose of comparison:
\[ P(\text{agricultural|E}) \propto P(E|\text{agricultural}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural}) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]

### Comparison:
Since we only need the prior ratios and don't actually need to normalize:

\[ \text{Normalized } P(\text{business|E}) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.08} = \frac{0.02}{0.10} = 0.2 \]

\[ \text{Normalized } P(\text{agricultural|E}) = \frac{0.08}{0.02 + 0.08} = \frac{0.08}{0.10} = 0.8 \]

### Final Results:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```
