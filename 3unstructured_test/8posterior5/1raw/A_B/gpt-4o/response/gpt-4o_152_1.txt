To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \), we need to use Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule can be expressed as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

Because \( P(E) \) will be the same for all hypotheses when comparing relative probabilities, we can focus on \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). \( P(E|\neg H) \) helps us understand how likely the evidence is if the hypothesis is false.

Now, let's qualitatively judge these terms for each field:

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): Moderate. Business Administration is a common field for graduate students.
- \( P(E|H) \): Low. The personality sketch of Adam doesn't align well with traits typically associated with Business Administration such as leadership, market analysis, and corporate management.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Higher, as the traits described (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals) are not typical for Business Administration graduates.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): Lower to moderate, as fewer students are in this field compared to Business Administration.
- \( P(E|H) \): High. The personality sketch aligns very well with traits needed in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, such as love for animals and curiosity about nature.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Lower, as the specific traits are less common in fields not related to Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

These qualitative assessments lead us to these numerical interpretations:

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): 0.3 (Moderate prior probability)
- \( P(E|H) \): 0.1 (Low likelihood)
- \( P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \times 0.3}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.03}{P(E)} \)

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): 0.2 (Lower to moderate prior probability)
- \( P(E|H) \): 0.6 (High likelihood)
- \( P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.6 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.12}{P(E)} \)

Now normalizing these values relative to each other:

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} \approx \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.12} = \frac{0.03}{0.15} = 0.2 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.03 + 0.12} = \frac{0.12}{0.15} = 0.8 \]

So, the final results in the required format:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
