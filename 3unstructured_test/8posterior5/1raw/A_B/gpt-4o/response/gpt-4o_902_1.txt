Sure, let's proceed with the calculations given the personality sketch of Adam (E).

### Field: Business Administration
- **P(H)**: The general probability that a random graduate student is in Business Administration is fairly moderate, as it's a common graduate field. Let's estimate \( P(H) \) at 0.2.
- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood that someone with Adam's personality sketch is in Business Administration seems lower because his interests and skills are more aligned with nature and empathy, rather than business. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) at 0.05.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood that someone with Adam's characteristics is not in Business Administration is higher, as there are many other fields fitting his profile better. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) at 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.2}{0.05 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.24} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.01}{0.25} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.04 \]

### Field: Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: The general probability that a random graduate student is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is lower compared to Business Administration, but still notable. Let's estimate \( P(H) \) at 0.05.
- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood that someone with Adam's personality sketch is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is quite high, as it aligns well with his interests and empathy towards animals. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) at 0.8.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood that someone with Adam's characteristics is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science but has a similar profile might still be significant due to overlapping fields (e.g., Biology, Environmental Science). Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) at 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.3 \cdot 0.95} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.285} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.04}{0.325} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.123 \]
