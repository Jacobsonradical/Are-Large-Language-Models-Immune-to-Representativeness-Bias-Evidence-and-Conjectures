To calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in business administration or agricultural and veterinary science, we'll use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant and would be the same for both fields, it will cancel out in the relative comparison. First, I will give a probable assessment of \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field, followed by calculating \( P(H|E) \) proportionally.

### 1. Business Administration
- \(P(H)\): Business administration is a popular field but given Adam's personality sketch, it seems less likely than agricultural and veterinary science. Assume \(P(H)\) is relatively low.
- \(P(E|H)\): The personality traits mentioned are not typical for business administration students. Assume \(P(E|H)\) is low.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): Higher probability since many other fields would fit Adam's personality better.

Using qualitative values:
- \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H) \approx 0.05 \) 
- Let's denote \( k \) as the normalizing constant representing \( P(E) \).

\[ P(H|\neg E) = 0.95 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} \proportional 0.1 \times 0.05 = 0.005 \]

### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \(P(H)\): This seems a plausible field for Adam given his love for nature, animals, and empathy. Assume \(P(H)\) is relatively high.
- \(P(E|H)\): The personality sketch strongly aligns with this field. Assume \(P(E|H)\) is high.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): Lower probability since Adam's personality fits well within this field.

Using qualitative values:
- \( P(H) \approx 0.4 \)
- \( P(E|H) \approx 0.7 \)
- Let's denote \( k \) as the normalizing constant representing \( P(E) \).

\[ P(H|\neg E) = 0.3 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} \proportional 0.4 \times 0.7 = 0.28 \]

### Normalizing Constant
To compute directly just the proportionals are sufficient. 

### Final Proportional Probabilities
- Business Administration: \(0.005\)
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \(0.28\)

Now, normalizing these to make the total probability sum to 1 for our comparative purpose:

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} = \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.28} = \frac{0.005}{0.285} \approx 0.0175 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} = \frac{0.28}{0.005 + 0.28} = 0.9825 \]

These are the calculated posterior probabilities that Adam is enrolled in each field given his personality sketch.
