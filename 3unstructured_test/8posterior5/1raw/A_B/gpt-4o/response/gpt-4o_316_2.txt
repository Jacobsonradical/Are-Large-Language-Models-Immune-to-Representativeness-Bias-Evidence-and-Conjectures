To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to first assign values to \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Here's how we might proceed:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, this field seems a strong fit for his interests and personality.

   \[
   P(H_{\text{aggicultural}}) = 0.2
   \]
   
   This is an assumption that out of a larger set of graduate fields, there's a significant but not overwhelming chance he was in this field.

   \[
   P(E|H_{\text{aggicultural}}) = 0.8
   \]
   
   The personality sketch strongly aligns with this field, hence a high probability.

   \[
   P(E|\neg H_{\text{aggicultural}}) = 0.3
   \]
   
   There's a moderate chance that these traits could be found in someone not in this field, particularly in fields with similar requirements or traits.

2. **Business Administration**: This field typically doesn't align closely with the provided personality sketch. 

   \[
   P(H_{\text{business}}) = 0.1
   \]
   
   This is an assumption, with fewer graduates likely to share Adamâ€™s specific characteristics.

   \[
   P(E|H_{\text{business}}) = 0.2
   \]
   
   The characteristics listed don't strongly align with typical traits needed in business administration.

   \[
   P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}}) = 0.6
   \]
   
   There's still a reasonable chance this personality sketch could appear in other fields, outside business.

To apply Bayes' rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Calculations:

1. For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
   \[
   P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) = 0.16 + 0.24 = 0.40
   \]
   
   \[
   P(H_{\text{aggicultural}}|E) = \frac{(0.8 \cdot 0.2)}{0.40} = \frac{0.16}{0.40} = 0.4
   \]

2. For Business Administration:
   \[
   P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.6 \cdot 0.9) = 0.02 + 0.54 = 0.56
   \]
   
   \[
   P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{(0.2 \cdot 0.1)}{0.56} = \frac{0.02}{0.56} \approx 0.036
   \]

So, here are the values:

\[
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.036
}
\]
