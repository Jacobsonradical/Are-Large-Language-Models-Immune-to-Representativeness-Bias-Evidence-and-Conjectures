To determine \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis \( H \), we'll use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the description of Adam, we'll assign probabilities for each step:

1. \( P(H) \): Prior probability of being enrolled in the given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in the given field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is not enrolled in the given field.

We will provide estimates for these probabilities as follows:

### Business Administration

1. **\( P(H) \)** (Prior Probability):
   - Let's assume that in general, the prior probability of a graduate student being enrolled in Business Administration is around 0.1.

2. **\( P(E|H) \)** (Likelihood of Personality Given Field):
   - Adam's traits (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, etc.) are less typical for Business Administration. We might assign a likelihood of 0.01.

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)** (Likelihood of Personality Given Not in Field):
   - Given that Adam could fall into many other fields with his traits, this would be relatively higher, around 0.05.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **\( P(H) \)** (Prior Probability):
   - Let's assume the prior probability for Agricultural and Veterinary Science students is around 0.05.

2. **\( P(E|H) \)** (Likelihood of Personality Given Field):
   - Adam's personality sketch (empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature) fits well with this field, leading us to assign a likelihood of around 0.7.

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)** (Likelihood of Personality Given Not in Field):
   - As above, we'll assume 0.05 since these traits might still apply to other fields but are more strongly indicative in the given field.

### Computing \( P(H|E) \) for Each Field

Using the given values in Bayes' Rule:

#### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01 \cdot 0.1}{0.01 \cdot 0.1 + 0.05 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.001}{0.001 + 0.045} = \frac{0.001}{0.046} \approx 0.0217 \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{0.7 \cdot 0.05 + 0.05 \cdot 0.95} = \frac{0.035}{0.035 + 0.0475} = \frac{0.035}{0.0825} \approx 0.424 \]

Therefore, the results are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0217,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.424
}
```
