To calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we are using Bayes' rule, given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of being in the field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given the field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in the field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H):** The prior probability. Let's assume the prior probability of being enrolled in this field is moderate but not exceedingly high given it's a specialized field: \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

2. **P(E|H):** Given his love for nature, plants, and animals, and his empathy, this fits strongly with agricultural and veterinary science. So, let's assign a high likelihood: \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H):** If Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science, he could be in any of a variety of other fields. These other fields might not align as strongly with his love for nature, plants, and animals, but since academic traits like solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts are common, let's assume a moderate likelihood: \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

Using Bayes’ rule for graduate students:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

We need to compute \( P(E) \), the total probability of the evidence:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.18 = 0.26 \]

So,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.26} \approx 0.3077 \]

### Business Administration

1. **P(H):** The prior probability of being enrolled in this field is generally higher due to its popularity: \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

2. **P(E|H):** His personality traits do not align strongly with typical business administration traits, which often focus more on leadership and management than on curiosity about nature and empathy for animals. Let’s assign a lower likelihood: \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H):** If Adam is not in business administration, he could be in fields better aligning with his traits. Therefore, assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \), as these traits fit moderately well with other academic fields but not specifically business.

Using Bayes’ rule for business administration:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

We compute \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.2) + (0.4 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.32 = 0.36 \]

So,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.36} \approx 0.111 \]
