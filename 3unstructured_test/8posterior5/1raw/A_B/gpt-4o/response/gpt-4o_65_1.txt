To utilize Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need the following probabilities:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in the given field.

Let's analyze the fields:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): This should be relatively low because it represents a small portion of graduate enrollments.
   - \( P(E|H) \): This should be high because Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, and appreciation for hard work fits well.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): This relatively lower but not negligible, as interests and empathy can exist in other fields too.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): This would be higher since it represents a significantly larger portion of graduate enrollments.
   - \( P(E|H) \): This should be quite low because Adam's traits align poorly with typical business administration interests.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): This should be higher than \( P(E|H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science since traits like solving puzzles and strong empathy can occur in other more common fields outside business administration or agri-vet.

Based on this qualitative analysis:

### Assigning Values:
- For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: 
  - \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \)
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.7 \)
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.1 \)

- For **Business Administration**: 
  - \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \)
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.05 \)
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \)

### Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
For simplicity's sake, since total probability distribution isn't required for other fields, I'll show calculations independently.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(E) = 0.7 \cdot 0.1 + 0.1 \cdot 0.9 = 0.07 + 0.09 = 0.16 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.16} = \frac{0.07}{0.16} \approx 0.4375 \]

2. **Business Administration**:
\[ P(E) = 0.05 \cdot 0.3 + 0.4 \cdot 0.7 = 0.015 + 0.28 = 0.295 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.3}{0.295} = \frac{0.015}{0.295} \approx 0.0508 \]

Thus, the results are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4375,
  "business administration": 0.0508
