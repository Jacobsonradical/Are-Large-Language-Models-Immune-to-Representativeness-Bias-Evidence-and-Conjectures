To apply Bayes' Rule and find the posterior probabilities \(P(H|E)\), we'll follow these steps:
1. Establish prior probabilities \(P(H)\) for each field.
2. Estimate the likelihood \(P(E|H)\) of Adam fitting the given personality sketch for each field.
3. Estimate the likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\) of Adam fitting the given personality sketch for other fields.
4. Compute the posterior probabilities \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' Rule: \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \).

For this purpose, we'll make qualitative estimates for each probability:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**:
   - Assuming limited data, let's say the prior probability of any given graduate student pursuing this is moderate, e.g., \(P(H) = 0.15\). (This is because agricultural and veterinary sciences are specialized but common enough.)

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**:
   - Given Adam's traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, intelligence, appreciation for hard work), the likelihood he fits this field is high, e.g., \(P(E|H) = 0.8\).

3. **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)**:
   - Assuming that Adam’s traits are relatively common but not specifically tailored to agricultural/veterinary science, e.g., \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.1\).

### Business Administration
1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**:
   - Again, let's assume the prior probability of any given graduate student pursuing this common field is moderate, e.g., \(P(H) = 0.20\).

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**:
   - Given Adam's traits are more tuned to empathy, nature, and animals rather than typical business administration, the likelihood might be low, e.g., \(P(E|H) = 0.1\).

3. **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)**:
   - Since Adam's traits are not commonly aligned with business administration but could appear in many other fields, e.g., \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.2\).

### Calculate Posteriors Using Bayes' Rule

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Assuming \(P(E)\) is the same for comparison purposes:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{P(E)} \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]

Since we’re interested in the relative probabilities and \(P(E)\) is just a normalization constant for comparison:

### Normalized Estimates
The ratios:
\[ \text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science} = 0.8 \times 0.15 = 0.12 \]
\[ \text{Business Administration} = 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02 \]

To present our final numbers with some normalization for comparative purposes:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.857,
  "business administration": 0.143
}
```

To summarize, based on the given personality sketch, Adam is significantly more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration.
