Let's start by evaluating each hypothesis and using Bayes' Rule to calculate the posterior probabilities, \( P(H|E) \).

### For Business Administration:

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \):**
   - Business administration is a common field, so we might assume a moderate prior probability. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.3 \).

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \):**
   - The personality sketch of Adam indicates a love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles. These traits are not strongly related to business administration. So, \( P(E|H) \) might be low. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

3. **Complementary Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   - Given the traits are quite specific, other fields like agricultural and veterinary science might fit better. Hence, \( P(E|\neg H) \) could be relatively higher, signifying that many non-business administration students might share these traits. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.8 \).

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \):**
   - This is a more specialized field, so the prior probability might be lower. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \):**
   - Given Adam’s traits align very well with this field, the likelihood should be high. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).

3. **Complementary Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   - For fields other than agricultural and veterinary science, Adam’s traits might not be as strongly represented. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

### Calculating Posterior Probabilities using Bayes' Rule:

Bayes' Rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

### For Business Administration:

1. Calculate \( P(E) \):
   \[
   P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.3) + (0.8 \cdot 0.7) = 0.03 + 0.56 = 0.59
   \]

2. Now, calculate \( P(H|E) \):
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.3}{0.59} \approx 0.051
   \]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

1. Calculate \( P(E) \):
   \[
   P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.1) + (0.5 \cdot 0.9) = 0.09 + 0.45 = 0.54
   \]

2. Now, calculate \( P(H|E) \):
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{0.54} \approx 0.167
   \]

Hence, the computed posterior probabilities, \( P(H|E) \), are as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.051,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.167
}
```

These values show that given Adam's personality sketch, it is more likely that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than business administration.
