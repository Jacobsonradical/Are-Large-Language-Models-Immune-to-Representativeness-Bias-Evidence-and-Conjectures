To compute the probabilities, we will use Bayes' Rule, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of H given E.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of E (the evidence) given H.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of H.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of E.

We will need to estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field and then compute \( P(H|E) \).

### Step 1: Estimate Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)
Since specific background information about the prevalence of each field among all graduate students in the U.S. in 2021 is not provided, we can make an educated guess:

- Business Administration is a relatively common field.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science is less common compared to Business Administration.

With this reasoning, let's assign the following priors:
- \( P(\text{business administration}) \approx 0.10 \)
- \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.02 \)

### Step 2: Estimate Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \)
Based on the personality sketch E:

#### Business Administration
- \( P(E|\text{business administration}) \): A quieter student (less suitable) with high intelligence (moderately suitable) but a strong empathy and love for animals (less directly relevant) may be less common in Business Administration.
  - Estimated: 0.02

- \( P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) \): Many fields will fit Adam's personality better than Business Administration.
  - Estimated: 0.18

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \): Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals strongly aligns with this field, making it more likely.
  - Estimated: 0.65

- \( P(E|\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \): There are many fields that don't align as well with Adam's qualities.
  - Estimated: 0.10

### Step 3: Compute \( P(E) \)
As exact values aren't available, it is ideal to acknowledge that there are many graduate fields, yet we focus on these two probabilities appropriately.

### Step 4: Apply Bayes Rule
Now apply the Bayes' Rule for each field:

\[
P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)}
\]
Using the relative probabilities: 
\[
P(\text{business administration}|E) \approx \frac{0.02 \cdot 0.10}{P(E)}
\]
\[
P(E) \approx \text{Total probability for normalization}
\]

\[
P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)}
\]
\[
P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \approx \frac{0.65 \cdot 0.02}{P(E)}
\]

By comparing relative values:
\[
P(E) = \text{constant non-specified}
\]

### Final Estimation
Although normalization is quite exacting here, comparing relative strengths, Agricultural and Veterinary Science is much more plausible.

Output for normalized probability perspective (scaled):
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.001,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.015
}
```

These values signify scaled relative probabilities based on alignment to traits and typical distributions respectively.
