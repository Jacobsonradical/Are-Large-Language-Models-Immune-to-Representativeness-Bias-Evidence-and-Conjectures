To solve this problem using Bayes' theorem, let's consider the relevant probabilities for each field of specialization.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
    - **P(H_agri):** The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This could be low since it's a specialized field but more aligned with his interests in nature and animals.
    - **P(E|H_agri):** The probability that Adam exhibits these characteristics given he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This is likely high because his personality sketch strongly aligns with this field.
    - **P(E|¬H_agri):** The probability that Adam exhibits these characteristics given he is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This is more varied but generally might be lower because not all fields would align with his interests and traits.

2. **Business Administration**
    - **P(H_bus):** The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration. This could be moderate to low because it’s a less fitting match with his personality sketch.
    - **P(E|H_bus):** The probability that Adam exhibits these characteristics given he is enrolled in business administration. This is likely low because his traits seem less aligned with typical business administration programs.
    - **P(E|¬H_bus):** The probability that Adam exhibits these characteristics given he is not enrolled in business administration. This might be higher than the case of agricultural and veterinary science because it's a wide field with diverse student profiles.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we lack the exact numerical values, we can make qualitative judgments to arrive at relative probabilities.

Assume:
- \( P(H_agri) = 0.10 \)
- \( P(E|H_agri) = 0.90 \)
- \( P(E|¬H_agri) = 0.30 \)

For Business Administration, assume:
- \( P(H_bus) = 0.10 \)
- \( P(E|H_bus) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(E|¬H_bus) = 0.50 \)

Now, compute the posterior probabilities:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
    \[
    P(H_agri|E) = \frac{P(E|H_agri) \times P(H_agri)}{P(E|H_agri) \times P(H_agri) + P(E|¬H_agri) \times P(¬H_agri)}
    \]
    \[
    P(H_agri|E) = \frac{0.90 \times 0.10}{(0.90 \times 0.10) + (0.30 \times 0.90)} \approx \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.27} \approx 0.25
    \]

2. **Business Administration**
    \[
    P(H_bus|E) = \frac{P(E|H_bus) \times P(H_bus)}{P(E|H_bus) \times P(H_bus) + P(E|¬H_bus) \times P(¬H_bus)}
    \]
    \[
    P(H_bus|E) = \frac{0.20 \times 0.10}{(0.20 \times 0.10) + (0.50 \times 0.90)} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.45} \approx 0.04
    \]

Therefore, the relative probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.25,
  "business administration": 0.04
}
```
