To calculate \( P(H|E) \), we use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given this, let’s assign plausible values to the following terms for both fields:

### Field A: Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. \( P(H_{a}) \): The probability that Adam, a random graduate student, was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - This field is less common, so let’s estimate a lower prior probability.
   - Suppose there is roughly a 5% chance (\( P(H_{a}) = 0.05 \)).

2. \( P(E|H_{a}) \): The probability of Adam having the described personality sketch if he was in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals, the fit seems high.
   - Let’s assign this a high probability, say 0.75 (\( P(E|H_{a}) = 0.75 \)).

3. \( P(E|\neg H_{a}) \): The probability of Adam having the described personality sketch if he was not in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Many other fields may also attract individuals with these traits, though perhaps not as strongly.
   - Let’s assign this a moderate probability, say 0.3 (\( P(E|\neg H_{a}) = 0.3 \)).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H_{a}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{a}) \cdot P(H_{a})}{P(E)} \]

Now, \( P(E) \) can be expanded using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{a})P(H_{a}) + P(E|\neg H_{a})P(\neg H_{a}) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.75 \cdot 0.05) + (0.3 \cdot 0.95) = 0.0375 + 0.285 = 0.3225 \]

Thus,

\[ P(H_{a}|E) = \frac{0.75 \cdot 0.05}{0.3225} = \frac{0.0375}{0.3225} \approx 0.116 \]

### Field B: Business Administration
1. \( P(H_{b}) \): The probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
   - This field is more common among graduate students.
   - Suppose there is roughly a 20% chance (\( P(H_{b}) = 0.20 \)).

2. \( P(E|H_{b}) \): The probability of Adam having the described personality sketch if he was in business administration.
   - The fit seems less strong considering Adam's traits, but it's still possible.
   - Let’s assign this a lower probability, say 0.2 (\( P(E|H_{b}) = 0.2 \)).

3. \( P(E|\neg H_{b}) \): The probability of Adam having the described personality sketch if he was not in business administration.
   - Many other fields may also attract individuals with these traits.
   - Let’s assign this a higher probability, say 0.35 (\( P(E|\neg H_{b}) = 0.35 \)).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H_{b}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{b}) \cdot P(H_{b})}{P(E)} \]

Now, \( P(E) \) can again be expanded using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{b})P(H_{b}) + P(E|\neg H_{b})P(\neg H_{b}) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.20) + (0.35 \cdot 0.80) = 0.04 + 0.28 = 0.32 \]

Thus,

\[ P(H_{b}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.20}{0.32} = \frac{0.04}{0.32} = 0.125 \]

So, the values are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.116,
  "business administration": 0.125
}
