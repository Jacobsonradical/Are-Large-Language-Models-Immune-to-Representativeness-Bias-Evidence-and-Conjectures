To apply Bayes' theorem, we need to calculate posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis (H) based on the given personality sketch (E) of Adam. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We will consider the following fields: business administration and agricultural and veterinary science. Let's start by assigning some values to the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

1. **Business Administration**

- **P(H)**: Prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in business administration. It's a common field, but given Adam's characteristics, this might be less likely.
  \[ P(H) = 0.15 \]

- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in business administration. His attributes do not strongly align with typical business administration traits.
  \[ P(E|H) = 0.05 \]

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not in business administration. Generally not directly useful in individual estimates but can be assumed high given many fields could fit his personality traits.
  \[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \]

- Now, we compute \( P(H|E) \):
  \[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

- **P(H)**: Prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This seems more likely given his characteristics.
  \[ P(H) = 0.10 \]

- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in agricultural and veterinary science. Strongly aligns with his love for nature and animals.
  \[ P(E|H) = 0.45 \]

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Similar as above.
  \[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \]

- Now, we compute \( P(H|E) \):
  \[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.45 \cdot 0.10}{P(E)} \]

Given that the computation involves \( P(E) \) and simplifying constants, we'll focus on the relative values:

- For business administration: 
  \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.0075}{P(E)} \]

- For agricultural and veterinary science: 
  \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.045}{P(E)} \]

Thus, proportionally:

{
  "business administration": "0.0075",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.045"
}

These proportions suggest Adam is significantly more likely to be studying agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration based on his personality traits.
