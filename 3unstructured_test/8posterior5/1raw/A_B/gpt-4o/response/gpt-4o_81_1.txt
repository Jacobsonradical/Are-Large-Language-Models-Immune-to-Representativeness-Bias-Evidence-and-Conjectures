To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' theorem, we need to estimate the following probabilities for each field:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in that field.

Then, Bayes' theorem is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. As a rough estimate, let's assign it a moderate value, say 0.1 (since it is one of many possible fields).
- **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, along with his empathy and intelligence, it seems highly probable that he could be studying in this field. Let’s assign it a high value, say 0.8.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of seeing Adam's personality traits in a student not studying agricultural and veterinary science could be reasonably common among other fields, but perhaps less so than in this specific field. Let's estimate it at 0.3.

### Business Administration

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration. Given the broad distribution of students among many fields, prioritize it as 0.1.
- **P(E|H)**: Business administration might not closely align with Adam's interests in nature, animals, and puzzles, so let’s assign a lower probability, say 0.2.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing his traits outside of business administration remains reasonably high, perhaps similar to above. Let's estimate it at 0.4.

Now, compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule. Assuming \( P(E) \) can be derived from the provided probabilities:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[
   P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)}
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{P(E)}
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{0.08}{P(E)}
   \]

2. **Business Administration**:
   \[
   P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)}
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{P(E)}
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{0.02}{P(E)}
   \]

Since \[ P(E) \] is the same for both fields, the final comparative posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08,
  "business administration": 0.02
}
```

We observe a higher probability for Adam being enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science than Business Administration based on his personality sketch.
