Given Adam’s personality sketch and applying Bayes' Theorem, we need to consider the probability of Adam being enrolled in each field based on the evidence provided (his characteristics).

### Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.

### Evaluating the Probabilities:

**For Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H₁):**
- **P(H₁)**: We assume a relatively moderate prior probability that Adam could be in an agricultural and veterinary science program, say 0.2 (since this prior belief reflects that there are many fields he could be studying).
- **P(E|H₁)**: Given Adam’s keen interest in nature, plants, and animals, his empathy and intelligence, the probability that the observed personality sketch fits someone in this field is quite high, say 0.9.
- **P(E|¬H₁)**: The probability of observing Adam’s personality traits assuming he is not in agricultural and veterinary science might be moderate since other fields also value empathy and abstract thinking, say 0.5.

So,
\[ P(H₁|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

**For Business Administration (H₂):**
- **P(H₂)**: We assume a lower prior probability that Adam is in business administration, say 0.1, primarily because his personality traits (e.g., love for animals, nature) are less commonly associated with business fields.
- **P(E|H₂)**: The probability that Adam’s personality traits fit someone in business administration is quite low, say 0.2.
- **P(E|¬H₂)**: The probability of observing Adam’s personality traits assuming he is not in business administration is relatively higher, say 0.6.

So,
\[ P(H₂|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

### Simplifying Bayesian Computation:

For simplicity, we summarize:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H₁) \cdot P(H₁) + P(E|¬H₁) \cdot P(¬H₁) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.2) + (0.5 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) ≈ 0.18 + 0.4 \]
\[ P(E) ≈ 0.58 \]

For H₁ (Agricultural and Veterinary Science):
\[ P(H₁|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.2}{0.58} ≈ \frac{0.18}{0.58} ≈ 0.31 \]

For H₂ (Business Administration):
\[ P(H₂|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.58} ≈ \frac{0.02}{0.58} ≈ 0.034 \]

Hence, the respective probabilities are as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.31,
  "business administration": 0.034
}
```

These calculations reflect that given Adam's personality sketch, it's more probable that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than business administration.
