To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we'll need the following information:

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given he is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given he is not enrolled in the field.

Bayes' rule formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- **\( P(H) \)**: Let's assume a moderate prior probability that Adam might be enrolled in this field, as it aligns with his interests in nature and animals. Let's assign \( P(H) = 0.3 \).
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's personality sketch, it is quite likely if he is in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assign \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability that Adam’s personality sketch is observed when he is not in agricultural and veterinary science may be less likely. Let's assign \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.3) + (0.1 \cdot 0.7) = 0.24 + 0.07 = 0.31 \]

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.3}{0.31} \approx 0.774 \]

### For Business Administration:
- **\( P(H) \)**: Let's assume a lower prior probability that Adam might be enrolled in this field since business administration does not directly align with his interests and personality traits. Let's assign \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's personality sketch, it is less likely if he is in business administration. Let's assign \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability that Adam’s personality sketch is observed when he is not in business administration might be similar to the overall likelihood of observing his traits in other fields. Let's assign \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.1 \cdot 0.9) = 0.02 + 0.09 = 0.11 \]

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.11} \approx 0.182 \]

Thus, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.774,
  "business administration": 0.182
}
