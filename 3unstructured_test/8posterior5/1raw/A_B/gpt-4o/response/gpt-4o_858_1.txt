To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in "agricultural and veterinary science" or "business administration," given his personality sketch \(E\), we use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For each case, we'll assign hypothetical prior probabilities \(P(H)\), likelihoods \(P(E|H)\), and base rates for the personality given not the hypothesis \(P(E|\neg H)\). We won't explicitly calculate \(P(E)\) (total evidence) as you have suggested it's not necessary.

Let's define these values first based on the description:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H)** - Prior probability: This is generally slightly higher for someone who has a strong curiosity about nature, understanding of dedication, and love for animals.
\[ P(H) \approx 0.25 \]
   
2. **P(E|H)** - Likelihood of the personality sketch given the hypothesis: Given that someone in this field would likely fit Adam's description quite well.
\[ P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \]

3. **P(E|\neg H)** - Likelihood of the personality sketch given any other field: This could be more moderate since the described personality could fit into fields involving abstract concepts but is less common in others.
\[ P(E| \neg H) \approx 0.3 \]

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)** - Prior probability: Generally lower compared to agricultural and veterinary sciences for someone with Adam's described personality, given the mismatch in consistent empathy, nature interest, and animal love.
\[ P(H) \approx 0.05 \]

2. **P(E|H)** - Likelihood of the personality sketch given the hypothesis: Less likely since business administration does not strongly align with described traits.
\[ P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \]

3. **P(E|\neg H)** - Likelihood of the personality sketch given any other field: As above.
\[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \]

### Applying Bayes' Theorem
We compute \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis:

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is constant for both hypotheses when we compare them, we can ignore it for relative comparison.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.225 \]

#### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.005 \]

Combining these relative posterior probabilities, we normalize them:

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} \approx \frac{0.225}{0.225 + 0.005} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} \approx \frac{0.225}{0.23} \approx 0.978 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} \approx \frac{0.005}{0.23} \approx 0.022 \]

So, after normalizing:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.978,
  "business administration": 0.022
}
```
