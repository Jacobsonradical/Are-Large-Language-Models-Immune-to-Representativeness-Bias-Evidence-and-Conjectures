To compute the probabilities using Bayes' rule, we need to carefully consider the given personality sketch E and how it aligns with the fields in question. Here are the steps involved:

1. Define \( P(H) \) for each field as the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
2. Define \( P(E | H) \) as the probability of observing the personality sketch given that he is enrolled in that field.
3. Define \( P(E | \neg H) \) as the probability of observing the personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in that field.
4. Use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H | E) \).

I will assume reasonable values for these probabilities based on the information provided and common knowledge about the typical interests and skills required in these fields.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior probability \( P(H) \)**: 
   - The field is less common compared to business administration, so we could propose a prior probability, say \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

2. **Probability \( P(E | H) \)**:
   - Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy, it is highly likely that he fits well in this field. Let's set \( P(E | H) = 0.9 \).

3. **Probability \( P(E | \neg H) \)**:
   - For other fields, the given personality traits might not be as strongly aligned. Let’s say \( P(E | \neg H) = 0.2 \).

### Business Administration

1. **Prior probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Business administration is a very common graduate field, so we could propose \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

2. **Probability \( P(E | H) \)**:
   - Given Adam's traits, it seems less likely that he aligns strongly with business administration, where traits like competitiveness, strategic thinking, and leadership are more emphasized. Let’s set \( P(E | H) = 0.1 \).

3. **Probability \( P(E | \neg H) \)**:
   - Same baseline as for agricultural science, \( P(E | \neg H) = 0.3 \).

Using Bayes' rule \( P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) P(H)}{P(E)} \), where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing E across all fields (\( P(E) = P(E | H) P(H) + P(E | \neg H) P(\neg H) \)).

Let's calculate these:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. \( P(H) = 0.1 \)
2. \( P(E | H) = 0.9 \)
3. \( P(E | \neg H) = 0.2 \)
4. \( P(\neg H) = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9 \)

\[ P(E) = P(E | H) P(H) + P(E | \neg H) P(\neg H) = (0.9)(0.1) + (0.2)(0.9) = 0.09 + 0.18 = 0.27 \]

\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{(0.9)(0.1)}{0.27} = \frac{0.09}{0.27} = 0.333 \]

### Business Administration
1. \( P(H) = 0.2 \)
2. \( P(E | H) = 0.1 \)
3. \( P(E | \neg H) = 0.3 \)
4. \( P(\neg H) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 \)

\[ P(E) = P(E | H) P(H) + P(E | \neg H) P(\neg H) = (0.1)(0.2) + (0.3)(0.8) = 0.02 + 0.24 = 0.26 \]

\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{(0.1)(0.2)}{0.26} = \frac{0.02}{0.26} \approx 0.077 \]
