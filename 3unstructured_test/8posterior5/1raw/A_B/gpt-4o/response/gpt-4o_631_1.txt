To compute the probabilities using Bayes' theorem, we need to evaluate the following:

1. P(H): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field (business administration or agricultural and veterinary science).
2. P(E|H): The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch fits given he is enrolled in the specified field.
3. P(E|\neg H): The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch fits given he is not enrolled in the specified field.

Let's analyze these for each field.

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: Let's assume the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration, considering graduate students in the U.S., is moderate. Let's say it's 0.2.

2. **P(E|H)**: The description does not strongly align with what we typically associate with business administration (such as a focus on entrepreneurship, finance, etc.). However, it's not impossible. Let's assign a value of 0.1.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood that Adam fits this personality sketch given he is not in business administration is relatively higher because the description fits many other fields better. Let's estimate it at 0.7.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.7 \cdot (1 - 0.2)} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.56} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.58} \approx 0.034 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of being in agricultural and veterinary science is probably lower than business administration considering the general population of graduate students. Let's estimate it at 0.1.

2. **P(E|H)**: The description fits very well with agricultural and veterinary science, given Adam's love for nature, plants, animals, and appreciation for hard work. Let's assign a value of 0.9.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood that Adam fits this personality sketch given he is not in agricultural and veterinary science is lower, as this field strongly matches his description. Let's estimate it at 0.4.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{0.9 \cdot 0.1 + 0.4 \cdot (1 - 0.1)} \approx \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.36} \approx \frac{0.09}{0.45} \approx 0.2 \]

Putting these together:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.034,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.2
}
