To apply Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \), we need to first estimate the following probabilities for each field:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in each field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in that field.

We will use these probabilities to compute \( P(H|E) \) via Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is constant across both fields and does not impact the relative comparison, we can focus on the numerator for the relative likelihoods.

Let's start with the prior probabilities \( P(H) \). Since we do not have specific data, we will assume a moderate prior, such as \( P(H) = 0.1 \) for business administration and 0.1 for agricultural and veterinary science. These values could adjust with more information.

Next, we need to estimate:

1. The likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for each field, given Adam's personality sketch.
2. The likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field, i.e., given he was not in that specific field but could be in one of many others.

We can make educated guesses based on Adam's interests and traits.

### Business Administration

- **\( P(E|H) \)**: Business administration might not align strongly with Adam's deep love for nature, plants, and animals or his empathy and warmth. Assume a lower probability, say **0.1**.
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Given the personality sketch may fit many non-business fields better, assume a higher probability, say **0.9**.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **\( P(E|H) \)**: This field aligns very well with his strong appreciation for nature, empathy, love for animals, and understanding abstract concepts. Assume a higher probability, say **0.8**.
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: If Adam were not in this field, he would fit less well elsewhere, especially given his specific interests. Assume a lower probability, say **0.2**.

Now, using Bayes' rule steps:

For business administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \times 0.1 = 0.01 \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \]

Finally, normalize the probabilities:
Normalize the results by ensuring they fit into a common comparative framework.

Let's represent it accordingly:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.01",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.08"
}
```

These values show that, based on Adam's personality sketch, he is far more likely to have been enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science as a graduate student compared to business administration.
