To compute \( P(H|E) \) for the fields of business administration and agricultural and veterinary science, I will use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given the hypothesis \(\neg H\) (not \( H \)).
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch \( E \).

Let's make some educated guesses for each parameter.

#### Business Administration
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
    Suppose the overall prior probability of a random graduate student being in business administration is 0.1.

2. **Probability \( P(E|H) \)**:
    Given the personality sketch, it is less likely for Adam to be enrolled in business administration because his interests and traits (nature, animals, puzzles, etc.) do not typically align with this field. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) to be 0.05.

3. **Probability \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
    This is the probability of the personality sketch \( E \) if Adam is not in business administration. Considering there are many fields where his traits fit better, let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) to be 0.2.

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
    Suppose the prior probability of a random graduate student being in agricultural and veterinary science is 0.05.

2. **Probability \( P(E|H) \)**:
    Given that Adam's personality aligns very well with this field (interest in nature, animals, etc.), we can estimate \( P(E|H) \) to be 0.8.

3. **Probability \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
    This would be the probability of the personality sketch \( E \) if Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science. There are still multiple fields where such a personality might fit, though less precisely, so let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) to be 0.1.

### Calculation

#### Business Administration
Using Bayes' rule for business administration:

\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{P(E|H_{BA})P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H_{BA})P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA})P(\neg H_{BA}) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.05 \times 0.1) + (0.2 \times 0.9) = 0.005 + 0.18 = 0.185 \]

So,

\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.05 \times 0.1}{0.185} \approx 0.027 \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
Using Bayes' rule for agricultural and veterinary science:

\[ P(H|E)_{AVS} = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS})P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H_{AVS})P(H_{AVS}) + P(E|\neg H_{AVS})P(\neg H_{AVS}) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.05) + (0.1 \times 0.95) = 0.04 + 0.095 = 0.135 \]

So,

\[ P(H|E)_{AVS} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.135} \approx 0.296 \]

### Summary

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.027,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.296
}
```

This approach shows that, based on the given personality sketch, Adam is significantly more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration.
