To apply Bayes' theorem for the given fields of graduate study, we need to estimate the relevant probabilities. Here’s a high-level reasoning for each of the probabilities needed:

- **P(H)**: The base rate probability that any given graduate student might be enrolled in a specific field. This can be informed by industry data or statistics from graduate programs.

- **P(E|H)**: The conditional probability that Adam’s personality sketch (E) matches students in the particular field (H).

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The conditional probability that Adam’s personality sketch (E) matches students in fields other than the specified field (H).

Let’s make some informed estimates:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H_agricultural and veterinary science)**: Let’s assume a moderate base probability because this is a specialized but not uncommon field. Let's estimate it at 0.15.
- **P(E|H_agricultural and veterinary science)**: Given Adam's interest in nature, animals, and plants, students in agricultural and veterinary sciences are likely to have similar traits. Estimating this high, around 0.8.
- **P(E|\neg H_agricultural and veterinary science)**: Students in other fields might share some of Adam's traits but less so compared to those in agricultural and veterinary science. So let's estimate this at 0.2.

Now using Bayes' theorem, P(H|E) = (P(E|H) * P(H)) / (P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|¬H) * P(¬H)):

P(H|E)_agricultural and veterinary science = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15))
P(H|E)_agricultural and veterinary science = (0.12) / (0.12 + 0.17) ≈ 0.414

### Business Administration

- **P(H_business administration)**: Business administration is a very common field. Let’s estimate a moderate base rate of 0.2.
- **P(E|H_business administration)**: Students in business administration might not necessarily share Adam's specific traits, especially his deep interest in nature and animals. Estimating a lower value, around 0.2.
- **P(E|\neg H_business administration)**: Adam’s traits may be equally common in various other fields that are not specifically business administration, let’s estimate this to be around 0.3.

 Bayes' theorem, P(H|E) = (P(E|H) * P(H)) / (P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|¬H) * P(¬H)):

P(H|E)_business administration = (0.2 * 0.2) / (0.2 * 0.2 + 0.3 * (1 - 0.2))
P(H|E)_business administration = (0.04) / (0.04 + 0.24) ≈ 0.143
