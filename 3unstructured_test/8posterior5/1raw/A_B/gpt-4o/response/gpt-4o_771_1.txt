To calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to define the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \) - The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
2. \( P(E|H) \) - The probability of the evidence given that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - The probability of the evidence given that Adam was not enrolled in that specific field.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, as \( P(E) \) is a normalization constant over all hypotheses, we can compare the relative values to assess the likelihood.

Let's assign reasonable values based on the given personality sketch and the two fields.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Assume a higher prior probability, say \( 0.2 \), since Adam has an intrinsic interest in nature, plants, and animals.

2. **P(E|H):**
   - Given Adam’s attributes, he fits well into agricultural and veterinary science, especially with his empathy and love for animals.
   - Let’s assume this probability is high, around \( 0.8 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H):**
   - For fields other than agricultural and veterinary science, while his empathy and intelligence might fit, the specific interest in plants and animals may be less common.
   - Let's assume this probability is lower, around \( 0.1 \).

### Business Administration
1. **P(H) for Business Administration:**
   - Assume a moderate prior probability, say \( 0.1 \), as it's a common field but not heavily suggested by the traits listed.

2. **P(E|H):**
   - Adam might have some traits valuable for business (like intelligence and dedication), but his strong interest in nature, plants, and animals is not a typical fit.
   - Let’s assume this probability is quite low, around \( 0.1 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H):**
   - For other fields, including those more related to nature and science, Adam’s traits might be more appropriate.
   - Let's assume this probability is slightly higher, around \( 0.3 \).

### Calculation of \( P(H|E) \)
Using these probabilities, we can intuitively compute \( P(H|E) \) relatively:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.2 = 0.16 \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.1 = 0.01 \]

Considering normalization:

Normalization factor = 0.16 (Ag/Vet) + 0.01 (Bus.Admin) = 0.17

Thus,

\[ P(H|E \text{ for Ag/Vet}) = \frac{0.16}{0.17} \approx 0.94 \]
\[ P(H|E \text{ for Bus.Admin}) = \frac{0.01}{0.17} \approx 0.06 \]

Thus, the final probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.94,
  "business administration": 0.06
}
