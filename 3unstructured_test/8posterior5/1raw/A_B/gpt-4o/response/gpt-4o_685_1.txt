To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Here's the formula we'll use:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is common to both fields and doesn't affect the comparison, we'll omit it in the step-by-step demonstration but implicitly consider it while comparing between fields.

We'll denote:
- \( H_1 \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( H_2 \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in business administration.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **\( P(H_1) \): Prior probability of Adam being in agricultural and veterinary science.**
   - Given Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, and love for animals, he seems more likely to be drawn to a field related to life sciences.
   - Therefore, we might set \( P(H_1) \) higher.

2. **\( P(E|H_1) \): Likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in agricultural and veterinary science.**
   - Adamâ€™s characteristics (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work) strongly align with this field.
   - \( P(E|H_1) \) will be high.

3. **\( P(E|\neg H_1) \): Likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not in agricultural and veterinary science.**
   - While Adam could theoretically have these traits in other fields, agricultural and veterinary science fits very well.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_1) \) is lower compared to \( P(E|H_1) \) because other fields might not align as strongly.

### Business Administration

1. **\( P(H_2) \): Prior probability of Adam being in business administration.**
   - Adam's traits seem less aligned with business administration, which often requires a different set of skills and interests, although high intelligence can be applied broadly.
   - Therefore, we might set \( P(H_2) \) lower.

2. **\( P(E|H_2) \): Likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in business administration.**
   - Curiosity about nature and a love for animals are less relevant in business administration. However, high intelligence and empathy can be beneficial in any field.
   - \( P(E|H_2) \) will be moderate to low.

3. **\( P(E|\neg H_2) \): Likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not in business administration.**
   - Since Adam's characteristics are not particularly aligned with business administration, we assume that this personality sketch is less likely in business administration.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_2) \) will be relatively high.

Given the information above, let's assign some estimated probabilities:

- For agricultural and veterinary science:
  \[
  \begin{align*}
  P(H_1) & \approx 0.4 \\
  P(E|H_1) & \approx 0.8 \\
  P(E|\neg H_1) & \approx 0.3
  \end{align*}
  \]

- For business administration:
  \[
  \begin{align*}
  P(H_2) & \approx 0.05 \\
  P(E|H_2) & \approx 0.2 \\
  P(E|\neg H_2) & \approx 0.6
  \end{align*}
  \]

Now apply Bayes' rule to compare:

- For agricultural and veterinary science:
  \[
  P(H_1|E) \propto P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) = 0.8 \times 0.4 = 0.32
  \]

- For business administration:
  \[
  P(H_2|E) \propto P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) = 0.2 \times 0.05 = 0.01
  \]

This leads us to a normalized comparison (where the sum may not add up to 1):

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.32,
  "business administration": 0.01
}
```
