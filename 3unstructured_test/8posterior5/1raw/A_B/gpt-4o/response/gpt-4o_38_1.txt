First, let's define the terms:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) (Adam's personality sketch) given that he was enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that he was not enrolled in that particular field.
- \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch, which we will compute using Bayes' rule: \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \).

Assuming we do not have a more specific prior probability and consider each field roughly equally likely for a graduate student, we might assign \( P(H) \) as an initial guess. However, these priors could be further refined based on demographic data, so note that these values are broad assumptions.

Let’s assume for simplicity:
- \( P(H) = 0.1 \) for both fields (given numerous other possible fields).
- \( P(E) \) can be normalized in the end.

Next, let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam’s interests and personality traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals), it is highly probable that his personality fits someone enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \).

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): For those not in this field, considering other potential fields and Adam's attributes, the likelihood of this personality can be assumed lower. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \).

### Business Administration
- \( P(E|H) \): A personality with strong empathy and abstract thinking is valued in business administration, though the specific interests in nature and animals are less directly relevant. Let’s estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \).

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): For those not in business administration, the likelihood of matching Adam’s personality sketch might not be significantly different given the broad applicability of empathy and intelligence. Let’s also estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \).

Now, compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We assume \( P(E) \) is the same for normalization, so we look at relative values of \( P(H|E) \).

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \]

For business administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.3 \times 0.1 = 0.03 \]

Normalizing these:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.03} \approx 0.73 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} = \frac{0.03}{0.08 + 0.03} \approx 0.27 \]

Given the above simplified assumptions and rough estimations, we get:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.73,
  "business administration": 0.27
}
```
