To apply Bayes' Rule to find \( P(H|E) \), we need the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence probability \( P(E) \). Bayes' Rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be computed as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Given that there are other fields of specialization, we won't compute \( P(E) \) directly, but will instead provide probabilities for the two given fields without normalizing such that they sum to 1.

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: Business administration is a common graduate field, so let's assume a moderate prior probability.
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.15 \)

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: This field may not typically emphasize traits like empathy, love for animals, or appreciation for nature and plants.
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \)

3. **Complement Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: For fields other than business administration, Adam's traits might be more generally applicable.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \)

4. **Posterior Probability, \( P(H|E) \)**: 
   \[
   P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{0.1 \cdot 0.15 + 0.3 \cdot (1 - 0.15)} = \frac{0.015}{0.015 + 0.255} \approx 0.055
   \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: Assume a lower prior probability since it's more specialized.
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.05 \)

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: This field aligns closely with Adamâ€™s traits such as his appreciation for nature, empathy, and love for animals.
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \)

3. **Complement Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: For other fields, Adam's traits might be less applicable.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \)

4. **Posterior Probability, \( P(H|E) \)**: 
   \[
   P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.9 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot (1 - 0.05)} = \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.19} \approx 0.191
   \]

Therefore, the probabilities of Adam being in these fields given his personality sketch are:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.055",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.191"
}
```
