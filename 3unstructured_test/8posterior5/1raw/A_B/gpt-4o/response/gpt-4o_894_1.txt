To apply Bayes' theorem for each field, we need to consider the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field, as well as the likelihood of the observed personality sketch given enrollment in that field and not being enrolled in that field.

Given:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam is enrolled in the field H.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam is not enrolled in the field H.

\( P(H|E) \) can be computed using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's consider the fields:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **\( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \) (prior)**: Given Adam's strong interest and empathy towards nature, plants, and animals, it is reasonably likely he might be enrolled in this field. We might give this a prior probability of 0.3 (30%).
2. **\( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \) (likelihood)**: Given that Adam has traits that align well with a student in Agricultural and Veterinary Science (e.g., love for nature, empathy, and intelligence), this probability would be high, say 0.9 (90%).
3. **\( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \)**: The probability of Adam having these traits but not being in this field would be reasonably lower, perhaps 0.2 (20%).

### Business Administration

1. **\( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \)**: Considering Adam's personality and interests, business administration seems less likely. We might assign this a prior probability of 0.1 (10%).
2. **\( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \)**: These personality traits are less likely to be associated with business administration, so let’s assign a likelihood of 0.2 (20%).
3. **\( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \)**: The probability of Adam having these traits but not being in business administration is higher, let's say 0.4 (40%).

To calculate the posterior probabilities, we use Bayes’ theorem:

### Calculation

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \).

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(E)_{\text{AVS}} = (0.9 * 0.3) + (0.2 * 0.7) = 0.27 + 0.14 = 0.41 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{0.9 * 0.3}{0.41} \approx 0.66 \]

For **Business Administration**:
\[ P(E)_{\text{BA}} = (0.2 * 0.1) + (0.4 * 0.9) = 0.02 + 0.36 = 0.38 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.2 * 0.1}{0.38} \approx 0.053 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.66,
  "business administration": 0.053
}
```

These values suggest that it is significantly more likely that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science compared to Business Administration, given his personality sketch.
