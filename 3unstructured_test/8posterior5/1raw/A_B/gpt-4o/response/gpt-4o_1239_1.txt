To compute the probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for each hypothesis \(H\) using Bayes' Rule, we need to first estimate the prior probabilities \(P(H)\), the likelihoods \(P(E|H)\), and the evidence likelihoods \(P(E|\neg H)\). 

For Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Since \(P(E)\) is common to all hypotheses and acts as a normalizing constant, we can focus on the numerator \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) to assess the relative probabilities.

### Business Administration:
#### P(H) - Prior Probability
Business administration is a common field, so let's assume:
\[ P(H_{\text{business}}) = 0.3 \]

#### P(E|H) - Likelihood
Personality traits in E don't strongly correlate with typical business administration students, who might generally be more extroverted and less focused on nature and animals. Likelihood might be relatively low:
\[ P(E|H_{\text{business}}) = 0.1 \]

#### P(E|\neg H) - Complement Likelihood
For students not in business administration, the likelihood of having E's traits might be moderate. Let’s roughly estimate:
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}}) = 0.5 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
#### P(H) - Prior Probability
Agricultural and veterinary science is less common but fits better with Adam’s interests and personality. Let’s assume:
\[ P(H_{\text{agri\_vet\_science}}) = 0.1 \]

#### P(E|H) - Likelihood
Adam's traits closely match those of students in agricultural and veterinary science. Likelihood might be high:
\[ P(E|H_{\text{agri\_vet\_science}}) = 0.9 \]

#### P(E|\neg H) - Complement Likelihood
For students not in agricultural and veterinary science, the likelihood of having E's traits might be moderate:
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{agri\_vet\_science}}) = 0.3 \]

Using Bayes’ Rule, we get relative probabilities. Let's denote:
\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))
\]

### Business Administration:
\[
P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}})}{P(E)}
\]

We only need the relative numerator, since P(E) will be the same for both fields:

\[
P(H_{\text{business}}|E) \approx P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}})
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{business}}|E) \approx 0.1 \cdot 0.3 = 0.03
\]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[
P(H_{\text{agri\_vet\_science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agri\_vet\_science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agri\_vet\_science}})}{P(E)}
\]

Relative numerator:

\[
P(H_{\text{agri\_vet\_science}}|E) \approx P(E|H_{\text{agri\_vet\_science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agri\_vet\_science}})
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{agri\_vet\_science}}|E) \approx 0.9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.09
\]

Finally, we normalize these amounts to get comparative probabilities:

\[
\text{Total} = 0.03 + 0.09 = 0.12
\]

### Normalized Probabilities:
\[
P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.12} = 0.25
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{agri\_vet\_science}}|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.12} = 0.75
\]

  "business administration": 0.25,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75
