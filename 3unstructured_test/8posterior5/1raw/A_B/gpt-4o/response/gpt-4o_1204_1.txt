To calculate the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to start by estimating \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: The probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in general. This might be relatively low compared to other fields due to less overall enrollment.
   - Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).

- **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam, with his described traits, would be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. His love for nature, animals, and empathy make this highly plausible.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam having his described traits if he was not in agricultural and veterinary science. Adam's traits could still fit other fields, especially in sciences or humanities.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]

First, we compute \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \times 0.05) + (0.1 \times 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.035 + 0.095 = 0.13 \]

Now, compute \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.05}{0.13} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.035}{0.13} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.269 \]

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: The probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. This field generally has high enrollment rates.
   - Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

- **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam, with his described traits, would be enrolled in business administration. His empathy and understanding could be useful, but love for nature and animals seems less connected.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam having his described traits if he was not in business administration. Given his traits fit better with other fields, this might be higher.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.15 \).

Again using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]

First, we compute \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \times 0.2) + (0.15 \times 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.12 = 0.16 \]

Now compute \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.2}{0.16} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.16} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.25 \]

Thus, the answers are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.269,
  "business administration": 0.25
}
