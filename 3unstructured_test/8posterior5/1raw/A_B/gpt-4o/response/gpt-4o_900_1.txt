Let's start by evaluating each field based on the given information about Adam's personality sketch (E).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: This is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in this field without any given personality information. Given that there are numerous fields of study, let's assume a moderate prior probability for fields that align with Adam's known interests.
  
  P(H) ≈ 0.1

- **P(E|H)**: This is the probability of observing Adam’s personality traits given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Considering Adam's love for nature, plants, animals, and his empathy, this alignment is quite high.
  
  P(E|H) ≈ 0.9

- **P(E|¬H)**: This is the probability of observing Adam’s personality traits given that he is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. These traits could exist in other fields, but they may not strongly indicate them. This value should be lower.

  P(E|¬H) ≈ 0.3

Using Bayes' Rule, let's compute P(H|E):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Considering \( P(E) \) as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]
\[ P(E) ≈ (0.9 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) ≈ 0.09 + 0.27 = 0.36 \]

Hence, 

\[ P(H|E) ≈ \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{0.36} \approx \frac{0.09}{0.36} = 0.25 \]

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: This is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in this field without considering his personality traits. Business administration is another common field, but let's assume a moderate prior probability as well for comparison.

  P(H) ≈ 0.1

- **P(E|H)**: This is the probability of observing Adam’s personality traits given that he is enrolled in business administration. Adam's traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy) don't strongly align with typical traits emphasized in business administration.

  P(E|H) ≈ 0.1

- **P(E|¬H)**: This is the probability of observing Adam’s personality traits given that he is not enrolled in business administration. This remains similar to the value used before.

  P(E|¬H) ≈ 0.4

Again, using Bayes’ Rule, let's compute P(H|E):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Considering \( P(E) \) as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]
\[ P(E) ≈ (0.1 \cdot 0.1) + (0.4 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) ≈ 0.01 + 0.36 = 0.37 \]

Hence,

\[ P(H|E) ≈ \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.37} \approx \frac{0.01}{0.37} ≈ 0.027 \]

### Summary
Based on the computations, the probabilities can be summarized as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.25,
  "business administration": 0.027
}
