### Hypothetical Probability Values:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) \): This is the prior probability of a graduate student being in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume this is 0.10 (10% of all graduate students might be in this field).
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \): This is the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, and his empathy, let's estimate this to be 0.80.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AgVet}}) \): This is the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. While some traits may be common outside this field, his specific profile might not be as prevalent. Let's assign this a value of 0.30.

   Using Bayes' rule:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{AgVet}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AgVet}})}{P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{AgVet}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{AgVet}})}
   \]
   \[
   P(H_{\text{AgVet}}|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.10}{(0.80 \cdot 0.10) + (0.30 \cdot 0.90)} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.27} = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \approx 0.229
   \]

2. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H_{\text{BusAdmin}}) \): This is the prior probability of a graduate student being in business administration. Let's assume this is 0.15 (15% of all graduate students might be in this field).
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{BusAdmin}}) \): This is the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is in business administration. Given Adam's profile, it seems less likely but not impossible. Let's estimate this to be 0.10.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BusAdmin}}) \): This is the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in business administration. Considering it's more likely he is not in business administration based on his personality, letâ€™s give this a value of 0.45.

   Using Bayes' rule:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{BusAdmin}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BusAdmin}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BusAdmin}})}{P(E|H_{\text{BusAdmin}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BusAdmin}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{BusAdmin}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{BusAdmin}})}
   \]
   \[
   P(H_{\text{BusAdmin}}|E) = \frac{0.10 \cdot 0.15}{(0.10 \cdot 0.15) + (0.45 \cdot 0.85)} = \frac{0.015}{0.015 + 0.3825} = \frac{0.015}{0.3975} \approx 0.038
   \]
