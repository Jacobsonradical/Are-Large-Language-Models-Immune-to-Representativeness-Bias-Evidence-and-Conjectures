To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to determine the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the marginal probability \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field of study. 

Bayes' Rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence, which is the sum \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Given that our total does not need to sum to 1 and considering the description of Adam's personality, we can reason as follows:

### Business Administration
1. **Prior \( P(H) \)**: This represents the initial likelihood of Adam enrolling in business administration, not given any other information. Let's assume a relatively low prior given Adam's interests; let's set this value to 0.1.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of Adam having the described personality sketch if he were enrolled in business administration. Given the traits described, a person in business administration would be less likely to have a deep love for animals and nature as a primary interest. We might set this value at around 0.2.

3. **Marginal \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This represents the likelihood of Adam having the described personality sketch if he were enrolled in any other field. Given our context, we should consider it relatively high as there are many fields more likely to align with his personality than business administration. We'll set this value at 0.7.

Substituting into Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.7 \cdot 0.9} 
= \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.63} 
= \frac{0.02}{0.65} 
\approx 0.0307 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **Prior \( P(H) \)**: This represents the initial likelihood of Adam enrolling in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume a higher prior given Adam's interests; let's set this value to 0.5.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of Adam having the described personality sketch if he were enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature, this field fits very well. We might set this value at 0.9.

3. **Marginal \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This represents the likelihood of Adam having the described personality sketch if he were enrolled in any other field. Assuming this complementarily to the first estimate, we'll set this value at 0.5 for simplicity.

Substituting into Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.5}{0.9 \cdot 0.5 + 0.5 \cdot 0.5} 
= \frac{0.45}{0.45 + 0.25} 
= \frac{0.45}{0.70} 
\approx 0.6429 \]

Based on the calculations, we get:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0307,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6429
}
