To solve for the probabilities \( P(H|E) \), we can use Bayes' rule, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Firstly, let's outline our assumptions for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for the given fields.

### Field: Agricultural and Veterinary Science
**Hypothesis \( H_{AVS} \): Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.**

- **P(H_{AVS})**: Probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is studying Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, we might expect this to be somewhat higher than average. Let's assume \( P(H_{AVS}) = 0.15 \).

- **P(E|H_{AVS})**: Probability of the observed evidence (E: Adam's personality sketch) given that Adam is studying Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Since the sketch is highly consistent with this field, we can assume this probability is high. Let's say \( P(E|H_{AVS}) = 0.8 \).

- **P(E|\neg H_{AVS})**: Probability of the observed evidence given that Adam is not studying Agricultural and Veterinary Science. This could include all other fields. Given the specificity of Adam's personality, interest in nature and animals, this probability might be lower. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) = 0.2 \).

### Field: Business Administration
**Hypothesis \( H_{BA} \): Adam was enrolled in Business Administration.**

- **P(H_{BA})**: Probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is studying Business Administration. Let's assume this is quite common, so \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.2 \).

- **P(E|H_{BA})**: Probability of the observed evidence (E: Adam's personality sketch) given that Adam is studying Business Administration. Given Adam's interests, this seems less likely. Let's assume \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.1 \).

- **P(E|\neg H_{BA})**: Probability of the observed evidence given that Adam is not studying Business Administration. This includes all other fields, and given the high specificity of Adam's personality, we might assume \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.25 \).

### Calculations

To calculate \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) + P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \cdot P(\neg H_{AVS}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

And similarly:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \cdot P(\neg H_{BA}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.25 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.22 \]

(For comprehensiveness, we continue using the initial calculation of \( P(E) \approx 0.29 \) for subsequent calculations.)

### Applying Bayes' Rule

**For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \approx 0.41 \]

**For Business Administration:**

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx \frac{0.02}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx 0.07 \]

So, the results are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.41,
  "business administration": 0.07
}
