Sure, let's break it down step-by-step using Bayes' theorem, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \), we need to estimate the values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. P(H) - The probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume it to be approximately 0.03 (3%) based on general enrollment statistics.
2. P(E|H) - The probability that Adam has the personality traits described if he is in this field. Given his love for nature, animals, and his empathy, we can estimate this to be high, say 0.8 (80%).
3. P(E|¬H) - The probability that Adam has these personality traits if he is not in this field. Since students from other fields can also have these traits but perhaps less commonly, let's assume it to be around 0.1 (10%).

### Business Administration

1. P(H) - The probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in business administration. Let's assume it to be approximately 0.15 (15%) based on general enrollment statistics.
2. P(E|H) - The probability that Adam has the personality traits described if he is in this field. Given his distinct lean towards nature and animals, this might be lower, say around 0.2 (20%).
3. P(E|¬H) - The probability that Adam has these personality traits if he is not in this field. This remains the same as before, 0.1 (10%).

Using these values, we can now compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

First, compute \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.03) + (0.1 \cdot 0.97) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.024 + 0.097 = 0.121 \]

Now, apply it to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.03}{0.121} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.024}{0.121} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.198 \]

### Business Administration

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

First, compute \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.15) + (0.1 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.03 + 0.085 = 0.115 \]

Now, apply it to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{0.115} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.115} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.261 \]

So, the values are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.198,
  "business administration": 0.261
}
```
These probabilities reflect the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in the respective fields given his described personality traits.
