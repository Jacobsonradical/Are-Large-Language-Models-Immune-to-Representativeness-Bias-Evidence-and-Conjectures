Let's analyze each field using Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in the specified field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch, which actually doesn't need to be calculated directly because we are comparing relative probabilities.

Let's consider the personality sketch \( E \) and how it aligns with the fields of "agricultural and veterinary science" and "business administration".

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): The probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science without knowing his personality. Suppose this field is relatively less common than business administration, but not exceedingly rare. Assign it a value of 0.3.
- \( P(E|H) \): Adam's interest in nature, animals, and plants, along with his empathy and appreciation for hard work, align very well with this field. Assign it a high value, 0.8.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam having this personality sketch if he was not in agricultural and veterinary science. It's possible he could have this personality in other fields, but less likely. Assign it a value, 0.4.

#### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): The probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration without knowing his personality. Since business administration is a common field, assign it a value of 0.5.
- \( P(E|H) \): Adam's personality seems less aligned with business administration, which often requires a focus on people, finance, and organizational skills, rather than an interest in nature and animals. Assign it a lower value, 0.2.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam having this personality sketch if he was not in business administration. His personality is better suited to other, less business-oriented fields. Assign it a value, 0.6.

Using these probabilities, we can calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} = \frac{0.24}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is common for both and thus cancels out in relative comparison, we get:

\[ \frac{P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E)}{P(\text{business administration}|E)} = \frac{0.24}{0.1} = 2.4 \]

Normalizing based on just these two probabilities to add 1 givesâ€”since they're compared directly:

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \approx \frac{2.4}{3.4} \approx 0.71 \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) \approx \frac{1}{3.4} \approx 0.29 \]

Therefore, the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field given his personality sketch are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.71,
  "business administration": 0.29
}
