To apply Bayes' rule for these hypotheses, we need to make some educated guesses about the probabilities. Let's denote:

- \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \) as the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \) as the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \) as the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is in business administration.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \) as the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \) as the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not in business administration.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \) as the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not in agricultural and veterinary science.

For simplicity, let’s assign some estimated values to these probabilities based on the given sketch.

### Estimating Probabilities:

- **Prior Probabilities**:
  - \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.10 \) (Considering a broad range of fields in graduate studies, business administration is a common one, but not overwhelmingly so.)
  - \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.05 \) (Agricultural and veterinary science is more specialized and less common.)

- **Likelihoods**:
  - \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.05 \) (Adam's personality traits align less directly with typical traits expected in business administration.)
  - \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.60 \) (Adam’s warm heart, empathy, love of nature and animals, and appreciation for hard work align well.)
  - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.30 \) (Adam’s traits might still be found in a range of other fields, just not specifically business administration.)
  - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.20 \) (His traits are less common outside of more nature-related fields.)

### Applying Bayes' Rule:

Bayes' rule: \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \), where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

### For Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \]

- \( P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \)
- \( P(E) = 0.05 \cdot 0.10 + 0.30 \cdot 0.90 \)
- \( P(E) = 0.005 + 0.27 = 0.275 \)

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.10}{0.275} \approx 0.018 \]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}})}{P(E)} \]

- \( P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \)
- \( P(E) = 0.60 \cdot 0.05 + 0.20 \cdot 0.95 \)
- \( P(E) = 0.03 + 0.19 = 0.22 \)

\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{0.60 \cdot 0.05}{0.22} \approx 0.136 \]

### Final Results:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.018,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.136
}
