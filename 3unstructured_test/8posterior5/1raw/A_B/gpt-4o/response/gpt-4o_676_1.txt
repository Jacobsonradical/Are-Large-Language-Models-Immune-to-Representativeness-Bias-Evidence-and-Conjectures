To compute the probabilities using Bayes' rule, we'll begin by estimating the relevant probabilities. Note that these values are subjective estimations.

Let's denote the following:

- H₁: Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- H₂: Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- E: The personality sketch of Adam.

We need:

- P(H₁) and P(H₂): The prior probabilities that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science or business administration.
- P(E|H₁) and P(E|H₂): The probabilities of observing the personality sketch given each hypothesis.
- P(E) and P(E|¬H): The probabilities of observing the personality sketch in general and given the negation of each hypothesis.

Assuming the priors for P(H₁) and P(H₂) are roughly equal, but noting that the total does not have to sum up to 1 due to other possible graduate fields:

P(H₁) and P(H₂) being roughly equal, let's give a prior of 0.1 (since there are many other possible graduate fields, this is a low but reasonable starting point).

Given these initial priors:
- P(H₁) = 0.1
- P(H₂) = 0.1

Next, let's consider P(E|H₁), P(E|H₂), and P(E|\neg H₁), P(E|\neg H₂):

For H₁ (agricultural and veterinary science), Adam's personality traits align well. Given his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, we estimate:
- P(E|H₁) ≈ 0.8

For H₂ (business administration), Adam's personality traits do not align as strongly. Although his intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts might help in business, his other traits align more with science. So a lower likelihood:
- P(E|H₂) ≈ 0.2

For not being in agricultural and veterinary science (¬H₁), we consider the overall likelihood of his personality matching other random fields:
- P(E|¬H₁) ≈ 0.4 (since his traits are still quite aligned with scientific fields)

For not being in business administration (¬H₂):
- P(E|¬H₂) ≈ 0.5 (since there are many scientific fields his traits can align with)

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be approximated by:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H₁) \cdot P(H₁) + P(E|\neg H₁) \cdot P(\neg H₁) \]

Let's start with H₁ (agricultural and veterinary science):

\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.4 \cdot 0.9 = 0.08 + 0.36 = 0.44 \]
\[ P(H₁|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.44} = \frac{0.08}{0.44} \approx 0.182 \]

Now for H₂ (business administration):

\[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.5 \cdot 0.9 = 0.02 + 0.45 = 0.47 \]
\[ P(H₂|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.47} = \frac{0.02}{0.47} \approx 0.043 \]

So the final values are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.182,
  "business administration": 0.043
}
