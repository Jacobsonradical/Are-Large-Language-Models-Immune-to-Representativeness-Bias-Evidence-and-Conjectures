To use Bayes' theorem, we need prior probabilities and likelihood estimations. Bayes' theorem is represented as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For the purpose of this question, letâ€™s make educated guesses for these probabilities.

**1. Business Administration**

- **P(H)**: The prior probability Adam was enrolled in Business Administration. 
  Given Adam's personality and interests in nature, plants, and animals, we might assume a lower prior probability.
  \[ P(\text{H}_\text{BA}) \approx 0.1 \]

- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch given enrollment in Business Administration.
  Given the sketch suggests a soft spot for nature, plants, and animals, this is low.
  \[ P(E|\text{H}_\text{BA}) \approx 0.1 \]

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch given NOT being enrolled in Business Administration.
  Given the wide range of non-business related fields, this might be relatively higher.
  \[ P(E|\neg\text{H}_\text{BA}) \approx 0.5 \]

- **P(H|E)**: Calculated using Bayes' Rule. 
  \[
  P(\text{H}_\text{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{H}_\text{BA}) \cdot P(\text{H}_\text{BA})}{P(E)} 
  \]
  \[
  P(E) = P(E|\text{H}_\text{BA}) \cdot P(\text{H}_\text{BA}) + P(E|\neg\text{H}_\text{BA}) \cdot (1 - P(\text{H}_\text{BA}))
  \]
  
  \[
  P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.1) + (0.5 \times 0.9) = 0.01 + 0.45 = 0.46
  \]
  
  \[
  P(\text{H}_\text{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.1}{0.46} \approx \frac{0.01}{0.46} \approx 0.0217
  \]

**Business Administration**: \( \approx 0.0217 \)

**2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
  Given Adam's personality sketch, this seems more likely.
  \[ P(\text{H}_\text{AG}) \approx 0.4 \]

- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch given enrollment in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
  From the sketch, this is notably high.
  \[ P(E|\text{H}_\text{AG}) \approx 0.9 \]

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch given NOT being enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
  This depends on the relative likelihood given other fields and might be lower.
  \[ P(E|\neg\text{H}_\text{AG}) \approx 0.3 \]

- **P(H|E)**: Calculated using Bayes' Rule.
  \[
  P(\text{H}_\text{AG}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{H}_\text{AG}) \cdot P(\text{H}_\text{AG})}{P(E)}
  \]
  \[
  P(E) = P(E|\text{H}_\text{AG}) \cdot P(\text{H}_\text{AG}) + P(E|\neg\text{H}_\text{AG}) \cdot (1 - P(\text{H}_\text{AG}))
  \]
  
  \[
  P(E) = (0.9 \times 0.4) + (0.3 \times 0.6) = 0.36 + 0.18 = 0.54
  \]
  
  \[
  P(\text{H}_\text{AG}|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.4}{0.54} = \frac{0.36}{0.54} \approx 0.6667
  \]

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: \( \approx 0.6667 \)

So, the final answers would be:

{
  "business administration": 0.0217,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6667
}
