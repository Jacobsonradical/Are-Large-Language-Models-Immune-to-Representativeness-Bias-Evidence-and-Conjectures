Sure, let's break this down using Bayes' Rule. Bayes' Rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the personality sketch of Adam, let's estimate the probabilities:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

   **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in this field. Given his interest in nature, plants, animals, and curiosity, this field seems quite likely. Let's denote this value as relatively high, say 0.4.

   **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam having these characteristics given that he is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. These traits fit well with this field. Let's assign a high probability, say 0.9.

   **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam having these characteristics given that he is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Since these traits are quite specific to nature and animals, we can assume it's lower. Let's denote it as 0.2.

   Using Bayes' Rule:
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.4}{P(E)} \]
   \[ = \frac{0.36}{P(E)} \]

   **P(E)**: is the total probability of observing E: 
   \[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
   Assuming there are many possible fields, let's denote \(\neg H\) as the complementary set of similar fields. For simplicity:
   \[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.4) + (0.2 \cdot 0.6) \]
   \[ = 0.36 + 0.12 \]
   \[ = 0.48 \]

   Thus,
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.36}{0.48} \]
   \[ = 0.75 \]

2. **Business Administration**

   **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in this field. Given his warm heart, empathy, and intelligence, it is possible, but less likely compared to Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Let's denote this value as 0.1.

   **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam having these characteristics given that he is in Business Administration. Some traits fit well, but the specifics about nature and animals don't. Let's assign a moderate probability, say 0.3.

   **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam having these characteristics given that he is not in Business Administration. This should be higher since the traits don't specifically fit business, but rather other possible natural sciences or empathy-driven fields. Let's denote it as 0.6.

   Using Bayes' Rule:
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]
   \[ = \frac{0.03}{P(E)} \]

   **P(E)**:
   \[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
   Assuming previous simplifications:
   \[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.1) + (0.6 \cdot 0.9) \]
   \[ = 0.03 + 0.54 \]
   \[ = 0.57 \]

   Thus,
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.57} \]
   \[ = 0.053 \]

So, the probabilities by field, calculated through Bayes' Rule, are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.053
}
```
