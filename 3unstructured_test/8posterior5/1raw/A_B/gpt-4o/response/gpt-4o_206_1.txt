To calculate the posterior probability \( \text{P}(H|E) \) (i.e., the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch), we'll use Bayes' rule: 
\[ \text{P}(H|E) = \frac{\text{P}(E|H) \cdot \text{P}(H)}{\text{P}(E)} \]
where:
- \( \text{P}(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.
- \( \text{P}(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) if Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( \text{P}(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \).

Given the information provided, let's estimate the probabilities for each field.

1. \( \text{P}(H) \):
   - Without specific data, let's assume that the overall distribution of students across different fields of study should be roughly even. This is a naive assumption due to lack of data, but it can help us proceed with the calculation. For simplicity, we'll assume \( \text{P}(H) \approx 0.1 \) for each field, and \( \text{P}(\neg H) \approx 0.9 \).

2. \( \text{P}(E|H) \) and \( \text{P}(E|\neg H) \):
   - For agricultural and veterinary science, students often have a strong curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, which aligns well with Adam's personality sketch. Thus, \( \text{P}(E|H) \) for this field will be high.
   - For business administration, while problem-solving skills and high intelligence are relevant, other traits like empathy and love for animals might be less directly related. Thus, \( \text{P}(E|H) \) for this field will be lower.

3. \( \text{P}(E) \):
   - This is a normalization factor. For simplicity, we will just consider the relevant fields provided, assuming it to be a combination of the probabilities across the mentioned hypotheses.

Now, let's assign approximate values based on logical reasoning:
- For agricultural and veterinary science:
  - \( \text{P}(E|H) \approx 0.8 \) (high likelihood given the personality traits)
  - \( \text{P}(E|\neg H) \approx 0.1 \) (given that these traits are less common in other fields)

- For business administration:
  - \( \text{P}(E|H) \approx 0.2 \) (lower likelihood given the mismatch in specific traits like love for animals and empathy)
  - \( \text{P}(E|\neg H) \approx 0.8 \) (since these traits are less specific to this field, issues might arise)

Given these values, we use Bayes' rule:
\[ \text{P}(H|E) = \frac{\text{P}(E|H) \cdot \text{P}(H)}{\text{P}(E)} \]

Now let's compute for both fields:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ \text{P}(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.1 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.09} = \frac{0.08}{0.17} \approx 0.47 \]

### Business Administration:
\[ \text{P}(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.8 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.72} = \frac{0.02}{0.74} \approx 0.027 \]

So, the final probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.47,
  "business administration": 0.027
}
```
