Let's use Bayes' Rule to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \) (the likelihood that Adam is enrolled in a given field without considering the personality sketch).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the personality sketch, which can be formulated as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For simplicity, let's assign some rough estimates to these probabilities based on the description provided.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

#### Priors
- \( P(H) \): The probability of randomly choosing a graduate student in the U.S. who is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is roughly around 0.05 (5%).

#### Likelihood
- \( P(E|H) \): Given that Adam's personality sketch aligns well with an interest in nature, plants, and animals, the likelihood is quite high; let's estimate it at 0.9.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): If Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science, there's still a chance he could have a similar personality sketch. Let's estimate this probability at 0.15.

### Business Administration

#### Priors
- \( P(H) \): The probability of randomly choosing a graduate student in the U.S. who is enrolled in business administration is roughly around 0.10 (10%).

#### Likelihood
- \( P(E|H) \): A personality sketch that emphasizes a love for nature and animals is less common in business administration. Let's estimate this likelihood at 0.2.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): This remains the same as above, at 0.15.

Now we calculate the posterior probabilities:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.9 \cdot 0.05 + 0.15 \cdot 0.95 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.045 + 0.1425 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.1875 \]

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.1875} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.1875} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.24 \]

### Business Administration

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.10 + 0.15 \cdot 0.90 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.135 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.155 \]

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.10}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.129 \]

So the results are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.24,
  "business administration": 0.129
}
```

These values reflect the higher likelihood that Adam, given his personality sketch, is more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration.
