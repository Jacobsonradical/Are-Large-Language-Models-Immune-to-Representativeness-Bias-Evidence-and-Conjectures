To estimate the probabilities involved, we'll use Bayes' Theorem, which is given by the equation:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field, \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given that field, and \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence across all fields (which we will assume to be a normalizing constant). \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of the evidence given that Adam was not in the given field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)**: Given Adam's personality traits, such as his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong understanding and appreciation for hard work, it seems relatively likely he would choose this field. Let us estimate it at 0.2.
- **P(E|H)**: The evidence fairly strongly supports the hypothesis, as Adam's traits align well with those typically seen in students of Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Let us estimate it at 0.8.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: For other fields not fitting these traits, this might be lower. Let us estimate it at 0.1. 

\[
P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|}
\]
\[
P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)}
\]

### Business Administration

- **P(H)**: This field does not align as strongly with Adam's stated personality traits such as love for animals and nature. We'll estimate it lower, at 0.05.
- **P(E|H)**: The evidence does not strongly support this field. Let us estimate it at 0.1.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Other fields again would not perfectly align. Let us estimate it at 0.3.

\[
P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|}
\]
\[
P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)}
\]

Given these assumptions and calculations:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.16/P(E)",
  "business administration": "0.005/P(E)"
}

Since the exact value of \(P(E)\) is unknown, we leave it in terms of \(P(E)\) which serves as our normalizing constant. You can see that Agricultural and Veterinary Science is much more likely based on Adam's personality traits.
