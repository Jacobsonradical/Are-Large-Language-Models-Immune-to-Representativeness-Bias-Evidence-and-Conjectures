To solve this, we'll first evaluate the priors and conditional probabilities necessary to apply Bayes' Rule. Bayes' Rule states that:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we are comparing two fields directly, we don't need to compute \( P(E) \) explicitly. Instead, we'll compare the relative likelihoods.

Let's start with the hypotheses:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - **Prior Probability (P(H))**: Given his appreciation for nature, plants, and animals and considering the various graduate fields available, let's assign a moderate prior probability, say \( P(H) = 0.3 \).
    - **Probability of E given H (P(E|H))**: This field fits well with his traits of curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work. Let's give this a high probability, say \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
    - **Probability of E given not H (P(E|\neg H))**: Since qualities like curiosity about nature and empathy can be associated with other fields, this could still generally be high. However, it wouldn't be as high as directly related fields. Let's set \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

2. **Business Administration**:
    - **Prior Probability (P(H))**: Given that many fields are less related to his stated interests in nature and animals, let's assign a lower prior probability, say \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
    - **Probability of E given H (P(E|H))**: Business Administration does not directly align with Adam's stated interests. Let's give a lower probability, say \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).
    - **Probability of E given not H (P(E|\neg H))**: Given his high intelligence and broad applicability of business knowledge, itâ€™s still possible but less likely. Let's set \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

Now, we compute \( P(H|E) \):

Using Bayes' Rule, we can compute the posterior probabilities, keeping in mind we are interpreting:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

- For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \]

- For **Business Administration**:
  \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \times 0.1 = 0.02 \]

Hence, normalizing these (to make comparison straightforward):
\[ P(Agri\&Vet|E) = \frac{0.24}{0.24 + 0.02} \approx 0.92 \]
\[ P(BusAdmin|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.24 + 0.02} \approx 0.08 \]

Therefore, Adam is much more likely to have been enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science compared to Business Administration.

Given the above calculations, the final answer in the specified format is:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.92,
  "business administration": 0.08
}
