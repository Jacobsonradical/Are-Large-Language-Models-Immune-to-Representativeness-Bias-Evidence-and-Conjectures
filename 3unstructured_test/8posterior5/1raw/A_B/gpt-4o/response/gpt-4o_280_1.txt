To approach this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Let's denote:
- \( H_{\text{BA}} \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( H_{\text{AVS}} \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

We need to estimate the following probabilities:

1. Prior Probability \( P(H) \):
   - \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): The general prior probability that a graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in business administration.
   - \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \): The general prior probability that a graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

2. Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch E given that he is enrolled in business administration.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch E given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

3. Marginal Probability:
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \): The probability of observing E given that Adam is not enrolled in business administration.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \): The probability of observing E given that Adam is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Here are qualitative assessments of the probabilities:
- \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): This might be moderate given the popularity of business administration programs.
- \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \): This might be lower compared to business administration but still significant, especially among students interested in nature and animals.

- \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): Likely low, as Adam's personality (appreciation for nature, animals) does not strongly align with typical business administration profiles.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \): Likely high, as his interest in nature, animals, and strong empathy aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science.

- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \): Likely higher than \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \) because many non-business fields could align better with his personality.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \): Could be high, since there might be other science-related fields that align well with his personality, but not as high as for AVS.

Using these assessments, we can make rough numerical estimates to plug into Bayes' theorem:

1. \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.2 \)
2. \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.1 \)

3. \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.1 \)
4. \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.8 \)

5. \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.3 \)
6. \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.4 \)

Plugging these into Bayes' theorem:

For business administration:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.1 \times 0.2 + 0.3 \times 0.8} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.24} = \frac{0.02}{0.26} \approx 0.077 \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.8 \times 0.1 + 0.4 \times 0.9} \approx \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.36} = \frac{0.08}{0.44} \approx 0.182 \]

So we have:

{
  "business administration": 0.077,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.182
}
