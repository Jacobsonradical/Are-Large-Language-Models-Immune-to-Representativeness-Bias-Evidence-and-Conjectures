To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for both fields (agricultural and veterinary science, and business administration) using Bayes' rule, we need to determine the prior probabilities (\( P(H) \)), the likelihoods (\( P(E|H) \)), and the evidence (\( P(E|\neg H) \)), then use these to compute the final probabilities.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

Given the personality sketch, it seems highly probable that Adam could be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science due to his curiosity about nature, empathy for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

### Business Administration

Although Adam's high intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication could fit with business administration, his deep love for nature, plants, and animals makes this less aligned with his personality sketch compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

#### Let's set up the values:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - \( P(H) \): Suppose the general prior probability that a student would choose this field (let's assume 0.1 as graduate students could select from a wide range of fields).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Probability of observing Adam's personality given he is in this field is high, let's assign 0.7.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality given he is not in this field. Considering many other fields donâ€™t align with his profile, let's assume 0.1.

2. **Business Administration**
   - \( P(H) \): Suppose the general prior probability that a student would choose this field (let's assume 0.2, business administration is a common field).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Probability of observing Adam's personality given he is in this field is low, let's assign 0.1.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Considering he could fit better in other fields, but also taking into account the base probability is somewhat higher, let's assume 0.3.

Now, apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the evidence across all hypotheses (thus includes all possible fields).

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_A) \cdot P(H_A) + P(E|\neg H_A) \cdot P(\neg H_A) \]

Given that we don't need the total probabilities to sum up to 1, we can simplify by comparing the relative magnitudes of \( P(H|E) \) for the fields of interest.

### Calculation:
#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H_A) \cdot P(H_A) + P(E|\neg H_A) \cdot P(\neg H_A) \]
\[ P(E) \approx (0.7 \cdot 0.1) + (0.1 \cdot 0.9) = 0.07 + 0.09 = 0.16 \]
\[ P(H_A|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.16} = 0.4375 \approx 0.44 \]

#### Business Administration:
\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H_B) \cdot P(H_B) + P(E|\neg H_B) \cdot P(\neg H_B) \]
\[ P(E) \approx (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) = 0.02+ 0.24 = 0.26 \]
\[ P(H_B|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.26} \approx 0.0769 \approx 0.08 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field are:

\[
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.44",
  "business administration": "0.08"
}
\]
