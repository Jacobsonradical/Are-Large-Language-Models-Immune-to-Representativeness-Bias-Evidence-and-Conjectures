To compute \( P(H|E) \), which is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch, we'll use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here are the steps:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being in each field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of the personality sketch given he is in each field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of the personality sketch given he is not in each field.
4. **P(E)**: The overall probability of the personality sketch.

We will assume values for these probabilities based on statistical data and intuition about the fit between Adam's personality and each field.

### Business Administration
1. **P(H_business)**: Suppose P(H_business) = 0.2 (as a generic estimate of students choosing this field).
2. **P(E|H_business)**: Given the personality sketch, the fit with business administration is somewhat lower than with agricultural and veterinary sciences, so let's set P(E|H_business) = 0.1.
3. **P(E|\neg H_business)**: The probability of having such a personality sketch if not in business administration is likely higher. Let's estimate P(E|\neg H_business) = 0.25.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H_agriculture_veterinary)**: Suppose P(H_agriculture_veterinary) = 0.1.
2. **P(E|H_agriculture_veterinary)**: Based on the sketch, there's a high fit with agricultural and veterinary science, so let's set P(E|H_agriculture_veterinary) = 0.9.
3. **P(E|\neg H_agriculture_veterinary)**: The probability of having such a personality sketch if not in this field is lower. Let's estimate P(E|\neg H_agriculture_veterinary) = 0.15.

To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each:

### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{business} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{business} = \frac{0.02}{P(E)} \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E)_{agriculture_veterinary} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{agriculture_veterinary} = \frac{0.09}{P(E)} \]

Note: \( P(E) \), the normalization factor, is the same for both fields, but since it's unknown, these values are proportional. We can compare the relative values directly.

Thus:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.09
}
```
These reflect the relative likelihood values based on the given probabilities and personality sketch.
