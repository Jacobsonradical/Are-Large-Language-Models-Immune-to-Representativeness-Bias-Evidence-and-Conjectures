Sure, let's go through the Bayesian analysis for these two fields:

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
1. **P(H): Prior probability of being enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Given Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, let's assume a decent probability. 
   - Let's hypothetically say P(H) = 0.2 (as many graduate fields exist).

2. **P(E|H): Probability of observing E given that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Given that this field aligns well with Adam’s curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals, this should be quite high.
   - Let’s assume P(E|H) = 0.9.

3. **P(E|\neg H): Probability of observing E given that Adam is not enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Considering that other fields might not align so perfectly with Adam’s described traits, this might be lower.
   - Let’s assume P(E|\neg H) = 0.1.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}\]

Substituting values:
\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.2}{0.9 \cdot 0.2 + 0.1 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.18}{0.18 + 0.08} = \frac{0.18}{0.26} \approx 0.692\]

### For Business Administration:
1. **P(H): Prior probability of being enrolled in Business Administration**:
   - Business is a popular field, but less likely given Adam's interests.
   - Let’s hypothetically say P(H) = 0.1.

2. **P(E|H): Probability of observing E given that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration**:
   - Business Administration doesn’t naturally align with Adam’s personality sketch.
   - Let’s assume P(E|H) = 0.2.

3. **P(E|\neg H): Probability of observing E given that Adam is not enrolled in Business Administration**:
   - This is relatively higher because many other fields (like Agricultural science) fit better.
   - Let’s assume P(E|\neg H) = 0.15.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}\]

Substituting values:
\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.15 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.135} = \frac{0.02}{0.155} \approx 0.129\]

So the posterior probabilities for each field, given the personality sketch of Adam, are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.692,
  "business administration": 0.129
}
```
