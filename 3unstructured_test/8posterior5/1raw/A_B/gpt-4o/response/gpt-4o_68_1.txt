To compute the probabilities using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam exhibits the personality traits given he is enrolled in a specific field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that Adam exhibits the personality traits given he is not enrolled in a specific field.

Given the information in the personality sketch, we can make reasonable estimates. Let's assume the following:

### Hypothesis: "Business Administration"

- \( P(H_{BA}) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration. For simplicity, let's assume that a relatively smaller proportion of people with Adam's characteristics would choose this field compared to fields more aligned with his interests. Let's estimate this as 0.10.
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): The likelihood of Adam's traits given he is in Business Administration. He has a genuine curiosity for nature, enjoys solving puzzles, and has a deep love for animals, which is less typical for this field, so let's estimate this as 0.05.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \): The likelihood of Adam's traits if he is not in Business Administration. Given he has a more nature-oriented and problem-solving personality, let’s assume a higher likelihood, such as 0.20.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant, it is common across all fields and not required for the direct comparison. However, for clarity:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) \]

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto 0.05 \times 0.10 = 0.005 \]

### Hypothesis: "Agricultural and Veterinary Science"

- \( P(H_{AVS}) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. This field aligns well with Adam’s interest in nature and animals. Let's estimate this as 0.20.
- \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \): The likelihood of Adam's traits given he is in this field. Given his alignment with curiosity about nature, problem-solving, and love for animals, this is quite higher. Let’s estimate this as 0.50.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \): The likelihood of Adam’s traits if he is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given his distinct traits aligning more with this field, let’s estimate a broader likelihood as 0.15.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)} \]

Again, \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant:

\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) \]

\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \propto 0.50 \times 0.20 = 0.10 \]

### Combined Results in Simplified Form:

{
  "business administration": 0.005,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.10
}

Based on these estimates and calculations, it is much more likely that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science compared to Business Administration, given his personality sketch.
