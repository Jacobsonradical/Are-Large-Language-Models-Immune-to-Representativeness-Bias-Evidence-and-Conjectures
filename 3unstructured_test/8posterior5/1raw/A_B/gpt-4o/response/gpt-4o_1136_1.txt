To calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \), we need to use Bayes' theorem, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's denote the variables:
- \( H_1 \): Adam was enrolled in "agricultural and veterinary science"
- \( H_2 \): Adam was enrolled in "business administration"
- \( \neg H_1 \): Adam was not enrolled in "agricultural and veterinary science"
- \( \neg H_2 \): Adam was not enrolled in "business administration"
- \( E \): The personality sketch of Adam

To arrive at the required probabilities, we'll guesstimate the values based on the provided personality sketch and the fit between Adam's personality and the fields of study.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H_1)**: The general prior probability that a randomly selected graduate student was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Suppose this is about 5%.
   - \( P(H_1) = 0.05 \)
2. **P(E|H_1)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch under the hypothesis that Adam was in agricultural and veterinary science, which matches quite well given his love for nature, animals, and plants. Let's estimate this to be fairly high, say 0.8.
   - \( P(E|H_1) = 0.8 \)
3. **P(E|\neg H_1)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch if Adam was enrolled in some other field. Given that there are various other fields, it's reasonable to assume this is less common. Let's estimate this to be around 0.2.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_1) = 0.2 \)

Applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} \]

### Business Administration
1. **P(H_2)**: The general prior probability that a randomly selected graduate student was enrolled in business administration. Suppose this is about 10%.
   - \( P(H_2) = 0.1 \)
2. **P(E|H_2)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch under the hypothesis that Adam was in business administration. This doesn't seem to fit quite well given his personality traits. So let's estimate this to be low, say 0.1.
   - \( P(E|H_2) = 0.1 \)
3. **P(E|\neg H_2)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch if Adam was enrolled in some other field. Guesstimating again, this would be higher than \( P(E|H_2) \), say 0.3.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_2) = 0.3 \)

Applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both calculations and involves normalizing the values, we'll compare the unnormalized results:
- For agricultural and veterinary science: \( 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04 \)
- For business administration: \( 0.1 \cdot 0.1 = 0.01 \)

Normalize these for comparison:

\[ P(H_1|E) \approx \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.01} = \frac{0.04}{0.05} = 0.8 \]
\[ P(H_2|E) \approx \frac{0.01}{0.04 + 0.01} = \frac{0.01}{0.05} = 0.2 \]

So, the posterior probabilities are:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```
