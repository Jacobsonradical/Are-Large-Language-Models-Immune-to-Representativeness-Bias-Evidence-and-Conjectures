To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' Theorem, which is stated as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we do not have exact numbers, we need to make reasonable estimates based on the personality sketch of Adam and the nature of the respective fields.

**Assumptions:**

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam could be enrolled in the respective fields, without any other information.
   
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing the personality sketch (E) given the hypothesis (H) that Adam is enrolled in that field.
   
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of observing the personality sketch (E) given that Adam is not enrolled in that field.
   
4. **P(E)**: The overall probability of the personality sketch, which can be expressed as \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \)

Given the personality sketch, we can make the following qualitative judgments:

### Business Administration

- **P(H)**: Let's assume business administration has moderate enrollment rates among graduate fields. P(business administration) = 0.2.
- **P(E|H)**: Adam's personality (love for nature, animals, puzzles) does not strongly align with typical business administration characteristics. We can assume a lower likelihood. P(E|H_business administration) = 0.1.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: This is based on how common Adam's characteristics are among all students not enrolled in business administration. Assuming that such characteristics are moderately common: P(E|\neg H_business administration) = 0.5.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.5 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.4 = 0.42 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.42} \approx 0.048 \]

So, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration given the personality sketch is approximately 0.048.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)**: Let's assume agricultural and veterinary science has lower enrollment rates than broader fields but more specific relevance to Adam's personality. P(agr & vet science) = 0.1.
- **P(E|H)**: Adam's personality aligns very well with this field. We can assume a higher likelihood. P(E|H_agr & vet science) = 0.7.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: This is how common Adam's characteristics are among students not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Still moderately common: P(E|\neg H_agr & vet science) = 0.4.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.1) + (0.4 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.07 + 0.36 = 0.43 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.43} \approx 0.163 \]

So, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science given the personality sketch is approximately 0.163.

Using the above reasoning, here are the final answers:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.048,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.163
}
