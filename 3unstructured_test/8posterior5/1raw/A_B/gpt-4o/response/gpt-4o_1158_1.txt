To assess the likelihood that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science or business administration based on his personality sketch, we will compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Rule. 

Bayes' Rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both hypotheses, we will focus on comparing the numerators. Higher values will directly correlate with a higher \( P(H|E) \).

Let's break down the components for each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
**\( H \)**: Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

- **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that any given graduate student might be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let’s assume this field has moderate enrollment among graduate programs, say \( 0.10 \) (10%).

- **\( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, empathy, and appreciation for dedication, let's estimate this as quite high, say \( 0.85 \).

- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's traits if he is **not** enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given the specificity of his traits to this field, let’s assume \( 0.30 \).

### Business Administration:
**\( H \)**: Adam was enrolled in business administration.

- **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that any given graduate student might be enrolled in business administration. Since business programs are quite popular, let’s estimate \( P(H) = 0.20 \) (20%).

- **\( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is in business administration. Given Adam’s specific love for animals and nature, this seems less likely, let’s say \( 0.20 \).

- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of observing Adam’s traits if he is **not** in business administration. Given how specific Adam's traits are to the natural sciences, let's estimate \( 0.60 \).

Now, let’s plug them into Bayes’ Rule:

### Calculation:

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.85 \cdot 0.10 = 0.085 \]

#### Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.20 \cdot 0.20 = 0.04 \]

Given the proportional values, we can normalize these values, but they clearly show the relative likelihood.

Therefore, our answers are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.085,
  "business administration": 0.04
}
