To calculate the probabilities, we need to consider the following:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field given the personality sketch \( E \), which we calculate using Bayes' Rule.

Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) can be derived from the total probabilities across all fields, it's not directly necessary for the comparison between two fields, as it's a constant normalizing factor.

Now, let's analyze the fields:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: The prior probability considering it is one of many possible fields is low but not negligible, say 0.1.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability that the observed sketch \( E \) fits someone in agricultural and veterinary science is very high, given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals. Let’s use 0.9.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Considering that Adam might fit into many other fields which involves high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts, this probability should be lower but not extremely small, say 0.2.

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: The prior probability considering it is one of many possible fields, tying into common graduate studies, is moderate, say 0.2.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability that the observed sketch \( E \) fits someone in business administration is relatively low because the personality aspects described do not directly align with typical traits for business administration. Let's use 0.3.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: This should be higher compared to the specific fit for business, given the broader personality spectrum. Let’s use 0.4.

Calculating the values through Bayes’ Rule relative comparison:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) \propto 0.9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.09 \]

### Business Administration:
\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) \propto 0.3 \cdot 0.2 = 0.06 \]

Normalizing to a total of 1 means we'll use relative values:
\[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) \approx \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.06} = \frac{0.09}{0.15} = 0.6 \]
\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) \approx \frac{0.06}{0.09 + 0.06} = \frac{0.06}{0.15} = 0.4 \]

As the field isn't inclusive of total sums to 1 (you may have other fields), retain direct proportional:
- \( P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) = 0.09 \)
- \( P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = 0.06 \)

So, the answer would be:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.09,
  "business administration": 0.06
}
