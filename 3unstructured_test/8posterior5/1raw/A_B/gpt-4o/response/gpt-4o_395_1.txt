To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to determine the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given Adam's personality sketch.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the personality sketch occurring, which can be computed as \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Firstly, let's evaluate the probabilities for both fields:

1. **Business Administration**
   - \( P(H) \) (prior): Generally, this is not high for someone with Adam’s personality traits, which are more aligned with the sciences and nature.
   - \( P(E|H) \) (likelihood): Adam's personality sketch is not strongly aligned with typical traits associated with Business Administration students.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Based on general population traits across other fields, this might be higher than \( P(E|H) \).
   
   We assume:
   - \( P(H) = 0.1 \)
   - \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \)
   
   Calculate \( P(E) \):
   
   \[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.5 \cdot 0.9) = 0.02 + 0.45 = 0.47 \]
   
   Then,
   
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.47} \approx 0.0426 \]
   
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - \( P(H) \) (prior): Higher likelihood given Adam’s interests in nature, plants, and animals.
   - \( P(E|H) \) (likelihood): Very high considering the personality traits described.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Lower compared to \( P(E|H) \).

   We assume:
   - \( P(H) = 0.2 \)
   - \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \)

   Calculate \( P(E) \):

   \[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) = 0.16 + 0.24 = 0.4 \]

   Then,

   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{0.4} = 0.4 \]

Based on the above calculations, we get:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0426,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4
}
```
