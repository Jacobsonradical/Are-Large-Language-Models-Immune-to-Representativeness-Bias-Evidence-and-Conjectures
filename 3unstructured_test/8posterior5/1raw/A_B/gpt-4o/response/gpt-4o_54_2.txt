To estimate the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the respective fields using Bayes' rule, we must evaluate the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \), as well as the prior probabilities \( P(H) \).

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Generally, students enrolled in business administration may not typically exhibit a high degree of curiosity about nature, empathy towards animals, or interest in solving puzzles â€“ attributes that are more aligned with fields involving nature and life sciences.
   - \( P(H) \) (the prior probability of Adam being in Business Administration) \( \approx 0.1 \) (assuming a lower prior based on the personality traits).
   - \( P(E|H) \) (the probability of observing the personality traits given he is in Business Administration) \( \approx 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \) (the probability of observing the personality traits given he is not in Business Administration) \( \approx 0.9 \).

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - This field closely aligns with Adam's personality traits such as curiosity about nature, empathy towards animals, and appreciation for hard work.
   - \( P(H) \) (the prior probability of Adam being in Agricultural and Veterinary Science) \( \approx 0.2 \) (assuming a higher prior based on personality traits).
   - \( P(E|H) \) (the probability of observing the personality traits given he is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science) \( \approx 0.8 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \) (the probability of observing the personality traits given he is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science) \( \approx 0.2 \).

Now applying Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) * P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be approximated as the total probability of observing such personality traits across all fields (including others not listed).

### Calculations:

1. For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.1 * 0.1}{0.1 * 0.1 + 0.9 * 0.9} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.81} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} \approx 0.012 \]

2. For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E)_{AVS} = \frac{0.8 * 0.2}{0.8 * 0.2 + 0.2 * 0.8} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{AVS} = \frac{0.16}{0.16 + 0.16} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{AVS} = \frac{0.16}{0.32} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{AVS} \approx 0.5 \]
