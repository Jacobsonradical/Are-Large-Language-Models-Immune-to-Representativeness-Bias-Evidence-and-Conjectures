To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to start by estimating the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood under the null hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H) \). Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

We can represent \( P(E|H) \), \( P(E|\neg H) \), and \( P(H) \) approximately, as the precise values are not provided. Let's consider:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was in each field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch given Adam was in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch given Adam was not in that field.

For our purposes, let's assume these approximate values based on the personality sketch provided:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H_{BA}) \): Let's say 0.2 (20% prior, roughly approximating common graduate enrollments).
   - \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): 0.1 (A business administration student may not strongly align with the described sketch).
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \): 0.9 (A non-business administration student is more likely to fit this profile).

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H_{AVS}) \): Let's say 0.1 (10% prior, roughly calculated based on common enrollments).
   - \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \): 0.8 (The personality sketch closely matches traits of students in this field).
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \): 0.3 (Others relatively less likely to exhibit these traits comprehensively).

Computations:

1. **Business Administration**:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{BA})P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA})P(\neg H_{BA}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.9 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.72 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.74 \]

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.74} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx \frac{0.02}{0.74} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx 0.027 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{AVS})P(H_{AVS}) + P(E|\neg H_{AVS})P(\neg H_{AVS}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.27 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.35 \]

\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.35} \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \approx \frac{0.08}{0.35} \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \approx 0.229 \]

So, the posterior probabilities can be approximated as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.027,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.229
}
```

This calculation assumes base rates and likelihoods as rough approximations; in a real-world scenario, more accurate data would refine these numbers.
