To solve this problem using Bayes' rule, we need to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field (i.e., the probability that Adam was enrolled in that field given his personality sketch). Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to estimate the following terms for each field:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch, given that he was enrolled in the given field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch, given that he was not enrolled in the given field.

The marginal probability of \(E\), \(P(E)\), can be broken down as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

Now, let's assume and estimate the terms:

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \) (prior for business administration): A rough estimate could be around 0.05, as fewer students in business programs might fit Adam's profile.
- \( P(E|H) \) (likelihood given business administration): Considering Adam's personality sketch, it seems less likely for a typical business administration student. I'll estimate it at 0.05.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) (likelihood given not in business administration): This would be higher, perhaps around 0.15, as his personality fits better with other fields closer to nature and animals. 

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \) (prior for agricultural and veterinary science): Let's estimate it at 0.02, as this field might naturally attract individuals like Adam.
- \( P(E|H) \) (likelihood given agricultural and veterinary science): This seems to be quite high, around 0.8, considering his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) (likelihood given not in agricultural and veterinary science): This would be lower, around 0.2, as other fields might not align as closely with Adamâ€™s profile.

Now we calculate:

### Business Administration

\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.05 * 0.05) + (0.15 * 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.0025 + 0.1425 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.145 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 * 0.05}{0.145} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.0025}{0.145} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0172 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 * 0.02) + (0.2 * 0.98) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.016 + 0.196 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.212 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 * 0.02}{0.212} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.016}{0.212} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0755 \]

Formatting the results as requested:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0172,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.0755
}
```

These are the posterior probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the specified fields given his personality sketch.
