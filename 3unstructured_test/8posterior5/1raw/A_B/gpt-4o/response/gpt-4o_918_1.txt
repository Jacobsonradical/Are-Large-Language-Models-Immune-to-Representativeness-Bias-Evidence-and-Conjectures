Sure, to compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule for the given hypotheses, let's break down the process step by step.

1. **Determine \( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in each of the fields.
2. **Determine \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that the hypothesis \( H \) is true.
3. **Determine \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that the hypothesis \( H \) is not true.
4. **Compute \( P(H|E) \)**: The posterior probability using Bayes' rule: 

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence, computed as follows:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

Approximate the values as follows:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS)**:
    - \( P(H) \): Let's assume a relatively small prior probability for a graduate field. Say, \( P(H) = 0.05 \).
    - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's interest in nature and animals, if he were in AVS, it's highly consistent with the evidence. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): For other fields, Adam's characteristics might not fit as well. Letâ€™s assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

2. **Business Administration (BA)**:
    - \( P(H) \): A prior that is more common but not necessarily fitting Adam's personality sketch. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
    - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's characteristics do not align as well with business administration. Say \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Other fields might not fit as well either, assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Now, compute:

**For AVS:**

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

\[
= (0.8 \times 0.05) + (0.2 \times 0.95) = 0.04 + 0.19 = 0.23
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.23} = \frac{0.04}{0.23} \approx 0.174
\]

**For BA:**

\[
P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.1) + (0.3 \times 0.9) = 0.01 + 0.27 = 0.28
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.28} = \frac{0.01}{0.28} \approx 0.036
\]

So, the probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.174,
  "business administration": 0.036
}
