Let's start by estimating the required probabilities for each field based on the given personality sketch and applying Bayes' rule. For reference, Bayes' rule for calculating \(P(H|E)\) is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \(P(E)\) can be derived from:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For simplification, we'll assume \( P(H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \) have standard base rates or are intuitive guesses, as we don't have precise data.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
1. **P(H)**: The probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science, which we'll estimate generously as 0.05 (5%).
2. **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's personality sketch with a love for animals, plants, and nature, this probability is high. Let's estimate it at 0.9.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Given that other fields might share some of these traits but less specifically to his interests in nature and animals, let's say this is 0.1.

### Business Administration:
1. **P(H)**: The probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is in business administration, estimated as 0.1 (10%).
2. **P(E|H)**: The personality sketch doesn't strongly fit the common traits for a business administration student, thus let's estimate it at 0.05.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Non-business administration students could more plausibly share these traits. We'll estimate this as 0.8.

Now, let's compute the posterior probabilities using these estimates.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
1. **P(E)**
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.05) + (0.1 \cdot 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.045 + 0.095 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.14 \]

2. **P(H|E)**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.14} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.14} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.321 \]

### Business Administration:
1. **P(E)**
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.05 \cdot 0.1) + (0.8 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.005 + 0.72 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.725 \]

2. **P(H|E)**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{0.725} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.725} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0069 \]

So the final result using our estimates is:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.321,
  "business administration": 0.0069
}
```
