To calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate the following components:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was not enrolled in that field.

Given E's elements and the characteristics aligned to Adam’s personality, let's make some educated estimations:

For Business Administration:
- \( P(H) \): Let's assume a baseline probability of 0.1 (since it is one of many possible fields).
- \( P(E|H) \): Usually, business administration doesn't particularly align with an interest in nature, plants, animals, or puzzles. Hence, we might estimate this at 0.05.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given the variety of other fields better aligning with Adam’s interests, let's calculate it at 0.2.

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- \( P(H) \): This field matches very well with Adam's interests in nature, plants, and animals. Let's assign a higher baseline probability of 0.3.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam’s personality traits if he was enrolled in this field seems high, estimated at 0.8.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Conversely, other fields not explaining these traits would make this probability low. Let’s estimate it at 0.05.

Using Bayes' rule, the posterior probability is calculated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) * P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For each field, we need to estimate \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|\neg H) * P(\neg H) \]
- For simplicity, \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) \).

Let's calculate for both fields:

### Business Administration
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.05 * 0.1}{(0.05 * 0.1) + (0.2 * 0.9)} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.18} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.185} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx 0.027 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.8 * 0.3}{(0.8 * 0.3) + (0.05 * 0.7)} \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.24}{0.24 + 0.035} \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.24}{0.275} \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \approx 0.873 \]

Based on these calculations, the results are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.027,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.873
}
