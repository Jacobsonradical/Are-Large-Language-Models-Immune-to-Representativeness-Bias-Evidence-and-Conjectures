To compute \( P(H|E) \) for both fields (agricultural and veterinary science, and business administration), we need to use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of Adam's personality sketch, which can be calculated as \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).
  
Since we're comparing two fields, we don't need to compute the exact value of \( P(E) \). Instead, we can compare the values of \( P(H|E) \) relative to each other.

Let's assign some values based on the given personality sketch:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication, this seems relatively likely. Let's assign \( P(H) = 0.2 \) (since there are many possible fields of study, we need to keep this moderate).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he was in this field, which seems high due to his interests and traits aligning well. Let's assign \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he was not in this field. Given his personality, it's less likely but not impossible. Let's assign \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

2. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Based on his interests and traits, this is less likely. Let's assign \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he was in this field, which seems low. Let's assign \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he was not in this field, which might still be reasonably typical for people not in business administration. Let's assign \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.8 \).

Now, using Bayes' rule for both fields:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \\
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \\
P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.2 = 0.16 
\]

2. **Business Administration:**

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \\
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \\
P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.1 = 0.01 
\]

Thus, comparing the proportional results:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.16,
  "business administration": 0.01
}
```

Given the high relative likelihood for "agricultural and veterinary science" vs. "business administration," it's much more probable that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science based on the given personality sketch.
