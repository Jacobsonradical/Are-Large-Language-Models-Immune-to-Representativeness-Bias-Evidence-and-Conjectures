To compute the probabilities, we need to use Bayes' rule, which is stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch.

For simplicity, I'll assume the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) are the same for both fields (though in reality they might not be). Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \) for both fields as a rough approximation since there are many possible fields.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(E|H) \): Adam's personality traits align well with this field. He has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and empathy. These traits would be highly relevant.
  - Let's approximate \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Assuming there are many fields and thus a variety of personalities, the probability of Adam having this set of traits if he were in another field besides agricultural and veterinary science might be lower.
  - Let's approximate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

### Business Administration
- \( P(E|H) \): While Adam's problem-solving skills and high intelligence might be relevant, his other traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy) are less directly aligned with business administration.
  - Let's approximate \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Similar reasoning as before but considering fields outside business administration, where empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature are less common.
  - Let's approximate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

Now, let's compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule:
- The marginal probability \( P(E) \) can be computed by the law of total probability:
  \[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For simplicity, assume \( P(\neg H) = 0.9 \) for both fields (since \( P(H) = 0.1 \)).

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
  - \( P(E) = 0.7 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9 = 0.07 + 0.18 = 0.25 \)
  - \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.25} = 0.28 \)

2. **Business Administration:**
  - \( P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.5 \cdot 0.9 = 0.02 + 0.45 = 0.47 \)
  - \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.47} \approx 0.04 \)

Putting this all together:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.28,
  "business administration": 0.04
}
```

These numbers suggest that, given Adam's personality sketch, it is more likely that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than business administration in 2021.
