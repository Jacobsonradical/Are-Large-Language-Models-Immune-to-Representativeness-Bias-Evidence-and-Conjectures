Sure, let's break it down using Bayes' Rule. We need to estimate the probabilities based on the provided personality sketch and typical characteristics needed for different fields.

Assumptions:
1. P(H) = Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the field.
2. P(E|H) = Probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is in that field.
3. P(E|\neg H) = Probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is not in that field.
4. P(H|E) = Posterior probability of Adam being in the field given the evidence.

Let's assume some reasonable values based on the provided personality sketch:

For "business administration":
- P(H) is relatively low because the personality traits don't strongly align.
  - Let's say P(H) = 0.1.
- P(E|H): The probability that Adam has these traits given that he is in business administration:
  - Let's estimate P(E|H) = 0.2, as some traits could align (high intelligence, appreciation for hard work), but overall it's not a strong match.
- P(E|\neg H) represents the traits not aligning with business administration:
  - Let's estimate P(E|\neg H) = 0.8, as the traits are more likely to align with other fields.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) * P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be approximated by the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|\neg H) * P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.2 * 0.1 + 0.8 * 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.72 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.74 \]

Thus,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 * 0.1}{0.74} = \frac{0.02}{0.74} \approx 0.027 \]

For "agricultural and veterinary science":
- P(H) is relatively high since the personality traits strongly align.
  - Let's say P(H) = 0.4.
- P(E|H): The evidence aligns well with this field.
  - Let's estimate P(E|H) = 0.9.
- P(E|\neg H): The probability of having these traits but not being in this field.
  - Let's estimate P(E|\neg H) = 0.5.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) * P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be approximated by the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|\neg H) * P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.9 * 0.4 + 0.5 * 0.6 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.36 + 0.3 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.66 \]

Thus,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 * 0.4}{0.66} = \frac{0.36}{0.66} \approx 0.545 \]

So the computed posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.027,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.545
}
```
