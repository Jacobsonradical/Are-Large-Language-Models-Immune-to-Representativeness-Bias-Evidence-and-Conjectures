To calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihoods under the negation \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Let's begin by defining and estimating these probabilities:

1. **P(H)**: Prior probability that Adam is in the field of study.
2. **P(E|H)**: Likelihood that Adam's personality sketch fits, given he is in the field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Likelihood that Adam's personality sketch fits, given he is not in the field.
4. **P(H|E)**: Posterior probability that Adam is in the field, given his personality sketch.

### Business Administration

- **P(H)**: Business Administration is a common field, but not particularly aligned with Adam's interests in nature and animals. Let's assume a broad moderate prior of 0.2.
- **P(E|H)**: Adam's personality sketch is less strongly aligned with typical interests in business administration. Let's assume a lower likelihood, say 0.1.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: This is challenging but typically broader since there are many other fields of study. Let's assume a moderate value of 0.5.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's approximate \( P(E) \) as:
\[ P(E) \approx 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.8 = 0.02 + 0.4 = 0.42 \]

So,
\[ P(H|E)_{business} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.42} \approx 0.0476 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)**: This field strongly aligns with Adam's interests in nature and animals. Let's set a high prior of 0.4.
- **P(E|H)**: His personality sketch fits very well with this field. Assume a high likelihood of 0.8.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of his personality fitting non-related fields remain the same at 0.5.

Calculating \( P(E) \) again:
\[ P(E) \approx 0.8 \cdot 0.4 + 0.5 \cdot 0.6 = 0.32 + 0.3 = 0.62 \]

So,
\[ P(H|E)_{agricultural} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.4}{0.62} \approx 0.516 \]

Combining these, we get:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0476,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.516
}
```

This illustrates that based on the personality sketch and using Bayes' rule, Adam is much more likely to be enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science than in Business Administration.
