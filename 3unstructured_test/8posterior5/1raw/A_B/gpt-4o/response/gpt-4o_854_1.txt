To calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we'll follow these steps:

1. Assign \( P(H) \), the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field without any additional information.
2. Estimate \( P(E|H) \), the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in a particular field.
3. Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \), the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in that particular field.
4. Use Bayes' rule to calculate \( P(H|E) \), the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field given his personality sketch.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

However, we do not need to explicitly calculate \( P(E) \) when comparing the probabilities, as it is a common factor for both hypotheses and will cancel out during normalization.

### Assign Values:
- Let \( P(H_{BA}) \) and \( P(H_{AVS}) \) represent the prior probability for business administration and agricultural and veterinary science, respectively. We will assume a low prior for specialized fields compared to more general fields, but we do not need exact numbers.

- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \) and \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \):
  - For business administration, the likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) fitting could be low because the interest in nature, empathy, and animals does not align well with the typical interests of business students.
  - For agricultural and veterinary science, the likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) fitting is high because interests in nature, plants, and animals are directly related to the field.

- \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \) and \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \):
  - These probabilities can be considered the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch in fields other than the specified ones.

### Reasonable estimates:
- \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(H_{AVS}) = 0.1 \)
  
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H_{AVS}) = 0.9 \)
  
- \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) = 0.3 \)

### Calculations:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \)
   - \( P(E) = P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \cdot P(\neg H_{BA}) \)
   - \( P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.8 \)
   - \( P(E) = 0.02 + 0.4 = 0.42 \)
   - \( P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.42} = \frac{0.02}{0.42} \approx 0.048 \)

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - \( P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)} \)
    - \( P(E) = P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) + P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \cdot P(\neg H_{AVS}) \)
    - \( P(E) = 0.9 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9 \)
    - \( P(E) = 0.09 + 0.27 = 0.36 \)
    - \( P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{0.36} = \frac{0.09}{0.36} = 0.25 \)

### Results:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.048,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.25
}
```

These values indicate that based on the given personality sketch, Adam is much more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration.
