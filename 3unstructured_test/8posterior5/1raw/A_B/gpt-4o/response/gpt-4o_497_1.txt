To use Bayes' rule to determine \( P(H|E) \), the probability Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch, we need to consider the following:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in a specific field.
3. **Marginal Likelihood \( P(E) \)**: The overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch, which can be computed as \( P(E) = P(E|H)*P(H) + P(E|\neg H)*P(\neg H) \).
4. **Posterior Probability \( P(H|E) \)**: The updated probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch, computed using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

### Business Administration

- \( P(H) \): Let's assume a typical distribution where business administration is a less likely field for someone with Adam's strong interest in nature and empathy, so let's estimate \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Business administration is less likely to correlate highly with his personality sketch, particularly given his love for animals and nature, so let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): This is the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in business administration. Given that he has attributes more aligned with other fields (like agricultural or veterinary sciences), let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

Therefore,

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|\neg H) * P(\neg H) = (0.1 * 0.2) + (0.5 * 0.8) = 0.02 + 0.4 = 0.42 \]

Applying Bayes' rule,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 * 0.2}{0.42} \approx 0.048 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- \( P(H) \): Given Adam's personality, let's assume this is a more likely field, so let's estimate \( P(H) = 0.4 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): This field highly correlates with his interest in nature, animals, and empathy, so let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in agricultural and veterinary science, let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Therefore,

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|\neg H) * P(\neg H) = (0.7 * 0.4) + (0.3 * 0.6) = 0.28 + 0.18 = 0.46 \]

Applying Bayes' rule,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 * 0.4}{0.46} \approx 0.609 \]
