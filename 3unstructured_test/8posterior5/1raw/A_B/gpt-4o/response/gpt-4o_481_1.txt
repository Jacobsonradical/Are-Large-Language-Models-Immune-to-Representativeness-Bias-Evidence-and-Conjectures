Let's begin by analyzing the probabilities. 

For each field:

1. **Business Administration**
   - P(H): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration. This probability depends on general statistics, but let's assume for simplicity and without specific statistics that P(H) is 0.1 (10%).
   - P(E|H): The likelihood of E given that Adam is studying Business Administration. Considering the personality sketch and interests in nature, animals, and abstract concepts, these traits are not typically associated with Business Administration. Let's set P(E|H) relatively low, at 0.1.
   - P(E|¬H): The likelihood of E given that Adam is not studying Business Administration. Considering Adam's interests align more with other fields, P(E|¬H) might be higher. Again, for simplicity, let's assume P(E|¬H) is 0.5.

   Applying Bayes' Rule:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H)}
   = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{(0.1 \cdot 0.1) + (0.5 \cdot 0.9)}
   = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.45}
   = \frac{0.01}{0.46}
   \approx 0.0217
   \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - P(H): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Considering such programs might be less common than business administration programs, we assign P(H) = 0.05 (5%).
   - P(E|H): The likelihood of E given that Adam is studying Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given his love for nature, plants, and animals, P(E|H) should be much higher. Let's set P(E|H) at 0.9.
   - P(E|¬H): The likelihood of E given that Adam is not studying Agricultural and Veterinary Science. This probability wouldn't be as high because Adam's traits strongly align with Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Let's take P(E|¬H) = 0.3.

   Applying Bayes' Rule:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H)}
   = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{(0.9 \cdot 0.05) + (0.3 \cdot 0.95)}
   = \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.285}
   = \frac{0.045}{0.33}
   \approx 0.1364
   \]

So, the computed probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0217,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.1364
}
```

These probabilities indicate that, based on Adam's personality sketch, he is more likely to be enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science than in Business Administration.
