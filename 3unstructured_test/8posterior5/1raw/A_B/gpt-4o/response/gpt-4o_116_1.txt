To estimate the probabilities, I'm going to make educated guesses based on Adam's personality sketch:

1. **P(H_agricultural):** This is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science without knowing anything else about him. Since agricultural and veterinary science is a fairly specialized field and competitive to get into, I’ll assign a moderate value of 0.1 (10%).

2. **P(H_business):** This is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration. Business administration is a popular field with many enrollments, so I will assign a higher prior probability of 0.2 (20%).

3. **P(E|H_agricultural):** This is the probability of observing E (Adam's personality sketch) given that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's love for nature, animals, and strong empathy, this is highly likely. I would rate this probability as 0.8 (80%).

4. **P(E|H_business):** This is the probability of observing E given that Adam is in business administration. Considering that the business field does not inherently connect well with his personality traits (especially love for nature and animals), I’ll assign a lower probability, say 0.2 (20%).

5. **P(E|¬H):** This is the probability of observing E given that Adam is not in either of these fields. Given that there are many other fields that may or may not align with his traits (biology, environmental science, etc.), I will assign a moderate probability of 0.3 (30%).

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

where \( P(\neg H) \) represents the probability of Adam enrolling in fields other than H.

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
1. **P(H_agricultural|E):**

\[ P(H_agricultural|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.27} = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \approx 0.229 \]

### For Business Administration:
2. **P(H_business|E):**

\[ P(H_business|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.2 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.24} = \frac{0.04}{0.28} \approx 0.143 \]

### Final values:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.229,
  "business administration": 0.143
}
