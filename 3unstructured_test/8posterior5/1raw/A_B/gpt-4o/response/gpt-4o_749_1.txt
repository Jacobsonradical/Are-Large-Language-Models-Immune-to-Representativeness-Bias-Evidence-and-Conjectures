To calculate the conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to start with our assessments of:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he were enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he were not enrolled in that field.

Given the personality sketch, there are qualitative aspects that seem more consistent with certain fields. Let's break this down:

### Assessment of Probabilities

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - \( P(H) \): The proportion of all graduate students in agricultural and veterinary science.
     - Let's assume it's moderate but not exceedingly common. We'll assign \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits among students in this field.
     - Given Adam's curiosity about nature, animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work, this likelihood seems relatively high. Let's say \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits among students not in this field.
     - This is harder to estimate, but given the specific nature-related interests, it might be lower. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

2. **Business Administration**
   - \( P(H) \): The proportion of students in business administration.
     - Business administration programs are very common. Let's assign \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits among business administration students.
     - Given Adam's nature-oriented and empathetic traits, this might be lower. Let's say \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likelihood of observing Adam’s personality among students not in this field.
     - Given Adam's personality sketch, it is reasonable to assume that the likelihood would be somewhat more common outside business fields. Let's say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \).

### Applying Bayes’ Rule

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the normalizing constant:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

#### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) = 0.08 + 0.18 = 0.26 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{agricultural\_and\_veterinary\_science} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.26} \approx 0.3077 \]

#### For Business Administration

\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.2) + (0.6 \cdot 0.8) = 0.04 + 0.48 = 0.52 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{business\_administration} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.52} \approx 0.0769 \]

### Final Result

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3077,
  "business administration": 0.0769
