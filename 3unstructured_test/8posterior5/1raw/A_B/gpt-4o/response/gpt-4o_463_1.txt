To apply Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the probabilities P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|¬H) for each field (business administration and agricultural and veterinary science) and then compute the posterior probabilities P(H|E).

**Bayes' Rule:** 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we are only interested in comparing the probabilities between the two fields, we can use a simplified form of Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Let's denote:
- H_b as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- H_a as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

### Evaluations:

#### Business Administration:
1. **P(H_b)**: The prior probability that a graduate student is in business administration. Given the general distribution of graduate students across fields, this might be fairly common, but not exceptionally high.
   - Estimate: \( P(H_b) \approx 0.2 \)

2. **P(E|H_b)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he were in business administration. Given the traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, warm heart, etc.), these traits do not strongly align with typical traits of students in this field.
   - Estimate: \( P(E|H_b) \approx 0.1 \)

3. **P(E|¬H_b)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he were not in business administration. Since these traits are more common in other fields, particularly those related to nature and animals:
   - Estimate: \( P(E|¬H_b) \approx 0.4 \)

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
1. **P(H_a)**: The prior probability that a graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. This field might be less common than business administration.
   - Estimate: \( P(H_a) \approx 0.1 \)

2. **P(E|H_a)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he were in agricultural and veterinary science. Given that his traits strongly align with this field's typical interests and values:
   - Estimate: \( P(E|H_a) \approx 0.7 \)

3. **P(E|¬H_a)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he were not in agricultural and veterinary science. This would be similar to the general population of non-agricultural/veterinary students.
   - Estimate: \( P(E|¬H_a) \approx 0.2 \)

### Calculations:
Using a proportional approach for simplicity:

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H_b | E) \propto P(E | H_b) \cdot P(H_b) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_a | E) \propto P(E | H_a) \cdot P(H_a) = 0.7 \cdot 0.1 = 0.07 \]

To normalize these (though not required here, comparing proportions is sufficient):

Sum of proportions = 0.02 + 0.07 = 0.09

Normalized values:
- Business Administration: \( \frac{0.02}{0.09} \approx 0.22 \)
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( \frac{0.07}{0.09} \approx 0.78 \)

Given these calculations, the final answers are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.22,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.78
}
