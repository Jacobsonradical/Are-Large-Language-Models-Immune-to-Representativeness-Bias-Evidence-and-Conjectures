To compute the probability \(P(H|E)\) for both "agricultural and veterinary science" and "business administration," we need to follow Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since calculating \(P(E)\) (the total probability of E) directly is complex without additional data, we will assume it's a normalizing constant that ensures the probabilities sum to 1 when combined with other potential fields.

Firstly, we need to set our priors and likelihoods. Based on the provided personality sketch, we're justified in making some qualitative assessments:

**1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- **Prior \(P(H)\)**: Let's assume it's reasonably likely for a graduate student to be in any field; hence prior could be around 0.1 (assuming a simplified model with many fields).
- **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: Given Adam’s love for nature, animals, and appreciation for hard work, his traits fit well with this field. Therefore, we assign a high value, around 0.8.
- **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)**: Considering the general population of graduate students, the blend of Adam's traits is less common; let's set this lower at around 0.2.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

**2. Business Administration:**
- **Prior \(P(H)\)**: Considering a similar prior likelihood, assume it's 0.1.
- **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: Adam's traits don’t perfectly align with a typical business administration profile, so we assign a lower value, like 0.2.
- **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)**: This remains 0.2 as before since personality traits are common across different fields.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac(0.2 \cdot 0.1)}{P(E)} \]

Now let's evaluate them comparatively:

- For agricultural and veterinary science:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

- For business administration:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

Since \(P(E)\) is the same for both:

- **P(H|E) for agricultural and veterinary science** is comparatively higher due to stronger alignment with Adam's personality traits than for business administration.

Given these assumptions, it seems logical to conclude that:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

These values illustrate the relative probability estimates based on Adam’s personality sketch.
