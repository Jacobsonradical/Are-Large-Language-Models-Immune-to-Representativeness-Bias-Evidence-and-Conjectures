Sure, let's denote:
- H1 as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- H2 as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

We'll calculate P(H1|E) and P(H2|E) using Bayes' Rule, which is defined as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

First, let's set up our initial probabilities (priors) and the likelihoods and marginal likelihoods (denominators).

For Business Administration:
- \( P(H1) \): Let's assume 5% (0.05) since Business Administration is a popular field but less likely for someone with Adam's personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H1) \): Since Adam's personality sketch (E) doesn't align perfectly with Business Administration, let's assign a low value, say 0.1.
- \( P(E|\neg H1) \): Suppose E's probability without considering H1 is higher, maybe about 0.9, since many fields could correspond to his personality but not necessarily Business Administration.

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- \( P(H2) \): Let's assume 10% (0.10) since this field is more aligned with Adam's interests and empathy for nature and animals.
- \( P(E|H2) \): Since Adam's personality sketch fits very well with this field, let's assign a high value, say 0.9.
- \( P(E|\neg H2) \): Suppose E's probability without considering H2 is lower, maybe about 0.2, since fewer fields fit his personality well.

Now use Bayes' Rule to calculate P(H|E):

1. For Business Administration:
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1)}{P(E)} \]
Assuming \( P(E) \) as the total probability involving all hypotheses,
\[ P(E) = P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1) + P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2) + P(E|\neg H1) \cdot P(\neg H1) \]

Since there are many other fields and we already know \( P(H1) \) and \( P(H2) \), we can simplify denominations for our specific double-check calculation and adjust standardizing the sum to be logical.

2. For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2)}{P(E)} \]

Now plugging in the numbers:

\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.05}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \]

To normalize:
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.05) + (0.9 \cdot 0.10) + \text{other terms allowing denial denominator fits relevant fields} \]

For simplification and relative values typically,
\[ P(H1|E) \approx \frac{0.005}{Section} \]
\[ P(H2|E) \approx \frac{0.09}{Overall divisor adjusting segment}\]

Substantially P(H2|E) appears prominently compared thus making:

{
  "business administration": 0.05,  // Adjust indicating low relativeness broadly
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8 // Dominant value as vividly fitting aligning descriptively.
