Given the description of Adam's personality and interests, we'll need to make reasonable estimations for the probabilities, keeping in mind that these are not exact figures but educated guesses based on the information provided.

Let's denote the different probabilities as follows:
- \( P(H_1) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(H_2) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|H_1) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H_2) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|\neg H_1) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H_2) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was not enrolled in business administration.

### Estimations:

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- \( P(H_1) \): Let's assume a prior probability of 10% (0.10) for this field, as it's a fairly specialized field.
- \( P(E|H_1) \): Given Adam's interest in nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, a high probability, let's say 90% (0.90).
- \( P(E|\neg H_1) \): For fields other than agricultural and veterinary science, the probability might be generally lower, say around 30% (0.30).

**Business Administration:**
- \( P(H_2) \): Assume a prior probability of 20% (0.20) for this field, as it's a common field of study in graduate programs.
- \( P(E|H_2) \): Given the personality sketch, Adam's traits are less aligned with business administration; let's estimate 10% (0.10).
- \( P(E|\neg H_2) \): For fields other than business administration, the probability may be similar to 40% (0.40).

### Calculations using Bayes' Rule:
We use the formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
However, \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields, so we compare the numerators directly for comparative purposes.

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_1|E) \propto P(E|H_1)P(H_1) = 0.90 \times 0.10 = 0.09 \]

#### Business Administration:
\[ P(H_2|E) \propto P(E|H_2)P(H_2) = 0.10 \times 0.20 = 0.02 \]

### Normalization:
To get probabilities that add up to 1 for these two hypotheses,
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.02} = \frac{0.09}{0.11} \approx 0.818 \]
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.09 + 0.02} = \frac{0.02}{0.11} \approx 0.182 \]

### Final Result:
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.818",
  "business administration": "0.182"
}
