Sure, let's use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probabilities. Let's denote:

- \( P(H_{1}) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(H_{2}) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H_{1}) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was in business administration.
- \( P(E|H_{2}) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{1}) \): The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given he was not in business administration.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{2}) \): The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given he was not in agricultural and veterinary science.

For simplicity, let's make some reasonable assumptions for these values:

- \( P(H_{1}) = 0.2 \): We assume a 20% prior probability that a random student is in business administration.
- \( P(H_{2}) = 0.05 \): We assume a 5% prior probability that a random student is in agricultural and veterinary science.

Given the personality sketch:

- \( P(E|H_{1}) = 0.1 \): The personality sketch seems less consistent with business administration, given his interests and qualities.
- \( P(E|H_{2}) = 0.7 \): The personality sketch seems quite consistent with agricultural and veterinary science.

Next, the probability of observing the sketch not being in those fields can be estimated less precisely but assumed:

- \( P(E|\neg H_{1}) = 0.4 \): Moderately consistent with other fields.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{2}) = 0.2 \): Less likely without fitting agricultural and veterinary science well.

We use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Now, let's compute:

For business administration (\( H_{1} \)):

- \( P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.2) + (0.4 \times 0.8) = 0.02 + 0.32 = 0.34 \)
- \( P(H_{1}|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.34} \approx 0.0588 \)

For agricultural and veterinary science (\( H_{2} \)):

- \( P(E) = (0.7 \times 0.05) + (0.2 \times 0.95) = 0.035 + 0.19 = 0.225 \)
- \( P(H_{2}|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.05}{0.225} \approx 0.1556 \)

So, the results in the requested format would be:

{
  "business administration": 0.0588,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.1556
}
