To calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' theorem, we need to estimate the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \). Here's how we can approach each field based on the given personality sketch and the assumptions about the relevance of the field to Adam's interests and characteristics:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The proportion of graduate students enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to other fields.
   - Given that agricultural and veterinary science is not one of the most popular graduate fields, suppose \( P(H) \) = 0.05.
   
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's characteristics given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - His curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work aligns well with this field. Therefore, \( P(E|H) \) is high.
   - Suppose \( P(E|H) \) = 0.9.

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's characteristics given that he is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - His characteristics might be less likely to be found if he is not in this field but could still be present in others.
   - Suppose \( P(E|\neg H) \) = 0.2.

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The proportion of graduate students enrolled in business administration compared to other fields.
   - Business administration is a popular field, so the prior probability is higher.
   - Suppose \( P(H) \) = 0.3.
   
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's characteristics given that he is enrolled in business administration.
   - Business administration might not align well with his specific interests, though general qualities like intelligence and hard work are relevant.
   - Suppose \( P(E|H) \) = 0.3.

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's characteristics given that he is not enrolled in business administration.
   - If he is not in business administration, his characteristics might fit better in other fields like sciences.
   - Suppose \( P(E|\neg H) \) = 0.6.

Now, let's use Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

\[ P(E) = 0.9 \times 0.05 + 0.2 \times 0.95 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.045 + 0.19 = 0.235 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.05}{0.235} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.191 \]

### Business Administration

\[ P(E) = 0.3 \times 0.3 + 0.6 \times 0.7 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.09 + 0.42 = 0.51 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.3}{0.51} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.176 \]

Returning values in the specified format:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.191,
  "business administration": 0.176
