Sure, let's approach this step-by-step.

Firstly, let's define the following:
- P(H) = Probability that Adam was enrolled in the specified field.
- P(E|H) = Probability of the personality sketch E, given Adam was enrolled in the specified field.
- P(E|¬H) = Probability of the personality sketch E, given Adam was not enrolled in the specified field.
- P(H|E) = Probability that Adam was enrolled in the specified field, given the personality sketch E.

We will be using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Even though it’s not essential to compute \( P(E) \) explicitly, since we are comparing relative probabilities, we can assume \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields for simplicity.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
- **P(H)**: Graduate programs in agriculture and veterinary science are less common compared to business administration. However, given Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, let's assume a moderate base probability:
  \[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.10 \]

- **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's personality sketch, it aligns very closely with what one would expect from a student in agricultural and veterinary science:
  \[ P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.9 \]

- **P(E|¬H)**: Assuming the personality sketch E is not as strongly representative of students not in agricultural and veterinary science:
  \[ P(E|¬H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.2 \]

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) \approx \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.10}{P(E)} \]
Since \( P(E) \) is a common denominator, we compare the relative values without it:
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) \propto 0.09 \]

2. **Business Administration**:
- **P(H)**: Business administration programs are very common and have high enrollment rates:
  \[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.3 \]

- **P(E|H)**: Adam's personality sketch does not align well with typical characteristics for a business administration student:
  \[ P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.1 \]

- **P(E|¬H)**: Assuming the personality sketch is less common for business administration:
  \[ P(E|¬H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.3 \]

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.30}{P(E)} \]
Since \( P(E) \) is a common denominator, this simplifies to:
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) \propto 0.03 \]

Comparing & normalizing these proportional values:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.09 / (0.09 + 0.03) ≈ 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.03 / (0.09 + 0.03) ≈ 0.25
}

So the final values should be:
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.25
}
