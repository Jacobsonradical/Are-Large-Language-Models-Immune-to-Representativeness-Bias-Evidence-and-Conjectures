Given the information provided in the personality sketch of Adam, let's evaluate the probabilities:

1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- P(H) (prior probability for this field): This field seems more likely given Adam's interests and attributes. Let's assume a moderate prior probability, say 0.3 (30%).
- P(E|H) (probability of the personality sketch given this field): Given Adam’s genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, it is highly consistent with this field. Let's assume a high probability, say 0.9 (90%).
- P(E|\neg H) (probability of the personality sketch given NOT this field): Excluding fields unrelated to nature and animals, let's assume a lower probability, say 0.2 (20%).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]
For an approximation, we use P(E) assuming only these two fields keep the probabilities within a relative scope:
\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times (1 - P(H)) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.9 \times 0.3 + 0.2 \times 0.7 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.27 + 0.14 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.41 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.3}{0.41} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.27}{0.41} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.66 \]

2. Business Administration
- P(H) (prior probability for this field): This field seems less likely given Adam's interests and attributes. Let's assume a lower prior probability, say 0.1 (10%).
- P(E|H) (probability of the personality sketch given this field): Given Adam’s traits, this field is less consistent. Let's assume a lower probability, say 0.2 (20%).
- P(E|\neg H): Since we chose P(E|\neg H) as 0.2 for the earlier one, we slightly adjust to include this one.

Using the same Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times (1 - P(H)) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.2 \times 0.1 + 0.34 \times 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.02 + 0.306 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.326 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{0.326} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.326} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.06 \]

Therefore, the answers can be summarized as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.66",
  "business administration": "0.06"
}
