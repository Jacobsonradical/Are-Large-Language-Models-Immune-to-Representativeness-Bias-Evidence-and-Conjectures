To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' Rule, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's break this down for each field.

### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

#### P(H): Prior Probability
We need to judge the likelihood that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science based on generic data or assumptions. Given his love for plants and animals, it's reasonable to assign a higher prior probability to this hypothesis.

Let's assume:
\[ P(H_{\text{agri\_vet}}) = 0.3 \]

#### P(E|H): Likelihood
Given that Adam is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, how likely is his personality sketch? Very likely, because his interests align very well with this field.

Let's assume:
\[ P(E|H_{\text{agri\_vet}}) = 0.9 \]

#### P(E|\neg H): Likelihood under the negation
Given that Adam is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, how likely is his personality sketch? It is less likely than in the case that he is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, but still possible.

Let's assume:
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{agri\_vet}}) = 0.2 \]

### 2. Business Administration

#### P(H): Prior Probability
We need to judge the likelihood that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration. Given his personality sketch, this seems less likely.

Let's assume:
\[ P(H_{\text{business}}) = 0.1 \]

#### P(E|H): Likelihood
Given that Adam is in Business Administration, how likely is his personality sketch? This seems less likely because his interests do not align well with typical business administration traits.

Let's assume:
\[ P(E|H_{\text{business}}) = 0.2 \]

#### P(E|\neg H): Likelihood under the negation
Given that Adam is not in Business Administration, how likely is his personality sketch? More likely than in the Business Administration case.

Let's assume:
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}}) = 0.8 \]

### Calculations

#### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

First, we need to compute \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{agri\_vet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agri\_vet}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{agri\_vet}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{agri\_vet}}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.9 \cdot 0.3 + 0.2 \cdot 0.7 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.27 + 0.14 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.41 \]

Now, apply Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H_{\text{agri\_vet}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agri\_vet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agri\_vet}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agri\_vet}}|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.3}{0.41} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agri\_vet}}|E) \approx 0.659 \]

#### For Business Administration:

First, we need to compute \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{business}}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.8 \cdot 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.72 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.74 \]

Now, apply Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.74} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) \approx 0.027 \]
