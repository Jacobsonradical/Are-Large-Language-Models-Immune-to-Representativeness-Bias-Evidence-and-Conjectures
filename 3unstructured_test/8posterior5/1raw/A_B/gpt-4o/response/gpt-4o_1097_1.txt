To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which states that:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of evidence \( E \), which can be derived from \( P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \).

Note: Given the nature of the task, we will provide hypothetical values based on reasoning and proportional estimates.

### Business Administration

1. \( P(H) \): The probability that Adam is a business administration graduate student. Business administration is a common field, estimate \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \) (20%).
2. \( P(E|H) \): Probability of Adam's characteristics being aligned with a business student. Given the sketch, it's less likely (animals, nature, quiet personality doesn't fit most business profiles), so let's set \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \).
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of Adam's characteristics given he is not in business administration. Since agriculture or veterinary science align better, let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.9 \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{(0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.9 \cdot 0.8)} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.72} = \frac{0.02}{0.74} \approx 0.027 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. \( P(H) \): The probability that Adam is an agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. This field fits better given his traits, estimate \( P(H) \approx 0.05 \) (5%).
2. \( P(E|H) \): Probability of Adam's characteristics fitting this field. High likelihood given empathy, animals, and nature, let's estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \).
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of Adam's characteristics given he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his traits, this is lower, let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{(0.9 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95)} \approx \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.19} = \frac{0.045}{0.235} \approx 0.191 \]

Therefore, the probabilities are as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.027,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.191
}
