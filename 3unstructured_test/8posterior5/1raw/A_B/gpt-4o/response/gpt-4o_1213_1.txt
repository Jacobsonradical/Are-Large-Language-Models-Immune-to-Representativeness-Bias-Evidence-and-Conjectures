To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Here's the structure of the calculation:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where \( P(E) \) can be expanded to include all fields, but for simplicity, we are looking at the relative likelihoods.

### For "agricultural and veterinary science":

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that a random graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's estimate this to be relatively low due to the specialized nature of the field.
   \[
   P(H) = 0.05
   \]

2. **P(E|H)**: Given that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science, how likely is his personality sketch. Since he has a deep love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work, this fits well.
   \[
   P(E|H) = 0.9
   \]

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Given that Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science, how likely is his personality sketch. His traits could fit into several fields, not just this one.
   \[
   P(E|\neg H) = 0.1
   \]

Using Bayes' rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.05}{P(E)}
\]

We simplify \( P(E) \) since it is a common factor across fields:
\[
P(E) = 0.9 \times 0.05 + P(E, other fields)
\]

but focusing on the relative scale:
\[
P(H|E) \propto 0.045
\]

### For "business administration":

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that a random graduate student is in business administration, which is a relatively common field.
   \[
   P(H) = 0.2
   \]

2. **P(E|H)**: Given that Adam is in business administration, how likely is his personality sketch? This seems less likely given his love for animals and nature.
   \[
   P(E|H) = 0.1
   \]

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Given that Adam is not in business administration, how likely is his personality sketch. This is relatively high given his characteristics.
   \[
   P(E|\neg H) = 0.8
   \]

Using Bayes' rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{P(E)}
\]

We simplify \( P(E) \):
\[
P(E) = 0.1 \times 0.2 + P(E, other fields)
\]

but focusing on the relative scale:
\[
P(H|E) \propto 0.02
\]

Putting it all together:

\[
\text{{{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.9",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}}
\]}
