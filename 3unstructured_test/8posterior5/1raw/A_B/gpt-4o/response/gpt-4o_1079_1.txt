To calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in "agricultural and veterinary science" and "business administration," we will use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to estimate the following:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was in a particular field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was not in a particular field (i.e., in any other field but the specified one).

Let's consider each field one by one.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**:
   - Let's assume the probability of a graduate student being in agricultural and veterinary science is about 0.05 (5%).

2. **P(E|H)**:
   - Given that Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, a love for animals, empathy, and an appreciation for hard work, it is highly likely that he fits well into this field. We'll assign a high probability of 0.8 (80%).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**:
   - For graduate students not in agricultural and veterinary science, the probability of matching Adam's personality sketch is likely lower. We can estimate this to be around 0.2 (20%).

Now, calculating the posterior:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To compute \( P(E) \), we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Where \( P(\neg H) = 0.95 \).

So,

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95) = 0.04 + 0.19 = 0.23 \]

Now,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.23} \approx 0.174 \]

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**:
   - Let's assume the probability of a graduate student being in business administration is about 0.15 (15%).

2. **P(E|H)**:
   - Given Adam's personality sketch, it is less likely he fits into business administration as his traits seem more aligned with nature and animals rather than business. We can estimate this probability to be around 0.1 (10%).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**:
   - For graduate students not in business administration, the probability of matching Adam's personality sketch is higher in fields related to nature and animals. We can estimate this to be around 0.3 (30%).

Now, calculating the posterior:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To compute \( P(E) \), we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Where \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \).

So,

\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.15) + (0.3 \cdot 0.85) = 0.015 + 0.255 = 0.27 \]

Now,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{0.27} \approx 0.056 \]

Therefore, the probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.174,
  "business administration": 0.056
