To use Bayes' Rule, we need the following components:

1. **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field.
2. **P(E|H):** The probability of the evidence (personality sketch) given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
3. **P(E|¬H):** The probability of the evidence given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.
4. **P(H|E):** The posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in the field given the evidence.

Assume for the purpose of this exercise, we use some hypothetical prior probabilities for P(H) since exact numerical data is not provided.

For simplicity, let's denote:

- P(H1) = Prior probability Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- P(H2) = Prior probability Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- P(E|H1) = Probability of Adam having the described personality traits if he was in business administration.
- P(E|H2) = Probability of Adam having the described personality traits if he was in agricultural and veterinary science.
- P(E|¬H1) = Probability of Adam having the described personality traits if he wasn't in business administration.
- P(E|¬H2) = Probability of Adam having the described personality traits if he wasn't in agricultural and veterinary science.

Given the personality traits provided, we make the following assumptions:

- Agricultural and veterinary science is more aligned with Adam's love for nature, plants, animals, and his strong empathy.
- Business administration may be less tightly aligned but is still a possibility considering analytical skills.

We can estimate as follows:

- **P(H1):** Let's assume 0.2 (since business administration is a common field but not necessarily the best fit for Adam's personality traits).
- **P(H2):** Let's assume 0.3 (since agricultural and veterinary science would seem a better fit).
- **P(E|H1):** Let's assume 0.1 (since the traits are somewhat less likely in this field).
- **P(E|H2):** Let's assume 0.5 (since the traits match well).

We also need:

- **P(E|¬H1):** Probability Adam has the traits if not in business administration. Let's assume 0.25.
- **P(E|¬H2):** Probability Adam has the traits if not in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume 0.2.

Using Bayes' Rule, we compute:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For business administration:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1) + P(E|\neg H1) \cdot P(\neg H1) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.25 \cdot 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.2 = 0.22 \]

\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.22} \approx 0.091 \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2) + P(E|\neg H2) \cdot P(\neg H2) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.5 \cdot 0.3 + 0.2 \cdot 0.7 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.15 + 0.14 = 0.29 \]

\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.3}{0.29} \approx 0.517 \]

So the probabilities are approximately:

{
  "business administration": 0.091,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.517
}
