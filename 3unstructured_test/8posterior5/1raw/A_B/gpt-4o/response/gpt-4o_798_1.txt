To compute the probability of Adam being enrolled in either agricultural and veterinary science or business administration based on his personality sketch using Bayes' Theorem, we need to consider the following probabilities:

1. **P(H)**: The base rate or prior probability of Adam being in a particular field. This typically depends on the overall distribution of students across different fields.

2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing the evidence (Adam's personality sketch) given that he is in the specific field.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of observing the evidence given that Adam is not in the specific field.

4. **P(H|E)**: The posterior probability, which we want to compute.

The calculations will be based on some reasonable assumptions:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: The base rate for Agricultural and Veterinary Science can be assumed moderate given the niche interest but with a decent number of students.
  
2. **P(E|H)**: Given Adam’s strong empathy, love for animals, and a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, the likelihood that he is in this field is high.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood that he shows these personality traits but is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science would be lower but not negligible because these traits can be applicable in other fields as well.

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: The base rate for Business Administration might be higher because it is a common graduate field.
  
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of the observed personality traits fitting a business administration student is lower since his traits fit more closely with fields focused on nature, animals, and empathy.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood that he shows these personality traits but is not in Business Administration is higher because it can apply more closely to other fields.

With these assumptions, here are the qualitative estimations:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: Moderate
- **P(E|H)**: High
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Lower

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: High
- **P(E|H)**: Lower
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Higher

Given these qualitative estimations, we can now assign some reasonable values for simplicity (these are just illustrative).

### Probabilities:
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 
  - P(H): 0.2
  - P(E|H): 0.8
  - P(E|\neg H): 0.3

- Business Administration:
  - P(H): 0.3
  - P(E|H): 0.2
  - P(E|\neg H): 0.4
  
Using Bayes' Theorem, \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \)

Let's assume the evidence (E) is equally likely in all fields for simplicity. 

### Calculations:
- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
  - P(E) can be assumed from both fields:
    - P(E) ≈ P(E|H_agri) * P(H_agri) + P(E|H_business) * P(H_business)
    - P(E) ≈ (0.8 * 0.2) + (0.2 * 0.3) = 0.16 + 0.06 = 0.22
  - P(H|E_agri) = (0.8 * 0.2) / 0.22 ≈ 0.727

- For Business Administration:
  - P(E) is same as above 0.22
  - P(H|E_business) = (0.2 * 0.3) / 0.22 ≈ 0.273

So the posterior probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.727,
  "business administration": 0.273
}
