To apply Bayes' rule and calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the given fields, we start with the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \), which represent the probability of observing E given that Adam is or is not in the hypothesized field. 

### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Probability that a graduate student is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
   Let's assume this prior probability to be around 0.1 (10%).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Probability of observing Adam's characteristics given he is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
   Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals strongly aligns with this field, as does his empathy and understanding of hard work.
   We'll assume this likelihood to be high, around 0.8 (80%).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Probability of observing Adam's characteristics given he is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
   These traits can be somewhat expected in non-technical fields but are still relatively specific.
   We'll assume this likelihood to be moderate, around 0.2 (20%).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the absence of \( P(E) \), we can express our posteriors as proportional (to P(E)):
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H)P(H) \]
\[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \]

### 2. Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Probability that a graduate student is enrolled in Business Administration.
   Let's assume this prior probability to be around 0.2 (20%).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Probability of observing Adam's characteristics given he is in Business Administration.
   The traits described for Adam (love for nature, animals, solving puzzles) donâ€™t particularly align with typical characteristics for a Business Administration student.
   We'll assume this likelihood to be low, around 0.1 (10%).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Probability of observing Adam's characteristics given he is not in Business Administration.
   We use a similar reasoning here as before.
   We'll assume this likelihood to be moderate, around 0.2 (20%).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H)P(H) \]
\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02 \]

### Answer Summary

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08,
  "business administration": 0.02
}
```

These values indicate that, based on the given personality sketch, Adam is more likely to be enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science than in Business Administration.
