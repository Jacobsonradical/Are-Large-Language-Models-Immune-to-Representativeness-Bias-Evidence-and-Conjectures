To estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) and then use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \), I will assume the following:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field, based on general enrollment statistics.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam's personality characteristics are observed given that he is enrolled in the specific field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that Adam's personality characteristics are observed given that he is not enrolled in the specific field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior \( P(H) \):**
   - Let's assume the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is relatively low, as it is a specialized field.
   - \( P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) = 0.1 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   - Adam has a strong love for animals, nature, and an appreciation for hard work which fits well with this field.
   - \( P(E|\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) = 0.8 \)

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   - Adam's personality traits might also fit well with other fields, though perhaps not as strongly.
   - \( P(E|\neg \text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) = 0.4 \)

### Business Administration

1. **Prior \( P(H) \):**
   - Let's assume the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration is moderate, as it's a popular and broad field.
   -  \( P(\text{Business Administration}) = 0.2 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   - Adam's traits do not strongly relate to typical characteristics needed in business administration which often involves less interaction with nature and animals.
   - \( P(E|\text{Business Administration}) = 0.2 \)

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   - Given that Adam's characteristics might fit more naturally to fields relating to nature or empathy-based roles, this will be moderately high.
   - \( P(E|\neg \text{Business Administration}) = 0.5 \)

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where \( P(E) \) (total evidence) can be calculated for each field by the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

Assuming \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) \):

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.1) + (0.4 \times 0.9) = 0.08 + 0.36 = 0.44 \]
\[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.44} \approx 0.1818 \]

#### Business Administration:
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \times 0.2) + (0.5 \times 0.8) = 0.04 + 0.4 = 0.44 \]
\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.2}{0.44} \approx 0.0909 \]

The calculated probabilities for each field given Adam's personality sketch are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.1818,
  "business administration": 0.0909
}
