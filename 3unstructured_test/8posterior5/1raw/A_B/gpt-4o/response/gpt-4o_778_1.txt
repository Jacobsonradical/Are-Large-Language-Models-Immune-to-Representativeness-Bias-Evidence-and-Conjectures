To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' theorem, we'll first outline the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood of \( E \) given the negation of the hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Let's start by assessing each of these components for the given fields.

1. **Business Administration:**

    - **Prior Probability (\( P(H) \)):**
      This is generally low for Adam since his personality sketch does not align closely with typical traits associated with business administration.
      \( P(H_{BA}) \): A lower value, say 0.1 (since many graduate students might choose a variety of other fields).
      
    - **Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \)):**
      Adam's traits such as strong empathy, love for nature and animals, and interest in abstract concepts don't closely align with common traits for business administration. 
      \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): A relatively low value, say 0.1.
      
    - **Likelihood (\( P(E|\neg H) \)):**
      Since many other fields could fit better based on Adam's personality sketch, this would be higher.
      \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \): A higher value, say 0.75.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

    - **Prior Probability (\( P(H) \)):**
      Adam's strong interests and traits suggest a good fit for this field.
      \( P(H_{AV}) \): A higher value, say 0.3.
      
    - **Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \)):**
      His interest in plants, animals, empathy, and understanding of hard work aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science.
      \( P(E|H_{AV}) \): A high value, say 0.9.
      
    - **Likelihood (\( P(E|\neg H) \)):**
      Still a high value but a bit lower than in the previous case as Adam fits well in this field.
      \( P(E|\neg H_{AV}) \): A lower value, say 0.6.

### Bayes Rule Formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where,
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's compute the posterior probabilities.

1. **Business Administration:**

    \[
    P(E)_{BA} = (0.1 \cdot 0.1) + (0.75 \cdot 0.9) = 0.01 + 0.675 = 0.685
    \]
    \[
    P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.685} \approx 0.0146
    \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

    \[
    P(E)_{AV} = (0.9 \cdot 0.3) + (0.6 \cdot 0.7) = 0.27 + 0.42 = 0.69
    \]
    \[
    P(H_{AV}|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.3}{0.69} \approx 0.3913
    \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0146,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3913
}
```

These values suggest that Adam is significantly more likely to be studying agricultural and veterinary science than business administration.
