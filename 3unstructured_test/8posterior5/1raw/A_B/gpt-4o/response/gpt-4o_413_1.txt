To calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E|\neg H) \). Let's start by making some reasonable assumptions for these probabilities:

Assume:
- \( P(H_{BA}) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(H_{AVS}) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E | H_{BA}) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence E given that Adam is enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E | H_{AVS}) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence E given that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Since we don't have specific data, we'll make some general estimates:

For business administration (BA):
- \( P(H_{BA}) \): The prior probability could range around 0.1 (10% chance he is enrolled in this due to the large number of fields available).
- \( P(E | H_{BA}) \): Given the personality sketch, the probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration seems low, so let's assume 0.01 (1%).
- \( P(E | \neg H_{BA}) \): This would be close to 1 minus the specific likelihoods of other more fitting fields, but we'll use approximately 0.5 for now (assuming that the other half might fit better).

For agricultural and veterinary science (AVS):
- \( P(H_{AVS}) \): The prior probability could be around 0.05 (5% chance he is enrolled in this).
- \( P(E | H_{AVS}) \): Given the personality sketch (deep love for animals and nature), the probability is high. Let's assume 0.7 (70%).
- \( P(E | \neg H_{AVS}) \): This would be lower, so let's use around 0.4.

Using Bayes' rule, \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \), but since \( P(E) \) is common to all hypotheses and assumes we are interested in relative probabilities, we only need to compare numerators:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) = 0.01 \times 0.1 = 0.001 \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) = 0.7 \times 0.05 = 0.035 \]

Re-normalizing these factors to sum to 1 among these two fields:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.001}{0.001 + 0.035} = \frac{0.001}{0.036} \approx 0.0278 \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.035}{0.001 + 0.035} = \frac{0.035}{0.036} \approx 0.9722 \]

So the posterior probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": 0.0278,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.9722
}
