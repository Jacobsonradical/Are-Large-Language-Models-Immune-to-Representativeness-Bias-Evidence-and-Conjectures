First, let's define the probabilities and then use Bayes' Rule for each field.

### Field: Business Administration
- **P(H):** This is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration as a field of study.
  - Since business administration is a fairly common graduate field, let's assume a prior probability of 0.15 for business administration.

- **P(E|H):** The probability of observing the evidence \(E\) (Adam's personality sketch) given that he is enrolled in business administration.
  - While it's possible for someone in business administration to have a curiosity about nature and enjoy solving puzzles, it is less likely compared to agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume a probability of 0.1.

- **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of observing the evidence \(E\) (Adam's personality sketch) given that he is not enrolled in business administration.
  - Given that Adam's interests align more with fields related to nature and science, the probability of this evidence in the absence of enrollment in business administration might be higher. Let's assume a probability of 0.3.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

First, compute \(P(\neg H)\):
\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 \]

Now compute \(P(H|E)\):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{0.3 \cdot 0.85} = \frac{0.015}{0.255} \approx 0.0588 \]

### Field: Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H):** This is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
  - Given his interests, let's assume a higher prior probability of 0.25 for agricultural and veterinary science.

- **P(E|H):** The probability of observing the evidence \(E\) (Adam's personality sketch) given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
  - Adam's interests strongly align with this field. Let's assume a high probability of 0.9.

- **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of observing the evidence \(E\) (Adam's personality sketch) given that he is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
  - With other fields considered \(\neg H\), this likelihood might be lower. Let's assume a probability of 0.2.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

First, compute \(P(\neg H)\):
\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75 \]

Now compute \(P(H|E)\):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.2 \cdot 0.75} = \frac{0.225}{0.15} = 1.5 \]

Since \(P(H|E)\) must be a value between 0 and 1, this indicates P(H|E) is actually very high:
\[ P(H|E) = 1 \text{ or nearly so} \]
