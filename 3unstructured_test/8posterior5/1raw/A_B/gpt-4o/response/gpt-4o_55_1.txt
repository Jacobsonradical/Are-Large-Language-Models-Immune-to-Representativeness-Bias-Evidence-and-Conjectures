To calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule for each hypothesis \( H \), we need to go through the following steps:

1. **Identify \( P(H) \), the prior probability of each hypothesis.**
2. **Identify \( P(E|H) \), the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis.**
3. **Identify \( P(E|\neg H) \), the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis is not true.**
4. **Calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule:**
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   where:
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
   \]

### Business Administration

1. **\( P(H) \) (Prior Probability):**
   This is the prior probability that Adam would be enrolled in Business Administration without any additional information. Let's assume this value is relatively low because he seems more aligned with natural sciences:
   \[
   P(\text{Business Administration}) = 0.1
   \]

2. **\( P(E|H) \) (Likelihood of Evidence given Hypothesis):**
   Given Adam's personality sketch, it's less likely that he would be in Business Administration, which typically does not closely align with nature, empathy, and animal-related interests:
   \[
   P(E|\text{Business Administration}) = 0.1
   \]

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \) (Likelihood of Evidence given Not Hypothesis):**
   This is the probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in Business Administration, which would be higher given his interests:
   \[
   P(E|\neg \text{Business Administration}) = 0.8
   \]

4. **Calculate \( P(H|E) \) (Posterior Probability):**
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|\text{Business Administration}) \cdot P(\text{Business Administration}) + P(E|\neg \text{Business Administration}) \cdot P(\neg \text{Business Administration})
   \]
   \[
   P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.1 + 0.8 \cdot 0.9 = 0.01 + 0.72 = 0.73
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{Business Administration} | E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.73} \approx 0.0137
   \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **\( P(H) \) (Prior Probability):**
   This is the prior probability that Adam would be enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given his interests, let's assume a relatively higher probability:
   \[
   P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) = 0.4
   \]

2. **\( P(E|H) \) (Likelihood of Evidence given Hypothesis):**
   Given Adam's personality sketch, it is quite likely he would be in Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
   \[
   P(E|\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) = 0.9
   \]

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \) (Likelihood of Evidence given Not Hypothesis):**
   This is the probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, which would be lower:
   \[
   P(E|\neg \text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) = 0.2
   \]

4. **Calculate \( P(H|E) \) (Posterior Probability):**
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) \cdot P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) + P(E|\neg \text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) \cdot P(\neg \text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science})
   \]
   \[
   P(E) = 0.9 \cdot 0.4 + 0.2 \cdot 0.6 = 0.36 + 0.12 = 0.48
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science} | E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.4}{0.48} = \frac{0.36}{0.48} = 0.75
   \]
