Sure, let's compute the probabilities.

For each field H, we need to evaluate:
1. The prior probability P(H) that Adam was enrolled in that field.
2. The likelihood P(E|H) that the personality sketch E matches someone enrolled in that field.
3. The probability P(E|\neg H) that the personality sketch E matches someone enrolled in all other fields.

### Business Administration:
1. **P(H) for Business Administration:** Graduate programs in business administration are quite popular in the U.S., but we would assume they are less aligned with Adam's personality characteristics. It might be less probable than average.
    - Let's assume P(H) = 0.1.

2. **P(E|H) for Business Administration:** Adam's characteristics (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy) are not highly aligned with typical traits needed for business administration. It seems less likely.
    - Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.05.

3. **P(E|\neg H) for Business Administration:** The personality sketch seems more aligned with fields other than business administration, which could include various sciences or humanities.
    - Given the large number of possible graduate fields, let's assume P(E|\neg H) = 0.3.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We can approximate P(E) as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.05 \times 0.1) + (0.3 \times 0.9) = 0.005 + 0.27 = 0.275 \]

So:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.1}{0.275} \approx 0.018 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
1. **P(H) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Graduate programs in agricultural and veterinary science are less common but would fit Adam's characteristics much better.
    - Let's assume P(H) = 0.05.

2. **P(E|H) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's intrinsic characteristics are highly aligned with this field (interest in nature, plants, animals).
    - Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.9.

3. **P(E|\neg H) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Given the large number of fields that might not match Adam's characteristics as well as agricultural and veterinary science, this is less likely.
    - Given the range of mismatched fields, let's assume P(E|\neg H) = 0.2.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We can approximate P(E) as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.9 \times 0.05) + (0.2 \times 0.95) = 0.045 + 0.19 = 0.235 \]

So:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.05}{0.235} \approx 0.191 \]

### Summary:
Here are the values computed for P(H|E):

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.018,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.191
}
