To compute \( P(H|E) \), we use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( H \) is the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in a given field,
- \( E \) is the personality sketch.

Given two fields, we need to estimate:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field (without any specific information about Adam).
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.

### Business Administration

**Estimations:**

- \( P(H) \): Business administration is a common field, so let's estimate it at around 0.1.
- \( P(E|H) \): Given the personality sketch, it doesn't strongly align with business administration attributes like a focus on finance, management, or corporate strategy. So, let's estimate it low, about 0.1.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The general likelihood of the personality sketch across all other fields. Since this is a broad category, let's assume an average value. Let's estimate it at around 0.3.

Using Bayes' Rule, assuming a proportional adjustment since \( P(E) \) will cancel out in the comparison:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \approx 0.1 \cdot 0.1 = 0.01 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

**Estimations:**

- \( P(H) \): Agricultural and veterinary science is less common than business administration but still significant in the context of natural sciences. Let's estimate it at around 0.05.
- \( P(E|H) \): The personality sketch very strongly aligns with an interest in nature, animals, and hard work, which is indicative of this field. Let's estimate it very high, about 0.8.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Same as above, let's assume an average value. Let's estimate it at around 0.3.

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \approx 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04 \]
