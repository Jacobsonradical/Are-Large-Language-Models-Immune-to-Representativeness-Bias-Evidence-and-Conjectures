Sure, let's analyze the given information and compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule for each field.

Bayes' Rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll start by judging \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science and business administration.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **\( P(H) \):** Let's assume the base rate of students in agricultural and veterinary science is reasonable but not too high: \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
- **\( P(E|H) \):** Adam's attributes like a love for animals, understanding nature, and empathy align strongly with this field. So, \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \):** Considering other fields, it’s less likely they match Adam’s personality closely. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

### Business Administration

- **\( P(H) \):** Assuming the base rate of students in business administration is fairly common, \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
- **\( P(E|H) \):** Adam’s attributes do not align well with business administration. So, \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \):** Similarly, \( P(E|H) \) for other fields might be more likely to match his attributes. Thus, \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \).

Now, let’s use these to compute \( P(H|E) \).

1. Calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E)_{\text{agri}} = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9 = 0.08 + 0.18 = 0.26 \]
\[ P(E)_{\text{bus}} = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.6 \cdot 0.8 = 0.02 + 0.48 = 0.50 \]

2. Calculate \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agri}} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.26} \approx 0.3077 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{bus}} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.50} = 0.04 \]

Based on these calculations:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3077,
  "business administration": 0.04
}
```
