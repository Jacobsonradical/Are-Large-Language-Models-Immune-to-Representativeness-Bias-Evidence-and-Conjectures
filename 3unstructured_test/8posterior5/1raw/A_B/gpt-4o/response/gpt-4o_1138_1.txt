Let's break this down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Judging P(H)
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's deep love for animals, nature, and plants, there is a reasonable likelihood he would be enrolled in this field. Let's assume P(H) = 0.25.
- **Business Administration**: Adam's traits don't strongly align with typical traits for this field, but we'll still consider it as a possibility. Let's assume P(H) = 0.1.

### Step 2: Judging P(E|H)
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's personality and interests align strongly with this field. Thus, P(E|H) = 0.9.
- **Business Administration**: Adam's personality and interests align less with this field, so P(E|H) = 0.2.

### Step 3: Judging P(E|¬H)
For both fields, we need to account for the probability of Adam having the described personality traits if he is not enrolled in those fields.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given the diversity of graduate fields, let's estimate P(E|¬H) = 0.3.
- **Business Administration**: Similarly, P(E|¬H) = 0.3.

### Step 4: Applying Bayes' Rule
Bayes' Rule:  
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is computed by:
\[ P(E) = P(H) \times P(E|H) + P(\neg H) \times P(E|\neg H) \]

#### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(E) = (0.25 \times 0.9) + (0.75 \times 0.3) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.225 + 0.225 = 0.45 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.25}{0.45} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.225}{0.45} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.5 \]

#### For Business Administration:
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.2) + (0.9 \times 0.3) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.27 = 0.29 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.069 \]

### Final Answer
\[ 
\{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.069
\}
\]
