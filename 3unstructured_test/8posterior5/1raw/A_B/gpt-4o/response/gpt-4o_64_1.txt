To calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Rule, we need to understand the terms and calculate them as follows:

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: This is the probability that Adam is enrolled in the given field without knowing his personality sketch.

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in the specified field.

3. **Marginal Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is the probability of observing the personality sketch given any field other than the specified one.

4. **Posterior Probability, \( P(H|E) \)**: This is the probability that Adam is enrolled in the specific field given his personality sketch E.

Given the personality traits described, we can make reasonable assumptions to estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field.

### For Business Administration

- **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: Business Administration is a common graduate field, so we can assume a moderately high prior probability.
  \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \)

- **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: Business Administration typically doesn't require a specific love for nature, animals, or a quiet and empathetic personality. Therefore, we would have a low probability.
  \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \)

- **Marginal Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Given the traits provided, it's more likely that someone with Adam's characteristics is not in Business Administration, so this is relatively high.
  \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \)

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.24} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.26} \approx 0.077 \]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: Agricultural and Veterinary Science is less common, but more aligned with Adam's interests, so we estimate a moderate prior probability.
  \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \)

- **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: This field strongly aligns with Adam's love for nature, animals, and empathy, making it very high.
  \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \)

- **Marginal Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Given many other fields don't strongly match Adam's interests, this probability would be lower.
  \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \)

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.18} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \approx 0.308 \]

Therefore, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.077,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.308
}
```
