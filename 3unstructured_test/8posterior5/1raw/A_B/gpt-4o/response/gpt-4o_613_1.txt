To compute the probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch (P(H|E)), we use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the information at hand, let's estimate the probabilities.

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is enrolled in business administration. Suppose it's moderately common, we can assign a value, say 0.2.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is a business administration student. Business administration usually involves less focus on nature, plants, animals, and puzzles. Therefore, this value might be low. Let's say 0.1.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not a business administration student. Considering various other fields could have students with Adam's traits, let's assign 0.6.

Therefore:

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.02}{P(E)} \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Suppose it's somewhat common but not very high, we can assign a value of 0.1.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is an agricultural and veterinary science student. Given Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature and plants, this is quite high. Let's say 0.9.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not an agricultural and veterinary science student. As many non-science fields may not typically produce students with such strong empathy towards animals and an interest in nature, let's rate this as 0.5.

Therefore:

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} \approx \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.09}{P(E)} \]

We note that \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields, so we can compare the numerators to discern which field is more likely.

Here's the final answer in the required format:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.09
}
