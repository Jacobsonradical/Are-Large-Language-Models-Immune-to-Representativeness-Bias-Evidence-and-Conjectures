Let's start by interpreting the given personality sketch, E, and then evaluate the probabilities using Bayes' rule.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H₁)**
   - P(H₁): Prior probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume P(H₁) = 0.05, which is relatively low given the variety of graduate fields available.
   - P(E|H₁): The likelihood of observing E if Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, this would be quite high. Let's assume P(E|H₁) = 0.9.
   - P(E|¬H₁): The likelihood of observing E if Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science. While other fields could explain some of his traits, they may not do so as comprehensively. This might be lower; let's assume P(E|¬H₁) = 0.2.
   - P(H₁|E) = [P(E|H₁) * P(H₁)] / [P(E|H₁) * P(H₁) + P(E|¬H₁) * (1 - P(H₁))]
     = [0.9 * 0.05] / [0.9 * 0.05 + 0.2 * 0.95]
     = 0.045 / (0.045 + 0.19)
     ≈ 0.045 / 0.235
     ≈ 0.191

2. **Business Administration (H₂)**
   - P(H₂): Prior probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in business administration. Let's assume P(H₂) = 0.1, as business administration tends to have higher enrollment numbers.
   - P(E|H₂): The likelihood of observing E if Adam is in business administration. Given Adam’s traits, it is less likely he is in business administration where more analytical and less empathetic traits might be emphasized. Let’s assume P(E|H₂) = 0.1.
   - P(E|¬H₂): The likelihood of observing E if Adam is not in business administration. Other fields could still explain his traits, so this might be moderate; let's assume P(E|¬H₂) = 0.3.
   - P(H₂|E) = [P(E|H₂) * P(H₂)] / [P(E|H₂) * P(H₂) + P(E|¬H₂) * (1 - P(H₂))]
     = [0.1 * 0.1] / [0.1 * 0.1 + 0.3 * 0.9]
     = 0.01 / (0.01 + 0.27)
     ≈ 0.01 / 0.28
     ≈ 0.036

Based on this, the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.191,
  "business administration": 0.036
}
