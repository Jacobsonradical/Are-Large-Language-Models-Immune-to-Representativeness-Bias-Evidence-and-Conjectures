Sure, let's go through the required steps systematically.

1. We need to estimate the prior probability \( P(H) \):
   - For \( H \) being "agricultural and veterinary science," let's assume this field is relatively niche, but still significant in the U.S. Estimated prior probability: \( P(H_{\text{ag}}) = 0.05 \).
   - For \( H \) being "business administration," let's assume this field is very common among graduate students in the U.S. Estimated prior probability: \( P(H_{\text{ba}}) = 0.20 \).

2. Estimate \( P(E|H) \), the likelihood of E given H:
   - Given Adam's traits, he seems well-suited to "agricultural and veterinary science." Estimated likelihood: \( P(E|H_{\text{ag}}) = 0.70 \).
   - Given Adam's traits, he seems less suited to "business administration," which doesn't typically emphasize his noted interests and traits. Estimated likelihood: \( P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) = 0.10 \).

3. Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \), the likelihood of E given not H:
   - Note that \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{ag}}) \) includes all other fields except "agricultural and veterinary science." For simplicity, assume there are many other fields and, given Adam’s specific traits, they collectively reduce the probability that those traits align so well. Estimated likelihood: \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{ag}}) = 0.05 \).
   - Similarly, for "business administration," the estimate includes all other fields, but given business fields do not typically align with Adam's specific traits, the estimated likelihood: \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{ba}}) = 0.30 \).

4. Apply Bayes’ rule to find \( P(H|E) \):
   
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]

   To calculate \( P(E) \), we use the law of total probability:
   
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
   \]

   For agricultural and veterinary science:
   \[
   P(E) = (0.70 \cdot 0.05) + (0.05 \cdot 0.95) = 0.035 + 0.0475 = 0.0825
   \]
   
   \[
   P(H_{\text{ag}}|E) = \frac{0.70 \cdot 0.05}{0.0825} \approx 0.424
   \]

   For business administration:
   \[
   P(E) = (0.10 \cdot 0.20) + (0.30 \cdot 0.80) = 0.02 + 0.24 = 0.26
   \]
   
   \[
   P(H_{\text{ba}}|E) = \frac{0.10 \cdot 0.20}{0.26} \approx 0.077
   \]

Therefore, the posterior probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.424",
  "business administration": "0.077"
}
