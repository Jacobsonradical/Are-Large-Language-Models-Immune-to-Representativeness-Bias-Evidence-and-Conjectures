Let's go through the calculations step-by-step for each field:

1. **Business Administration:**

    - **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. This might be moderate since business administration is a common graduate program.
    - **P(E|H):** Probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam was in business administration. This might be low because the given traits do not typically align with business administration.
    - **P(E|¬H):** Probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam was not in business administration. This might be higher as the traits seem more aligned with other fields, particularly those involving nature or animals.


2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

    - **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This might be relatively lower compared to business administration but still notable.
    - **P(E|H):** Probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam was in agricultural and veterinary science. This might be high because the given traits strongly align with this field.
    - **P(E|¬H):** Probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam was not in agricultural and veterinary science. This would be lower because the traits closely match this field.

The formula to compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have the exact values, let's make reasonable assumptions.

### Assumptions:
- **P(H) for Business Administration:** 0.2 (since it's a common field)
- **P(E|H) for Business Administration:** 0.05 (traits don’t strongly align with business)
- **P(E|¬H) for Business Administration:** 0.15 (higher probability of these traits in other fields)

### Calculation:
\[ P(H|E) \text{ for Business Administration} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant we’ll assume is the same for both calculations.

- **P(H) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** 0.1 
- **P(E|H) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** 0.4 (traits strongly align with this field)
- **P(E|¬H) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** 0.1 (traits less likely in fields other than this)

### Calculation:
\[ P(H|E) \text{ for Agricultural and Veterinary Science} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

### Normalize (Comparing relative values):
To simplify, we'll directly compare proportions:

- For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.05 \cdot 0.2 = 0.01 \]
- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.4 \cdot 0.1 = 0.04 \]

Thus, we’ll see that Agricultural and Veterinary Science has a relatively higher posterior probability.

### Final Relative Probabilities:
```
{
  "business administration": 0.01,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.04
}
```

These numbers provide a relative comparison of the likelihood based on the given data.
