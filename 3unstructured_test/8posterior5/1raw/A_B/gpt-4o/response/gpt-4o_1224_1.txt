To compute the probabilities, we start with the Bayes' Rule formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, let's assume the prior probabilities and conditional probabilities we assign are based on the characteristics described and the fields in question.

### Assumptions:
1. **P(H)**: Prior probability of Adam being in each field.
2. **P(E|H)**: Probability of observing Adam's personality given he is in that field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability of observing Adam's personality given he is not in that field.
4. **P(E)**: Total probability of observing Adam's personality (a normalization factor which is often complex to determine but is not necessary for comparative purposes here).

### Fields:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**  
   - **P(H)**: Since agricultural and veterinary science aligns well with Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, animals, etc., a reasonable a priori might be moderately high, say 0.2.
   - **P(E|H)**: Given this field, the likelihood of Adam having such a personality is high due to alignment with interests, so suppose 0.9.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of having such a personality profile in a different field where nature/animal curiosity isn't primary, maybe lower, say 0.1.

2. **Business Administration**  
   - **P(H)**: Business administration is less likely given Adam's profile, which indicates empathy, curiosity about nature, puzzles, etc. So, a priori lower, say 0.05.
   - **P(E|H)**: Given this field, the likelihood of personality traits fitting Adam's profile is lower (business usually does not focus on nature/animals directly), say 0.2.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of having such a profile in some other fields might be relatively similar to the other non-business fields, thus same 0.1.

For a more simplified comparative evaluation, we don't focus on exact \( P(E) \).

Using Bayes' rule simplified for our comparing purposes:

### Calculations:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**  
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.9 \times 0.2 = 0.18 \]

2. **Business Administration**  
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.2 \times 0.05 = 0.01 \]

So the comparative probabilities given Adam's personality:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.18,
  "business administration": 0.01
}
```

These numbers are illustrative and simplified for this exampleâ€™s purpose. Exact values might be different depending on the actual distribution and context specifics.
