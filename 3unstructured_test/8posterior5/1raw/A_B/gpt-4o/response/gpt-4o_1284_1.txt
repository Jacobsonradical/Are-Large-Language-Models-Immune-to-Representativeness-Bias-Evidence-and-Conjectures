Let's break it down step-by-step for each field.

### Business Administration

#### Step 1: Estimate P(H)
\( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \): Initially, let's assume a moderate probability that a random graduate student is in a business administration program, say 0.2 (20%).

#### Step 2: Estimate P(E|H)
\( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \): Given that Adam’s personality sketch involves a love of nature, animals, and empathy, it’s less likely someone with these traits would select business administration, where the focus is more on management, finance, and organization. Let’s assume this probability as 0.1 (10%).

#### Step 3: Estimate P(E|\neg H)
\( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business administration}}) \): This is the likelihood of Adam's personality being common in any other field except business administration. Given Adam's interests, he may be more likely in other fields such as sciences or the humanities. Let’s assume this is 0.6 (60%).

#### Step 4: Apply Bayes' Rule
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}})}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't know the exact value of \( P(E) \), we can define it as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{business administration}}) \]

Let's calculate:
\[ P(\neg H_{\text{business administration}}) = 1 - P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.8 \]

\[ P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.6 \cdot 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.48 = 0.5 \]

So,
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.5} = 0.04 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

#### Step 1: Estimate P(H)
\( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): Given Adam's interests, we can estimate the prior probability of him being in such a field to be relatively higher, say 0.3 (30%).

#### Step 2: Estimate P(E|H)
\( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): Given his personality sketch, it is highly likely for Adam to be in this field. Let's assign this a probability of 0.8 (80%).

#### Step 3: Estimate P(E|\neg H)
\( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): This is again the likelihood of Adam's personality being common in fields except agricultural and veterinary science. This would be lower, say 0.3 (30%).

#### Step 4: Apply Bayes' Rule
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})}{P(E)} \]

Let's calculate \( P(E) \) for this scenario:
\[ P(\neg H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.7 \]

\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 + 0.3 \cdot 0.7 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.24 + 0.21 = 0.45 \]

So,
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.3}{0.45} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = 0.5333 \]
