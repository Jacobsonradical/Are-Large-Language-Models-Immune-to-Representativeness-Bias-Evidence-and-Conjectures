Let's use Bayes' Rule to calculate the probabilities \(P(H|E)\), which represent the probability that Adam was enrolled in each specific field, given his personality sketch \(E\).

Bayes' Rule: \(P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\)

To perform the calculations, we'll need to make some reasonable assumptions about the probabilities based on the provided sketch.

### For Business Administration:
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration. Business administration is a common field, but given Adam's personality sketch, it seems less likely than agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume \(P(H)_{BA} = 0.1\).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is in Business Administration. Given that the traits described (curiosity about nature, love for animals, solving puzzles) are less aligned with Business Administration, let's assume \(P(E|H)_{BA}\) is low, say \(P(E|H)_{BA} = 0.1\).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is not in Business Administration. Adam's traits are common among fields that deal with nature more directly. Let's assume \(P(E|\neg H)_{BA} = 0.8\).

Now, compute \(P(H|E)_{BA}\):

\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{P(E|H)_{BA} \cdot P(H)_{BA}}{P(E)_{BA}} \]

Assuming \(P(E)_{BA}\) as an average:

\[ P(E)_{BA} = [P(E|H)_{BA} \cdot P(H)_{BA} + P(E|\neg H)_{BA} \cdot P(\neg H)_{BA}] \]

\[ = [0.1 \cdot 0.1 + 0.8 \cdot 0.9] \]
\[ = 0.01 + 0.72 \]
\[ = 0.73 \]

So,

\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.73} = \frac{0.01}{0.73} \approx 0.014 \]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given Adam's personality, this field seems quite likely. Let's assume \(P(H)_{AVS} = 0.4\).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. The sketch closely matches this field, so let's assume \(P(E|H)_{AVS} = 0.9\).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Let's assume \(P(E|\neg H)_{AVS} = 0.5\).

Now, compute \(P(H|E)_{AVS}\):

\[ P(H|E)_{AVS} = \frac{P(E|H)_{AVS} \cdot P(H)_{AVS}}{P(E)_{AVS}} \]

Assuming \(P(E)_{AVS}\) as an average:

\[ P(E)_{AVS} = [P(E|H)_{AVS} \cdot P(H)_{AVS} + P(E|\neg H)_{AVS} \cdot P(\neg H)_{AVS}] \]

\[ = [0.9 \cdot 0.4 + 0.5 \cdot 0.6] \]
\[ = 0.36 + 0.3 \]
\[ = 0.66 \]

So,

\[ P(H|E)_{AVS} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.4}{0.66} = \frac{0.36}{0.66} \approx 0.545 \]

Hence, the computed posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.014,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.545
}
```
