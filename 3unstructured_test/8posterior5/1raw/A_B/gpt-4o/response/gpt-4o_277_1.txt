Let's break down the probabilities for each field of study you mentioned based on the personality sketch provided for Adam.

### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume a moderately high prior probability because his interests and personality traits align well with this field.
  - Estimate: **0.3** (30%).

- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science.
  - His genuine curiosity about nature, strong love for animals, and appreciation for hard work fits well with this field.
  - Estimate: **0.9** (90%).

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in agricultural and veterinary science.
  - Given Adam's traits, it's less likely but still possible that he could be in another field.
  - Estimate: **0.2** (20%).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ = (0.9 \cdot 0.3) + (0.2 \cdot 0.7) \]
\[ = 0.27 + 0.14 \]
\[ = 0.41 \]

Thus:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.3}{0.41} \]
\[ = \frac{0.27}{0.41} \]
\[ \approx 0.6585 \]

### 2. Business Administration:
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Given his traits, it seems much less likely.
  - Estimate: **0.05** (5%).

- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in business administration.
  - His traits do not strongly align with typical business administration interests.
  - Estimate: **0.05** (5%).

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in business administration.
  - More likely since business administration is not a natural fit for his personality.
  - Estimate: **0.3** (30%).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ = (0.05 \cdot 0.05) + (0.3 \cdot 0.95) \]
\[ = 0.0025 + 0.285 \]
\[ = 0.2875 \]

Thus:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.05}{0.2875} \]
\[ = \frac{0.0025}{0.2875} \]
\[ \approx 0.0087 \]

### Summary:
