To compute the probabilities, we need to use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We also need to compute or estimate the following probabilities:
- \(P(H)\): Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field.
- \(P(E|H)\): Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in a particular field.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not in that particular field.
- \(P(E)\): Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch (which we can estimate as a normalization constant).

Since we are only asked for \(P(H|E)\) for two specific fields and we do not need to add up to 1, we can normalize our answers relative to each other.

### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- \(P(H)\): Given Adam's love for nature and animals, it's reasonable to assume he has a higher prior probability of being in this field compared to a random field.
- \(P(E|H)\): The personality sketch highly matches a student in this field, given his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): While there might be students in other fields with similar characteristics, the fit is stronger for agricultural and veterinary science.

Let's assign some rough values based on the reasoning:

- \(P(H)\) \(\approx 0.2\): Higher likelihood due to interest in nature and animals.
- \(P(E|H)\) \(\approx 0.9\): The personality traits match well.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\) \(\approx 0.1\): Less likely in fields not related to his interests.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.9 \times 0.2 = 0.18 \]

### 2. Business Administration

- \(P(H)\): A lower prior probability since his personality sketch does not explicitly indicate a strong fit with business administration.
- \(P(E|H)\): The personality sketch does not align well with this field. The traits mentioned are less relevant to typical business administration interests.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): Higher compared to agricultural and veterinary science because there are many other fields where his personality would fit (e.g., sciences, humanities).

Rough values could be:

- \(P(H)\) \(\approx 0.05\): Lower likelihood.
- \(P(E|H)\) \(\approx 0.2\): The personality traits donâ€™t strongly fit.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\) \(\approx 0.2\): More likely in fields other than business administration but fits better than being a strong mismatch.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \times 0.05 = 0.01 \]

To summarize and normalize:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.18,
  "business administration": 0.01
}
