To estimate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' theorem, we need the following:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in the given field.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is constant for both hypotheses, we can focus on the numerator:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

For each field:

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of being enrolled in Business Administration. Given many fields of graduate study, this might be a moderate probability. Let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \).
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood that a person with the given personality sketch would be enrolled in Business Administration. Given the sketch mentions natural curiosity, empathy, and love for animals—traits not strongly associated with Business Administration—this might be low, say \( P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of the sketch independent of Business Administration. Given it fits well with fields like agricultural and veterinary science, \( P(E|\neg H) \) could be high, say \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.7 \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \times 0.1 = 0.02 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of being enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given many fields of graduate study and the specific nature of this field, this might be moderate to high. Let's estimate \( P(H) \approx 0.05 \).
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood that a person with this personality sketch would be enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given the sketch closely matches traits associated with this field, this is high, say \( P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of the sketch independent of Agricultural and Veterinary Science. If we assume other unrelated fields, \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.9 \times 0.05 = 0.045 \]

To normalize these probabilities (if needed for comparison):

\[ P(business\ administration|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.045} \approx 0.31 \]
\[ P(agricultural\ and\ veterinary\ science|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.02 + 0.045} \approx 0.69 \]
