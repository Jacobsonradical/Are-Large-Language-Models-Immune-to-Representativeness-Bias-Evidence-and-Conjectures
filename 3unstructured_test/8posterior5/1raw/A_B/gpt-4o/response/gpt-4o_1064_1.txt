To solve for \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to compute:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

However, since \( P(E) \) is the same for all fields and mainly used for normalization across different fields, we can ignore it when comparing relative probabilities.

### Hypothesis: Business Administration

#### P(H): Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration.
Given that Business Administration is one of many fields, let's assume a moderate prior. Let's say:

\[
P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.2
\]

#### P(E|H): Probability of observing E given H.
E describes someone with curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, and love for animals—traits not typically aligned with a Business Administration background. Thus, \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \) could be relatively low:

\[
P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1
\]

#### P(E|\neg H): Probability of observing E given \(\neg\)H.
This is the likelihood of seeing E in any field other than Business Administration. Let's assume this is moderately high since the described traits are more common in other fields:

\[
P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.8
\]

Using Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{P(E)}
\]

### Hypothesis: Agricultural and Veterinary Science

#### P(H): Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
Given Adam’s love for nature and animals, let's assume this prior probability is higher:

\[
P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) = 0.3
\]

#### P(E|H): Probability of observing E given H.
The traits closely match someone in Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[
P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) = 0.9
\]

#### P(E|\neg H): Probability of observing E given \(\neg\)H.
This likelihood is moderately lower since the specific traits match Agricultural and Veterinary Science closely:

\[
P(E|\neg H_{\text{AgVet}}) = 0.3
\]

Using Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H_{\text{AgVet}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AgVet}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.9 \times 0.3}{P(E)}
\]

### Calculating Relative Values

We are comparing the numerator of the Bayes rule ratios since \( P(E) \) is common to both and thus can be ignored for relative comparisons.

For Business Administration:
\[
P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02
\]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[
P(H_{\text{AgVet}}|E) \propto 0.9 \times 0.3 = 0.27
\]

Normalizing these values to get them between 0 and 1:
\[
\text{Sum} = 0.02 + 0.27 = 0.29
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.29} \approx 0.069
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{AgVet}}|E) = \frac{0.27}{0.29} \approx 0.931
\]

So the final relative probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.069,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.931
}
```
