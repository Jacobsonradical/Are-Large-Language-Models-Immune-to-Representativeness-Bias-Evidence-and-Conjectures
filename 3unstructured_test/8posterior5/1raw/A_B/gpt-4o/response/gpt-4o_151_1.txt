Sure, let's break this down by first assigning some provisional values for the probabilities and then applying Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \).

For "agricultural and veterinary science" (let's denote this hypothesis as \( H_1 \)):
- \( P(H_1) \): The prior probability that a given graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume, for simplicity, that this prior is relatively low but not insignificant since it is a specialized field. Suppose \( P(H_1) = 0.05 \).
- \( P(E|H_1) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given that he is a graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. Considering his interest in nature, animals, and high empathy, this fits well. So, let's assume \( P(E|H_1) = 0.8 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H_1) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given that he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. This is more generic, so let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_1) = 0.2 \).

For "business administration" (let's denote this hypothesis as \( H_2 \)):
- \( P(H_2) \): The prior probability that a given graduate student is in business administration, which is relatively high compared to a specialized field like agricultural science. Suppose \( P(H_2) = 0.20 \).
- \( P(E|H_2) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch \( E \) being true if he is in business administration. Given the traits mentioned, the fit is weaker than for agricultural science. Let's assume \( P(E|H_2) = 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H_2) \): The probability of Adamâ€™s personality sketch \( E \) given that he is not in business administration. It stays the same as before. So, \( P(E|\neg H_2) = 0.2 \).

Now, let's calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

For \( H_1 \):
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.05) + (0.2 \times 0.95) = 0.04 + 0.19 = 0.23 \]
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.23} \approx 0.174 \]

For \( H_2 \):
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.20) + (0.2 \times 0.80) = 0.02 + 0.16 = 0.18 \]
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.20}{0.18} \approx 0.111 \]

Thus, the results are:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.174,
  "business administration": 0.111
}
