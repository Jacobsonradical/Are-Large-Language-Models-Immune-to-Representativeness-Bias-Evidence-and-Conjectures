To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) (the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch), we need to use Bayes' theorem, which is formulated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) represents the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \) represents the probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in the field H.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) represents the probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was not enrolled in the field H.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch E, calculated as a weighted sum of the probabilities under all possible fields.

Since we don't have enough data for a detailed calculation, we will make some reasonable assumptions for these probabilities based on the field characteristics and Adam's personality sketch.

### Assumptions:
For both "agricultural and veterinary science" and "business administration":

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - We can assume these fields are reasonably popular among graduate students but have no concrete numerical data. Let's assume:
     - \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.1 \) (10%)
     - \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.2 \) (20%)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Adam's traits suggest a high compatibility with agricultural and veterinary science (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy). Let's assume:
     - \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.7 \) (70%)
   - His traits don't align as clearly with business administration, but his intelligence and understanding of hard work could still be relevant. Let's assume:
     - \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.3 \) (30%)

3. **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - This is the probability of observing Adam's personality in fields other than the one specified.
   - Suppose the overall odds of observing these traits in a random graduate field are moderate. Let's assume:
     - \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \) (40%)

Now, we can plug these into Bayes' theorem to get an understanding of the relative probabilities without worrying too much about the exact overall \( P(E) \) for now:

### Calculations:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})}{P(E)}
   \]

   Given our assumptions:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) \propto 0.7 \times 0.1 = 0.07
   \]

2. **Business Administration**:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}})}{P(E)}
   \]

   Given our assumptions:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) \propto 0.3 \times 0.2 = 0.06
   \]

### Normalizing ratios:
To get the normalized probabilities, we note that there are other fields that could be relevant, and we just look at the relative sizes here. These probabilities sum up to 0.13 without considering additional fields. We can normalize these ratios:

\[
P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) \approx \frac{0.07}{0.13} \approx 0.538
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) \approx \frac{0.06}{0.13} \approx 0.462
\]

Expressed in the required format, we get:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.538,
  "business administration": 0.462
}

Note: These values are hypothetical and based on the assumptions provided. Actual probabilities might differ based on more accurate priors and data.
