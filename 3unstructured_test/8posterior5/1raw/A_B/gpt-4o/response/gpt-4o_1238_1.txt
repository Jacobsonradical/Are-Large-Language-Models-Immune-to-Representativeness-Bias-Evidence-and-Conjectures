To determine the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in either business administration or agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch \(E\), we will evaluate the necessary probabilities using Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \), we break this down for each hypothesis:

**Hypothesis 1: Business Administration**

- **P(H) (Prior probability of being enrolled in business administration):** 
  Let's say the proportion of graduate students in business administration is moderately common. Assigning a value like 0.15 seems reasonable.

- **P(E|H) (Likelihood of personality sketch given business administration):**
  The personality sketch does not particularly fit business administration since it emphasizes curiosity about nature, strong empathy for animals, and appreciation for hard work, which align less frequently with business administration. A lower value like 0.05 might be appropriate.

- **P(E|\neg H) (Likelihood of personality sketch given not business administration):**
  Given that there are many other fields better aligning with Adam's personality, a relatively higher value can be used here. Assigning 0.95 seems fitting.

Using these values, we calculate:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.15}{(0.05 \cdot 0.15 + 0.95 \cdot 0.85)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{business\ administration} = \frac{0.0075}{(0.0075 + 0.8075)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{business\ administration} = \frac{0.0075}{0.815} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{business\ administration} = 0.0092 \]

**Hypothesis 2: Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

- **P(H) (Prior probability of being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science):** 
  Assuming that this field is less common overall, but more likely for someone with Adam’s interests. Assigning a value like 0.05.

- **P(E|H) (Likelihood of personality sketch given agricultural and veterinary science):**
  This field closely aligns with Adam’s personality and interests. A high value like 0.75 is reasonable.

- **P(E|\neg H) (Likelihood of personality sketch given not agricultural and veterinary science):**
  As before, assuming many other fields are less aligned with his personality, we keep it lower, say 0.15.

Using these values, we calculate:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.75 \cdot 0.05}{(0.75 \cdot 0.05 + 0.15 \cdot 0.95)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{agricultural_and_veterinary_science} = \frac{0.0375}{(0.0375 + 0.1425)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{agricultural_and_veterinary_science} = \frac{0.0375}{0.18} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{agricultural_and_veterinary_science} = 0.2083 \]

Thus, the probabilities are:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0092,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.2083
}
```
