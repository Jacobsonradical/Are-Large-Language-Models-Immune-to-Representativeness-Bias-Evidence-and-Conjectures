To compute the posterior probabilities that Adam was enrolled in business administration and agricultural and veterinary science, we will use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's break down each term for both fields.

### 1. Business Administration

- **P(H) (prior probability)**: Let's assume, based on general statistics, that 15% of graduate students pursue business administration.
  \[ P(H) = 0.15 \]

- **P(E|H) (likelihood)**: It's less likely that a student who fits Adam's personality sketch would choose business administration, given his interest in nature, animals, and abstract concepts over business-related topics.
  \[ P(E|H) = 0.1 \]

- **P(E|¬H) (likelihood given not H)**: The likelihood that Adam's personality fits if he is not in business administration is higher because more fields align better with his sketch.
  \[ P(E|¬H) = 0.5 \]

Using these, we apply Bayes' Rule to calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{0.1 \cdot 0.15 + 0.5 \cdot 0.85} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.015}{0.015 + 0.425} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.015}{0.44} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.034 \]

### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H) (prior probability)**: Let's assume 5% of graduate students pursue agricultural and veterinary science.
  \[ P(H) = 0.05 \]

- **P(E|H) (likelihood)**: Adam's personality sketch strongly fits someone in this field.
  \[ P(E|H) = 0.9 \]

- **P(E|¬H) (likelihood given not H)**: The likelihood that Adam's personality fits if he is not in this field is lower since fewer fields align as well.
  \[ P(E|¬H) = 0.4 \]

Using these, we apply Bayes' Rule to calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.9 \cdot 0.05 + 0.4 \cdot 0.95} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.38} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.425} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.106 \]

Based on these calculations, we get:

{
  "business administration": 0.034,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.106
}
