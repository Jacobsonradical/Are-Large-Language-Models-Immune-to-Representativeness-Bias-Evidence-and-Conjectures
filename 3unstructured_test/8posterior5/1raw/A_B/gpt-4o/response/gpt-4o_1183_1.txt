To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to define the probabilities and then apply Bayes' formula. Bayes' rule is stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is in the given field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is not in the given field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch E, which can be calculated as:
  \[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For the sake of this task, we can make reasonable estimates of these probabilities. Let's assume some reasonable prior distribution and conditional probabilities for simplicity:

### Hypotheses:
- \( H_1 \): Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science
- \( H_2 \): Adam is enrolled in business administration

### Estimations:
1. **P(H_1)**: Probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science
2. **P(H_2)**: Probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration

Based on the personality sketch, it is reasonable to attribute stronger priors to fields that align well with Adam's interests and characteristics:

- **P(H_1)**: Agricultural and veterinary science seems a strong match given Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, animals, and empathy.
- **P(H_2)**: Business administration seems less likely given Adam's interests, but not impossible.

### Conditional Probabilities:
- **P(E|H_1)**: High, as the personality sketch fits well with the field of agricultural and veterinary science.
- **P(E|H_2)**: Low, as the personality sketch is less associated with interests typically found in business administration.
- **P(E|\neg H_1)**: Would mainly include E given H2 and other potential fields.
- **P(E|\neg H_2)**: Would mainly include E given H1 and other potential fields.

### Calculation:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - \( P(H_1) \approx 0.2 \)
    - \( P(E|H_1) \approx 0.8 \)
    - \( P(E|\neg H_1) \approx 0.2 \)

2. **Business Administration**:
    - \( P(H_2) \approx 0.1 \)
    - \( P(E|H_2) \approx 0.1 \)
    - \( P(E|\neg H_2) \approx 0.6 \)

Given these estimates, we can calculate \( P(E) \) for use in both posterior probabilities:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E|\neg H_1) \cdot P(\neg H_1) \]

### P(E)
\[ P(E) \approx (0.8 \cdot 0.2) + (0.2 \cdot 0.8) + (0.1 \cdot 0.1) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.16 + 0.16 + 0.01 = 0.33 \]

Now we apply Bayes' rule for each field:

1. **For Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{0.33} \approx 0.484 \]

2. **For Business Administration**:
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.33} \approx 0.03 \]

So, the final posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.484,
  "business administration": 0.03
}
```
