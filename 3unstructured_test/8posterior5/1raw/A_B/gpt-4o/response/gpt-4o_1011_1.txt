To compute \( P(H|E) \), Bayes' theorem is used as follows:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

First, let's outline the reasoning for the given fields:

### Business Administration:

1. **P(H)**: Probability of a graduate student being enrolled in Business Administration.
   - Business Administration is a popular field, though less likely for someone with Adam's profile centered on nature, empathy, and animals.
   - Let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \).

2. **P(E|H)**: Probability of E given H (Adam’s personality sketch given that he is in Business Administration).
   - While Business Administration involves people who can have a warm heart and intelligence, it doesn't align as well with Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability of E given not H (Adam’s personality sketch for fields other than Business Administration).
   - Given Adam's personality, it is higher compared to Business Administration.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \).

Using Bayes' Formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]

4. **P(E)**: We don't have an exact P(E) but can relatively consider it a normalization constant.

Thus,
\[ P(Business\ Administration|E) = \frac{0.02}{P(E)} \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

1. **P(H)**: Probability of a graduate student being enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
   - This field aligns very well with Adam’s profile.
   - Let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.05 \).

2. **P(E|H)**: Probability of E given H (Adam’s personality sketch given that he is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science).
   - Adam's appreciation for nature, empathy, love for animals, and intelligence makes it highly probable.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: As before, less probable for other fields compared to this specific one.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \).

Using Bayes’ Formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 \times 0.05}{P(E)} \]

Thus,
\[ P(Agricultural\ and\ Veterinary\ Science|E) = \frac{0.045}{P(E)} \]

To calculate specific values for \( P(E) \) and provide normalized results would normally require a summation of probabilities for all possible fields. Since we only focus on relative probabilities in this context, we'll leave \( P(E) \) as a normalization factor.

Let's provide the normalized relative probabilities:

{
  "business administration": \(\frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.045} \approx 0.308\),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \(\frac{0.045}{0.02 + 0.045} \approx 0.692\)
