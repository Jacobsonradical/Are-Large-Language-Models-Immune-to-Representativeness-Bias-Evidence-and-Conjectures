To calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the evidences \( P(E|\neg H) \). For the sake of this estimation, letâ€™s assume some initial reasonable values for these probabilities based on the information provided in the personality sketch:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Agricultural and veterinary science is a relatively specific field, but given Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, he may have a predisposition to choose this field. We can estimate \( P(H) \) as 0.1 (10%).
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Given that Adam's interest in nature, empathy, and animal love align very well with this field, we estimate \( P(E|H) \) as 0.8 (80%).
- **Evidence \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is the probability that Adam would have the described personality traits even if he were not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Since these traits could also apply to several other fields related to nature and science, we might estimate this as 0.2 (20%).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \text{, where } P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.1) + (0.2 \times 0.9) = 0.08 + 0.18 = 0.26 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.26} \approx 0.3077 \]

### Business Administration
- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Business administration is a common field with a broad appeal, though it doesn't specifically align with Adam's noted interests. We can estimate \( P(H) \) as 0.05 (5%).
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The personality sketch does not particularly align with the characteristics typically associated with business administration. Therefore, we estimate \( P(E|H) \) as 0.1 (10%).
- **Evidence \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Similar reasoning applies as before, estimating this as 0.2 (20%).

Calculating using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.05) + (0.2 \times 0.95) = 0.005 + 0.19 = 0.195 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.05}{0.195} \approx 0.0256 \]

Therefore, the final answers are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3077,
  "business administration": 0.0256
}
