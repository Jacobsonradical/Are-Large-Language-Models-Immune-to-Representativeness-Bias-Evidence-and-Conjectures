To solve this problem using Bayes' Rule, we need to use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of Adam having the personality sketch \(E\) given that he was enrolled in that specific field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of Adam having the personality sketch \(E\) given that he was not enrolled in that specific field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the personality sketch \(E\) across all fields.

Assumptions and estimates:
- Let's assume Adam's enrollment in "business administration" (H1) or "agricultural and veterinary science" (H2) fields to have a 5% prior probability each. This is purely to demonstrate the method and ideally, should be based on relevant statistical data.
- \( P(H1) = 0.05 \)
- \( P(H2) = 0.05 \)

From the personality sketch E:
- Adam's traits (his genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, strong empathy, love for animals) fit more naturally with "agricultural and veterinary science" than "business administration".
- So let's assign estimated probabilities for \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \):

1. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(E|H1) \): He has a warm heart, strong empathy, but these traits are less relevant to business administration. Let's assume \( P(E|H1) = 0.01 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H1) \): Given the large number of graduate fields, let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H1) = 0.2 \).

   Using Bayes' Rule:
   \[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.01 \times 0.05}{P(E)} \]
   
   We assume \( P(E) \) as the normalizing constant for all hypotheses.
   
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(E|H2) \): Adam's traits fit much better here. Let's assume \( P(E|H2) = 0.6 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H2) \): Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H2) = 0.1 \).

   Using Bayes' Rule:
   \[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.05}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant that will be calculated based on the sum \( P(E|H1)P(H1) + P(E|H2)P(H2) \), and for simplicity purposes, assuming other values contribute to \( P(E) \) are very negligible:

\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H1)P(H1) + P(E|H2)P(H2) \approx (0.01 \times 0.05) + (0.6 \times 0.05) \approx 0.0005 + 0.03 = 0.0305 \]

Now, we can calculate:

1. **Business Administration**:
   \[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.01 \times 0.05}{0.0305} \approx 0.0164 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.05}{0.0305} \approx 0.9836 \]

Finally, our answers are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0164,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.9836
}
