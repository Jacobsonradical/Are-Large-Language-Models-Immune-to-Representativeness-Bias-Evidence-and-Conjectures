To utilize Bayes' Rule to compute \( P(H|E) \), we need the following quantities:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the evidence given that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the evidence given that Adam was not enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E) \): The overall probability of the evidence.

Bayes' Rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \) and we are primarily interested in the ratios, we can simplify our calculations.

Let's start with some reasonable estimates for each quantity:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): Let's assume a reasonable prior that Adam, given his curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and love for animals, might be enrolled in this field. Let's say there's about a 15% chance (\(0.15\)) that any randomly selected graduate student with similar traits is in this field.
   - \( P(E|H) \): If Adam is in this field, it fits his personality sketch very well. Let's estimate this at \(0.8\), indicating high compatibility.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): If Adam is not in this field, the chance of still fitting the personality sketch might be lower, let's say \(0.4\).

2. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H) \): Let's assume that the prior probability of Adam being in Business Administration, given the general popularity of the field, is moderate, say \(0.2\).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The traits described donâ€™t align very well with typical business administration students, so let's estimate this at \(0.1\).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): If Adam is not in this field, he might fit more naturally into fields better aligned with his traits, so we adjust this to \(0.4\).

We use these assumptions to compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field.

### Calculations:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
   \]
   \[
   P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.4 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.34 = 0.46
   \]

   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.46} \approx 0.26
   \]

2. **Business Administration:**
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
   \]
   \[
   P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.4 \cdot 0.8) = 0.02 + 0.32 = 0.34
   \]

   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.34} \approx 0.06
   \]

So, based on these calculations, the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.26,
  "business administration": 0.06
}
```

These values indicate that it is more likely Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration given his personality sketch.
