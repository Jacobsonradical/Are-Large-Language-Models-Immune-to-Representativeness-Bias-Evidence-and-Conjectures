To address this question, we apply Bayes' Rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here is the plan:
1. Estimate \(P(H)\), the initial probability of Adam being enrolled in each field.
2. Estimate \(P(E|H)\), the probability of observing the sketch if Adam is in that field.
3. Estimate \(P(E|\neg H)\), the probability of observing the sketch if Adam is not in that field.
4. Calculate \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' Rule.

To simplify, let's assume we don't have concrete prior statistical data. We will use reasonable assumptions based on the personality sketch of Adam.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: Given Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, it's reasonable to assume the probability is higher for this field. Let's say \(P(H_{AV}) = 0.3\).
- **P(E|H)**: The personality traits like curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy strongly match with this field. Let's assign a high value: \(P(E|H_{AV}) = 0.9\).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: While these qualities can be spread across various other disciplines, they are uniquely strong for agricultural and veterinary science. We'll assign \(P(E|\neg H_{AV}) = 0.4\).

\[ P(H_{AV}|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} = \frac{0.27}{P(E)} \]

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: Considering the traits described, business administration doesn't align as closely with Adam's personality. Therefore, \(P(H_{BA}) = 0.05\).
- **P(E|H)**: The personality traits do not strongly correspond to business administration. Let's assign \(P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.2\).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Given that a large portion of other fields might not match the traits well, we can assume \(P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.6\).

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} = \frac{0.01}{P(E)} \]

### Calculations
To derive the precise \(P(H|E)\), we technically need \(P(E)\). However, since we're comparing the relative probabilities of the fields given the personality sketch, it's sufficient to compare the numerators of the fractions, given that:

\[ P(H_{AV}|E) = \frac{0.27}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.01}{P(E)} \]

Normalizing this:

\[ P(H_{AV}|E) \approx \frac{0.27}{0.27 + 0.01} \approx 0.964 \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx \frac{0.01}{0.27 + 0.01} \approx 0.036 \]

Thus,

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.964,
  "business administration": 0.036
}
