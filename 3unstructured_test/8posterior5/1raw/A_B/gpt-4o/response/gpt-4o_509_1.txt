To compute the probabilities of Adam being enrolled in either "agricultural and veterinary science" or "business administration," we start by estimating the different probabilities involved in Bayes' theorem. P(H) denotes the prior probability of Adam being in a certain field, P(E|H) denotes the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in a certain field, and P(E|\neg H) denotes the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in that field. Using these, we compute P(H|E), the probability of Adam being in a certain field given his personality sketch.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- P(H): The prior probability of a graduate student being in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume this is relatively low given the variety of fields. For example, assume P(H) = 0.05.
- P(E|H): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature, this is high. For example, assume P(E|H) = 0.8.
- P(E|\neg H): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. While such traits may be present in other fields, they are less common. For example, assume P(E|\neg H) = 0.2.

Using the formula for Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.8 \times 0.05 + 0.2 \times (1 - 0.05)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.19} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.23} \approx 0.174 \]

### Business Administration:
- P(H): The prior probability of a graduate student being in business administration. This is relatively higher compared to agriculture, as business programs are common. For example, assume P(H) = 0.2.
- P(E|H): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in business administration. This is low given his traits are not typically associated with business administration. For example, assume P(E|H) = 0.1.
- P(E|\neg H): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in business administration. This remains relatively similar across non-business fields. For example, assume P(E|\neg H) = 0.3.

Again, using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.1 \times 0.2 + 0.3 \times (1 - 0.2)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.24} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.26} \approx 0.077 \]

Thus, the calculated probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.174,
  "business administration": 0.077
}
