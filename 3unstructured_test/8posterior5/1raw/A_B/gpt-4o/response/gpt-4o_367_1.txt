To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch (E), we utilize Bayes' rule, which is formulated as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Let's start by making reasonable estimates for P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|\neg H) for each field: agricultural and veterinary science (denoted as \( H_a \)) and business administration (denoted as \( H_b \)).

1. **Agricultural and veterinary science (\( H_a \))**:
   - **P(H_a)**: Given that agricultural and veterinary science is a common field for people who have a genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, let's estimate this likelihood to be relatively high. Let's assume \( P(H_a) = 0.2 \).
   - **P(E|H_a)**: Adam's characteristics strongly match this field (interest in nature, animals, empathy, understanding hard work). Assume \( P(E|H_a) = 0.8 \).
   - **P(E|\neg H_a)**: The probability that someone not in agricultural and veterinary science matches Adam's personality. While it's possible, it's likely lower. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H_a) = 0.2 \).

2. **Business administration (\( H_b \))**:
   - **P(H_b)**: Business administration is a common graduate field. However, it’s less aligned with Adam’s interests and personality. Let's assume \( P(H_b) = 0.1 \).
   - **P(E|H_b)**: Adam’s characteristics are less fitting for business administration (abstract concepts are relevant but nature and animals are not). Assume \( P(E|H_b) = 0.1 \).
   - **P(E|\neg H_b)**: The probability of someone not in business administration matching Adam’s personality. Since many non-business fields could fit Adam, let’s estimate \( P(E|\neg H_b) = 0.6 \).

Now, using Bayes' rule, we calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

### Agricultural and veterinary science
\[ 
P(H_a|E) = \frac{P(E|H_a) \cdot P(H_a)}{P(E|H_a) \cdot P(H_a) + P(E|\neg H_a) \cdot P(\neg H_a)} 
\]
\[ 
P(H_a|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{0.8 \cdot 0.2 + 0.2 \cdot 0.8} 
\]
\[ 
P(H_a|E) = \frac{0.16}{0.16 + 0.16} 
\]
\[ 
P(H_a|E) = \frac{0.16}{0.32} 
\]
\[ 
P(H_a|E) = 0.5 
\]

### Business administration
\[ 
P(H_b|E) = \frac{P(E|H_b) \cdot P(H_b)}{P(E|H_b) \cdot P(H_b) + P(E|\neg H_b) \cdot P(\neg H_b)} 
\]
\[ 
P(H_b|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.1 \cdot 0.1 + 0.6 \cdot 0.9} 
\]
\[ 
P(H_b|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.54} 
\]
\[ 
P(H_b|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.55} 
\]
\[ 
P(H_b|E) \approx 0.018 
\]

Now, let's compile the results:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.018
}
```

These calculations suggest that, given Adam's personality sketch, it is more likely that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration.
