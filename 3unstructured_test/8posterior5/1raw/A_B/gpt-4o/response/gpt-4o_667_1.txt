To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E|\neg H) \). Here's the formulation of Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we are comparing two fields, we'll focus on evaluating \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch \( E \). Let's denote the fields as:

- \( H_{\text{BA}} \) for Business Administration
- \( H_{\text{AVS}} \) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science

We need to evaluate the probabilities subjectively based on the provided descriptions:

### Estimations:

#### Business Administration (\( H_{\text{BA}} \)):
1. **Prior Probability \(P(H_{\text{BA}})\)** - A reasonable assumption for any given student could be \[P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.2\]
2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H_{\text{BA}})\)** - The personality sketch aligns poorly with typical attributes of business students, so we estimate it low: \[P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1\]
3. **Complement Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}})\)** - If not in business, he is more likely to have those personality traits when compared to the base rate of other fields, so we assume a moderate value: \[P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.3\]

Using Bayes' Rule for \( H_{\text{BA}} \):

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.3} = \frac{0.02}{0.3} \approx 0.067 \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science (\( H_{\text{AVS}} \)):
1. **Prior Probability \(P(H_{\text{AVS}})\)** - A reasonable assumption for any agricultural sciences student could be \[P(H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.1\]
2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H_{\text{AVS}})\)** - The personality sketch aligns well with attributes common to this field, thus we estimate it high: \[P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.7\]
3. **Complement Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}})\)** - Similarly, if not in Agricultural/Veterinary Science, the personality sketch is less likely, assume \[P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.3\]

Using Bayes' Rule for \( H_{\text{AVS}} \):

\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.3} = \frac{0.07}{0.3} \approx 0.233 \]


Using these calculus and relationships, we can express our final answer as:

{
  "business administration": 0.067,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.233
}

Remember, these are subjective estimations based on the information provided. In real scenarios, base rates and conditional probabilities should be determined more rigorously.
