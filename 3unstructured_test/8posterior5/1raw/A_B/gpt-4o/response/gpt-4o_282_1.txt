Let's begin by defining our terms in the context of Bayes' theorem:

**Bayes' theorem** states that P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E).

- P(H) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
- P(E|H) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in that field.
- P(E|¬H) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in that field.
- P(H|E) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field given his personality sketch.

### For agricultural and veterinary science

#### Prior Probability P(H)
P(H): Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and high intelligence, it is reasonable to assume a relatively high prior probability. Let's estimate P(H) at 0.2.

#### Likelihood P(E|H)
P(E|H): Given the field's alignment with interests in plants, nature, and animals, P(E|H) should be quite high. Let's estimate P(E|H) at 0.9.

#### Probability P(E|¬H)
P(E|¬H): Given that E also fits other scientific fields, this might not be very low but reasonable. Let's estimate P(E|¬H) at 0.3.

### For business administration

#### Prior Probability P(H)
P(H): Adam's personality and interests do not strongly align with Business Administration. Let's estimate P(H) at 0.05.

#### Likelihood P(E|H)
P(E|H): Given the significant mismatch between E and business administration traits, let's estimate P(E|H) at 0.1.

#### Probability P(E|¬H)
P(E|¬H): This is quite similar to the general probability of E not aligning with other fields. Let's estimate P(E|¬H) at 0.3.

### Applying Bayes' theorem

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|¬H) * (1 - P(H))]
        
P(H|E) = [0.9 * 0.2] / [0.9 * 0.2 + 0.3 * 0.8]

P(H|E) = 0.18 / (0.18 + 0.24)

P(H|E) = 0.18 / 0.42

P(H|E) ≈ 0.428 

#### Business Administration
P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|¬H) * (1 - P(H))]

P(H|E) = [0.1 * 0.05] / [0.1 * 0.05 + 0.3 * 0.95]

P(H|E) = 0.005 / (0.005 + 0.285)

P(H|E) = 0.005 / 0.29

P(H|E) ≈ 0.017
