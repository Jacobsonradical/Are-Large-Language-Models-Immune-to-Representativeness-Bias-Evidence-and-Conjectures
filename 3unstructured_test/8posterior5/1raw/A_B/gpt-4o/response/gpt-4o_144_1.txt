To calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in various graduate fields given the personality sketch \( E \) using Bayes' rule, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Assess the Prior Probability \( P(H) \):** This is the initial probability of Adam being enrolled in each field before considering his personality traits.
2. **Assess the Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** This is the probability of Adam having the described personality traits given that he is enrolled in that field.
3. **Assess the Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):** This is the probability of Adam having the described personality traits given that he is not enrolled in that field.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant ensuring the probabilities sum to 1 over all considered hypotheses. Since \( P(E) \) is difficult to determine precisely with the given information, we will focus on comparing the relative posterior probabilities.

Let's go through the fields:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Assume a higher priori probability because it directly aligns with Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals. Let's estimate \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This field strongly resonates with Adamâ€™s personality (love for nature and animals). Estimating \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).
3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This should be lower as fewer other fields would match his profile. Estimating \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

### Business Administration
1. **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Assume a lower prior probability given no direct personality match with business traits. Let's estimate \( P(H) = 0.05 \).
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This field indirectly matches some traits (e.g., appreciation for hard work). Estimating \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).
3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Given many non-business fields fit Adam more, estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

Now applying Bayes' rule proportionally:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E)_{agric} \propto 0.9 \cdot 0.2 = 0.18 \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E)_{business} \propto 0.3 \cdot 0.05 = 0.015 \]

Normalizing proportionally:
\[ P(H|E)_{total} = 0.18 + 0.015 = 0.195 \]

Final probabilities:
\[ P(H|E)_{agric} = \frac{0.18}{0.195} \approx 0.923 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{business} = \frac{0.015}{0.195} \approx 0.077 \]

Therefore:
