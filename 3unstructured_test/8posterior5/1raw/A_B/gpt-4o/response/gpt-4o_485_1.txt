Let's go through each field step by step.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
1. **P(H)**: The probability that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science without any additional information. Since this is just one possibility among many graduate fields of study, let's assume P(H) is reasonably small but not insignificant. Let's say P(H) = 0.1.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing E (Adam's personality sketch) given that H (Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science) is true. Adam's deep curiosity about nature, love for animals, and understanding of hard work all align well with this field. So, let's set P(E|H) = 0.8.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing E given that H is not true (Adam is enrolled in some other field). While it's possible for someone in another field to have such a personality, it's less likely. Let's say P(E|\neg H) = 0.2.

Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Using the normalization constant \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.18 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.26 \]

Now, compute \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.3077 \]

### Business Administration:
1. **P(H)**: The probability that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration without any additional information. Again, let's assume P(H) is reasonably small but not insignificant. Let's say P(H) = 0.1.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing E given that H (Adam is enrolled in Business Administration) is true. Adam's personality traits, such as a love for solving puzzles and high intelligence, may align with Business Administration, but his strong curiosity about nature and animals makes this less likely. Let's set P(E|H) = 0.2.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing E given that H is not true. We already used this before so it remains P(E|\neg H) = 0.2.

Using Bayes' Rule again:
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.18 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.2 \]

Now compute \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.2} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.1 \]

Hence, the result will be:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3077,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These values represent the posterior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each respective field given his personality sketch.
