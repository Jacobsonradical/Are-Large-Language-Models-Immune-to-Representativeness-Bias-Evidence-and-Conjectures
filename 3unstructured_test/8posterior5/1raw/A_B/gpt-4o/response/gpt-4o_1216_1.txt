To calculate the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for both fields given the personality sketch of Adam, we need to apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that \( P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \), and knowing \(\neg H\) includes all other fields apart from the specified ones, we need to make assumptions about these probabilities.

Let's consider priors for each hypothesis based on common distribution of graduate enrollments in the U.S. and our knowledge about Adam's interests and skills. This is a subjective estimation based on provided information.

For "business administration":
- \( P(H) \) (prior probability Adam is in business administration): 0.1
- \( P(E|H) \) (probability that Adam's personality sketch matches business administration): 0.1
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) (probability that Adam's personality sketch matches any other field): 0.4

For "agricultural and veterinary science":
- \( P(H) \) (prior probability Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science): 0.15
- \( P(E|H) \) (probability that Adam's personality sketch matches agricultural and veterinary science): 0.7
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) (probability that Adam's personality sketch matches any other field): 0.4

We can now calculate \( P(E) \) if we assume only these two fields and a general field somehow balances out to simplify the calculation:

\[ P(E) = (P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \times P(H_{\text{business}})) + (P(E|H_{\text{agricultural}}) \times P(H_{\text{agricultural}})) + (\sum P(H_{\text{other}})P(E|H_{\text{other}})) \]

However, given our assumptions, we will average out the others roughly for computation ease.

### For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{business}} = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \times P(H_{\text{business}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.1 \times 0.1}{(0.1 \times 0.1) + (0.7 \times 0.15) + x} \]
\[ = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.105 + x} \]
\[
P(H|E)_{\text{business}} \approx \frac{0.01}{0.115 + x}
\]
Given a general assumption for x being the sum of small contributions of other fields, approximate as negligible here (say x ~0.1), it gives roughly:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{business}} \approx \frac{0.01}{0.22} \approx 0.045 \]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural}} = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agricultural}}) \times P(H_{\text{agricultural}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.7 \times 0.15}{(0.1 \times 0.1) + (0.7 \times 0.15) + x} \]
\[ = \frac{0.105}{0.01 + 0.105 + x} \]
\[
P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural}} \approx \frac{0.105}{0.115 + x}
\]
Under a same simplicity for x:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural}} \approx \frac{0.105}{0.22} \approx 0.477 \]

Therefore, given these assumptions the resulting probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.045,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.477
}
```
