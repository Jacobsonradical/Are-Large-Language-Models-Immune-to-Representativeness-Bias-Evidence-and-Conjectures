Sure, let's break it down step by step using Bayes' Theorem. 

Given:
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is enrolled in that particular field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is not enrolled in that particular field.
- \( P(H|E) \): Posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field given the evidence.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, instead of computing \( P(E) \), we will provide the values in a comparative manner since we’re only interested in relative values.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   Let's assume P(H) is moderate since Adam is a graduate student and many areas of study might have similar base rates.
   \[ P(H) \approx 0.1 \]
   
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   Adam's personality sketch closely aligns with interests common in Agricultural and Veterinary Sciences (nature, plants, love for animals).
   \[ P(E|H) \approx 0.7 \]
   
3. **Complementary Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   It’s less likely but not impossible to have this personality in other fields.
   \[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.1 \]

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   Similarly, let's assume a moderate base rate.
   \[ P(H) \approx 0.1 \]
   
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   Adam's personality sketch is less aligned with common traits in Business Administration programs.
   \[ P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \]
   
3. **Complementary Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   Given the variety of fields, this remains moderately likely.
   \[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \]

Now, applying Bayes’ Theorem comparatively (without needing the exact value for \( P(E) \)):

\[
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H)
\]

So,
1. For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
   \[
   P(H|E) \propto 0.7 \times 0.1 = 0.07
   \]

2. For Business Administration:
   \[
   P(H|E) \propto 0.2 \times 0.1 = 0.02
   \]

Hence, the relative posterior probabilities are:
\[
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \approx 0.07,
  "business administration": \approx 0.02
}
\]

Given these calculations and interpretations, we can conclude:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```
