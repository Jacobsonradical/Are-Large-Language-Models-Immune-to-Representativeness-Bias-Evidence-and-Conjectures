### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: Business administration is a common field of study among graduate students, so let's assume P(H) for it is moderate, say 0.15 (15%).

2. **P(E|H)**: Adam has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication, which is relevant in business administration, but his interests seem more aligned with nature and animals. So let's assume P(E|H) is low, say 0.05 (5%).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of E given he is not in business administration but in some other field is higher due to his specific interests in nature and animals. Let's assume this as 0.95 (95%).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We don't have P(E), but we can use a proportionality approach for comparison:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

So,
\[ P_{\text{business administration}} \propto 0.05 \times 0.15 = 0.0075 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: Given Adam's interests, agricultural and veterinary science are more specific fields. Let's assume P(H) for agricultural and veterinary science is lower because it's a less common field, say 0.05 (5%).

2. **P(E|H)**: Adamâ€™s personality sketch closely aligns with this field since it involves nature, plants, and animals. Let's assume P(E|H) is high, say 0.80 (80%).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: If Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science but in some other field, the probability still remains high because other fields might still relate to his interests. Say 0.20 (20%).

Using the same Bayes' Rule proportionality approach:

\[ P_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} \propto 0.80 \times 0.05 = 0.04 \]

Considering the proportional values:

\[ P_{\text{business administration}} = \frac{0.0075}{0.0075 + 0.04} \approx 0.158 \]
\[ P_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} = \frac{0.04}{0.0075 + 0.04} \approx 0.842 \]

So, the final estimated probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.158,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.842
}
