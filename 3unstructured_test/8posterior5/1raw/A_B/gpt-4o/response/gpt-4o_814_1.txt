To use Bayes' rule for computing \( P(H|E) \) (the probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field given his personality sketch), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Define the prior probability \( P(H) \)**: The initial guessing probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field before considering the personality sketch. Let’s assume the prior probabilities are the same for simplicity in this situation (0.5 for both fields).

2. **Define the likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of Adam having the given personality traits if he was enrolled in that field.

3. **Define the likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of Adam having the given personality traits if he wasn't enrolled in that field.

4. **Compute posterior probability \( P(H|E) \)**: Using Bayes' rule.

### 1. Prior Probability \( P(H) \)
Assume the prior probability is the same for both fields:
- \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.5 \)

### 2. Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)
- For agricultural and veterinary science: Given Adam’s strong empathy, deep love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, it is very likely that his personality fits someone in this field. Thus, let’s assume \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.9 \).

- For business administration: Adam’s traits, like high intelligence and problem-solving skills, fit many graduate fields including business administration. However, his strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature are less typical in business administration. Therefore, let’s assume \( P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.4 \).

### 3. Prior Probability of Negation \( P(E|\neg H) \)
This involves assessing the probability of Adam having the given personality traits if he was not enrolled in the specific field. Let’s use a general probability, considering the personality sketch could fit several other fields:
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.6 \)

### 4. Compute Posterior Probability Using Bayes' Rule
Bayes' rule: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

#### For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(E) = 0.9 \cdot 0.5 + 0.3 \cdot 0.5 = 0.6 \]

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.5}{0.6} = 0.75 \]

#### For business administration:
\[ P(E) = 0.4 \cdot 0.5 + 0.6 \cdot 0.5 = 0.5 \]

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = 0.4 \]

### Final Answer

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.4
}
