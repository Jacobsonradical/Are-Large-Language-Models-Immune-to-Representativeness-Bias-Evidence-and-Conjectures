To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given Adam's personality sketch (E), we'll use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was NOT enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch.

Given the limited information, we'll make some subjective estimations:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H_1) \): Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Given Adam's strong affinity for nature, plants, and animals, it's reasonable to assume \( P(E|H_1) \) is quite high.
   
   - \( P(H) \): Assume the general probability of being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is 0.05 (since not everyone is enrolled in this specialized field).
   - \( P(E|H_1) \): Given the personality sketch, let's assume this probability to be 0.8.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_1) \): Assume a lower probability for the complement since not all fields have graduates with these traits; let's assume 0.1.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H_2) \): Adam is enrolled in business administration.
   - Given Adam's traits of empathy and understanding hard work might be somewhat relevant but are less directly indicative of this field, \( P(E|H_2) \) is relatively lower than for agricultural and veterinary science.
   
   - \( P(H) \): Assume the general probability of being enrolled in business administration is higher due to its popularity, let's use 0.15.
   - \( P(E|H_2) \): Given the personality sketch, let's assume this probability to be around 0.3.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_2) \): Assume a slightly higher probability for the complement because many fields could have such traits, let's use 0.2.

Now we compute \( P(H|E) \):

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} \]

2. **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both calculations and considering we are looking for relative values:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H_1|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.08} = \frac{0.04}{0.08} = 0.5 \]

2. **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H_2|E) \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.15}{0.08} = \frac{0.045}{0.08} = 0.5625 \]

While the absolute values provided are not intended to sum to 1 due to the presence of other potential fields, they give us a way to compare the relative likelihood within this limited scope:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.5625
}
