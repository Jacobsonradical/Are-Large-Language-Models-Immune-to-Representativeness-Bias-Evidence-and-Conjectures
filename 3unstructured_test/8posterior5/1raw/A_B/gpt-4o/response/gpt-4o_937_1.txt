Sure, to compute the probabilities using Bayes' rule, we need to assess the prior probability \( P(H) \) that Adam was enrolled in each field, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) which is the probability of the personality sketch given he was enrolled in that field, and the likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \) which is the probability of the personality sketch given he was not enrolled in that field. Here are my estimates and calculations:

### 1. Business Administration

- **Prior probability \( P(H) \)**: The probability that a graduate student is enrolled in business administration. Given the variety of graduate fields, a rough estimate might be 0.15 (assuming there are numerous equally likely fields).

- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability that a student in business administration would have a personality sketch like Adam's.
  - Adam's interest in puzzles, nature, and animals might be less likely in business administration, so I will estimate this at 0.3.

- **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability that a student not in business administration would have such a personality sketch.
  - Given how broad other fields are and that his interests seem particularly attuned to fields like science, I will estimate this as approximately 0.8.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))} \]

\[ P(H|E)_{business\ administration} = \frac{0.3 \times 0.15}{(0.3 \times 0.15) + (0.8 \times 0.85)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.68} \]
\[ = \frac{0.045}{0.725} \]
\[ \approx 0.062 \]

### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **Prior probability \( P(H) \)**: The probability that a graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given the numerous fields, I might estimate this around 0.1 (assuming there are numerous equally likely fields).

- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability that a student in agricultural and veterinary science would have a personality sketch like Adam's.
  - Adam's characteristics (strong empathy, love for animals, interest in nature) fit well in this field, so I will estimate this at 0.9.

- **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability that a student not in agricultural and veterinary science would have such a personality sketch.
  - Given how specific his fit is, I would estimate this as approximately 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E)_{agricultural\ and\ veterinary\ science} = \frac{0.9 \times 0.1}{(0.9 \times 0.1) + (0.3 \times 0.9)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.27} \]
\[ = \frac{0.09}{0.36} \]
\[ = 0.25 \]

Thus, the results are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.062,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.25
}
