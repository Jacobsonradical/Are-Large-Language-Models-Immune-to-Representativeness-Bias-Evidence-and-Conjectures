Given the personality sketch of Adam, we need to analyze the probabilities related to two fields of graduate study: agricultural and veterinary science, and business administration.

### Definitions
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the specified field without any information from the personality sketch.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in the specified field.
- **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in the specified field.
- **P(H|E)**: The posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in the specified field given the personality sketch, computed using Bayes' rule.

### Bayes' Rule
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where:
- \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \)

Since we are only comparing two specific fields, we can evaluate the relative probabilities and don't need the exact overall denominator term.

### Judging Probabilities
#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: Assuming a moderate prior because it is a common field but not overwhelmingly so.
  \[
  P(H_{\text{agriculture}}) \approx 0.2 
  \]
- **P(E|H)**: The sketch aligns well with this field. High curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, love for animals.
  \[
  P(E|H_{\text{agriculture}}) \approx 0.8 
  \]
- **P(E|¬H)**: Less aligned with typical graduate fields that don't focus on nature, animals, and plants.
  \[
  P(E|¬H_{\text{agriculture}}) \approx 0.2 
  \]

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H_{\text{agriculture}}|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \times 0.2}{0.8 \times 0.2 + 0.2 \times 0.8} = 0.5 \]

#### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: A very common field for graduate studies, so prior probability could be moderately high.
  \[
  P(H_{\text{business}}) \approx 0.2
  \]
- **P(E|H)**: The sketch is less aligned. Interest in puzzles and abstract concepts could fit, but the love for nature, plants, and animals doesn’t typically align.
  \[
  P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \approx 0.2
  \]
- **P(E|¬H)**: More aligned with fields that are not expressly unrelated to nature, animals, and empathy (like most others).
  \[
  P(E|¬H_{\text{business}}) \approx 0.8 
  \]

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) \approx \frac{0.2 \times 0.2}{0.2 \times 0.2 + 0.8 \times 0.2} = 0.2 \]

### Summary
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```
This suggests that given the personality sketch, Adam is more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science as opposed to business administration.
