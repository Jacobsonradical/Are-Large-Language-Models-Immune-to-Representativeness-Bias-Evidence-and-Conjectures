Let's break down the problem:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of the personality traits given that Adam is in that field.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood of the personality traits given that Adam is not in that field.
4. **P(H|E)**: The posterior probability that Adam is in that field given the personality traits E, which we can calculate using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Note that \( P(E) \) is a normalization constant ensuring probabilities sum up to 1 for all possible hypotheses, but if we are only comparing two fields, we can simplify the calculation by evaluating their relative probabilities.

Let's assign and assume values to these probabilities:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H)**: Assume a moderate prior probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's say 0.1.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam’s traits given he is in this field seems high because his love for nature, plants, animals, and his understanding of hard work align well with this field. Let's say 0.8.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood of these traits given he is *not* in this field is lower, as not all fields would align so well with these traits. Let's say 0.3.

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)**: Assume a moderate to high prior probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in business administration due to its popularity. Let's say 0.2.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam’s traits given he is in this field seems lower. Although business requires intelligence and understanding of hard work, love for nature, plants, and animals is less relevant. Let's say 0.4.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood of these traits given he is *not* in this field would be somewhat similar to the general pool. Let's say 0.6.

Now we calculate the posterior using Bayes' rule for a simplified comparison (not normalizing \( P(E) \)):

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural}} \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{business}} \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.4 \cdot 0.2 = 0.08 \]

Given these simplified calculations, both fields end up with the same posterior probability. However, if we normalize or calculate more accurately, agricultural and veterinary science would likely have a slightly higher posterior due to a better match on the interests.

### Answer

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08,
  "business administration": 0.08
}
```

(Note: More precise real-world priors and likelihoods are needed for an exact calculation, and understanding the total \( P(E) \) would provide normalized posteriors. This answer aims for a relative comparison based on the given traits.)
