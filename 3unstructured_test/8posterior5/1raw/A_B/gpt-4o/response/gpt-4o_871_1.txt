To calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we first need to estimate the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the marginal likelihood \( P(E) \). Given the constraints, we'll have to make educated assumptions about these probabilities.

### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

**Prior Probability, \( P(H) \):**
We estimate that the probability of a graduate student being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is moderate, given that it's a relatively common field but not the most popular.

\[ P(H)_{agricultural} = 0.10 \]

**Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \):**
Adam's characteristics match well with someone in this field: a genuine curiosity about nature, a love for animals, and a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work.

\[ P(E|H)_{agricultural} = 0.85 \]

**Likelihood under Complement, \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
The likelihood of Adam's traits fitting some other field's student is moderate because empathy, intelligence, and puzzle-solving are valuable in various fields.

\[ P(E|\neg H)_{agricultural} = 0.20 \]

### 2. Business Administration

**Prior Probability, \( P(H) \):**
We estimate that the probability of a graduate student being enrolled in business administration is relatively high given its widespread popularity.

\[ P(H)_{business} = 0.20 \]

**Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \):**
Adam's traits do not particularly align with business administration. Empathy and intelligence are useful, but curiosity about nature and deep love for animals are less relevant.

\[ P(E|H)_{business} = 0.10 \]

**Likelihood under Complement, \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
Again, the likelihood of Adam's traits fitting some other field is moderate.

\[ P(E|\neg H)_{business} = 0.20 \]

### Bayes' Rule Calculation

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We can normalize across these fields by including the marginal likelihood, which we simplify here as assuming the sum of likelihoods relevant to the context.

For **agricultural and veterinary science**:

\[ P(H|E)_{agricultural} = \frac{P(E|H)_{agricultural} \cdot P(H)_{agricultural}}{P(E)} \]

For **business administration**:

\[ P(H|E)_{business} = \frac{P(E|H)_{business} \cdot P(H)_{business}}{P(E)} \]

\(P(E)\) can be seen as a normalizing constant for these two probabilities, but we'll keep the structure as given above for simplicity.

### Calculations Summary

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(H|E)_{agricultural} = \frac{0.85 \times 0.10}{P(E)} = 0.085 \]

**Business Administration:**
\[ P(H|E)_{business} = \frac{0.10 \times 0.20}{P(E)} = 0.02 \]

Considering the normalization over multiple fields:

### Final Posterior Probabilities

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.085,
  "business administration": 0.02
}
```

Note: These values are not true probabilities in the strict statistical sense but rather the scaled likelihoods that show a relatively higher or lower fit of Adam’s personality sketch to the given fields. For rigorous normalization, we’d need to sum these across other possible graduate fields as well.
