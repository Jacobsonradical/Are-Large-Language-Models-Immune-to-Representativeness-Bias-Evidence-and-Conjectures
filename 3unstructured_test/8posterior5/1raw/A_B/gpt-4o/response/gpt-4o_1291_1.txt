To utilize Bayes' theorem to compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) for each given field, we need to analyze \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Bayesian inference will help us update the probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch \( E \).

### Analysis of Probabilities:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \(P(H)\): The prior probability that a graduate student in the U.S. is studying Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Let’s assume a rough estimate based on available data; this could be relatively low but not negligible (let’s assume 0.05).
   - \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood that Adam, given his personality sketch \( E \), is studying Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy, this is relatively high. Let’s assume 0.8.
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\): The likelihood that Adam, given that he is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, still matches his personality sketch \( E \). Since there are multiple other fields he could be in, this is moderate. Let’s assume 0.3.

   Using Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

2. **Business Administration**:
   - \(P(H)\): The prior probability that a graduate student in the U.S. is studying Business Administration. Business Administration is a popular field, so this prior is higher. Let’s assume 0.2.
   - \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood that Adam, given his personality sketch \( E \), is studying Business Administration. His love for nature and animals and his empathetic nature makes this less likely. Let’s assume 0.1.
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\): The likelihood that Adam, given that he is not in Business Administration, still matches his personality sketch \( E \). This remains moderate. Let’s assume 0.35.

   Using Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

### Step-by-step Calculation:

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[
P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.3 \cdot 0.95) = 0.04 + 0.285 = 0.325
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.325} = \frac{0.04}{0.325} \approx 0.123
\]
So, 
\[
P(H|E) \approx 0.123
\]

#### Business Administration:
\[
P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.35 \cdot 0.8) = 0.02 + 0.28 = 0.3
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.3} = \frac{0.02}{0.3} \approx 0.067
\]
So,
\[
P(H|E) \approx 0.067
\]

### Final Answer:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.123,
  "business administration": 0.067
}
