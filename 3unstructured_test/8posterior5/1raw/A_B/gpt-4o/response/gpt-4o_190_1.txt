Let's break it down step by step:

1. **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
2. **P(E|H)**: This is the probability of the personality sketch occurring given that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: This is the probability of the personality sketch occurring given that Adam is not enrolled in that specific field.
4. **P(H|E)**: This is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given the personality sketch, which we can calculate using Bayes' rule: \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \).

We'll calculate for both fields: Business Administration and Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: Let's assume there's no reason to think that Adam is more or less likely to be in any specific field than another. Let's assume a moderate prior probability, say 0.1.
   
2. **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's personality sketch, he doesn't seem to fit the typical personality traits that are commonly associated with business administration students. Let's assume this to be moderately low, say 0.2.

3. **P(E|¬H)**: This encompasses all other fields, including ones that might match his personality traits better. Given his traits, we'll assume this to be moderately high, maybe around 0.5.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: The prior for Agricultural and Veterinary Science should be the same moderate value initially considered, 0.1.
   
2. **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's personality traits, this appears to be a good fit. Let's assume a high value, say 0.8.

3. **P(E|¬H)**: This encompasses all other fields and would be lower as we've allotted better compatibility here. For this, we can assume maybe around 0.3.

### Calculate P(H|E) using Bayes' rule:

We can simplify the fraction \(
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)}
\) by noting that \( P(E) \) is the sum of all possible scenarios: \[
P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)
\]

#### For Business Administration:

1. **Numerator \( = P(E|H) * P(H) = 0.2 * 0.1 = 0.02 \)**
2. **Denominator \( = (0.2 * 0.1) + (0.5 * 0.9) = 0.02 + 0.45 = 0.47 \)**
3. **P(H|E) = 0.02 / 0.47 ≈ 0.043 \)**

#### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

1. **Numerator \( = P(E|H) * P(H) = 0.8 * 0.1 = 0.08 \)**
2. **Denominator \( = (0.8 * 0.1) + (0.3 * 0.9) = 0.08 + 0.27 = 0.35 \)**
3. **P(H|E) = 0.08 / 0.35 ≈ 0.229 \)**

Thus, the updated posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.043,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.229
}
```
