To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field of study given his personality sketch (E), we will use Bayes' Rule. The rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll assume reasonable values for the problem parameters to make the calculations.

### 1. Business Administration
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that any randomly selected graduate student is in business administration. Let's assume this is around 0.20.
- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing the personality sketch E for a student in business administration. Considering the traits described, it’s less likely that they align with a typical business administration student, but certainly not impossible. Let's assume this is around 0.10.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of observing E among students not in business administration. Given Adam's traits, this might be relatively common outside business administration, let's say around 0.30.

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.10 \times 0.20}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have \( P(E) \) explicitly, we can note that \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Let's denote \( H1 \) for business administration and \( H2 \) for all other fields, with \( \neg H \) being 0.80:

\[ P(E) = 0.10 \times 0.20 + 0.30 \times 0.80 = 0.02 + 0.24 = 0.26 \]

Thus, the posterior probability:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.10 \times 0.20}{0.26} \approx 0.077 \]

### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that any randomly selected graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume this is around 0.05.
- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing the personality sketch E for a student in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam’s traits, it is highly likely (empathy, love for nature, animals). Let's assume this is around 0.70.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of observing E among students not in agricultural and veterinary science. Given the specificity of Adam’s traits, it’s likely lower outside this field. Let’s assume this at 0.25.

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.70 \times 0.05}{P(E)} \]

Again, noting that \( P(E) \) can be calculated as:

\[ P(E) = 0.70 \times 0.05 + 0.25 \times 0.95 = 0.035 + 0.2375 = 0.2725 \]

Thus, the posterior probability:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.70 \times 0.05}{0.2725} \approx 0.128 \]

### Result:
Here are the final probabilities based on our assumptions and calculations:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.077,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.128
}
```

These values represent the posterior probabilities that Adam was enrolled in business administration or agricultural and veterinary science, given his personality sketch.
