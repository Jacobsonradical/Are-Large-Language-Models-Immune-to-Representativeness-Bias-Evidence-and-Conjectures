Let's utilize the Bayes rule to compute \( P(H | E) \). The Bayes rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis, \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis, \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence, and \( P(E| \neg H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis. 

In our case:

- \( P(H) \) denotes the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \) denotes the probability that Adam has the described personality traits given that he was enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E| \neg H) \) denotes the probability that Adam has the described personality traits given that he was not enrolled in a specific field.

Considering the details provided in the personality sketch:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: 
    - Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals fits well within agricultural and veterinary science.
    - It's reasonable to assume \( P(E|H) \) (the likelihood of Adam's personality given that he is in this field) is high.
    - However, we consider how common this field is among all possible graduate fields.

2. **Business Administration**: 
    - Adam's traits do not directly correlate with business administration as well as they do with agricultural and veterinary science.
    - It's reasonable to assume \( P(E|H) \) (the likelihood of Adam's personality given that he is in this field) is lower.
    - Again, consider how common this field is among graduate fields.

We'll denote estimated values for these probabilities and perform the computation:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \approx 0.10 \) (10% likelihood prior)
- \( P(E|H) \approx 0.80 \) (80% likelihood given his traits match well)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.30 \) (30% likelihood given these traits might be present in other fields but less likely)

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Since \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \) and \( P(\neg H) = 0.90 \):

\[ P(E) = (0.80 \times 0.10) + (0.30 \times 0.90) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.27 = 0.35 \]

So,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.10}{0.35} \approx 0.229 \]

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \approx 0.20 \) (20% likelihood prior)
- \( P(E|H) \approx 0.10 \) (10% likelihood given his traits do not match well)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.35 \) (35% likelihood given these traits are more common in other fields)

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Since \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \) and \( P(\neg H) = 0.80 \):

\[ P(E) = (0.10 \times 0.20) + (0.35 \times 0.80) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.28 = 0.30 \]

So,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.10 \times 0.20}{0.30} \approx 0.067 \]

Summarizing the results:
