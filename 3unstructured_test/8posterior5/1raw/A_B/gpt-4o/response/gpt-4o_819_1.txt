First, let's outline the relevant terms and how they might relate to Adam's personality sketch \( E \):

- \( P(H) \): Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the given field without knowing the personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \): Probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in the field.
- \( P(H|E) \): Probability of Adam being enrolled in the field given the personality sketch, calculated using Bayes' Rule: \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \).

### Business Administration
- **P(H):** Business administration is a common field, so its prior probability is relatively moderate. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
- **P(E|H):** The personality sketch mentions a genuine curiosity about nature, a warm heart, and a love for animals, which are less aligned with typical qualities for business administration graduates. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.05 \).
- **P(E|\neg H):** Given the broader graduate population, it's more likely to find someone with Adam's personality characteristics outside business administration. Let \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(H)P(E|H) + P(\neg H)P(E|\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.1 \times 0.05 + 0.9 \times 0.3 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.005 + 0.27 = 0.275 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.1}{0.275} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.275} \approx 0.018 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H):** Agricultural and veterinary science is less common but still quite specialized. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).
- **P(E|H):** Adam's personality sketch is highly aligned with this field: strong appreciation for nature, plants, animals, and empathy. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).
- **P(E|\neg H):** For the non-specialized population, these characteristics are less commonly all present together in other fields. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(H)P(E|H) + P(\neg H)P(E|\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.05 \times 0.7 + 0.95 \times 0.2 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.035 + 0.19 = 0.225 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.05}{0.225} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.035}{0.225} \approx 0.156 \]

Here are the results:
