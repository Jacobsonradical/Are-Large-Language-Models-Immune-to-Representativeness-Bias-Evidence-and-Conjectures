To compute \( P(H|E) \), we can use Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalization constant, we are primarily interested in the relative values of \( P(H|E) \), so we can focus on \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for each field.

Given Adam's personality sketch \( E \), we can assess:

- \( P(E|H_{a}) \): The probability of Adam's personality given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H_{b}) \): The probability of Adam's personality given that he is enrolled in business administration.
  
From the description, let's make reasonable predictions for these probabilities:

1. **Agricultural and veterinary science (H\_{a})**:
   - \( P(H_{a}) \): Assume graduate students are evenly distributed, so we estimate around 10% (0.1) for agricultural and veterinary science.
   - \( P(E|H_{a}) \): Given Adam's love for nature, animals, and empathy, this field aligns well with his personality. Thus, \( P(E|H_{a}) \) is higher, say 0.8.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{a}) \): This reflects the probability of Adam's personality across all other fields. Given Adam's high alignment with agriculture and veterinary science, this might be lower, say 0.3.

2. **Business administration (H\_{b})**:
   - \( P(H_{b}) \): Assume graduate students are evenly distributed, so we estimate around 10% (0.1) for business administration.
   - \( P(E|H_{b}) \): This field does not align particularly well with Adam's specified personality traits. Thus, \( P(E|H_{b}) \) is lower, say 0.2.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{b}) \): This reflects the probability of Adam's personality across all other fields except business administration, which might be higher, say 0.6.

Now we use these values to compute \( P(H_{a}|E) \) and \( P(H_{b}|E) \):

\[
P(H_{a}|E) \propto P(E|H_{a}) \cdot P(H_{a}) \approx 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08
\]

\[
P(H_{b}|E) \propto P(E|H_{b}) \cdot P(H_{b}) \approx 0.2 \cdot 0.1 = 0.02
\]

Normalizing:

Since we only focus on these two fields and their values, we observe that,
\[
P(H_{a}|E) \approx \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.02} = \frac{0.08}{0.10} = 0.8
\]

\[
P(H_{b}|E) \approx \frac{0.02}{0.08 + 0.02} = \frac{0.02}{0.10} = 0.2
\]

Hence,

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
