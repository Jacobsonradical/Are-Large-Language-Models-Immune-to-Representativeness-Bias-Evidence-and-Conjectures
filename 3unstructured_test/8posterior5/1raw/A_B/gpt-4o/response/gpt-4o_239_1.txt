To calculate \( P(H|E) \), I'll use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll need to estimate the values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Unfortunately, we don't have explicit values, so we'll need to use reasonable estimates based on the description provided. Let's start by estimating these probabilities for both fields:

### 1. Business Administration

**P(H):** Probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration.
Given that Business Administration is a common graduate field, let's assign it a moderate prior probability:
\[ P(H) = 0.2 \]

**P(E|H):** Probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration.
Adam's personality traits, such as a love for nature, animals, and puzzles, as well as his empathy, do not strongly align with the characteristics typically associated with Business Administration students. Thus, we'll assign a low probability:
\[ P(E|H) = 0.1 \]

**P(E|\neg H):** Probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in Business Administration.
Since Adam's traits are more likely to be found in non-business fields, we'll assign a higher probability here:
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \]

### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

**P(H):** Probability that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
Given Adam's love for nature and animals, let's assign a moderate to high prior probability:
\[ P(H) = 0.15 \]

**P(E|H):** Probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
Adam's traits align well with students in this field. We'll assign a high probability:
\[ P(E|H) = 0.8 \]

**P(E|\neg H):** Probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
Adam's traits are less likely to be found in the rest of the graduate fields:
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \]

Using these estimates and Bayes' rule, we can calculate \( P(H|E) \).

### Calculations

1. **Business Administration**

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \), we have:
\[ P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.8 = 0.02 + 0.4 = 0.42 \]

So:
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.42} = \frac{0.02}{0.42} \approx 0.048 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \), we have:
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.3 \cdot 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.255 = 0.375 \]

So:
\[ P(H|E)_{AgVet} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.375} = \frac{0.12}{0.375} \approx 0.32 \]
