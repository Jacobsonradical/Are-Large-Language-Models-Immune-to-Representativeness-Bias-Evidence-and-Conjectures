To assess the probabilities of Adam being enrolled in different graduate fields based on his personality sketch, let's use Bayes' theorem as follows:
\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} 
\]

Given:
- \(P(H)\) = Prior probability of Adam being in a particular field.
- \(P(E|H)\) = Probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in that field.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\) = Probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is **not** in that field.

Let's make some reasonable assumptions for the likelihoods and prior probabilities:

1. **Business Administration**
   - \(P(H_{BA})\) (Prior probability of being in Business Administration): It's a common field but less aligned with the given personality sketch. Let's assume 10%.
   - \(P(E|H_{BA})\) (Probability of Adam's personality sketch given Business Administration): Based on the sketch, it seems less likely. Let's assume 0.05.
   - \(P(E|\neg H_{BA})\) (Probability of Adam's personality sketch given not Business Administration): Let's assume an average likelihood, say 0.25.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - \(P(H_{AVS})\) (Prior probability of being in Agricultural and Veterinary Science): Less common as a field but highly aligned with the sketch. Let's assume 5%.
   - \(P(E|H_{AVS})\) (Probability of Adam's personality sketch given Agricultural and Veterinary Science): Very high given the description. Let's assume 0.90.
   - \(P(E|\neg H_{AVS})\) (Probability of Adam's personality sketch given not Agricultural and Veterinary Science): Again, an average likelihood, so 0.25.

Now, let's calculate \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' theorem for each field:

### For Business Administration:
\[ 
P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} 
\]

Simplify by estimating \(P(E)\):
\[ 
P(E) \approx P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{BA}))
\]
\[ 
P(E) \approx 0.05 \cdot 0.10 + 0.25 \cdot 0.90 = 0.005 + 0.225 = 0.23
\]

Thus:
\[ 
P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.10}{0.23} = \frac{0.005}{0.23} \approx 0.0217
\]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ 
P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)} 
\]

Simplify by estimating \(P(E)\):
\[ 
P(E) \approx P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) + P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{AVS}))
\]
\[ 
P(E) \approx 0.90 \cdot 0.05 + 0.25 \cdot 0.95 = 0.045 + 0.2375 = 0.2825
\]

Thus:
\[ 
P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.90 \cdot 0.05}{0.2825} = \frac{0.045}{0.2825} \approx 0.1593
\]

So the final answers in the required format:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0217,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.1593
}
```
