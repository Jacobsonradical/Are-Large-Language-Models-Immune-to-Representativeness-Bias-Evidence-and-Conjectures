Let's tackle the Bayesian analysis step-by-step.

First, assign some plausible initial probabilities. Let's assume that the prior probability for any student to be in either "agricultural and veterinary science" or "business administration" is 0.1 (10%) each. These are arbitrary but reasonable assumptions given a wide array of potential fields.

Next, let's look at the likelihoods:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1):**
   - P(H1) = 0.1
   - P(E|H1): The characteristics described in Adam's personality sketch are congruent with a student in agricultural and veterinary science (curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, love for animals, understanding of hard work). Let's assign a high value, say \( P(E|H1) = 0.8 \).
   - P(E|¬H1): The probability of these characteristics in any other field may be more diverse and spread out. Thus, let’s assign a lower value, say \( P(E|¬H1) = 0.2 \).

2. **Business Administration (H2):**
   - P(H2) = 0.1
   - P(E|H2): The characteristics in Adam's sketch are less aligned with what one might typically associate with business administration. Let's assign a lower value, say \( P(E|H2) = 0.2 \).
   - P(E|¬H2): The probability of these characteristics in any field other than business administration may be higher. Thus, let’s assign a higher value, say \( P(E|¬H2) = 0.6 \).

Now we apply Bayes' rule to find \( P(H_1|E) \) and \( P(H_2|E) \). The formula for Bayes' rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \). Since we are using conditional probability considering only H1 and H2 among possibilities, we use:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) + P(E|¬(H_1 \cup H_2)) \cdot P(¬(H_1 \cup H_2))\]

However, for simplification, we can compute each hypothesis independently with the understanding that there are unknowns we are not computing directly here.

### Compute for Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1)
\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E|¬H_1) \cdot P(¬H_1) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.08 + 0.18 = 0.26 \]

\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.26} \approx \frac{0.08}{0.26} \approx 0.3077 \]

Let's round it off to 0.31.

### Compute for Business Administration (H2)
\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) + P(E|¬H_2) \cdot P(¬H_2) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.6 \cdot 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.02 + 0.54 = 0.56 \]

\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.56} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.56} \approx 0.0357 \]

Let's round it off to 0.04.

### Final Results
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.31,
  "business administration": 0.04
}

Note: These estimates are based on the assumptions for initial probabilities and likelihoods. Real-world prior data might adjust these figures.
