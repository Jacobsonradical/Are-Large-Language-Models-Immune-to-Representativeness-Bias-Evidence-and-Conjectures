Certainly! Below is the calculation based on the given personality sketch of Adam and the hypotheses that he was enrolled in either business administration or agricultural and veterinary science.

1. **Prior Probability, P(H):**
   - Let's assume for simplicity that before considering the personality sketch, each field is equally likely. This is a simplification acknowledging that there are many other potential fields of study.

Given many possible fields, for simplicity, we might assign P(H) = 0.1 for both (acknowledging there are at least 10 potential fields he could be studying). 

2. **Likelihood, P(E|H):**
   - P(E|H) for business administration might be lower since his personality sketch fits better with fields related to nature and empathy.
   - P(E|H) for agricultural and veterinary science seems very high considering his interest and deep love for animals and understanding of hard work and dedication.

3. **Likelihood, P(E|\neg H):**
   - This would represent the probability of Adam having this personality if he is not in the specified field. Given that many fields could suit his characteristics, we might assign a moderate probability.

Based on Bayesian rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

### Assumptions:

- P(E|business administration) = 0.3
- P(E|\neg business administration) = 0.7
- P(E|agricultural and veterinary science) = 0.9
- P(E|\neg agricultural and veterinary science) = 0.4

### Normalization constant:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(E)_{\text{business administration}} = 0.3 \cdot 0.1 + 0.7 \cdot 0.9 = 0.03 + 0.63 = 0.66 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.66} \approx 0.045 \]

\[ P(E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} = 0.9 \cdot 0.1 + 0.4 \cdot 0.9 = 0.09 + 0.36 = 0.45 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{0.45} \approx 0.2 \]

### Conclusion:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.045,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.2
}
```

These values represent the posterior probabilities that Adam is enrolled in either business administration or agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch. The higher probability for agricultural and veterinary science aligns well with Adam's characteristics and interests.
