To solve this using Bayes' rule, we need to apply the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we don't have the exact values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), \( P(E|\neg H) \), or \( P(E) \) in this situation. We'll make reasoned estimates based on the provided personality sketch and some reasonable assumptions. 

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was studying the given field. For simplicity, assume all fields have an equal prior probability.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam's personality and interests (E) fit the field (H).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that Adam's personality and interests (E) fit any field other than the given field (H).

Let's make rough estimates based on the personality sketch.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: Let's assume P(H) is relatively low, given the broad diversity of graduate fields.
   \[ P(H) \approx 0.1 \]

2. **P(E|H)**: Adam's interests in nature and animals strongly suggest a good fit for this field.
   \[ P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \]

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that his interests fit any other field given \neg H is lower, but not negligible since there are other science-related fields.
   \[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \]

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) = 0.08 + 0.18 = 0.26 \]

Now compute \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \approx 0.31 \]

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: Similarly to before, we'll assume a prior probability.
   \[ P(H) \approx 0.1 \]

2. **P(E|H)**: Adam's interests do not strongly align with typical business administration traits.
   \[ P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \]

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability his traits fit another field given it's not business administration is higher.
   \[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.25 \]

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.1) + (0.25 \cdot 0.9) = 0.01 + 0.225 = 0.235 \]

Now compute \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.235} \approx 0.043 \]

### Conclusion

Given the assumptions and rough estimations, the probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.31,
  "business administration": 0.043
}
