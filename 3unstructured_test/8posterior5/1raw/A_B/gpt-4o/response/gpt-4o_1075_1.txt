Bayes' theorem is expressed as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:

- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of evidence \( E \).

Let's consider the scenarios for each field:

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a business administration program might be lower given his personality sketch and interests in nature and animals. Let's estimate this at 0.1.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is in business administration is also estimated to be relatively low because his interests do not match the typical business administration profile. Let's estimate this at 0.05.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is not in business administration (considering all other possible fields) is higher. Let's estimate this at 0.3.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

We need \( P(E) \) to compute this exactly, but for the sake of comparison, we can leave this term out temporarily and compare relative probabilities.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in an agricultural and veterinary science program is higher given his interests in nature and animals. Let's estimate this at 0.4.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science is very high. Let's estimate this at 0.9.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is not in agricultural and veterinary science is lower due to the strong alignment with his interests. Let's estimate this at 0.2.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.4}{P(E)} \]

Again, we need \( P(E) \) to compute this exactly, but we want to compare relative probabilities.

### Putting It Together
We compare the relative probabilities (since \( P(E) \) is a common factor and cancels out):

- For business administration (BA):
\[ P(BA|E) \propto \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(BA|E) \propto 0.005 \]

- For agricultural and veterinary science (AVS):
\[ P(AVS|E) \propto \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.4}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(AVS|E) \propto 0.36 \]

Since these figures are proportional:

{
  "business administration": 0.005,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.36
}

In summary, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science based on his personality sketch is significantly higher than the probability of him being enrolled in business administration.
