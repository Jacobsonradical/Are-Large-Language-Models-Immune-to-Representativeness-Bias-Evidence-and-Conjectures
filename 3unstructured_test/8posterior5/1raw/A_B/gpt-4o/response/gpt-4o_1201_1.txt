To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field (where \( H \) represents the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in that particular field, and \( E \) represents the given personality sketch), we need the following probabilities for each field:
1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of being enrolled in that field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch given enrollment in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch given enrollment in any other field.

Finally, we'll apply Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, let’s assume \( P(E) \) is constant across different hypotheses since it is a normalizing factor.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Given Adam's interests, the prior probability might be reasonably high. Let’s assume \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Given his curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals, the likelihood is very high. Let’s assume \( P(E|H) = 0.90 \).
3. **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Given he has characteristics that are quite specific to agricultural and veterinary sciences, the probability of observing \( E \) given he is in another field is lower, though not negligible. Let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

### Business Administration
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Given Adam’s attributes, this is much less likely. Let’s assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Given the personality sketch, it seems less likely for a typical business administration student but not impossible. Let’s assume \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).
3. **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Since Adam’s attributes are not particularly aligned with this field, \( P(E|\neg H) \) might still be similar to the value used above. Let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

Now, applying Bayes' rule, we have:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

### Calculation for Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.90 \times 0.15}{0.90 \times 0.15 + 0.30 \times (1 - 0.15)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.135}{0.135 + 0.255} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.135}{0.39} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.346 \]

### Calculation for Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.05}{0.2 \times 0.05 + 0.4 \times (1 - 0.05)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.38} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.39} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.026 \]

Based on this analysis, the posterior probabilities are:

  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.346,
