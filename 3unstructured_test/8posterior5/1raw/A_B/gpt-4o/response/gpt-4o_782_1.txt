To evaluate the probability of Adam being enrolled in different fields of study given his personality sketch E, we need to use Bayes' theorem. The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we only need relative probabilities and we are dealing with two fields of study specifically, we can simplify the problem by focusing on the relative likelihoods \( P(E | H) \cdot P(H) \) and then normalizing these if needed.

### Hypothesis 1: Agricultural and Veterinary Science

#### P(H): Prior probability of enrolling in Agricultural and Veterinary Science
Without specific information on the exact distribution of graduate students among various fields, we can estimate. Assuming uniform distribution among many fields, we might start with a general lower probability for specialized fields:

\[ P(H_{\text{agri}}) \approx 0.05 \]

#### P(E|H): Likelihood of E given H (agricultural and veterinary science)
Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work align well with Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[ P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) \approx 0.8 \]

#### P(E|¬H): Likelihood of E given not H (agricultural and veterinary science)
The likelihood that Adam's personality matches other fields varies, but it is less likely to find such a perfect match:

\[ P(E|¬H_{\text{agri}}) \approx 0.2 \]

### Hypothesis 2: Business Administration

#### P(H): Prior probability of enrolling in Business Administration
Similarly, assuming a uniform distribution among many fields:

\[ P(H_{\text{business}}) \approx 0.05 \]

#### P(E|H): Likelihood of E given H (business administration)
Adam's personality does not strongly align with typical traits desired in business administration, such as a strong focus on interpersonal interaction, competitive drive, and leadership qualities. Thus:

\[ P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \approx 0.1 \]

#### P(E|¬H): Likelihood of E given not H (business administration)
Given that business administration is broader, P(E|¬H) needs to be higher:

\[ P(E|¬H_{\text{business}}) \approx 0.7 \]

### Calculation (relative comparison)

Using Bayes' theorem, we calculate relative probabilities.

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[ P(H_{\text{agri}} | E) \propto P(E | H_{\text{agri}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agri}}) \]
\[ \approx 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04 \]

For Business Administration:

\[ P(H_{\text{business}} | E) \propto P(E | H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}}) \]
\[ \approx 0.1 \cdot 0.05 = 0.005 \]

### Normalized Relative Probabilities

We can now normalize the probabilities focusing on the relative comparison (since there are other fields not considered here, these are not definitive absolute probabilities).

The sum for comparison purposes (not absolute):

\[ 0.04 + 0.005 = 0.045 \]

Normalized probabilities:

\[ P(H_{\text{agri}} | E) = \frac{0.04}{0.045} \approx 0.8889 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business}} | E) = \frac{0.005}{0.045} \approx 0.1111 \]

Given the rough and simplified estimates, we can present the results as follows:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8889,
  "business administration": 0.1111
}
