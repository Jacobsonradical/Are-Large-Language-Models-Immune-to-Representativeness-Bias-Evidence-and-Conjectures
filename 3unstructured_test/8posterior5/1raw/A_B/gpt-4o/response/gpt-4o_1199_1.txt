To compute \( P(H|E) \) for the given fields using Bayes' rule, we need to follow these steps:

1. Assign the priors \( P(H) \) for each field.
2. Assess the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) considering how well the personality sketch matches with each field.
3. Determine \( P(E|\neg H) \) based on the likelihood of the personality sketch given Adam is not in that field.
4. Use Bayes' rule: \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \)

Given values will be estimates based on reasonable assumptions.

**1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS):**

- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \) (assumed)**: Suppose around 10% of graduate students in the U.S. might be enrolled in AVS, so \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.10 \)

- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's traits (e.g., love for animals, interest in nature) strongly match with AVS, so we can assign a high probability: \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.80 \)

- **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Assuming the likelihood of the personality sketch for non-AVS fields matches the generic population, let's assign: \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.15 \)

**2. Business Administration (BA):**

- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \) (assumed)**: Suppose around 20% of graduate students in the U.S. might be enrolled in BA, so \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.20 \)

- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adamâ€™s traits don't strongly match with BA, so we might assign: \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.10 \)

- **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Given earlier assumptions, including AVS and other possible fields, we can assign: \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.20 \)

To compute **P(H|E)**, we use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \) can be cumbersome without the normalization step (i.e., summing over all fields and not knowing the exhaustive list of all fields), we compute the unnormalized results and then perform relative comparison.

### Computation for AVS:

\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \]
\[ \propto 0.80 \times 0.10 = 0.08 \]

### Computation for BA:

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) \]
\[ \propto 0.10 \times 0.20 = 0.02 \]

### Normalization (relative):

To normalize and compare:

\[ P_{\text{relative}}(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.02} = \frac{0.08}{0.10} = 0.80 \]
\[ P_{\text{relative}}(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.08 + 0.02} = \frac{0.02}{0.10} = 0.20 \]

So the conditional probabilities reflecting Adam's enrollment in the specific fields would be:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.80,
  "business administration": 0.20
}
