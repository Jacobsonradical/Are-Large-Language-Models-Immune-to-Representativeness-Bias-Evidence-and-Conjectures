To calculate the probabilities, we'll employ Bayes' Rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in that specific field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.

Let's assign values to these probabilities based on the given information:

1. Adam is curious about nature and plants, loves animals, is highly intelligent, enjoys solving puzzles, and has warm empathy and a good understanding of hard work and dedication. These characteristics align more strongly with agricultural and veterinary science than with business administration.

2. Let's assume a uniform prior probability \( P(H) \) for each field, as we lack specific information about the base rates of graduate students in different fields:
   - \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \approx 0.1 \)
   - \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \approx 0.05 \) 

3. Given Adam's personality, the likelihoods may be estimated as:
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \approx 0.2 \), since his traits don't particularly lend themselves to typical characteristics for business administration students.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \approx 0.8 \), given his strong fidelity with nature, plants, and animals.

4. For the complementary probabilities (not being in these fields), we assume:
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business administration}}) \approx 0.6 \), there's a reasonable chance that someone with Adam’s attributes isn't in business administration.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \approx 0.4 \), as Adam’s attributes closely match other science-related fields.

Now, we'll compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \):

Using Bayes' Rule in the denominator, 

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{business administration}})P(H_{\text{business administration}}) + P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{business administration}})(1-P(H_{\text{business administration}})) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})(1-P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})) \]

To simplify calculation, we will divide our estimated likelihoods by common P(E) normalization.

Let us approximate:
- Business: \( 0.02 / 0.13 \approx 0.153846 \)
- Agriculture/Vet: \( 0.04 / 0.09 \approx 0.444444 \)

Therefore, our answers are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.153846,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.444444
}
```
