Firstly, let's denote the hypotheses and the evidence provided. For clarity:

- \( H_1 \): Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( H_2 \): Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( E \): The personality sketch of Adam.

Now let's evaluate the different probabilities.

### Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)

Assuming no other information than the distribution of graduate fields of specialization in general, the priors for each field might be somewhat equal. However, agricultural fields are less common than business administration programs. Thus, let's give a rough estimation:

- \( P(H_1) \): Prior probability for agricultural and veterinary science might be \( 0.1 \).
- \( P(H_2) \): Prior probability for business administration might be \( 0.2 \).

### Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \)

- \( P(E|H_1) \): Given Adam's personality (curiosity about nature, love for animals), it’s highly likely he fits the agricultural and veterinary science field. We might estimate this as \( 0.8 \).

- \( P(E|H_2) \): Given Adam's personality, it's not very likely he fits into business administration since traits like a strong love for animals and curiosity about nature seem less relevant. We could estimate this as \( 0.2 \).

- \( P(E|\neg H_1) \): Probability of having Adam's characteristics given he’s not in agricultural and veterinary sciences might be lower — considering other fields except business administration, it could be \( 0.3 \).

- \( P(E|\neg H_2) \): Probability of having Adam's characteristics given he's not in business administration could be higher, as many other fields fit agricultural sciences better. We might estimate this as \( 0.7 \).

### Computing Posterior Probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes Rule

- For \( P(H_1|E) \):

\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E|\neg H_1) \cdot P(\neg H_1) \).

Thus,

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.1) + (0.3 \times 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.27 = 0.35 \]

So,

\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.35} \]
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \approx 0.229 \]

- For \( P(H_2|E) \):

\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) + P(E|\neg H_2) \cdot P(\neg H_2) \).

Thus,

\[ P(E) = (0.2 \times 0.2) + (0.7 \times 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.56 = 0.6 \]

So,

\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.2}{0.6} \]
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.6} = 0.0667 \]

So the final values are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.229,
  "business administration": 0.0667
}
```

This indicates that Adam is much more likely to be in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration given his personality sketch.
