To answer this question rigorously, it's essential to break down the probabilities as required by Bayes rule. Bayes rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given:
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of hypothesis H (Adam being enrolled in a given field).
- \(P(E|H)\) is the probability of the evidence E (personality sketch) given hypothesis H.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\) is the probability of the evidence E given not-H (not being enrolled in that field).

We'll use the provided context to estimate these probabilities.

### Business Administration

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in business administration. Given the vast number of disciplines, let's estimate it at 0.1 or 10%.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam has the given personality traits if he is in business administration. Traits like curiosity about nature and animals, solving puzzles, warm heart, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work are not typically associated with business administration. Let's assign a lower probability here, perhaps 0.1 or 10%.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that Adam has the given personality traits if he is in any field other than business administration. Considering his traits could be more aligned with fields outside of business administration (e.g., sciences, humanities), let's say 0.5 or 50%.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary sciences. Assuming it’s less common compared to business administration but still plausible, let’s estimate at 0.05 or 5%.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam has the given personality traits if he is in agricultural and veterinary sciences. Traits like love for animals, curiosity about nature, and warmth align well with this field. Let's use a higher probability: 0.8 or 80%.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that Adam has the given personality traits if he is in any field other than agricultural and veterinary sciences. Since his traits could match well with a few other disciplines, let’s estimate this at 0.4 or 40%.

### Calculations

Now, compute \(P(H|E)\) for each hypothesis using Bayes rule. For simplicity, let's assume \(P(E)\) is the same for both hypotheses and focus on relative values.

1. **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.01/P(E) \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.04/P(E) \]

### Relative Probabilities

Since absolute values depend on \(P(E)\), we will simply compare:

\[ \frac{0.04}{P(E)} \] vs. \[ \frac{0.01}{P(E)} \]

Clearly,
\[ P(H|E)_{agricultural \& veterinary science} > P(H|E)_{business administration} \]

Thus, the relative probabilities considering the estimations would be:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.01,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.04
}
```
