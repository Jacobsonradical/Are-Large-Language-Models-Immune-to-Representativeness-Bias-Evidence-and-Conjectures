To use Bayes' rule, we need to first judge the probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field. These probabilities are not precisely known, so we will estimate them based on the description provided. 

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration. Business administration is a common graduate field, so let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \) (20%).
- **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam exhibits the personality traits mentioned if he is in business administration. Given his curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and preference for puzzles, these traits are less commonly associated with business administration. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \) (10%).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that Adam exhibits these traits if he is not in business administration. Since the traits better fit other fields, let's say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.25 \) (25%).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.8 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.25 \cdot 0.8} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.2} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.22} \approx 0.091 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his traits, this field seems appropriate, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \) (5%).
- **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam exhibits these traits if he is in agricultural and veterinary science. His traits strongly align with this field, so let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \) (90%).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that Adam exhibits these traits if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. This is lower since the traits fit so well with this field, say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \) (10%).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.95 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.9 \cdot 0.05 + 0.1 \cdot 0.95} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.095} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.14} \approx 0.321 \]

In summary:

  "business administration": 0.091,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.321
