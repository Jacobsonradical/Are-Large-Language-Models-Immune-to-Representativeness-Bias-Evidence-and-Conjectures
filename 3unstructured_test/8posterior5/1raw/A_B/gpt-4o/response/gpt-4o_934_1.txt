To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we first need to specify \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Then we can use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence.

We will estimate these values for each field based on the information in the personality sketch.

### Business Administration
- **P(H), prior probability**: Let's assume that the probability of any given graduate student being enrolled in Business Administration is moderate. Let's set \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1 \) (10%).
- **P(E|H), likelihood**: The personality sketch of Adam does not strongly match the typical interests and characteristics associated with a Business Administration student. So, \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1 \).
- **P(E|\neg H), likelihood**: Without strong characterization towards Business Administration, and given multiple fields, let's set \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.2 \).

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H), prior probability**: The probability of a given graduate student being enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is relatively lower than Business Administration but closer due to the personality fit. Let’s set \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.05 \) (5%).
- **P(E|H), likelihood**: The given personality traits (interest in nature, plants, animals, empathy) align well with Agricultural and Veterinary Science. So, \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.8 \).
- **P(E|\neg H), likelihood**: Similar to above but adjusted for the personalities fitting AVS better, let’s set \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.2 \).

\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{P(E)} \]

### Normalizing values
To find \( P(E) \), note this is typically the sum of all potential hypotheses. However, as exact normalization isn't needed for relative probability comparisons here, and assuming \( P(E) \) is equal for practical purposes, we can compare relative terms of numerators:

- For Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.1 = 0.01 \]

- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.05 = 0.04 \]

These ratio succinctly suggests that given Adam's personality, he is relatively more likely to be in Agricultural and Veterinary Science than in Business Administration.

Let's denote these proportional values in an easy-to-understand format:

{
  "business administration": 0.01,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.04
