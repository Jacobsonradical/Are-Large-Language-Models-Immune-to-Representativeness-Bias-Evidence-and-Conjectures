Sure, let’s assess each hypothesis \(H\) (agricultural and veterinary science or business administration) with regard to the personality sketch \(E\) of Adam. We'll assign probabilities based on the given information and use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probabilities \(P(H|E)\).

### Estimates:
1. **Initial Probability \(P(H)\) (based on general popularity and enrollment in the fields)**:
    - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Graduate programs in agricultural and veterinary sciences are less common and thus may have a lower prior probability of enrollment.
    - Business Administration: Business administration programs are quite popular, so the prior probability is higher.

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)** (how likely is the personality sketch given the fields):
    - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Adam's traits (love for nature, animals, empathy) align closely with agricultural and veterinary science, thus the likelihood \(P(E|H)\) should be high.
    - Business Administration: While strong intelligence and problem-solving skills may be a fit, the other traits (nature, animals, empathy) are less common for this field, so the likelihood is lower.

3. **Probability of sketch not given the field \(P(E|\neg H)\)**: 
    - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Given other fields, the likelihood of having the same personality sketch \(E\) is moderately high since other science-related fields could share similar traits.
    - Business Administration: Given other fields, the likelihood of having the same personality sketch \(E\) is quite low because many of his traits are less typical in business administration.

Let’s put some qualitative values to these probabilities.

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- \(P(H_{AV})\): 0.1 (given general enrollment distribution)
- \(P(E|H_{AV})\): 0.8 (since traits align well)
- \(P(E|\neg H_{AV})\): 0.3 (other related fields may have similar traits but lower)

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_{AV}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AV}) \cdot P(H_{AV})}{P(E)} \]

Since:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{AV}) \cdot P(H_{AV}) + P(E|\neg H_{AV}) \cdot P(\neg H_{AV}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.27 = 0.35 \]

\[ P(H_{AV}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.35} \]
\[ P(H_{AV}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \approx 0.2286 \]

#### Business Administration:
- \(P(H_{BA})\): 0.25 (since it's a common field)
- \(P(E|H_{BA})\): 0.2 (traits fit less well)
- \(P(E|\neg H_{BA})\): 0.5 (given other less fitting fields combined)

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]

Since:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \cdot P(\neg H_{BA}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.25 + 0.5 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.05 + 0.375 = 0.425 \]

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.425} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.05}{0.425} \approx 0.1176 \]
