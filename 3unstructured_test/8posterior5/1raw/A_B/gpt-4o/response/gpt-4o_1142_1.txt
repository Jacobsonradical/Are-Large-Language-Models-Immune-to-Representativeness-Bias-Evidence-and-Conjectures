To calculate \( P(H|E) \) for the fields of business administration and agricultural and veterinary science, we'll use Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule is expressed as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we only need to compare the probabilities, we can simplify the computation to focus on the relative likelihoods of \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for each field, as the denominator \( P(E) \) will be constant across both fields.

Let's begin by estimating each term:

### Business Administration

- **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam would be enrolled in business administration is relatively low, given his interest in nature and animals, which might not directly align with a business administration program. Let's assume this prior probability is around \(0.1\).

- **P(E|H):** The likelihood that someone in business administration would fit Adam's personality sketch is also relatively low. We might assume someone in business administration would be more interested in market trends, finance, etc., rather than nature and animals. This could be estimated around \(0.1\).

- **P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood that someone not in business administration would fit Adam's personality sketch is higher because there are many other fields more aligned with his interests. Let's assume this is \(0.3\).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is relatively high, given his interest in animals and plants. Let's estimate this at \(0.4\).

- **P(E|H):** The likelihood that someone in agricultural and veterinary science would fit Adam's personality sketch is very high. We can estimate this around \(0.9\).

- **P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood that someone not in agricultural and veterinary science would fit Adam's personality sketch is lower, though still not negligible because there are other fields of nature-oriented studies. Let's estimate this around \(0.2\).

Now let's calculate the comparative values of \( P(H|E) \).

### Business Administration

\[
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.1 = 0.01
\]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

\[
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.9 \cdot 0.4 = 0.36
\]

### Normalized Probabilities

To get these into a more interpretable format, let's normalize them by dividing each by the sum of both, even though it's not required for the question:

\[
\text{Total} = 0.01 + 0.36 = 0.37
\]

\[
P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.37} \approx 0.027
\]
\[
P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) = \frac{0.36}{0.37} \approx 0.973
\]

So, the final answer in the required format is:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.027,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.973
}
