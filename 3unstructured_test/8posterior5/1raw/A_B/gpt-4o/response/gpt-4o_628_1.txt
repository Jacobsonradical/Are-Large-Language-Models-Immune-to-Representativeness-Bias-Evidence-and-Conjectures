To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to understand the probabilities in the context of business administration and agricultural and veterinary science. The probabilities required for Bayes' Rule are:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in either field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality given he is enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality given he is not enrolled in that field.

### Business Administration

- \( P(H) \): Let's assume a relatively uniform prior for all fields. Business administration is quite common, so let's assume \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): The personality described (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy) doesn't strongly fit the stereotypical business administration profile. Thus, let's assign \( P(E|H) = 0.05 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given that Adam's interests and personality shine more in fields related to nature and animals, \( P(E|\neg H) \) could be relatively high since these traits are common in other fields. Let's assign \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.25 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- \( P(H) \): This field is less common, but Adamâ€™s interests align more closely with it. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Adam's deep love for animals, curiosity about nature, and empathy fit well with this field. Let's assign \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given that these traits are less common in other fields compared to agricultural and veterinary science, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

### Using Bayes' Rule

Bayes' Rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be computed as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

#### For Business Administration

\[ P(E) = (0.05 \cdot 0.15) + (0.25 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.0075 + 0.2125 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.22 \]

Now,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.15}{0.22} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.0075}{0.22} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.034 \]

#### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science

\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.035 + 0.19 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.225 \]

Now,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{0.225} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.035}{0.225} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.156 \]

So, rounding the values slightly for readability, we have:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.03,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.16
}
