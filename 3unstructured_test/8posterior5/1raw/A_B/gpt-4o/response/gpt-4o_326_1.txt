To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field (assume equal priors for simplicity unless additional information is known).
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given enrollment in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given enrollment in other fields.

### Assumptions:
- We assume there are multiple other graduate fields of specialization \( \neg H \), and for simplicity, we'll distribute priors equally.
- Certain attributes in personality sketch \( E \), such as "genuine curiosity about nature", "deep love for animals", and "warm heart, strong empathy", seem to align more strongly with agricultural and veterinary science than business administration.

### Estimations:

#### Business Administration
1. \( P(H) \sim 0.2 \) (assuming equal distribution among multiple fields, say around 5 fields)
2. \( P(E|H) \): Attributes like "genuine curiosity about nature", "deep love for animals", and "warm heart, strong empathy" are less common in business administration, so a lower probability. Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{BA}) \sim 0.1 \)
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): With relatively equal distribution for other fields, but considering that some fields share traits with \( E \), let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) \sim 0.4 \) given Adam's characteristics align more with sciences than business.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.4} = \frac{0.02}{0.4} = 0.05 \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. \( P(H) \sim 0.2 \) (assuming equal distribution among multiple fields, say around 5 fields)
2. \( P(E|H) \): Attributes in \( E \) align strongly with agricultural and veterinary science. Estimate \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \sim 0.6 \)
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): Assuming this is still \( 0.4 \) as mentioned above.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \approx \frac{0.6 \times 0.2}{0.4} = \frac{0.12}{0.4} = 0.3 \]

So, considering the given information, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3
}
```
