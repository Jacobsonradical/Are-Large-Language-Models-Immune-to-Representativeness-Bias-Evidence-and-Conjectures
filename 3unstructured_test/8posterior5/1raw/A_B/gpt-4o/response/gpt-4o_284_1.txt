Sure, to estimate \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we'll use Bayes' Rule which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have the exact values, we will make educated guesses based on the personality sketch provided and general trends.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This field is less common than others, so we'll assign a lower prior, say \( 0.05 \).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the evidence (Adam's personality traits) given that he is in this field. Adam's strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align well with this field. So, we'll assign a high value, say \( 0.8 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the evidence given that he is not in this field. While his traits could fit other fields too, they are particularly well-suited to this field. So, we'll assign a lower value, say \( 0.3 \).

Now we use Bayes' formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{P(E)} \]

\( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the evidence and can be complex to calculate, but for our purposes, we'll calculate the relative likelihood.

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in business administration. This is a common field, so we'll assign a higher prior, say \( 0.2 \).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is in this field. While intelligence and appreciation for hard work fit, the love for animals and nature curiosity fits less. We'll assign a moderate value, say \( 0.4 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Since business administration is common and many traits are shared, we'll take a slightly higher value here, say \( 0.4 \).

Now we use Bayes' formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]

### Relative Likelihood
Since \( P(E) \) is a normalization factor and the same for both, we can compare the numerators directly for relative likelihood.

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ 0.8 \times 0.05 = 0.04 \]

**Business Administration**:
\[ 0.4 \times 0.2 = 0.08 \]

The relative likelihood suggests that given Adam's personality traits, he is more likely in business administration than agricultural and veterinary science, but let's rescale somewhat intuitively.

So, our estimated values are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.33,
  "business administration": 0.67
}
