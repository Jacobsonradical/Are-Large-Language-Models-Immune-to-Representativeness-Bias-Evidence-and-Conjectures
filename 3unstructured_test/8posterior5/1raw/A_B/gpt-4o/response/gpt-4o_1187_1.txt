To assess the probabilities, let's break down each parameter for both fields:

### Field: Agricultural and Veterinary Science
#### P(H): The prior probability that a student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
Given the various fields available, agricultural and veterinary science is a less common field compared to others like business or engineering. A rough estimate for P(H) could be:

P(H) ≈ 0.05

#### P(E|H): The likelihood of observing this personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
The personality sketch indicates a strong interest in nature, animals, and plants, which aligns well with this field.

P(E|H) ≈ 0.9

#### P(E|¬H): The likelihood of observing this personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
Students not in agricultural and veterinary science could have these traits, but it is less likely compared to those in the field.

P(E|¬H) ≈ 0.1

#### Using Bayes' Rule:
\( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \)
Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \)

\[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.05) + (0.1 \cdot 0.95) = 0.045 + 0.095 = 0.14 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.14} = \frac{0.045}{0.14} ≈ 0.3214 \]

### Field: Business Administration
#### P(H): The prior probability that a student is enrolled in business administration.
Business administration is a more common field of graduate study.

P(H) ≈ 0.2

#### P(E|H): The likelihood of observing this personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in business administration.
The personality sketch doesn't strongly align with typical business administration characteristics.

P(E|H) ≈ 0.2

#### P(E|¬H): The likelihood of observing this personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in business administration.
The likelihood represents a more general probability and can be considered broader, since many other fields might exhibit the described traits.

P(E|¬H) ≈ 0.1

#### Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.2) + (0.1 \cdot 0.8) = 0.04 + 0.08 = 0.12 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.12} = \frac{0.04}{0.12} ≈ 0.3333 \]

Based on these calculations:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3214,
  "business administration": 0.3333
