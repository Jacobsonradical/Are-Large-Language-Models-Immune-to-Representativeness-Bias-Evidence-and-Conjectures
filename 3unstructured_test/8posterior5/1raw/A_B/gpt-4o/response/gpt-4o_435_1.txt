To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to start with the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field. Here’s the formula for Bayes’ rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is constant for every hypothesis \( H \), for simplicity, we can compare the values of \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for the given fields. The absolute values will need normalization if you require probabilities to sum to 1, but for now, we'll directly compare the non-normalized scores.

1. **Business Administration**:
    - \( P(H) \): Prior probability of Adam being in business administration. It's reasonable to assume this is less common given the personality sketch.
    - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam having such a personality and being enrolled in business administration. This likelihood seems low because the personality traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals) do not align well with typical business administration interests.
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability Adam fits E regardless of being in business administration. It’s higher because the personality traits lean more towards science fields.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - \( P(H) \): Prior probability Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his interests, this is relatively higher.
    - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood he has these traits if he’s in agricultural and veterinary science. This is high because his characteristics align well with this field.
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability Adam fits E regardless of being in agricultural and veterinary science. It’s lower here, as his personality sketches seem specifically tailored to this field.

Given these considerations, let's assign some reasonable but simplified probabilities and compute \( P(H|E) \).

### Calculations and Adjustments:

1. **Business Administration**:
    - Assigning \( P(H) \) ≈ 0.1 (less likely choice)
    - \( P(E|H) \) ≈ 0.1 (doesn’t align well)
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \) ≈ 0.4 (quite broad but leaning towards science)

    \[
    P(H|E)_{BA} \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.1 = 0.01
    \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - Assigning \( P(H) \) ≈ 0.3 (a more likely choice)
    - \( P(E|H) \) ≈ 0.8 (very high alignment)
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \) ≈ 0.3 (specific to this field)

    \[
    P(H|E)_{AVS} \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24
    \]

### Normalization (Optional Step):

To normalize:

\[
P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.24} \approx 0.04
\]

\[
P(H|E)_{AVS} = \frac{0.24}{0.01 + 0.24} \approx 0.96
\]

So, the final calculations are:

{
  "business administration": 0.04,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.96
}

However, if not normalizing:

{
  "business administration": 0.01,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.24
}

These values suggest it's far more likely that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch.
