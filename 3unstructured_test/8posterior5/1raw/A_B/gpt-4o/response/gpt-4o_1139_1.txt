To solve this problem using Bayes' rule, we'll go through the required probabilities step by step. 

1. **Define the components for Bayes' rule:**

   P(H|E) = \(\frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\)

   Since P(E) is the same for any field, we'll only compare the numerators for each hypothesis.

2. **Estimate the probabilities for each hypothesis:**

   - **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field, based on general knowledge.
   - **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing E (Adam's personality sketch) given the hypothesis H (he was enrolled in a specific field).
   - **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing E given the hypothesis ¬H (he was not enrolled in that specific field).

Let's estimate the values based on the provided personality sketch:

### For "agricultural and veterinary science":
- **P(H)**: Assume a prior probability of 0.1 (10%) since there are many different fields of graduate study.
- **P(E|H)**: Adam's traits of curiosity about nature, love for animals, understanding of hard work, and empathy match well with studies in agricultural and veterinary science. Estimate high at 0.8.
- **P(E|¬H)**: While these traits can be found in other fields, they are less likely to be as strongly represented. Estimate at 0.2.

### For "business administration":
- **P(H)**: Assume a prior probability of 0.1 (10%) for fairness across all fields.
- **P(E|H)**: Adam's traits do not align as closely with typical business administration interests (e.g., curiosity about nature, love for animals). Estimate lower at 0.2.
- **P(E|¬H)**: Many other fields may match Adam’s characteristics better than business administration. Estimate higher at 0.4 compared to P(E|¬H) of agricultural and veterinary science because many fields could explain the traits better.

### Calculations:

1. **For Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[
   P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08
   \]
2. **For Business Administration**:
   \[
   P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \cdot 0.1 = 0.02
   \]

### Normalization (if required, but we are comparing only):
   Since we only need a proportional comparison here, we won’t normalize. Instead, we'll directly compare the numerators:

   {
     "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08,
     "business administration": 0.02
   }

This proportional comparison shows that Adam is more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration based on the provided personality sketch.
