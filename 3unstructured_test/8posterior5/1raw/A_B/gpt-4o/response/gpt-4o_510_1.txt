Let's analyze Adam's personality sketch and background to calculate the probabilities for each field.

Given personality traits like a strong appreciation for nature, plants, animals, and empathy, it seems more likely that Adam might be inclined toward fields closely related to these interests, such as agricultural and veterinary science. He is also described as being of high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts. This might incline him somewhat towards business administration, but given the specific interests in nature and animals, the second field seems a better fit.

1. **Business Administration:**
   - P(H): This is the prior probability that a given graduate student is enrolled in business administration. In the general population of graduate students, this might be around 0.1 (assuming 10% of graduate students are in business administration).
   - P(E|H): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in business administration. Given his interests in nature and animals, this might be lower, say 0.05 because these interests align less with a typical business administration curriculum.
   - P(E|¬H): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not in business administration. Adam’s personality could be common in other fields, particularly agricultural and veterinary science. Assuming we distribute the rest equally among other graduate fields of interest, possibly 0.5 because the traits align more with other fields.

   Using Bayes' Rule to calculate P(H|E):
   $$ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} $$
   We normalize this by noting that P(E) should be the overall probability of seeing Adam's traits:
   
    $$ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) $$
    $$ = 0.05 \cdot 0.1 + 0.5 \cdot 0.9 $$
    $$ = 0.005 + 0.45 $$
    $$ = 0.455 $$

   Therefore,

    $$ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{0.455} $$
    $$ = \frac{0.005}{0.455}$$
    $$ \approx 0.011 $$

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - P(H): Again, assuming 10% of graduate students are in agricultural and veterinary science. P(H) ~ 0.1.
   - P(E|H): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his interests, this might be quite high, say 0.8 because these interests align with the curriculum.
   - P(E|¬H): This is the same 0.5 as previously assumed.

   Using Bayes' Rule to calculate P(H|E):
   $$ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} $$
   
    Using the same normalization P(E) as calculated above:

    Therefore,

    $$ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.455} $$
    $$ = \frac{0.08}{0.455}$$
    $$ \approx 0.176 $$

So in summary:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.011",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.176"
}
```
