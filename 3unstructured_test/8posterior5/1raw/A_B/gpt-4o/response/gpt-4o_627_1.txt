To calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' theorem, we need to establish the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the complement likelihoods \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Bayes' theorem formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we don't have absolute numbers, we'll need to make educated guesses based on the personality sketch.

### Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)
The prior probability \( P(H) \) reflects how common it is to be in a given field among all graduate fields. We'll denote these as follows (assuming a uniform distribution among various fields just for simplicity):

- \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.1 \)

### Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \)
Next, let's estimate how likely it is that Adam, with his described personality traits, would be enrolled in each field:

- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy, it seems highly likely.
  - \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.8 \)
  
- Business Administration: Adam’s traits don’t strongly align with a typical business administration profile, which often emphasizes skills like leadership, management, and strategic thinking over a love for animals and nature.
  - \( P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.2 \)

### Complement Likelihoods \( P(E|\neg H) \)
We'll estimate the likelihood of Adam's personality fit across all other fields, given that he is not in the specified field. Given the rarity of specific traits aligning exactly, I will use the following estimates:

- \( P(E|\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.4 \)
- \( P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) = 0.6 \)

### Posterior Probabilities \( P(H|E) \)
To compute the posterior probabilities, we use Bayes' theorem.

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)} \]
\( P(E) \) cancels out as we are comparing relative probabilities.

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.4 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.36} = \frac{0.08}{0.44} \approx 0.182 \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.6 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.54} = \frac{0.02}{0.56} \approx 0.036 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.182,
  "business administration": 0.036
}
```
