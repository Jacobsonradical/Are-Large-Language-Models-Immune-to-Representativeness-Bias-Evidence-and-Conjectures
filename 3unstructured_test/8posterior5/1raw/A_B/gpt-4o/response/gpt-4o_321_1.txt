To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to determine the individual probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) first. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) will be the same for both fields, we can simplify our comparison by focusing on the numerator \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \), as the denominator will cancel out when comparing the fields.

### 1. Business Administration
- **P(H):** This is the prior probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is studying business administration. Business administration is a fairly common field, so we might assign a moderate probability. Let's assume 0.2.
- **P(E|H):** This is the probability that the personality sketch \( E \) matches someone in business administration. Given Adam's traits (interested in nature, animals, empathy, puzzles), this is relatively low. Let's assume 0.1.
- **P(E|\neg H):** This is the probability that the personality sketch \( E \) matches someone not in business administration. Considering students outside this field often have a broader range of interests, let's assume a higher value, 0.4.

Bayes' computation:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H):** This is the prior probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is studying agricultural and veterinary science. This is less common than business administration, but still notable. Let's assume 0.05.
- **P(E|H):** This matches Adam's traits closely: interest in nature, animals, empathy â€“ all are highly relevant. Let's assume 0.8.
- **P(E|\neg H):** The personality sketch \( E \) is less common outside this field. Let's assume 0.3.

Bayes' computation:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04 \]

### Normalized Probabilities
Since these values are relative, to get a sense of the actual probabilities, we should normalize them:

1. Business Administration: 0.02
2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.04

Total = 0.02 + 0.04 = 0.06

Normalized:
- Business Administration: \( \frac{0.02}{0.06} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.333 \)
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( \frac{0.04}{0.06} = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.667 \)

Therefore, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.333,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.667
}
