Explanation:
1. **P(H) - Prior Probability**: This is the initial probability of Adam being enrolled in the fields without any personality sketch.
   - For agricultural and veterinary science, given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy, P(H) can be considered relatively high. Let's assume P(H) = 0.3.
   - For business administration, considering Adam’s interest in nature, which is less aligned with business administration, we'll assume P(H) = 0.1.
   
2. **P(E|H) - Likelihood**: This is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
   - For agricultural and veterinary science, Adam’s traits align very well with this field. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.9.
   - For business administration, Adam’s traits do not strongly align with this field. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.3.

3. **P(E|\neg H) - Complement Likelihood**: This is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in a specific field.
   - For agricultural and veterinary science, given how well his traits match, P(E|\neg H) can be considered lower. Assume P(E|\neg H) = 0.3.
   - For business administration, given the mismatch of traits, P(E|\neg H) can be considered higher. Assume P(E|\neg H) = 0.6.

4. **Bayes’ Rule Calculation**:
   - Bayes' Rule: \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \)
   - \( P(\neg H) \) is 1 - P(H).

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\( P(H) = 0.3 \)
\( P(E|H) = 0.9 \)
\( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \)
\( P(\neg H) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7 \)
\( P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.3}{0.9 \cdot 0.3 + 0.3 \cdot 0.7} = \frac{0.27}{0.27 + 0.21} = \frac{0.27}{0.48} \approx 0.5625 \)

For business administration:
\( P(H) = 0.1 \)
\( P(E|H) = 0.3 \)
\( P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \)
\( P(\neg H) = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9 \)
\( P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.3 \cdot 0.1 + 0.6 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.54} = \frac{0.03}{0.57} \approx 0.0526 \)

Simplifying further and rounding values:
- Agricultural and veterinary science: Approximately 0.9
- Business administration: Approximately 0.1
