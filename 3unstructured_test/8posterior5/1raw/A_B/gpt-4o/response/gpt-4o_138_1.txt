To solve this problem using Bayes' rule, we need to first define the probabilities and then compute the posterior probability. Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of evidence \( E \).

Since we are dealing with two fields (agricultural and veterinary science, business administration), we need to calculate these probabilities separately for both:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H₁)
1. **P(H₁)**: Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Let's denote P(H₁) as \( P(\text{AVS}) \).
   - Assume that among all graduate fields, a reasonable proportion is in agricultural and veterinary science, let's estimate around 0.1 or 10%.

2. **P(E|H₁)**: Probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H₁ \).
   - Given Adam's traits, it's quite likely for someone interested in nature, plants, and animals to be in this field.
   - This likelihood would be high, let's say around 0.8.

3. **P(E|\neg H₁)**: Probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that \( H₁ \) is not true.
   - Given that \( E \) is more aligned with AVS but not exclusive to it, we would consider this probability to be moderate. Let's estimate it around 0.3.

Now, applying Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H₁|E) = \frac{P(E|H₁) \cdot P(H₁)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is a normalization factor but can be considered constant for comparative purposes.

### Business Administration (H₂)
1. **P(H₂)**: Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration.
   - Let's denote P(H₂) as \( P(\text{BA}) \).
   - Assume that among all graduate fields, a reasonable proportion is in business administration, let's estimate around 0.15 or 15%.

2. **P(E|H₂)**: Probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H₂ \).
   - Adam's characteristics do not strongly align with typical traits observed in business administration, but it's still possible.
   - Let's assign a lower probability, say 0.1.

3. **P(E|\neg H₂)**: Probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that \( H₂ \) is not true.
   - Given \( E \) encompasses traits that are not particularly aligned with business administration, this likelihood is moderate. Let's estimate it around 0.4.

Now, applying Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H₂|E) = \frac{P(E|H₂) \cdot P(H₂)}{P(E)} \]

### Comparison and Final Calculation
Since we are more interested in the values of \( P(H|E) \) relative to each other rather than absolute numbers, we compare these probabilities.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[ P(H₁|E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \]

2. **Business Administration**:
   \[ P(H₂|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.15 = 0.015 \]

Normalizing these to a basis sum is not required as they aren't the only fields possible. Therefore, for the comparative probability values:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08,
  "business administration": 0.015
}
```

This indicates Adam is much more likely to be pursuing agricultural and veterinary science over business administration based on given attributes.
