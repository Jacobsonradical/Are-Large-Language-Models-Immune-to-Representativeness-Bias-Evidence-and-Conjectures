To calculate the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field based on his personality sketch, we'll use Bayes' rule. We'll denote P(H) as the prior probability of Adam being in a given field, P(E|H) as the likelihood of observing his personality traits if he were in that field, and P(E|¬H) as the likelihood of observing his personality traits if he were not in that field. Finally, we will compute P(H|E) as the posterior probability of each hypothesis given the evidence.

Let's start by estimating these values based on the information provided. 

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being in Business Administration. Let's assume a neutral estimate, say 0.1 (it could be adjusted based on real data, but we'll use a generic value for now).
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's traits if he were in Business Administration. Given the information, this seems relatively low because his traits are more aligned with science and nature-oriented fields. Let's estimate this at 0.2.
- **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing Adam's traits if he were not in Business Administration. Given that these traits are more common in science fields, let's estimate this at 0.8.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.8 \cdot 0.9} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.72} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.74} \approx 0.027 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given his interests and personality traits, this seems higher. Let's estimate it at 0.3.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's traits if he were in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given that his traits align well with this field, let’s estimate this at 0.8.
- **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing Adam's traits if he were not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. This is lower, but not too low as other fields might also match some of his traits; let's say 0.4.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.3}{0.8 \cdot 0.3 + 0.4 \cdot 0.7} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.24}{0.24 + 0.28} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.24}{0.52} \approx 0.462 \]

Here are the computed probabilities in the required format:

{
  "business administration": 0.027,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.462
