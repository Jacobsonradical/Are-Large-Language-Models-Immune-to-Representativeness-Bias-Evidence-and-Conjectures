To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or agricultural and veterinary science given the personality sketch (E), we'll use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the nature of the calculation, some values need to be assumed reasonably:

1. **Base rate probabilities (P(H))**: These reflect the prior probability of Adam being in a particular field without any additional information (E). I'll assume:
   - P(H) for business administration might be lower given Adam's interests in nature, plants, and animals.
   - P(H) for agricultural and veterinary science might be higher given his interests.

2. **Likelihood (P(E|H))**: This reflects how well the personality sketch fits with someone in that field. 
   - P(E|H) for business administration might be lower because the personality sketch does not particularly align with typical traits of business administration students.
   - P(E|H) for agricultural and veterinary science might be higher due to his interest in nature and animals.

3. **Complement likelihood (P(E|¬H))**: This reflects how well the personality sketch fits with someone not in that field.
   - P(E|¬H) for business administration or agricultural and veterinary science could be assumed based on common sense reasoning that these traits are less common in other fields such as engineering or physics.

Given these assumptions, we will now outline reasonable values for those probabilities:

Let's assume:
- P(H) for business administration = 0.1 (since it's less likely given Adam's personality)
- P(H) for agricultural and veterinary science = 0.3 (since it's more likely given Adam's personality)
- P(E|H) for business administration = 0.2 (the sketch does not fit well)
- P(E|H) for agricultural and veterinary science = 0.8 (the sketch fits well)
- P(E|¬H) for business administration = 0.4 (students in other fields can also have curiosity and a warm heart, etc.)
- P(E|¬H) for agricultural and veterinary science = 0.3 (others may also care about animals)

Now we assume a general prior for P(E). Since there are many other fields:
- P(E) for simplicity could be approximated equally for all fields (though not always realistic, it's a general simplification).

Let’s calculate P(H|E):

1. **Business administration:**

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.4} = \frac{0.02}{0.4} = 0.05 \]

2. **Agricultural and veterinary science:**

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.3}{0.3} = \frac{0.24}{0.3} = 0.8 \]

Therefore, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These values portray a higher likelihood that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration given the personality sketch provided.
