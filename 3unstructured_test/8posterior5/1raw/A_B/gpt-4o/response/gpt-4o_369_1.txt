To answer this question using Bayes' rule, we'll start by estimating the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \), and then compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \).

1. **Prior probability \( P(H) \)**: 
   - \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \): Assuming the proportion of graduate students enrolling in business administration is relatively high but lower than specialized fields like agricultural and veterinary science, we might estimate this as 0.2.
   - \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): Given that this is a specialized field and Adam's interests align strongly with this area, we may estimate this as higher, let's say 0.1.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \): The description of Adam's personality does not typically match a business administration student, so let's estimate this as 0.05.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): The likelihood that a student in agricultural and veterinary science has Adam's traits is high, possibly around 0.8.

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: For other fields, we need an average estimate. We assume:
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business administration}}) \approx \frac{\sum P(E|H_{\text{other fields}}) \times P(H_{\text{other fields}})}{\sum P(H_{\text{other fields}})} \), but without detailed data, we make a reasonable guess of around 0.1 considering the broad range of possibilities in other fields.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): Similarly, it would be less likely around 0.15.

Now applying Bayes' rule, \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \). However, \( P(E) \) is constant for each field and does not need to be calculated exactly as we are looking for relative values:

For **business administration**:
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \times P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) \propto 0.05 \times 0.2 = 0.01 \]

For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \times P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \]

Normalizing these values so they sum to 1, we get:
\[ \text{Total} = 0.01 + 0.08 = 0.09 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.09} \approx 0.111 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.09} \approx 0.889 \]

Thus, the final probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": 0.111,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.889
}
