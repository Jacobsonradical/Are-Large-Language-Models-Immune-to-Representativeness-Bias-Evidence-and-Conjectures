To use Bayes' Rule to compute \( P(H|E) \), we need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \). Since you haven't provided specific numbers, I'll make reasonable assumptions based on the given personality sketch of Adam and the nature of the fields of study.

Let's make the following assumptions:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that a randomly chosen graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in each field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in the field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in the field.

For simplicity, let's consider that the overall distribution among all possible graduate fields is roughly uniform, but we'll adjust slightly based on pertinence to the fields described. Note that these are assumed values for illustrative purposes only.

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \) (10% of graduate students are in business administration, a reasonable assumption for a heavily enrolled field).
2. **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's personality sketch focusing on nature, empathy, animals, and abstract concepts, it seems less likely that he would fit into business administration. So let's assign \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \). This is because his personality is more likely fitting in other fields outside of business administration.

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Since \( P(E) \) is common across all fields and we are primarily comparing relative probabilities, we can simplify this to proportional reasoning:

\[
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H)
\]

So for business administration:

\[
P(H|E)_{business} \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.1 = 0.01
\]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \) (5% of graduate students are in agricultural and veterinary science).
2. **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's love for nature, animals, and empathy, this field seems like a strong fit. Let's assign \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Given he doesn't fit into any field that isn't nature-focused, let's keep \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

Using the same proportional reasoning:

\[
P(H|E)_{agriculture} \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04
\]

Now let's normalize these proportions to form a rough comparative Bayesian estimate.

\[
P(H|E)_{business} \propto 0.01
\]

\[
P(H|E)_{agriculture} \propto 0.04
\]

### Relative Probabilities

Given the normalization over these values:

\[
\text{Normalization Factor} = 0.01 + 0.04 = 0.05
\]

\[
P(H|E)_{business} = \frac{0.01}{0.05} = 0.2
\]

\[
P(H|E)_{agriculture} = \frac{0.04}{0.05} = 0.8
\]

So the calculated probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These probabilities suggest that based on Adam's personality sketch, he is much more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration.
