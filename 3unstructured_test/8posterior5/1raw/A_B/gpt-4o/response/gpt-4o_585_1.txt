To estimate the probabilities, we need to consider the following:

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in a specific field.
- **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in a specific field.

Given these, we can use Bayes' Rule to compute:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we are comparing only two fields, we don't necessarily need the exact value of P(E), as it would be a common factor for both fields. 

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- **P(H)**: This field might have a relatively small but notable fraction of graduate students, say around 0.1.
- **P(E|H)**: Adam's characteristics strongly match with students in this field (curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, empathy, etc.), so this could be very high, say 0.75.
- **P(E|¬H)**: Probability of exhibiting these traits while not being in agricultural and veterinary science could be lower, say 0.2.

### Business Administration:
- **P(H)**: This field has a larger fraction of graduate students, likely closer to 0.25.
- **P(E|H)**: Business students might not typically have the described personality traits (quiet, love for nature, puzzles, animals). This might be low, say 0.1.
- **P(E|¬H)**: Probability of exhibiting these traits while not being in business administration could be moderate, say 0.25.

Using these estimates, we can compute the posterior probabilities.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[ 
P(H|E)_{av} = \frac{P(E|H_{av}) \cdot P(H_{av})}{P(E)} 
           = \frac{0.75 \times 0.1}{P(E)} 
           = 0.075 / P(E) 
\]

### Business Administration:

\[ 
P(H|E)_{ba} = \frac{P(E|H_{ba}) \cdot P(H_{ba})}{P(E)} 
           = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{P(E)} 
           = 0.025 / P(E) 
\]

To compare:

\[ 
\frac{P(H|E)_{av}}{P(H|E)_{ba}} 
= \frac{0.075 / P(E)}{0.025 / P(E)} 
= \frac{0.075}{0.025} 
= 3 
\]

So, P(H|E) for agricultural and veterinary science is 3 times more likely than for business administration. 

Given these relative odds and the priors:

\[
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.25
}
\]

Note: These values are estimates based on given traits and logical deductions. Actual probabilities can vary with more specific data.
