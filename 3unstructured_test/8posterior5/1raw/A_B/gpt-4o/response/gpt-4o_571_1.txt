To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in "business administration" or "agricultural and veterinary science" given the personality sketch E, we start by estimating the following:

1. P(H) - the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
2. P(E|H) - the likelihood of the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
3. P(E|\neg H) - the likelihood of the personality sketch E given that Adam was NOT enrolled in that field.
4. P(H|E) - the posterior probability, which is computed using Bayes' rule: \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \).

Since the total probabilities do not need to add up to 1 and we are not given explicit numerical prior probabilities, these estimates will be heuristic and qualitative.

### Business Administration

- P(H) for business administration: For graduate students, business administration is a common field, so let's assume a moderate prior probability. Let's denote \( P(H) = 0.15 \).

- P(E|H): The personality sketch describes traits common in fields like natural sciences more than business administration. Empathy and love for animals are not typically associated strongly with business administration. Therefore, let's say \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

- P(E|\neg H): Given the wide range of other fields that could share similar personality traits (e.g., various sciences, humanities), let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.05 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the sum of the probabilities of E over all possible hypotheses, we'll simplify it to a constant for comparison purposes. We compute the relative values:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \approx 0.1 \cdot 0.15 = 0.015 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- P(H) for agricultural and veterinary science: This is a less common but relevant field given Adam's traits. Someone studying nature and animals fits well here. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).

- P(E|H): The described personality traits align very well with agricultural and veterinary science, so let's use a high value. Let's set \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

- P(E|\neg H): Again, assuming a broad range of other fields where the sketch traits might occur, we estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.05 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Similarly, computing the relative value:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \approx 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04 \]

### Summary

Given the relative likelihoods calculated, we have the following probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.015,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.04
}

These values indicate that it is more likely for Adam to have been enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality traits than in business administration.
