To address the problem using Bayes' rule, we'll break it down step-by-step for each field.

1. **P(H)** - The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
2. **P(E|H)** - The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \(E\), given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)** - The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \(E\), given that Adam was *not* enrolled in that field.
4. **P(H|E)** - The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field, given the personality sketch \(E\).

Let's start with **agricultural and veterinary science**.

## Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)** (Prior probability):
   - Assuming equal probability across a large number of potential fields, we can set a neutral starting point. Let's say P(H) = 0.05 (5%).

2. **P(E|H)** (Likelihood):
   - Given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, his interests and personality align well with agricultural and veterinary science. This makes \( P(E|H) \) quite high. Let's estimate P(E|H) = 0.9.

3. **P(E|\neg H)** (Likelihood if not in the field):
   - The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he wasn't in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his traits, it seems less likely that all these qualities would strongly align with other fields. Let's estimate P(E|\neg H) = 0.2.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.045 + 0.19 = 0.235 \]

Therefore:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.235} \approx 0.191 \]

## Business Administration

1. **P(H)** (Prior probability):
   - Again, assuming equal probability across multiple fields, we set a neutral prior. Let's say P(H) = 0.05 (5%).

2. **P(E|H)** (Likelihood):
   - Given Adam's interests and personality, it's less likely he would be in business administration. Let's estimate P(E|H) = 0.1.

3. **P(E|\neg H)** (Likelihood if not in the field):
   - The probability of observing Adam's sketch if he wasn't in business administration could be somewhat higher as there are many other fields fitting his traits better. Let's estimate P(E|\neg H) = 0.25.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.05) + (0.25 \cdot 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.005 + 0.2375 = 0.2425 \]

Therefore:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.05}{0.2425} \approx 0.021 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities given the personality sketch are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.191,
  "business administration": 0.021
}
```
