Let's start by breaking down the problem:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing E (Adam's personality sketch) given H (Adam is enrolled in that field).
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing E (Adam's personality sketch) given ¬H (Adam is not enrolled in that field).
4. **P(H|E)**: The posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field given E, which we compute using Bayes' rule.

Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

**Assumptions Made:**
- P(E) can be considered a normalizing constant for simplicity in relative comparison.
- P(H) is assumed to be uniformly distributed given no prior information about Adam's field of study. Since we are only given two fields to compare, the prior probabilities are equal \( P(H_{\text{business}}) = P(H_{\text{agri}}) = 0.5 \).

### For Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: Assuming a uniform prior, P(H) = 0.5
2. **P(E|H)**: Adam's personality sketch does not explicitly align with traits typical of a business administration student (such as a focus on economics, management, and entrepreneurship). So, let's assume P(E|H) is relatively low, around 0.2.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing Adam’s personality in fields other than business administration seems higher because of the specific interests and aptitude for nature, abstract concepts, and animals. Let's assume P(E|¬H) to be somewhat higher at 0.8.

\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}}) \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) \propto 0.2 \times 0.5 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) \propto 0.1 \]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: Assuming a uniform prior, P(H) = 0.5
2. **P(E|H)**: Adam's strong interest in nature, empathy, and love for animals highly align with agricultural and veterinary science. P(E|H) is high, around 0.9.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing Adam’s personality in fields excluding agricultural and veterinary science is lower since those specific traits (curiosity about nature, empathy towards animals) align less with non-related disciplines. Let's assume P(E|¬H) around 0.4.

\[ P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agri}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agri}}) \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) \propto 0.9 \times 0.5 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) \propto 0.45 \]

### Normalizing:

Since we are looking at a relative comparison:

\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.1+0.45} = \frac{0.1}{0.55} \approx 0.182 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) = \frac{0.45}{0.1+0.45} = \frac{0.45}{0.55} \approx 0.818 \]

Given this breakdown:

  "business administration": "0.182",
