To solve this problem, we'll apply Bayes' theorem, which is expressed as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

For simplicity, we won't calculate \( P(E) \) directly because we're only interested in the relative probabilities for different hypotheses.

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration.
   - Graduate students in the U.S. enrolling in business administration is relatively common, but Adamâ€™s interests (nature, empathy, love for animals) do not directly align with this field. Let's assign a somewhat lower prior, say \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.1 \).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the evidence given Adam is enrolled in business administration.
   - The described characteristics do not strongly match with business administration. Thus, we can assign a low probability, say \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.05 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of the evidence given Adam is NOT enrolled in business administration.
   - Given the described characteristics, he seems more fitting for other fields, suggesting a high probability for \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \), let's assign \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.95 \).

Applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{0.05 \cdot 0.1 + 0.95 \cdot (1 - 0.1)} \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Considering Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, and a warm heart, it aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science. We can assign a higher prior, say \( P(H_{AVS}) = 0.2 \) .

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the evidence given Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - His characteristics strongly align with this field, so we can assign a higher probability, say \( P(E|H_{AVS}) = 0.9 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of the evidence given Adam is NOT enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Given the strong match, other fields are less likely, so let's assign \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) = 0.1 \).

Applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.2}{0.9 \cdot 0.2 + 0.1 \cdot (1 - 0.2)} \]

### Calculations

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.855} = \frac{0.005}{0.86} \approx 0.0058 \]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.18}{0.18 + 0.08} = \frac{0.18}{0.26} \approx 0.692 \]

Thus, using Bayes' theorem, we get:

{
  "business administration": 0.0058,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.692
}
