To calculate the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we start with the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given we need to assess these for two fields:

1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
2. Business Administration

First, let's analyze the given data.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
**Prior Probability, \(P(H)\):**
This field aligns well with Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals. It's reasonable to assign a relatively higher prior probability here.

**Likelihood, \(P(E|H)\):**
Given Adam's personality sketch, it's high that he fits into this field. Since this field requires understanding abstract concepts, appreciation for hard work, and empathy for animals, \(P(E|H)\) is also high.

**Complementary Likelihood, \(P(E|\neg H)\):**
For fields other than Agricultural and Veterinary Science, the personality sketch doesn't align as strongly. This makes \(P(E|\neg H)\) relatively lower.

### Business Administration
**Prior Probability, \(P(H)\):**
Adam being in Business Administration seems less probable based on the personality sketch, given his interests and empathy. So, the prior probability can be moderately lower here.

**Likelihood, \(P(E|H)\):**
Business Administration usually requires different key attributes like leadership and financial acumen that aren't strongly highlighted in Adam's sketch. Thus, \(P(E|H)\) is lower.

**Complementary Likelihood, \(P(E|\neg H)\):**
Given there are many possible fields Adam could be in that fit his personality sketch better, \(P(E|\neg H)\) is higher for Business Administration.

### Preliminary Values
Assuming informal values to describe the likelihoods:
Given:
- \(P(E) \approx 1\) (since it's just what we observe)
- Let’s assume \(P(Agricultural and Veterinary Science)\) = 0.3
- Let’s assume \(P(Business Administration)\) = 0.05

For simplification, let’s assume some values:
- \(P(E|Agricultural and Veterinary Science) = 0.8\)
- \(P(E|\neg Agricultural and Veterinary Science) = 0.3\)
- \(P(E|Business Administration) = 0.1\)
- \(P(E|\neg Business Administration) = 0.5\)

Let's plug these into Bayes' rule:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- \( P(Agricultural and Veterinary Science|E) = \frac{P(E|Agricultural and Veterinary Science) \cdot P(Agricultural and Veterinary Science)}{P(E)} \)
- \( \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.3}{1} = 0.24 \)

### Business Administration:
- \( P(Business Administration|E) = \frac{P(E|Business Administration) \cdot P(Business Administration)}{P(E)} \)
- \( \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.05}{1} = 0.005 \)

Hence, the posterior probabilities for Adam being in these fields would be:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.24,
  "business administration": 0.005
}
```

These values are indicative rather than absolute and are based on the likelihoods and priors derived from the provided sketch and assumptions made.
