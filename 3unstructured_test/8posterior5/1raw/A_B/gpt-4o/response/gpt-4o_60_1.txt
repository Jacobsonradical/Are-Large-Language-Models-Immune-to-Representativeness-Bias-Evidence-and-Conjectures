To compute \( P(H|E) \), we need to use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have exact values, we need to make reasonable estimates based on the given information.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Given his genuine curiosity about nature, interest in plants, and love for animals, this seems moderately likely.
   - Estimate: 0.2

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that H is true.
   - His personality traits strongly align with a field focused on animals and nature.
   - Estimate: 0.8

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that H is false.
   - These traits are generally less expected in fields that are not related to nature or animals.
   - Estimate: 0.2

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
   - Given his personality sketch, this seems less likely as he appears more oriented towards nature and empathy than business.
   - Estimate: 0.1

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that H is true.
   - These traits do not strongly align with typical characteristics emphasized in business administration.
   - Estimate: 0.1

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that H is false.
   - This would be moderately likely if he were in other fields outside business administration.
   - Estimate: 0.3

To apply Bayes' theorem, we also need to estimate \( P(E) \) for each hypothesis. However, we can compare relative probabilities without determining the exact \( P(E) \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.2 = 0.16 \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.1 = 0.01 \]

Since these are relative probabilities, we can compare them directly.

### Final Answer:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.16,
  "business administration": 0.01
}
```

This analysis shows that Adam is much more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration, based on the given personality sketch.
