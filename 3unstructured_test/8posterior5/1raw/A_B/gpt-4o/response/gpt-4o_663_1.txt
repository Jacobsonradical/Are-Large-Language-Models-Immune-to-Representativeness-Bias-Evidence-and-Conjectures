To determine the probability of Adam being enrolled in "agricultural and veterinary science" or "business administration," we'll use Bayes' theorem, which is formulated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in the given field \( H \), \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam’s characteristics given he is in that field, and \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of Adam’s characteristics given he is not in that field. Since we only need comparative values, we can simplify the task by assuming \( P(E) \) to be a normalizing constant, and our main task is to estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: Since Agricultural and Veterinary Science is a relatively specialized field, let's assume it has a moderate prior probability.
  - \( P(H) = 0.05 \)

- **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam’s characteristics fit well with this field. His curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work are highly relevant.
  - \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \)

- **Non-Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Assuming \(\neg H\) encompasses all other fields, many would not fit Adam's specific interests and personality as closely, so the likelihood of him having these characteristics if not in agricultural and veterinary science might be low.
  - \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \)

### Business Administration

- **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: Business Administration is a more common graduate field.
  - \( P(H) = 0.15 \)

- **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam’s characteristics do not closely match the typical profile for a Business Administration student, which often involves skills in management, finance, and less emphasis on nature and animals.
  - \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \)

- **Non-Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Given many other fields exist with varying relevance to Adam’s characteristics, this would still be relatively low.
  - \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \)

### Applying Bayes' Theorem

Using these values, we can now compute \( P(H|E) \) for both fields.

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} = \frac{0.04}{P(E)} \]

#### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} = \frac{0.03}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing factor and does not affect the comparative results, here are the unnormalized probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.04,
  "business administration": 0.03
}

After normalizing:

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.03} = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.571 \]

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.04 + 0.03} = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.429 \]

So the final estimates are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.571,
  "business administration": 0.429
}
