To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \), we will apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's break down the calculations for each field.

### Business Administration:

#### 1. Assigning Prior Probabilities:
- \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): The probability that Adam is in business administration. Let's assume a prior probability of 0.1.
- \( P(\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 1 - P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.9 \).

#### 2. Likelihoods:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): The likelihood that Adam has the described personality given that he is enrolled in business administration. Considering the description, it seems less aligned with a typical business administration student's characteristics. I'll assign a value of 0.1.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \): The likelihood of having the personality given that Adam is not in business administration. Given Adam's traits better align with fields involving nature, animals, and abstract thinking, I'll assign a value of 0.7.

#### 3. Normalization Constant:
Let \( P(E) \) be our normalization constant that ensures the probability sums correctly. We don't calculate \( P(E) \) directly but acknowledge it's there to standardize our result.

By Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \]

Combining the values:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{ 0.1 \cdot 0.1 + 0.9 \cdot 0.7} = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.63} = \frac{0.01}{0.64} \approx 0.0156 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

#### 1. Assigning Prior Probabilities:
- \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \): The probability that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science. Considering his traits, this seems highly plausible. Assume a prior of 0.4.
- \( P(\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) = 1 - P(H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.6 \).

#### 2. Likelihoods:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \): The likelihood that Adam has the described personality given he is in agricultural and veterinary science. I'll put this high, say 0.8.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \): The likelihood of having the personality given he's not in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's consider this as a general average value due to other fields potentially matching his personality. I'll assign a value of 0.4.

#### 3. Normalization Constant:
Here, too, we understand \( P(E) \) as the standardizing factor.

By Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}})}{P(E)} \]

Combining the values:
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.4}{0.8 \cdot 0.4 + 0.4 \cdot 0.6} = \frac{0.32}{0.32 + 0.24} = \frac{0.32}{0.56} \approx 0.5714 \]

Combining the results, we have:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0156,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5714
}
