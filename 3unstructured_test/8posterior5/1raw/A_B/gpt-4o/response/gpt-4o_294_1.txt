Let's denote the relevant probabilities for the field of agricultural and veterinary science as follows:

- P(A): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- P(E|A): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- P(E|¬A): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- P(A|E): The posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch.

Similarly, we denote the relevant probabilities for the field of business administration:

- P(B): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration.
- P(E|B): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is enrolled in business administration.
- P(E|¬B): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is not enrolled in business administration.
- P(B|E): The posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science (A):

**P(A):** 
The prior probability of enrolling in agricultural and veterinary science is relatively low compared to more common fields like business administration, but it's not negligible.

Estimation: 0.05

**P(E|A):**
Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, the likelihood of him being in agricultural and veterinary science is quite high.

Estimation: 0.8

**P(E|¬A):**
The probability of having Adam's personality sketch if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science is lower, because his interests strongly align with this field.

Estimation: 0.2

**P(A|E):**
Using Bayes' Rule: \( P(A|E) = \frac{P(E|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(E)} \)
Where \( P(E) = P(E|A) \cdot P(A) + P(E|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \)
Substitute in the values:
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95) = 0.04 + 0.19 = 0.23 \]

\[ P(A|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.23} \approx 0.174 \]

#### Business Administration (B):

**P(B):**
The prior probability of enrolling in business administration is higher due to the popularity of the field.

Estimation: 0.2

**P(E|B):**
Given Adam's personality sketch, the likelihood of him being in business administration is relatively low, as his interests don't directly align with this field.

Estimation: 0.1

**P(E|¬B):**
The probability of having Adam's personality sketch if he is not in business administration is higher, considering many fields align better with his interests.

Estimation: 0.3

**P(B|E):**
Using Bayes' Rule: \( P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \)
Where \( P(E) = P(E|B) \cdot P(B) + P(E|\neg B) \cdot P(\neg B) \)
Substitute in the values:
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) = 0.02 + 0.24 = 0.26 \]

\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.26} \approx 0.077 \]

### Final Results:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.174,
  "business administration": 0.077
}
