Let's analyze the given information and use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study based on Adam's personality sketch.

Bayes' rule is stated as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is common in all calculations, we can focus on the proportional relationships. Below are the assumptions for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in this field. Let's assume a moderate value like 0.1 (10%).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam’s personality sketch given he is in this field. Given his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, let's assume this to be high, around 0.8.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam’s personality sketch given he is not in this field. This can be moderately lower given his traits are quite specific to this field, so let's assume around 0.3.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in this field. This field is very common, so let's assume a higher value like 0.3 (30%).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam’s personality sketch given he is in this field. His traits don’t fit perfectly within this field, so let's assume a lower value like 0.2.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam’s personality sketch given he is not in this field. This would be slightly higher, as there are many other fields apart from business administration that might fit better, so let's assume around 0.5.

Using Bayes' rule, we can compute the proportional values for \( P(H|E) \) without needing \( P(E) \).

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]

For **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \cdot 0.3 = 0.06 \]

Normalizing these so that they sum to 1 would give a better comparison, but since it's stated that the total doesn't need to add up to 1 because of other possible fields of specialization, we can present them as they are.

Here is the answer in the required format:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08,
  "business administration": 0.06
}
