To compute the probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for Adam being enrolled in business administration or agricultural and veterinary science, we need to consider each field and use Bayes' rule: 

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

The steps are as follows:

1. **P(H):** The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field.
2. **P(E|H):** The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is in a particular field.
3. **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is not in that particular field.

Given that P(E) is a normalizing constant and assumed to be the same for both hypotheses for relative comparison, we'll focus on \(P(E|H)\) and \(P(H)\).

### Business Administration

1. **P(H) for Business Administration:** This is the general prior probability that a graduate student might be in business administration. For simplicity and without specific data, let's assume a neutral prior of 0.1 (10%).
2. **P(E|H) for Business Administration:** Given Adam's traits – deep love for nature, animals, empathy, and abstract thinking – it seems less likely to align with a business field's typical skillset and interests. Let’s assume a low probability, perhaps around 0.05.
3. **P(E|\neg H) for Business Administration:** If Adam is not in business administration, his personality traits might still match reasonably well with the general population of other fields. Let’s assume this probability is around 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule in a proportional manner:

\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.05 \cdot 0.1 = 0.005 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The prior probability here might be lower overall but higher than in business administration, say 0.05 (5%).
2. **P(E|H) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam’s traits align well with this field given his love for nature and animals. Let’s assume a high probability, perhaps around 0.8.
3. **P(E|\neg H) for Agricultural Science:** If Adam is not in this field, the fit of his personality traits to other fields could be more varied; we might assume this probability is around 0.25.

Again, using Bayes' rule in a proportional manner:

\[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04 \]

### Normalization:

While we won't formally normalize these probabilities across all possible fields as requested, we can still compare them relatively.

So, the relative probabilities (not exact but for comparison) are:

\[ \text{Business Administration}: 0.005 \]
\[ \text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}: 0.04 \]
