To start, we'll define the following probabilities in the context of graduate fields of study:

- P(H) = Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.
- P(E|H) = Likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in a particular field.
- P(E|¬H) = Likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in that field.

We then use Bayes' theorem to compute P(H|E), the posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

P(E) can generally be seen as a normalizing factor. Since we're asked to evaluate more than one field and don't need the sum to add up to 1, we can focus on the relative comparisons between P(H|E) values for each field.

Given Adam’s traits, we can make educated estimations for these probabilities:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- P(H): The likelihood that a random graduate student is in this field might be moderate to low due to fewer programs in these specialized areas compared to fields like business. Let's estimate this at 0.1.
- P(E|H): Given Adam’s curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, this field seems to align well with his personality sketch. Let's estimate this at 0.8.
- P(E|¬H): The likelihood of a non-agricultural/non-veterinary student having this personality sketch is lower. Let’s assume it at 0.2.

### Business Administration
- P(H): The likelihood that a random graduate student is in this field is higher due to the popularity and prevalence of business programs. Let's estimate this at 0.3.
- P(E|H): Given Adam’s empathy, intelligence, and appreciation for dedication, but considering his deep love for animals and nature, this field seems less fitting. Let's estimate this at 0.2.
- P(E|¬H): The likelihood of a non-business student having this personality sketch doesn’t change significantly. Let's assume it at 0.4.

Now, let's calculate P(H|E) for each field.

\[
P(H|E)_{Agri-Veterinary} = \frac{P(E|H)_{Agri-Veterinary} \cdot P(H)_{Agri-Veterinary}}{P(E)}
\]
\[
P(H|E)_{Business} = \frac{P(E|H)_{Business} \cdot P(H)_{Business}}{P(E)}
\]

As P(E) is a normalizing factor and does not change within individual comparisons in this format, we can ignore it for relative comparison:

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[
P(H|E)_{Agri-Veterinary} = 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08
\]

#### Business Administration
\[
P(H|E)_{Business} = 0.2 \times 0.3 = 0.06
\]

Now, put this into the requested format:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.08",
  "business administration": "0.06"
}
