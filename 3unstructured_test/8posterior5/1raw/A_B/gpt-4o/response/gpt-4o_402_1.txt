To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) through Bayes' rule for whether Adam was enrolled in business administration or agricultural and veterinary science, we need to consider several probabilities:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability Adam is in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the evidence given the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the evidence given that he is not in the field.

Then, we apply Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we are only comparing these two fields, we can treat \( P(E) \) as a normalizing constant. However, without precise priors \( P(H) \) and likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) from data, we'll need to intuitively estimate these values based on the given personality sketch and general knowledge.

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**
   - Business administration is a common graduate field, but it may not be as aligned with Adam's interests in nature, animals, and abstract concepts.
   - Let’s assume \( P(H) \) for business administration is moderately low given Adam's personality traits.
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**
   - The characteristics described for Adam do not strongly align with typical traits desired in business administration such as strategic thinking, interest in corporate environments, or leadership ambitions.
   - \( P(E|H) \) for business administration is likely low.
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \) represents the probability of observing Adam’s traits given he is **not** in business administration. Since many fields could fit Adam better, this likelihood would be higher.
   - Let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) \) is moderately high.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.7 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**
   - Agricultural and veterinary science fit well with Adam's interests in nature, plants, animals, and abstract understanding.
   - Let’s assume a higher \( P(H) \) for this field.
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**
   - The evidence of Adam's traits aligns well with someone in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - \( P(E|H) \) for this field is high.
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \) represents the probability of Adam’s traits if **not** in agricultural and veterinary science. It should be lower since fewer other fields match his interests as closely.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \).

### Calculating Posterior Probabilities \( P(H|E) \)

Using Bayes' rule (simplifying by treating \( P(E) \) as a normalizing constant):

#### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02 \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.9 \times 0.3 = 0.27 \]

### Normalizing
Total unnormalized probabilities:
\[ 0.02 + 0.27 = 0.29 \]

Normalized probabilities:
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.29} \approx 0.069 \]
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.27}{0.29} \approx 0.931 \]

Thus, the computed posterior probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": 0.069,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.931
}
