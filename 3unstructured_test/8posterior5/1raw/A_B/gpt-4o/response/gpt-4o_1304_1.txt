Sure, let's analyze the given information and calculate the probabilities using Bayes' Rule. 

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)**: Probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration. This could be relatively low given his interests align more with nature, animals, and abstract concepts, which are not primarily associated with business administration. Therefore, let's assume a prior: \(P(\text{H}) = 0.1\).

2. **P(E|H)**: Probability of observing the personality sketch E given that he's in business administration. Since the sketch strongly deviates from typical traits associated with business students, we'd assign a lower likelihood: \(P(\text{E|H}) = 0.2\).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability of observing the personality sketch if he's not in business administration. Given that E matches quite well with some other fields like science, let's be generous here: \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.8\).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(\text{H|E}) = \frac{P(\text{E|H}) \cdot P(\text{H})}{P(\text{E})} \]

Note: Since we're computing comparative probabilities, P(E) can be treated as a normalizing constant, or we can rely on proportional reasoning:

\[ P(\text{H|E}) \propto P(\text{E|H}) \cdot P(\text{H}) = 0.2 \times 0.1 = 0.02 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H)**: Probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This seems much more likely given his interests in nature, animals, and abstract concepts. Let's assume a higher prior: \( P(\text{H}) = 0.4 \).

2. **P(E|H)**: Probability of observing the personality sketch E given that he's in agricultural and veterinary science. This matches well with the description, so we can assign a higher likelihood: \( P(\text{E|H}) = 0.9 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability of observing the personality sketch if he's not in this field. Given that E fits more narrowly into fewer fields, let's be more conservative: \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(\text{H|E}) \propto P(\text{E|H}) \cdot P(\text{H}) = 0.9 \times 0.4 = 0.36 \]

### Normalized Comparison
As mentioned, the total does not need to add up to 1 for different fields because P(E) (the normalizing constant) is the same for both comparisons. We care about comparative strengths:

{
  "business administration": \( 0.02 \),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( 0.36 \)
