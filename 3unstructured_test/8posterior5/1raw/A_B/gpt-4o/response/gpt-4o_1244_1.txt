Sure, let's evaluate the probabilities step by step and then compute \( P(H | E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: The probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his interests and traits, this seems like a plausible field.
   \[
   P(H) \approx 0.2 
   \]

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This field aligns well with his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work.
   \[
   P(E|H) \approx 0.9 
   \]

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This is a broad scenario, but we can assume that this personality is somewhat less likely in other fields not related to nature or animals.
   \[
   P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 
   \]

Using Bayes' rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
Where:
\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]
\[
P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) = 0.18 + 0.24 = 0.42
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.2}{0.42} \approx 0.4286 
\]

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: The probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Given his personality traits, this seems less likely.
   \[
   P(H) \approx 0.05 
   \]

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in business administration. The characteristics mentioned do not strongly align with typical interests in business administration.
   \[
   P(E|H) \approx 0.1 
   \]

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in business administration.
   \[
   P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4  \text{ (updated from the previous due to broader applicability)}
   \]

Using Bayes' rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
Where:
\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]
\[
P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.05) + (0.4 \cdot 0.95) = 0.005 + 0.38 = 0.385
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.05}{0.385} \approx 0.013
\]

### Final Output

{
   "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4286,
   "business administration": 0.013
}
