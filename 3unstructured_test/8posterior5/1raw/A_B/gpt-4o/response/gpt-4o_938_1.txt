To compute \( P(H|E) \) for both fields (agricultural and veterinary science, and business administration), we need to use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, we can compare the relative likelihoods of Adam being in each field given the personality sketch (E). The actual posterior probabilities depend on the prior probabilities of enrollment in those fields \( P(H) \) and the likelihood of the personality sketch given the field \( P(E|H) \). Let's assign some illustrative values to each term:

1. **P(H)** - The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field.
2. **P(E|H)** - The probability of having the personality sketch given that Adam was in the field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)** - The probability of having the personality sketch given that Adam was not in the field.

**1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
- **P(H)**: Given Adam's personality and interests, it’s reasonable to assume a higher prior probability that he would enroll in a field related to nature and animals.
- **P(E|H)**: High, as the field aligns well with his interests in nature, plants, animals, empathy, and abstract thinking.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Lower, as not all fields outside agriculture and veterinary science would fit his profile so well.

**2. Business Administration**:
- **P(H)**: Given Adam's personality and interests, it’s less likely he would enroll in business administration.
- **P(E|H)**: Lower, as the field does not directly align with his interests in nature, plants, and animals.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Somewhat higher because business administration is a common field and not as specific to his interests.

Let’s assign illustrative values:

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science} & \quad \text{Business Administration} \\
P(H) & = 0.2 & P(H) & = 0.1 \\
P(E|H) & = 0.8 & P(E|H) & = 0.3 \\
P(E|\neg H) & = 0.3 & P(E|\neg H) & = 0.5 \\
\end{align*}
\]

Now, calculate posterior probabilities:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
\[
P(E) \approx P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8 = 0.16 + 0.24 = 0.4
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{0.4} = \frac{0.16}{0.4} = 0.4
\]

2. **Business Administration**:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
\[
P(E) \approx P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) = 0.3 \cdot 0.1 + 0.5 \cdot 0.9 = 0.03 + 0.45 = 0.48
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.48} = \frac{0.03}{0.48} \approx 0.0625
\]

Thus, the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.0625
}
```
