To apply Bayes' Rule, we need to understand the following probabilities for each field:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam is in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam is not in that field.
4. \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability that Adam is in a given field given the evidence \( E \), which we will compute using Bayes' Rule.

For brevity, we'll assume that:
- The probability of a graduate student being in any given field of study is broadly distributed, without any detailed statistical data.
- We will use general knowledge to estimate these probabilities.

### Estimates for Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

- \( P(H) \):
  - Let's assume the baseline probability that a random graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science is moderate. Let's set it to 0.1.
  
- \( P(E|H) \):
  - Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, and his understanding of hard work aligns well with this field. We will assign a high likelihood, let's set it to 0.7.
  
- \( P(E|\neg H) \):
  - Given the broad range of other fields, the likelihood of Adam having these attributes but not being in agricultural and veterinary science is lower. Let's set it to 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.7 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.07 + 0.27 = 0.34 \]

Finally,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.34} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.07}{0.34} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.206 \]

### Estimates for Business Administration:

- \( P(H) \):
  - Assuming the baseline probability of a random graduate student being in business administration is higher due to its popularity. Let's set it to 0.2.
  
- \( P(E|H) \):
  - Adam's interests and traits are less commonly associated with business administration. We will assign a lower likelihood, let's set it to 0.2.
  
- \( P(E|\neg H) \):
  - Given the broad range of other fields and the less specific match, assigning a higher value. Let's set it to 0.4.

Again using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.32 = 0.36 \]

Finally,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.36} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.04}{0.36} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.111 \]

Putting everything together:
