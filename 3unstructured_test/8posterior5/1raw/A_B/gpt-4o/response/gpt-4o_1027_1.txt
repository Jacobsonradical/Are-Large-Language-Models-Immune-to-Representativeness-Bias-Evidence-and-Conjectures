To solve this problem, we will start by calculating the various probabilities needed to apply Bayes' theorem. Here is how we should approach the task:

1. \(P(H)\): The prior probability of Adam being in a particular field.
2. \(P(E|H)\): The probability of observing the personality sketch if Adam is in that field.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of observing the personality sketch if Adam is not in that field.
4. Apply Bayes' Theorem: 
\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]
Where \(P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)\)

Let's set up values for each field based on the provided personality sketch.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. \(P(H)\): This can be assumed to be relatively low or moderate as agriculture and veterinary science are specialized fields, yet Adam’s love for nature and animals fits well here. Let’s assume \(P(H)\) = 0.10
2. \(P(E|H)\): This is high because Adam's characteristics align closely with traits beneficial for this field. Let's assume \(P(E|H)\) = 0.85
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): How likely is the personality sketch given he is not studying agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume this value is lower due to the specificity of the fit. Assume \(P(E|\neg H)\) = 0.05

Bayes' Theorem:
\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]
Where:
\[P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)\]
\[P(E) = (0.85 \cdot 0.10) + (0.05 \cdot 0.90) = 0.085 + 0.045 = 0.13\]

So:
\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.85 \cdot 0.10}{0.13} = \frac{0.085}{0.13} ≈ 0.65\]

### Business Administration

1. \(P(H)\): This is higher due to the popularity of business administration, but let's infer a moderate probability based on lack of strong alignment with Adam's traits. Assume \(P(H)\) = 0.15
2. \(P(E|H)\): Lower since Adam's characteristics do not strongly align with typical traits beneficial for business administration. Assume \(P(E|H)\) = 0.10.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): Assume similar as before. Assume \(P(E|\neg H)\) = 0.05.

Bayes' Theorem:
\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]
Where:
\[P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)\]
\[P(E) = (0.10 \cdot 0.15) + (0.05 \cdot 0.85) = 0.015 + 0.0425 = 0.0575\]

So:
\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.10 \cdot 0.15}{0.0575} = \frac{0.015}{0.0575} ≈ 0.26\]
