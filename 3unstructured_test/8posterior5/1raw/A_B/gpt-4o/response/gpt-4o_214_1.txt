Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can assign probabilities for each of the hypotheses and then apply Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probabilities \(P(H|E)\).

Let's assume the following prior probabilities:

- \(P(\text{H}_{\text{business admin}})\): Probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration
- \(P(\text{H}_{\text{agricultural/veterinary}})\): Probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science

Let's assign these prior probabilities as they can be relatively common fields:

- \(P(\text{H}_{\text{business admin}}) = 0.2\)
- \(P(\text{H}_{\text{agricultural/veterinary}}) = 0.05\)

Now, let's estimate:

- \(P(E | \text{H}_{\text{business admin}})\): Probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is in business administration
- \(P(E | \text{H}_{\text{agricultural/veterinary}})\): Probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is in agricultural and veterinary science
- \(P(E)\): Overall probability of Adam's personality sketch

Considering the details of Adam's personality:

1. **Business Administration:**
    - \(P(E | \text{H}_{\text{business admin}})\) is likely lower because his traits don't directly align with typical business administration interests or skills. Let's assign \(P(E | \text{H}_{\text{business admin}}) = 0.1\).

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \(P(E | \text{H}_{\text{agricultural/veterinary}})\) would be much higher because his traits align well with a field involving nature, plants, and animals, empathy, and hard work. Let's assign \(P(E | \text{H}_{\text{agricultural/veterinary}}) = 0.8\).

For the sake of simplicity, let's calculate the overall probability \(P(E)\) using just these two fields:

\[ P(E) = P(E | \text{H}_{\text{business admin}}) \cdot P(\text{H}_{\text{business admin}}) + P(E | \text{H}_{\text{agricultural/veterinary}}) \cdot P(\text{H}_{\text{agricultural/veterinary}}) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.2) + (0.8 \times 0.05) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.04 = 0.06 \]

Now apply Bayes' rule to find \(P(H|E)\):

\[ P(\text{H}|\text{E}) = \frac{P(E|\text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H})}{P(E)} \]

1. **Business Administration:**
\[ P(\text{H}_{\text{business admin}}|\text{E}) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.06} = \frac{0.02}{0.06} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.333\]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(\text{H}_{\text{agricultural/veterinary}}|\text{E}) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.06} = \frac{0.04}{0.06} = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.667\]

So, the values are:

{
  "business administration": 0.333,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.667
}

These values suggest that based on Adam's personality traits, he is more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than business administration.
