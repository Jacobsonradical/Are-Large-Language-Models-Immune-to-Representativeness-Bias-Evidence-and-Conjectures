To calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probability of the hypothesis \( P(H) \), the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H) \). Bayes' rule is defined as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) (the overall probability of the evidence) is the same for all hypotheses, we can compare the relative values of \( P(H|E) \) without needing its exact value. Thus, we will focus on estimating \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field of study.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Assume some reasonable priors such as around 0.05 (uncertainty about exact values, but we assume it's low because of the large number of possible graduate fields).
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: High, given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy. Estimate it at around 0.8.
3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Lower than \( P(E|H) \) because his personality traits are more aligned with agricultural and veterinary science. Estimate it at around 0.2.

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Assume a prior probability around 0.05.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Low, since Adam’s personality traits don’t strongly align with typical traits required for business administration like extroversion, interest in commerce, etc. Estimate it at around 0.2.
3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Higher than \( P(E|H) \) as his traits are not specific to business. Estimate it at around 0.8.

### Calculations

We'll calculate the relative probabilities separately:

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \approx 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04 \]

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \approx 0.2 \cdot 0.05 = 0.01 \]

Now we normalize these probabilities to get the total sum of them equal to 1 for comparison's sake:

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \approx \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.01} \approx 0.8 \]

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) \approx \frac{0.01}{0.04 + 0.01} \approx 0.2 \]

So the results would be:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
