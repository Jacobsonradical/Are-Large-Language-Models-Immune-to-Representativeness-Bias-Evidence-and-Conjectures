Sure, to determine the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Assign a prior probability \( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field without any additional information.
2. **Assign \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability that Adam would have the given personality sketch given he is enrolled in the specified field.
3. **Assign \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability that Adam would have the given personality sketch given he is not enrolled in the specified field.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, for simplicity in relative comparisons and because \( P(E) \) is common across hypotheses, we don't need its exact value; we will only compare the numerators.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **\( P(H) \)**: The base rate probability of being in agricultural and veterinary science as a graduate student. This is relatively low compared to some other fields. 
   Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy, it's highly likely he would be in this field.
   Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Given he is not in agricultural and veterinary science, but considering there are other fields which might also match his personality (e.g., biology, psychology), this probability will be moderate.
   Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

### Business Administration

1. **\( P(H) \)**: The base rate probability of being in business administration as a graduate student. This is relatively higher than agricultural and veterinary science.
   Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's personality traits, it is less probable he would be in business administration as it doesn't strongly align with his empathy and love for nature/animals.
   Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Given he is not in business administration but is in another field, the probability would be relatively high as there are many other fields that could still match his personality.
   Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

### Calculating \( P(H|E) \)

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science} \mid E) \propto P(E \mid \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \]
\[ \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04 \]

For business administration:
\[ P(\text{business administration} \mid E) \propto P(E \mid \text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) \]
\[ \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.1 = 0.01 \]

Putting it together:

  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.04,
