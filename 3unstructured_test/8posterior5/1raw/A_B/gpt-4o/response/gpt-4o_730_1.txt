Let's break down the problem using Bayes' theorem, which is formulated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \).

Let's denote:
1. \( H_1 \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
2. \( H_2 \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

We need to estimate \( P(H_1) \), \( P(E|H_1) \), \( P(E|\neg H_1) \), and the same set for \( H_2 \).

### For Business Administration:

1. \( P(H_1) \): The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in business administration. Let's estimate this as \( 0.2 \) or 20%, as business administration is a common graduate field, but this is a reasonable assumption.

2. \( P(E|H_1) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is in business administration. Given Adam's interests in nature, animals, and empathy, these traits do not strongly align with typical personality traits associated with business administration. Let's estimate this as \( 0.1 \) or 10%.

3. \( P(E|\neg H_1) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in business administration. Since Adam’s traits are less common in business administration but might be found in other fields (like science or humanities), \( P(E|\neg H_1) \) can be higher. We might estimate this as \( 0.8 \) or 80%.

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

1. \( P(H_2) \): The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's estimate this as \( 0.05 \) or 5%, as this field is less common compared to business administration.

2. \( P(E|H_2) \): The likelihood of Adam’s personality sketch given he is in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's interest in nature, empathy, and love for animals, these traits are strongly aligned with this field. Let’s estimate this as \( 0.9 \) or 90%.

3. \( P(E|\neg H_2) \): The likelihood of Adam’s personality sketch given he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Since these traits might be rarer in other fields, let's estimate this as \( 0.7 \) or 70%.

### Computation:

Using Bayes’ theorem:

\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E|\neg H_1) \cdot P(\neg H_1)} \]

\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.1 \times 0.2 + 0.8 \times 0.8} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.64} = \frac{0.02}{0.66} \approx 0.0303 \]

\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) + P(E|\neg H_2) \cdot P(\neg H_2)} \]

\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.05}{0.9 \times 0.05 + 0.7 \times 0.95} = \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.665} = \frac{0.045}{0.71} \approx 0.0634 \]

So the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0303,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.0634
}
```

These values reflect the likelihood that Adam is enrolled in either of these fields given his personality sketch.
