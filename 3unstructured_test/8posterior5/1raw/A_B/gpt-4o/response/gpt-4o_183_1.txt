To address the problem, we'll need to apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we're not given explicit values for \( P(E) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \), we'll estimate these values based on the provided description.

1. **P(H) (Prior probability of each field):**
   - Agricultural and veterinary science: Assume relatively higher for someone with Adam's interests.
   - Business administration: Assume relatively lower given his personality and interests.

2. **P(E|H) (Likelihood of the personality sketch given each field):**
   - Agricultural and veterinary science: High, as his interests closely align with nature, plants, and animals.
   - Business administration: Low, as his interests and personality do not align with typical traits and skills required for business administration.

3. **P(E|\neg H) (Likelihood of the personality sketch given he is not in each field):**
   - This would be relatively similar for both fields since E specifically aligns more with agricultural and veterinary sciences, and we assume P(E|\neg H) for both fields as quite low given his specified interests.

Now let's assign some hypothetical probabilities to these judgments:

- Agricultural and veterinary science:
  - P(H) = 0.3
  - P(E|H) = 0.8
  - P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 (we assume others have less alignment)
  
- Business administration:
  - P(H) = 0.1
  - P(E|H) = 0.1
  - P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 (same reasoning as above)

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{H}|\text{E}) = \frac{P(\text{E}|\text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H})}{P(\text{E})} \]

We see P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) can be estimated but not calculated precisely without knowing the total probability. For comparison, we use:

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(\text{H}|\text{E}) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.3}{P(E)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.24}{P(E)} \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(\text{H}|\text{E}) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.01}{P(E)} \]

We can thus see the relative values for comparison without the exact P(E):

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.24,
  "business administration": 0.01
}

Given that we're comparing the likelihoods, we note that Adam is significantly more likely to be enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science based on his personality sketch.

Here is the final output:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.24,
  "business administration": 0.01
}
