To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each of the given fields of graduate specialization based on the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, we need to use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since \( P(E) \) is constant for all hypotheses, we can ignore it when comparing probabilities between fields. Therefore, we only need to consider the numerators \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

Let's start by assigning our estimates:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - **\( P(H) \)** (prior probability): Let's assume the likelihood Adam was in an agricultural or veterinary science program is moderate, as it aligns well with his interests and traits. Say 0.2.
   - **\( P(E|H) \)** (likelihood of sketch given field): Given his traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy), it is highly likely he would be interested in this field. Say 0.8.
   - **\( P(E|\neg H) \)** (likelihood of sketch given any other field): This might be lower since not all fields require the same level of empathy, love for nature, and animals. Say 0.2.

   Calculating \( P(H | E) \) using Bayes' Rule:

   \( P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.2 = 0.16 \)


2. **Business Administration:**
   - **\( P(H) \)** (prior probability): The chance of Adam being in a business administration program seems lower considering his strong inclination towards nature and animals. Say 0.05.
   - **\( P(E|H) \)** (likelihood of sketch given field): Traits such as love for nature and animals aren't typical for business administration. Suppose itâ€™s quite unlikely. Say 0.1.
   - **\( P(E|\neg H) \)** (likelihood of sketch given any other field): As previously, 0.2.

   Calculating \( P(H | E) \) using Bayes' Rule:

   \( P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.05 = 0.005 \)

Comparing these values will give us a clearer picture. Here is the finalized result:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.16,
  "business administration": 0.005
}
```

Note: The actual values can depend a lot on personal judgments and further data which might shift these estimates. These calculations provide a rough estimate based on the given personality sketch.
