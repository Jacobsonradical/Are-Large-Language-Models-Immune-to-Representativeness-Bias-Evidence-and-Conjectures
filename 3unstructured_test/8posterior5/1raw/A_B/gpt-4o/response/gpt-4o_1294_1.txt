To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam's enrollment in each of the given fields, we need to first estimate the values of \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \), and then use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Here are the necessary steps and estimations for each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **\( P(H) \)**: This represents the prior probability that a graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume a moderate prior, as this is a specialized but not uncommon field. Let’s assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

- **\( P(E|H) \)**: This represents the likelihood of Adam's personality traits if he is indeed in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, this likelihood should be relatively high. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This represents the likelihood of Adam's personality traits if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Given the sketch, these traits could still appear in other fields, but less strongly aligned. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Using these values in Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.27} = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \approx 0.229 \]

### Business Administration

- **\( P(H) \)**: This represents the prior probability that a graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in business administration. Business administration is a very common field. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

- **\( P(E|H) \)**: This represents the likelihood of Adam's personality traits if he is indeed in business administration. This personality sketch seems less likely for a business administration student. Let’s assume \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).

- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This represents the likelihood of Adam's personality traits if he is not in business administration. Given the sketch, these traits could fit more closely with non-business fields. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

Using these values in Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.2 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.32} = \frac{0.04}{0.36} \approx 0.111 \]

Therefore, the estimates of \( P(H|E) \) for the given fields are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.229,
  "business administration": 0.111
}
