Let's begin by calculating the necessary probabilities for both fields, using Bayes' rule for each. Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, we will assume that the total probability space (all graduate fields) is normalized to 1.

### For Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being a Business Administration student. Given that Business Administration is a popular field, let's assume P(H) = 0.2.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's characteristics given that he is in Business Administration. Adam's profile suggests a strong interest in nature, empathy, and a love for animals, which doesn't align well with typical traits for a Business Administration student. P(E|H) could be low, say 0.05.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing Adam's characteristics given that he is not in Business Administration. Since Adam's personality seems to align more with fields like agricultural and veterinary science, P(E|¬H) would be higher. Let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.3.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. This is a more specialized field, so let's assume P(H) = 0.1.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's characteristics given that he is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given his strong interest in animals, nature, and empathy, P(E|H) would be high. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.8.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing Adam's characteristics given that he is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. This would be lower considering his interests are rare outside this field. Let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.1.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

To compute \(P(H|E)\) for both fields, we need \(P(E)\), which is the total probability of observing Adam's characteristics across all fields. We don't need to know this exact value as it will be a common normalizing factor, but let's call it \(C\) for simplicity in these relative comparisons.

So we get:
- For Business Administration:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.2}{C} = \frac{0.01}{C} \]

- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{C} = \frac{0.08}{C} \]

To compare:

- \( \frac{0.08/C}{0.01/C} = 8 \).

This means the relative probability of Adam being in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is much higher than being in Business Administration.

### Final Probabilities (Normalizing the Results):

Let's assign a comparable scale where the probabilities need not sum to 1 but are relative to each other.

{
  "business administration": 0.01,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08
