Let's go through each field and determine the probabilities.

### Business Administration:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration. This can be considered relatively common among graduate disciplines, so let's assign a moderate prior. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given that he was enrolled in Business Administration. While some traits (like intelligence and understanding abstract concepts) fit, the strong interest in nature, plants, and animals do not align well. Let's assign a lower probability. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in Business Administration. Since there are many other fields (like agricultural sciences) where his personality fits better, we can assume this probability to be reasonably high. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.7 \).

Using Bayes’ Rule: 

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

\[
P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.7 \cdot 0.8
\]

\[
P(E) = 0.02 + 0.56 = 0.58
\]

Now,

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.58} \approx 0.0345
\]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. This field is less common than Business Administration, but significant given Adam's interests. Let's assign a prior that reasonably reflects this field's representation, say \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given that he was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, animals, etc., this fits very well. Let's assign a high probability. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. This will be less than in the case of enrolling within the field but can be quite significant given other possible disciplines such as environmental studies. We can assume this probability slightly lower than the previous one given Adam's specific traits. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \).

Using Bayes’ Rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

\[
P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.6 \cdot 0.9
\]

\[
P(E) = 0.08 + 0.54 = 0.62
\]

Now,

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.62} \approx 0.129
\]

Thus, the computed probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": 0.0345,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.129
}
