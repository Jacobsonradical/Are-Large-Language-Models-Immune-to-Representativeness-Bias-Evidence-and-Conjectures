To determine the likelihood that Adam was enrolled in a specific graduate field given his personality sketch (E), we use Bayes' rule, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is constant across different hypotheses, we can compare the likelihoods relatively without calculating it directly. It's sufficient to consider:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

where \( \propto \) denotes proportionality.

### Estimations

#### 1. Business Administration

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in business administration.
  - Given the broad range of graduate programs, let's assume a moderate prior, maybe around 0.2.

- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is in business administration.
  - Logical reasoning: While business administration might attract diverse personalities, the specific traits of strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature are less typical. Let's assign a low value, maybe around 0.1.

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's traits if he is not in business administration.
  - This is higher given that his traits seem more aligned with fields like agricultural sciences, so let's assume a value of around 0.3.

- So using proportionality:
  - \( P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02 \)

#### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
  - This field is less common than business but matches Adam’s attributes well. Let’s assume a lower base rate, around 0.05.

- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's traits given enrollment in this field.
  - Adam's traits align very well with agricultural and veterinary science; let’s assign a high value, maybe around 0.8.

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's traits if he is not in this field.
  - It is comparatively lower, perhaps 0.2, because not many other fields match these traits closely.

- So using proportionality:
  - \( P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.05 = 0.04 \)

### Normalizing Values
Given the rough proportional values:
- For **business administration**: \( 0.02 \)
- For **agricultural and veterinary science**: \( 0.04 \)

We can normalize these if needed, but for simplicity, we keep the straight comparative values.

### Final Computed Probabilities
- **business administration**: 0.02
- **agricultural and veterinary science**: 0.04
