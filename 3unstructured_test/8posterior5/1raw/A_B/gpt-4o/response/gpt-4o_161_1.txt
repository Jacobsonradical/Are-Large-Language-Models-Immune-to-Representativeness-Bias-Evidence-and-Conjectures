Let's go through the Bayes' rule calculation step by step for each field.

### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

Section 1.1: Prior Probability (\( P(H) \)):
Given that Adam is a graduate student, the probability that he is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science should be relatively low compared to some more common fields of study. Let's assume:
\[ P(H_{agricultural \, & \, veterinary}) = 0.05 \]

Section 1.2: Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \)):
The personality sketch (E) fits very well with a field that involves nature, plants, animals, and empathy.
\[ P(E|H_{agricultural \, & \, veterinary}) = 0.8 \]

Section 1.3: Likelihood of not being in H (\( P(E|\neg H) \)):
The probability of the personality sketch if Adam is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science could be somewhat lower since other fields might not align as well with such interests.
\[ P(E|\neg H_{agricultural \, & \, veterinary}) = 0.2 \]

Now, using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
We need to compute \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.19 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.23 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.23} \approx 0.1739 \]

### 2. Business Administration

Section 2.1: Prior Probability (\( P(H) \)):
Business administration is a common graduate field. Let's assume:
\[ P(H_{business \, administration}) = 0.2 \]

Section 2.2: Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \)):
The personality sketch (E) does not align particularly well with business administration since it emphasizes nature, animals, and empathy, none of which are strongly associated with business.
\[ P(E|H_{business \, administration}) = 0.1 \]

Section 2.3: Likelihood of not being in H (\( P(E|\neg H) \)):
The probability of the personality sketch if Adam is not in Business Administration will be higher since the sketch fits better with other fields.
\[ P(E|\neg H_{business \, administration}) = 0.6 \]

Now, using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
We need to compute \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.6 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.48 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.5 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.5} = 0.04 \]

Now, compiling the results:

  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.1739,
