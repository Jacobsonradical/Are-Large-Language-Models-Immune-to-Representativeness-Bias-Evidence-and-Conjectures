To estimate the likelihoods and apply Bayes' rule for each field, we first need to assess the given probabilities based on the information provided in the personality sketch of Adam and general knowledge about the fields. The probabilities used here are educated guesses:

Let \(H_1\) be the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in a business administration program.
Let \(H_2\) be the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in an agricultural and veterinary science program.

### Business Administration:
1. \(P(H_1)\) - The prior probability that a graduate student could be enrolled in business administration (considering it's a common field, but not directly related to Adam's interests): 0.2
2. \(P(E|H_1)\) - Likelihood of E given H1 (business students can have varied interests, but Adam's specific interests in nature and animals make this less likely): 0.1
3. \(P(E|\neg H_1)\) - Likelihood of E given not H1 (general likelihood of having Adam's traits in any other field): 0.3

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]

We can assume \(P(E) = P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E|\neg H_1) \cdot P(\neg H_1)\)
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) = 0.02 + 0.24 = 0.26 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.26} = \frac{0.02}{0.26} \approx 0.077 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
1. \(P(H_2)\) - The prior probability of being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science (less common for general graduate students, but fits well with Adamâ€™s interests): 0.05
2. \(P(E|H_2)\) - Likelihood of E given H2 (students in this field often have traits aligning with Adam's description): 0.7
3. \(P(E|\neg H_2)\) - Likelihood of E given not H2 (same as above): 0.3

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E)} \]

Again, \(P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.05) + (0.3 \cdot 0.95) = 0.035 + 0.285 = 0.32\)

Thus:
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{0.32} = \frac{0.035}{0.32} \approx 0.109 \]
