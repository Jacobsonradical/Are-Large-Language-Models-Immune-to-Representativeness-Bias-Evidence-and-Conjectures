Sure, let's go through the calculations in a structured manner.

### Definitions
- \(H_{\text{BA}}\) represents the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration.
- \(H_{\text{AVS}}\) represents the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
- \(E\) represents the personality sketch of Adam.

### Assumptions
- \(P(H_{\text{BA}})\) and \(P(H_{\text{AVS}})\) represent the prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in Business Administration and Agricultural and Veterinary Science respectively.
- \(P(E|H_{\text{BA}})\) and \(P(E|H_{\text{AVS}})\) represent the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration and Agricultural and Veterinary Science respectively.
- \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}})\) and \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}})\) represent the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in Business Administration and not enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science respectively.
- \(P(H_{\text{BA}}|E)\) and \(P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E)\) represent the posterior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in Business Administration and Agricultural and Veterinary Science respectively, given the personality sketch.

### Estimations

1. **Prior Probability (\(P(H)\))**:
   - \(P(H_{\text{BA}})\): We assume a rough average proportion of students enrolled in Business Administration is 0.15.
   - \(P(H_{\text{AVS}})\): We assume a rough average proportion of students enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is 0.05.

2. **Likelihood (\(P(E|H)\))**:
   - \(P(E|H_{\text{BA}})\): The personality sketch of Adam (curiosity about nature, love for animals) seems less in line with Business Administration. We assume a low probability, say 0.02.
   - \(P(E|H_{\text{AVS}})\): The personality sketch of Adam seems highly compatible with Agricultural and Veterinary Science. We assume a high probability, say 0.8.

3. **Complementary Likelihood (\(P(E|\neg H)\))**:
   - \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}})\): Probability of the personality sketch given fields other than Business Administration might be relatively higher (given there are many other fields), say 0.1.
   - \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}})\): Probability of the personality sketch given fields other than Agricultural and Veterinary Science might be relatively lower, say 0.05.

### Calculations using Bayes' Rule

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Using the Law of Total Probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

#### For Business Administration:
- \(P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{BA}})\)
  \[ = (0.02 \cdot 0.15) + (0.1 \cdot 0.85) = 0.003 + 0.085 = 0.088 \]

- \(P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.02 \cdot 0.15}{0.088} \approx 0.034 \)

#### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- \(P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{AVS}})\)
  \[ = (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.05 \cdot 0.95) = 0.04 + 0.0475 = 0.0875 \]

- \(P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.0875} \approx 0.457 \)
