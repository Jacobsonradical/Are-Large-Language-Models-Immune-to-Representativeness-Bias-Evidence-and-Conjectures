Let's use the provided information to estimate the probabilities step by step for each field.

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H) - Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science:** This probability is not given explicitly, but graduate students in agricultural and veterinary science are relatively less common compared to other fields of study. Let's assume a modest prior of 0.1. 

2. **P(E|H) - Probability that Adam's personality sketch matches someone in agricultural and veterinary science:** Given Adam's love for animals, genuine curiosity about nature, and empathy, it seems quite likely. We can assign a high probability, say 0.8.

3. **P(E|¬H) - Probability that Adam's personality sketch matches someone not in agricultural and veterinary science:** Many fields will have people who are empathetic, intelligent, and curious about nature. Let's assume this probability is 0.4 since these traits are somewhat common.

We use Bayes Rule to get \( P(H|E) \):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.4 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.36} = \frac{0.08}{0.44} \approx 0.182
\]

### For Business Administration

1. **P(H) - Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration:** Business administration is a very common graduate field. Let's assume a prior of 0.2.

2. **P(E|H) - Probability that Adam's personality sketch matches someone in business administration:** Adam’s traits such as empathy and intelligence are valuable in business, but his deep love for animals and curiosity about nature are less typical. We might estimate this probability as moderate, say 0.3.

3. **P(E|¬H) - Probability that Adam's personality sketch matches someone not in business administration:** As calculated earlier, assume 0.4.

Now, we use Bayes Rule to get \( P(H|E) \):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.32} = \frac{0.06}{0.38} \approx 0.158
\]

Thus, the probabilities for each field can be summarized as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.182,
  "business administration": 0.158
}
