To apply Bayes' Rule to determine the probability of Adam being enrolled in each field given his personality sketch, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Define our terms:**
   - \(H\): Hypothesis that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.
   - \(E\): Evidence based on the personality sketch.

2. **Assign initial probabilities:**
   - \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
   - \(P(E|H)\): The probability of observing the personality sketch given he is enrolled in that field.
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of observing the personality sketch given he is not enrolled in that field.

3. **Use Bayes' Rule to compute the posterior probability:**
   - \(P(H|E)\) = \(\frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\)
   - Since \(P(E)\) is common for all calculations, we can use relative scaling to compare fields.

For simplicity, let's assume a generic prior probability for each field, say \(P(H)\) = 0.1 (10%), knowing that the actual distribution varies.

Now, let's assess \(P(E|H)\) and \(P(E|\neg H)\) based on the personality traits:

### Business Administration:
- P(H) = 0.1; Prior probability he could be studying business administration.
- P(E|H) = 0.05; A personality more focussed on nature, empathy, and animals translates poorly to business admin.
- P(E|\neg H) = 0.95; High likelihood that Adam's personality doesn't fit business administration.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- P(H) = 0.1; Prior probability for agriculture/veterinary science.
- P(E|H) = 0.9; Strong match between personality and field, given his interests in nature and animals.
- P(E|\neg H) = 0.2; Lower probability of those traits existing if not in this specific field.

Let's calculate it using relative terms of scaling likelihoods:

- Business Administration:
  - P(H|E) = \(\frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)}\)

- Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
  - P(H|E) = \(\frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)}\)

The final relative probabilities:
  - \(P(\text{Business Administration}|E)\) is scaled to 0.05 * 0.1 = 0.005
  - \(P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E)\) is scaled to 0.9 * 0.1 = 0.09

Since we just need relative comparison:

{
  "business administration": "0.005",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.09"
}
