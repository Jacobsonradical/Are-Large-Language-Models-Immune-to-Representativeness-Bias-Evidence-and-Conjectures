To solve the problem using Bayes' theorem, we need to calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field, given the personality sketch of Adam. Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing evidence \( E \).

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields and we are only comparing the relative likelihoods, we can focus on calculating the numerator \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for each field.

Given Adam's personality sketch, it's reasonable to assume some priors:
- \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \)
- \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \)

For simplicity, let's assume the prior probabilities without any additional data (hence chosen somewhat arbitrarily as these would typically be informed by broader statistical data or context about Adam's background):

- \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.1 \)

Now, we estimate the likelihoods, \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \):

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): High, as Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, love for animals, and empathy align strongly with characteristics commonly seen in this field. Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.8 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): Lower compared to \( P(E|H) \), say \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.3 \).

### Business Administration
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \): Low, as the personality traits mentioned do not strongly align with typical characteristics associated with business administration. Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business administration}}) \): Given Adam's strong traits towards natural sciences and empathy, it's likely higher than within the business administrative field, assume \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.6 \).

Now we apply Bayes' theorem:

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.2 = 0.16 \]

#### Business Administration
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) \propto 0.2 \times 0.1 = 0.02 \]

In relative terms:

\[
\begin{align*}
P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) &\propto 0.16 \\
P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) &\propto 0.02 \\
\end{align*}
\]

Thus,

\[ 
\begin{align*}
\text{normalized } P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) &\approx \frac{0.16}{0.16 + 0.02} = \frac{0.16}{0.18} \approx 0.89 \\
\text{normalized } P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) &\approx \frac{0.02}{0.16 + 0.02} = \frac{0.02}{0.18} \approx 0.11 \\
\end{align*}
\]

Putting it into the requested format:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.89,
  "business administration": 0.11
}
```
These values represent the posterior probabilities reflecting the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in the respective fields based on his personality sketch.
