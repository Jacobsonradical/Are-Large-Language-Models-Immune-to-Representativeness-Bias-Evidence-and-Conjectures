To compute \( P(H|E) \), which is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch, I will first evaluate the following probabilities:
1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in that field.

For the purposes of this exercise, I will assume some qualitative values for these prior and conditional probabilities based on the information given.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H)**: Given that Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, there's a relatively strong prior probability he might be in this field. Let's estimate \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
2. **P(E|H)**: Adam's personality traits are highly consistent with someone in this field. Thus, \( P(E|H) \) will be high. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: If Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science, the probability of having his personality traits is lower, but not extremely low, since there could be other fields with similar characteristics. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
\]

Let's plug in the values:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{0.8 \cdot 0.2 + 0.1 \cdot 0.8}
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.16}{0.16 + 0.08}
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.16}{0.24}
\]
\[
P(H|E) \approx 0.67
\]

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)**: Given Adam's characteristics, the prior probability that he was enrolled in business administration might be lower. Let's estimate \( P(H) = 0.05 \).
2. **P(E|H)**: His personality traits are less consistent with someone typically found in business administration. Thus, \( P(E|H) \) will be lower. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: If Adam is not in business administration, the probability of having his personality traits would be similar to other unrelated fields. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \) as well.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
\]

Let's plug in the values:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.05}{0.1 \cdot 0.05 + 0.1 \cdot 0.95}
\]
\]
P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.095}
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.1}
\]
\]
P(H|E) = 0.05

Thus, the probabilities are:
\[
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.67,
  "business administration": 0.05 
}
\]
