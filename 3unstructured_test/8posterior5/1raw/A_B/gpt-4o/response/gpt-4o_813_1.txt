Let's analyze the given fields based on the personality sketch of Adam and use Bayes' theorem to compute the probabilities.

For Bayes' theorem, we have:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \)
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \)
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \)
- \( P(E) \) is the evidence probability, which is the same for all hypotheses in given comparisons, hence can be treated as a normalizing constant in our case.

Let's assign subjective values based on the personality sketch:

### Business Administration (H1)

1. \( P(H1) \): The commonality of students enrolling in business administration graduate programs. Let's assign a moderately common prior probability, say \( 0.3 \).
2. \( P(E|H1) \): The likelihood that someone enrolled in business administration would have Adam's personality traits (interest in nature, empathy, love of animals). These traits seem less aligned with typical business administration interests, so let's assign a lower likelihood, say \( 0.1 \).
3. \( P(E|\neg H1) \): The likelihood of observing Adam’s personality in fields other than business administration. Given the sketch, let's assign this quite high, say \( 0.8 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H2)

1. \( P(H2) \): The commonality of students enrolling in agricultural and veterinary science graduate programs. This field is less common overall compared to business administration. Let's assign a moderately lower prior probability, say \( 0.1 \).
2. \( P(E|H2) \): The likelihood that someone enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science would have Adam's personality traits. These traits perfectly align with agricultural and veterinary science - strong appreciation for nature, curiosity about plants, empathy towards animals. Hence, let's assign a high likelihood, say \( 0.9 \).
3. \( P(E|\neg H2) \): The likelihood of observing Adam’s personality in fields other than agricultural and veterinary science. Given the sketch, let’s assign this a relatively lower value, say \( 0.5 \).

Now to use Bayes' theorem and normalize the results:

For business administration,
\[ P(H1|E) \propto P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1) \]
\[ P(H1|E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.3 = 0.03 \]

For agricultural and veterinary science,
\[ P(H2|E) \propto P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2) \]
\[ P(H2|E) \propto 0.9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.09 \]

Normalizing these results:
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.09} = \frac{0.03}{0.12} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.03 + 0.09} = \frac{0.09}{0.12} = 0.75 \]

Thus, based on these calculations,

{
  "business administration": 0.25,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75
}
