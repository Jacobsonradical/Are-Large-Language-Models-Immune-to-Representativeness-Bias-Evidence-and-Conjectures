To calculate the probabilities you requested, we'll start by breaking down the necessary components and then apply Bayes' rule. Let's use the following notation:

- P(H) = Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field (before knowing about his personality).
- P(E|H) = Probability that the personality sketch (E) fits Adam given his enrollment in a particular field (H).
- P(E|¬H) = Probability that the personality sketch (E) fits Adam given that he was not enrolled in that particular field (H).

We'll use these to calculate P(H|E), which is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a certain field given his personality sketch (E).

### Hypothesis 1: Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- P(H): Let's assume a moderate prior since Agricultural and Veterinary Sciences are specialized and not the most common graduate fields. We might estimate P(H) ≈ 0.05.
- P(E|H): Given Adam’s strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature, he seems very well-suited to this field. P(E|H) ≈ 0.8.
- P(E|¬H): In general, empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature might not be as common. We'll estimate P(E|¬H) ≈ 0.1.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.1 \cdot 0.95} = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.095} = \frac{0.04}{0.135} ≈ 0.296 \]

### Hypothesis 2: Business Administration
- P(H): Business Administration is quite a common graduate field. We might estimate P(H) ≈ 0.2.
- P(E|H): Adam’s empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature don't particularly fit with the stereotypical traits for Business Administration. We'd estimate P(E|H) ≈ 0.2.
- P(E|¬H): Again, given Adam’s traits, we'd estimate the general P(E|¬H) ≈ 0.1.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.2 \cdot 0.2 + 0.1 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.08} = \frac{0.04}{0.12} ≈ 0.333 \]

Thus, the probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.296",
  "business administration": "0.333"
}

It looks like based on our assumed probabilities, the likelihood that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration is a bit higher than Agricultural and Veterinary Science, even though the fit of his personality seems better for the latter; this is due to the higher prior probability of enrollment in Business Administration.
