To apply Bayes' theorem, we measure the prior probability \(P(H)\) of Adam being enrolled in each field, the likelihood \(P(E|H)\) corresponding to how likely we would observe the personality sketch \(E\) given he is in that field, and the likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\) of observing the personality sketch given he is not in that field. 

Given these, we can compute the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since \(P(E)\) is the same for both hypotheses (i.e., the portion of students with such a profile regardless of field), we can focus on the proportionality:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Let us assign priors and likelihoods based on the typical alignment with Adam's personality sketch:

1. **Business Administration (H1)**

   - **Prior \(P(H1)\)**: Business administration is a common graduate field. Suppose the prior likelihood that Adam is enrolled in a business administration field is moderate, say \(0.2\).
   - **Likelihood \(P(E|H1)\)**: The personality sketch of Adam suggests he is more oriented towards nature, animals, and empathetic activities than business administration would typically attract. Therefore, let's assume this is low, maybe \(0.1\).
   - **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H1)\)**: Given not in business administration, the personality could still belong to other fields which align more closely with nature-related interests. Assume \(0.5\).
   
   Calculation:
   \[ P(H1|E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H2)**

   - **Prior \(P(H2)\)**: This is a less common field but matches the profile. Suppose \(0.1\).
   - **Likelihood \(P(E|H2)\)**: Adam's curiosity about nature, empathy, high intelligence, and love for animals align perfectly with agricultural and veterinary science. Assume \(0.9\).
   - **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H2)\)**: Given not in agricultural and veterinary science, it is less likely to find fields that match the personality sketch this closely. Assume \(0.5\).
   
   Calculation:
   \[ P(H2|E) \propto 0.9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.09 \]
   
Normalizing these values by dividing each by the sum of both:

Sum of both:
\[ 0.02 + 0.09 = 0.11 \]

Therefore, the posteriors become:

\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.11} \approx 0.1818 \]
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.11} \approx 0.8182 \]

Thus, our results are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1818,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8182
}
