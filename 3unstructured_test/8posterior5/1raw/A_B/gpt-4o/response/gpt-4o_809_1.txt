Alright, let's break it down step by step.

Given:
- E: Personality sketch of Adam
- H: Hypothesis of Adam being enrolled in a specific field
- \(\neg H\): Complement of H, meaning Adam is not enrolled in that specific field

### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
**Step 1: Determine **P(H) and P(\neg H)** for Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
- P(H): Prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Let's assume a rough estimate of graduate field distribution, say 10% (0.1).
- P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.9

**Step 2: Determine **P(E|H) and P(E|\neg H)**
- P(E|H): Probability of observing Adam's personality traits given he is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Traits such as a love for nature, plants, animals, and curiosity about nature fit very well, so let's say 0.75.
- P(E|\neg H): Probability of observing Adam's traits given he is not in this field. While some traits are generic, let's say 0.1 for being spread across all other fields.

**Step 3: Apply Bayes' Rule**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where 
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

First calculate \( P(E) \) :
\[ P(E) = (0.75 \times 0.1) + (0.1 \times 0.9) = 0.075 + 0.09 = 0.165 \]

Now calculate \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.75 \times 0.1}{0.165} \approx \frac{0.075}{0.165} \approx 0.4545 \]

**Conclusion:**
\[ \text{"agricultural and veterinary science"}: 0.4545 \]

### 2. Business Administration
**Step 1: Determine **P(H) and P(\neg H)** for Business Administration**
- P(H): Prior probability of a graduate student being enrolled in Business Administration. Estimate a rough distribution, say 20% (0.2).
- P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.8

**Step 2: Determine **P(E|H) and P(E|\neg H)**
- P(E|H): Probability of Adamâ€™s traits given he is enrolled in Business Administration. Traits may not fit well, so let's say 0.05.
- P(E|\neg H): Probability given he is not in this field. Again let's keep the 0.1 distribution as a generic spread.

**Step 3: Apply Bayes' Rule**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where 
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

First calculate \( P(E) \) :
\[ P(E) = (0.05 \times 0.2) + (0.1 \times 0.8) = 0.01 + 0.08 = 0.09 \]

Now calculate \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.2}{0.09} = \frac{0.01}{0.09} \approx 0.1111 \]

**Conclusion:**
\[ \text{"business administration"}: 0.1111 \]

### Final Answer:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4545,
  "business administration": 0.1111
}
```
