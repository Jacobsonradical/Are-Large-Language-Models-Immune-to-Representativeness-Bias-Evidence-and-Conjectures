To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we follow the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields when comparing them, and given that it's not explicitly needed for computing the relative probabilities, we can focus on \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

Here are the steps for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

   - **P(H)**: The prior probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This could generally be low since not many students choose this field as compared to more common ones.
   - **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is in this field. Given his genuine curiosity about nature, a deep love for animals, and empathy, this matches well with this field.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not in this field. While his traits could fit other fields, the specific interest in plants and animals makes this less likely.

   Assuming:
   - \( P(H) = 0.05 \) (5% of graduate students are in this field)
   - \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \) (High probability because his traits match very well)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \) (Much lower, considering most other fields don't match as closely)

   Then:
   \[
   P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04
   \]

2. **Business Administration**

   - **P(H)**: The prior probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in business administration. This is usually higher given the popularity of this field.
   - **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is in this field. This is reasonably low since his traits like a deep love for animals and nature, and curiosity about plants do not fit this field well.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: Using the same as before, since the non-business fields vary widely.

   Assuming:
   - \( P(H) = 0.2 \) (20% of graduate students are in this field)
   - \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \) (Low, as his personality doesn't align well)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \) (Higher than 0.1 in the previous case for broader fields)

   Then:
   \[
   P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02
   \]

Putting it all together:

  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.04,
  "business administration": 0.02
