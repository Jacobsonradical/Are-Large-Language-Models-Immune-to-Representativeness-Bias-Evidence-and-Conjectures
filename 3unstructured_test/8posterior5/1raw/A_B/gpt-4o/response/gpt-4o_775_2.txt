Sure, let's break it down step-by-step using Bayes' rule, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence (this is a normalizing constant that can be ignored for comparative purposes).

Let's define probability estimates for the two fields given the sketch of Adam's personality:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H):** This is the prior probability that any given graduate student is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Let's estimate this at 0.05 (just an assumption, actual values may differ).
- **P(E|H):** Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy, there's a high chance he fits this field. Let's estimate this at 0.7.
- **P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood of Adam’s personality sketch fitting another field can be lower. Let's estimate this at 0.3.

### Business Administration
- **P(H):** This is the prior probability that any given graduate student is in Business Administration. Let's estimate this at 0.15 (just an assumption, actual values may differ).
- **P(E|H):** Given Adam's personality sketch, he's less likely to be in this field, but not impossible. Let's estimate this at 0.1.
- **P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood of Adam’s personality sketch fitting another field could be the same as the general fit. Let’s estimate this at 0.3.

Using these estimates, we can compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} = \frac{0.035}{P(E)} \]

For **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} = \frac{0.015}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant and is the same for both scenarios, we can compare the ratios directly:

\[ \frac{0.035}{P(E)} \quad \text{vs} \quad \frac{0.015}{P(E)} \]

Even without calculating \( P(E) \), we can see that the ratio for Agricultural and Veterinary Science is higher than for Business Administration.

So, the comparative likelihoods are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
