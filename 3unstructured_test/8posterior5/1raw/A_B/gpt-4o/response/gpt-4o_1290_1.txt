Assuming I must use the provided values in a schematized format and acknowledging the hypothetical nature of these probabilities:

For the field of business administration:
- P(H): The prior probability of Adam enrolling in business administration is generally high due to its popularity but not dominant given his personality traits. Let's estimate it as 0.1.
- P(E|H): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in business administration might be low, as his traits don't align well with this field. Let's estimate it as 0.05.
- P(E|¬H): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in business administration is higher. Let's estimate it as 0.9.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \)
Using \( H \) for business administration, \( ¬H \) would be other fields including agricultural and veterinary science.
\( P(¬H) \) would thus be 0.9.

Calculating \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.05 \cdot 0.1) + (0.9 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.005 + 0.81 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.815 \]

Thus, \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{0.815} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0061 \]

For the field of agricultural and veterinary science:
- P(H): The prior probability of Adam enrolling in agricultural and veterinary science based on his personality sketch and interests might be higher. Let's estimate it as 0.4.
- P(E|H): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is quite high. Let's estimate it as 0.7.
- P(E|¬H): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is lower. Let's estimate it as 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule:
Let's consider again:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]
Here \( H \) is now agricultural and veterinary science, so \( ¬H \) includes all other fields.
\( P(¬H) \) would be 0.6.

Calculating \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.4) + (0.3 \cdot 0.6) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.28 + 0.18 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.46 \]

Thus, \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.4}{0.46} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.6087 \]

Combining these results, we get:

{
  "business administration": 0.0061,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6087
}
