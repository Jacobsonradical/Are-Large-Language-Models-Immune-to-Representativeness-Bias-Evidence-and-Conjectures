To determine \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to calculate the following:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in each field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in a different field.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a constant across different hypotheses and we're interested in relative probabilities, we can ignore \( P(E) \) and compare \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for each field. Let's evaluate each component:

### For Business Administration
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration might be moderate, say about 0.2, considering it's a common graduate field.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability that a student in Business Administration would have Adam's personality traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy) seems relatively low, say around 0.1.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that someone in a different field would have Adam's personality sketch is higher, given the sketch's qualities align with many fields, say around 0.3.

### Calculation for Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is lower than Business Administration due to less overall enrollment, say about 0.1.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability that a student in Agricultural and Veterinary Science would have Adam's personality traits is very high, given the alignment with nature, love for animals, and strong empathy, say around 0.9.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that someone not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science would have Adam's personality traits is moderate, say around 0.3.

### Calculation for Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.09 \]

### Summary of Calculations
Using the results, we can see that \( \frac{P(H|E)}{\text{sum of all } P(H|E)} \approx\frac{0.02}{0.11} \) for Business Administration and \( \frac{0.09}{0.11} \) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science. 

However, for simplicity and given the format requested, we will not normalize them and just provide the raw results.
