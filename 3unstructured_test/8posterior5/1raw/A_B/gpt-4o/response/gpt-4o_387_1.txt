To apply Bayes' Rule, we need to estimate the following probabilities:

1. **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a certain field before considering his personality sketch \( E \).

2. **P(E|H):** The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in a certain field.

3. **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.

We will also use Bayes' Rule to compute:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, we will assume \( P(E) \) is a normalization constant and will focus on comparing the relative values of \( P(H|E) \) across fields.

### Business Administration

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration. Let's assume this is \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1 \) (arbitrary but reasonable for this scenario).
- **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam exhibits the described personality traits if he is a business administration student. Given that business administration often doesn't specifically require traits like deep curiosity about nature, animals, high empathy, or love for animals, we might set this at \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing these traits if Adam is not a business administration student. This could be higher because these traits might be more common in areas like agricultural science, veterinary science, and other fields. Let's set this at \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.3 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume this is \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.05 \).
- **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam exhibits these personality traits if he is in agricultural and veterinary science. Given the alignment with nature, plants, animals, and empathy, we can set this quite high at \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.9 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing these traits if Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science. This might be lower than in the general population since the traits are quite fitting for this field. Let's set this at \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.2 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}})}{P(E)} \]

### Computation of Relative Values

Despite not having the exact normalization factor \(P(E)\), we can still evaluate the relative likelihoods.

For business administration:

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.3} = \frac{0.01}{0.3} \approx 0.0333 \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:

\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.2} = \frac{0.045}{0.2} = 0.225 \]
