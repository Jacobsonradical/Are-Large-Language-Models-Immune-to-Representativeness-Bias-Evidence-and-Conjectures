To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to determine the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the complement likelihoods \( P(E|\neg H) \).

### Business Administration

1. **Prior \( P(H_{\text{business}}) \) (~0.10)**
   - Business administration is a common field for graduate students, but not overwhelmingly so. Let's assign it a prior probability of 0.10 or 10%.
   
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \) (~0.02)**
   - The detailed description of Adam suggests strong empathy, curiosity about nature, and a love for animals, which do not typically align with the field of business administration. Although there are some empathetic business leaders, it's relatively uncommon. Thus, we assign a low likelihood, say 0.02 or 2%.

3. **Complement likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}}) \) (~0.10)**
   - The likelihood that someone with Adam’s traits exists outside of business administration is relatively higher, as these traits are more in line with fields related to nature, animals, or abstract thinking. This could be moderately high, for example, 0.10 or 10%.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary}}) \) (~0.05)**
   - Although this field is less common compared to some, it's highly relevant to Adam's profile. We might assign it a somewhat lower base rate of 0.05 or 5%.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary}}) \) (~0.70)**
   - Adam’s comprehensive interest in nature, animals, and empathy aligns very strongly with agricultural and veterinary science. Thus, we would assign a high likelihood, say 0.70 or 70%.

3. **Complement likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary}}) \) (~0.10)**
   - The chance that a person with Adam’s traits is in another field could be moderately high, but not exceedingly so. Let’s assign it 0.10 or 10%.

### Posterior Probabilities Using Bayes' Rule

Using Bayes' rule, we compute:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) \) can be found using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For simplicity, let's focus on relative comparisons:

#### Business Administration:

\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{0.02 \cdot 0.10}{0.02 \cdot 0.10 + 0.10 \cdot 0.90} = \frac{0.002}{0.002 + 0.09} = \frac{0.002}{0.092} \approx 0.0217 \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary}}|E) = \frac{0.70 \cdot 0.05}{0.70 \cdot 0.05 + 0.10 \cdot 0.95} = \frac{0.035}{0.035 + 0.095} = \frac{0.035}{0.13} \approx 0.269 \]

### Summary

Here are the posterior probabilities for each field:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0217,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.269
}
```

These results indicate that it is far more likely, given Adam’s personality sketch, that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science rather than business administration.
