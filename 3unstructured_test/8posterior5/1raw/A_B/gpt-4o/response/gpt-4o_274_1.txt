To compute \( P(H|E) \), the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch, we need to use Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule can be expressed as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we only need relative values and not absolute probabilities, we can compute it as:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

We can assume that \( P(E) \) is a constant for both hypotheses and thus does not affect the relative probabilities.

From the personality sketch \( E \), we can estimate the following probabilities:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1)**
   - \( P(H1) \): The prior probability of being enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science can be reasonably assumed to be relatively low compared to more common fields like Business Administration. Let's assume \( P(H1) = 0.05 \).
   - \( P(E|H1) \): The probability of Adam's personality traits given enrollment in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is likely high because they align well with the described traits: curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. Let's assume \( P(E|H1) = 0.8 \).

2. **Business Administration (H2)**
   - \( P(H2) \): The prior probability of being enrolled in Business Administration is higher due to its popularity. Let's assume \( P(H2) = 0.25 \).
   - \( P(E|H2) \): The probability of Adam's personality traits given enrollment in Business Administration is likely lower, as the traits described do not strongly correlate with typical characteristics needed for a career in Business Administration. Let's assume \( P(E|H2) = 0.1 \).

Now, let's compare \( P(H1|E) \) and \( P(H2|E) \):

\[ P(H1|E) \propto P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1) = 0.8 \times 0.05 = 0.04 \]
\[ P(H2|E) \propto P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2) = 0.1 \times 0.25 = 0.025 \]

Based on these calculations, we get the following relative probabilities:

\[
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.04,
  "business administration": 0.025
}
\]

Hence, we normalize these values to get approximate posterior probabilities:

\[
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.025} \approx 0.615,
  "business administration": \frac{0.025}{0.04 + 0.025} \approx 0.385
}
\]

Final answer:

\[
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.615,
  "business administration": 0.385
}
\]
