Alright, let's first assess the probabilities:

### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)**: Probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
  - Given his interest in nature, plants, and animals, this field is quite plausible.
  - Let's assign P(H) a value of 0.4

- **P(E|H)**: Probability of E (the personality sketch) given Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
  - The personality sketch fits well with this field.
  - Let's say P(E|H) = 0.8

- **P(E|¬H)**: Probability of E given Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
  - He could still show these attributes but to a lesser extent.
  - Let's assign P(E|¬H) a value of 0.1

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.4}{0.8 \cdot 0.4 + 0.1 \cdot 0.6} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.32}{0.32 + 0.06} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.32}{0.38} \approx 0.84 \]

### 2. Business Administration

- **P(H)**: Probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
  - Given his attributes, this field seems less likely for him.
  - Let's assign P(H) a value of 0.1

- **P(E|H)**: Probability of E given Adam was enrolled in business administration.
  - The personality sketch is less likely to be tightly correlated with this field.
  - Let's say P(E|H) = 0.2

- **P(E|¬H)**: Probability of E given Adam was not enrolled in business administration.
  - Higher probability since his personality might better fit other fields.
  - Let's assign P(E|¬H) a value of 0.7

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.7 \cdot 0.9} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.63} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.65} \approx 0.03 \]

So, the computed probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.84,
  "business administration": 0.03
}
```
