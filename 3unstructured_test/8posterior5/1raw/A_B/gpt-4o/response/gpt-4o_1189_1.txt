First, let's introduce the probabilities we need to estimate:

- P(H): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the given field.
- P(E|H): The probability that the personality sketch E corresponds to someone enrolled in the given field.
- P(E|¬H): The probability that the personality sketch E corresponds to someone not enrolled in the given field.
- P(H|E): The posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in the given field given the personality sketch E.

For simplicity, we will assign some reasonable values to these probabilities, keeping in mind that these are estimations:

### Business Administration:
- P(H): Business administration is a popular field, but given Adam's personality sketch, it might be less likely than other fields. Let's assume P(H) = 0.15.
- P(E|H): Given that business administration typically involves more focus on management, finance, and less on nature and animals, P(E|H) might be lower. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.1.
- P(E|¬H): We need to estimate the likelihood of the personality sketch E given that Adam is not enrolled in business administration. Given that E strongly fits other fields related to nature and animals, P(E|¬H) could be higher. Let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.4.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H)} \]

\[ P(H|E)_{business administration} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{0.1 \cdot 0.15 + 0.4 \cdot 0.85} = \frac{0.015}{0.015 + 0.34} = \frac{0.015}{0.355} \approx 0.0423 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- P(H): Agricultural and veterinary science aligns well with Adam's love for nature and animals. Let's assume P(H) = 0.3.
- P(E|H): Given E aligns strongly with interests typical in agricultural and veterinary science, let's assume P(E|H) = 0.8.
- P(E|¬H): Given that E strongly aligns with agricultural and veterinary science, P(E|¬H) for other fields would be lower. Let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E)_{agricultural and veterinary science} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.3}{0.8 \cdot 0.3 + 0.3 \cdot 0.7} = \frac{0.24}{0.24 + 0.21} = \frac{0.24}{0.45} \approx 0.5333 \]

Therefore, the posterior probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": 0.0423,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5333
}
