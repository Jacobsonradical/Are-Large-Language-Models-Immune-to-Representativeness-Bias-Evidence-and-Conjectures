To apply Bayes' rule and compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \), we need to estimate the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the marginal likelihoods \( P(E|\neg H) \). Here is the approach:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given Adam is in that field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given Adam is not in that field.
4. **P(E)**: The total probability of observing the personality sketch, but since it is constant across all hypotheses, it will be factored out in the normalization at the end.

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

- **P(H)**: Let's assume an arbitrary prior probability for Adam being in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given his traits and interests, a reasonable prior might be higher than the general average due to his love for nature and animals. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.3 \).

- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood is high due to the strong match of his interests and traits with the field. Let's assign \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).

- **P(E|\neg H)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given that other fields may also value these traits but likely less so, let's say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Although we don't know \( P(E) \), it cancels out in the normalization step later.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.3}{P(E)} = \frac{0.27}{P(E)} \]

### For Business Administration:

- **P(H)**: Let's assume a lower prior probability for Adam being in Business Administration given his traits which seem less aligned with business. Assuming \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood here should be lower because his traits do not as strongly align with typical Business Administration interests. Let's assign \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of observing his traits if he's not in Business Administration could be higher, given that his traits are more commonly associated with other fields. Let's say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.7 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.02}{P(E)} \]

### Normalization:

To normalize the probabilities, we consider the sum of these posteriors over all hypotheses. Since we're only considering two hypotheses here, the normalization constant \( P(E) \) can be approximated for the sake of these calculations.

\[ P(E) \approx P(E|Agri) \cdot P(Agri) + P(E|Business) \cdot P(Business) \]

\[ P(E) \approx (0.9 \times 0.3) + (0.2 \times 0.1) = 0.27 + 0.02 = 0.29 \]

Thus:
\[ P(Agri|E) = \frac{0.27}{0.29} \approx 0.93 \]
\[ P(Business|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.29} \approx 0.07 \]

So the final answers are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.93,
  "business administration": 0.07
}
