Sure, I will use Bayes' theorem to compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the given graduate fields, based on the provided personality sketch (E). For simplicity, I'll assume general baseline probabilities for each field based on common enrollment statistics in the U.S. However, the actual probabilities might differ based on more specific data which I do not have.

We'll use the following steps:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is in a specific field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's characteristics (E) given that he is in that specific field.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing Adam's characteristics if he is not in that specific field.
4. Use Bayes' theorem: \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \), where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

### Prior Probabilities Estimation (P(H))
- **Agricultural and veterinary science**: Relatively niche, let's estimate this at 0.05 (5%).
- **Business administration**: Very common, let's estimate this at 0.20 (20%).

### Conditional Probabilities (P(E|H) and P(E|¬H))
- **P(E|H)** for Agricultural and veterinary science: Given Adam's love for nature, animals, and his empathy, high probability \( \approx 0.70 \).
- **P(E|¬H)** for Agricultural and veterinary science: Lower than for the hypothesis but not negligible \( \approx 0.20 \).

- **P(E|H)** for Business administration: Given Adam's personality, less aligned \( \approx 0.10 \).
- **P(E|¬H)** for Business administration: Slightly higher than aligned because business administration is unrelated to these traits \( \approx 0.30 \).

### Applying Bayes' Theorem

Let's compute \(P(E)\) as the sum \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

First, for Agricultural and veterinary science:
- \(P(H) = 0.05\)
- \(P(\neg H) = 0.95\)
- \(P(E|H) = 0.70\)
- \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.20\)

\[ P(E|Ag) = \frac{0.70 \cdot 0.05}{(0.70 \cdot 0.05) + (0.20 \cdot 0.95)} \]
\[ P(E|Ag) = \frac{0.035}{0.035 + 0.19} \]
\[ P(E|Ag) = \frac{0.035}{0.225} \approx 0.156 \]

Next, for Business administration:
- \(P(H) = 0.20\)
- \(P(\neg H) = 0.80\)
- \(P(E|H) = 0.10\)
- \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.30\)

\[ P(E|Bus) = \frac{0.10 \cdot 0.20}{(0.10 \cdot 0.20) + (0.30 \cdot 0.80)} \]
\[ P(E|Bus) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.24} \]
\[ P(E|Bus) = \frac{0.02}{0.26} \approx 0.077 \]

So with these estimations:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.156,
  "business administration": 0.077
}
```
These probabilities suggest Adam is more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than business administration based on his personality sketch.
