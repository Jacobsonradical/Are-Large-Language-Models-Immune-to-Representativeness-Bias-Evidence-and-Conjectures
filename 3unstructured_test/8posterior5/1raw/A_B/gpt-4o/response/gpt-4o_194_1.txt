First, let's define the problem in terms of Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(H|E)\) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field given his personality sketch.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the probability of Adam having the personality sketch given that he was enrolled in a specific field.
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
- \(P(E)\) is the overall probability of Adam having that personality sketch.

Since we don't have specific numerical values for these probabilities, we'll need to make qualitative assessments based on the information given.

### Hypothesis 1: Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- \(P(H)\): The general likelihood that a graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. While I don't have specific data, we can assume these fields are somewhat specialized and not as broadly populated as some other fields. For estimation, let's assume \(P(H) = 0.1\).
- \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is in agricultural and veterinary science. Since Adam has a deep love for animals and nature and a strong empathy (qualities that align well with these fields), let's assume this probability is high. For estimation, \(P(E|H) = 0.8\).
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Adam’s personality traits fit agricultural and veterinary science better than most other fields, let's assume this probability is moderate. For estimation, \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.3\).

### Hypothesis 2: Business Administration

- \(P(H)\): The general likelihood that a graduate student is in business administration. This is a broad and very common field, so let's assume \(P(H) = 0.3\).
- \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is in business administration. Adam's interests and traits don't align particularly well with business administration, so let's assume this probability is low. For estimation, \(P(E|H) = 0.1\).
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in business administration. Given that his traits align better with sciences, this is unlikely. For estimation, \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.4\).

### Computing \(P(H|E)\) for Each Field

Bayes’ theorem rearranged for our purposes:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given \(P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)\).

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \(P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) = 0.08 + 0.27 = 0.35\)
   - \(P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.35} = \frac{0.08}{0.35} = 0.229\)

2. **Business Administration**:
   - \(P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.3) + (0.4 \cdot 0.7) = 0.03 + 0.28 = 0.31\)
   - \(P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.3}{0.31} = \frac{0.03}{0.31} = 0.097\)

Based on these calculations, the probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.229,
  "business administration": 0.097
}
