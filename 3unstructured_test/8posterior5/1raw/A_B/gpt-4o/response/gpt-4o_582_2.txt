To apply Bayes' Rule and calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \), we'll need the following components:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given he is in a particular field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given he is not in that particular field.

Let's first look at each field and provide some estimated values for these probabilities based on the given personality sketch.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

#### Prior Probability \( P(H) \):
Given that there are many graduate fields, let's assume an arbitrary prior for each field. Since we don't know the exact number of fields, we can assume a moderately low prior to reflect the distribution among various fields.
\[ P(H) \approx 0.05 \]

#### Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):
Adam's traits fit well with agricultural and veterinary science, given his love for nature, animals, and appreciation for hard work.
\[ P(E|H) \approx 0.7 \]

#### Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):
This is a bit tricky, but considering that many other fields might not align strongly with Adam's personality traits:
\[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \]

### Business Administration

#### Prior Probability \( P(H) \):
Similarly, let's use a prior reflecting reasonable assumptions given the multitude of fields available.
\[ P(H) \approx 0.05 \]

#### Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):
Business Administration does not strongly align with Adam's personality traits, making this likelihood lower.
\[ P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \]

#### Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):
This would be higher since Adam's traits are more likely to align with other fields than with Business Administration.
\[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \]

### Bayes' Rule Calculation
Bayes' Rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For simplicity, we calculate \( P(E) \) only for the set of hypotheses we're considering:

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \times 0.05) + (0.2 \times 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.035 + 0.19 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.225 \]

Then, calculate \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.05}{0.225} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.035}{0.225} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.156 \]

#### Business Administration
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.05) + (0.3 \times 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.005 + 0.285 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Then, calculate \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.05}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.005}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.017 \]

Now, putting these together, we get:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.156,
  "business administration": 0.017
}
