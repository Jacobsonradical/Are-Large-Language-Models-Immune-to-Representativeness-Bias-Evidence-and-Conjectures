To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field (business administration and agricultural and veterinary science), we need to use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is NOT enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \).

For simplicity, let's denote the following:
- \( P(H_{\text{ba}}) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(H_{\text{agv}}) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agv}}) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \).

To estimate these values:

1. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H_{\text{ba}}) \): Since business administration is a relatively common field, let's denote this as 0.1 for graduate students.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) \): The personality traits do not align particularly well with a typical business administration student. Let's denote this as 0.1.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{ba}}) \): For students not in business administration, the traits are more probable. Let's denote this as 0.5.

\[ \text{Using Bayes' theorem: } P(H_{\text{ba}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ba}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H_{\text{agv}}) \): This is less common than business administration but still a known field related to Adam's interests. Let's denote this as 0.05.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{agv}}) \): The personality traits align very well with this field. Let's denote this as 0.8.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agv}}) \): For students not in agricultural and veterinary science, let's denote this as 0.2.

\[ \text{Using Bayes' theorem: } P(H_{\text{agv}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agv}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agv}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{P(E)} \]

Assuming \( P(E) \) is the same in the denominators, we don't need the exact value to compare the probabilities as the relative values will still give us an estimate.

Given these estimates, the relative probabilities can be directly compared:

{
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.01}{P(E)} \),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{0.04}{P(E)} \)
}
  
Thus:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
