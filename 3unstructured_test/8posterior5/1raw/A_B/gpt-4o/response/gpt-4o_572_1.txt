To use Bayes' rule to compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch (E), we need to estimate the probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field. 

1. **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in that particular field.
4. **\( P(H|E) \)**: The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **\( P(H_{\text{agri}}) \)**: The probability of any graduate student being in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume \(\sim 0.05\) (5%).
- **\( P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) \)**: Given Adam's characteristics (such as a love for nature, animals, and empathy), it's highly likely he would fit well in this field. Let's assume \( \sim 0.8 \) (80%).
- **\( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agri}}) \)**: The probability of having such characteristics in any other field. Given the uniqueness of his traits pointing towards agricultural and veterinary science, let's assume \( \sim 0.1 \) (10%).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agri}})}{P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agri}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{agri}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{agri}})} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.1 \cdot 0.95} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.095} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.135} \approx 0.296 \]

### Business Administration
- **\( P(H_{\text{bus}}) \)**: The probability of any graduate student being in business administration. Let's assume \(\sim 0.2\) (20%).
- **\( P(E|H_{\text{bus}}) \)**: Given that business administration typically requires different characteristics, such as being business-oriented and less focused on nature and empathy, let's assume \( \sim 0.05 \) (5%).
- **\( P(E|\neg H_{\text{bus}}) \)**: This would be the same as calculated previously for fields other than agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume \( \sim 0.1 \) (10%).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H_{\text{bus}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{bus}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{bus}})}{P(E|H_{\text{bus}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{bus}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{bus}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{bus}})} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{bus}}|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.2}{0.05 \cdot 0.2 + 0.1 \cdot 0.8} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{bus}}|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.08} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{bus}}|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.09} \approx 0.111 \]

So, the answer in the requested format is:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.296,
  "business administration": 0.111
}
```
