Bayes' Theorem provides us a way to compute the probability of a hypothesis given new evidence. Specifically, it is given by the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis, \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence given the hypothesis, and \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the evidence.

First, we need reasonable estimations for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), \( P(E|\neg H) \):

1. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): Generally, the probability that a graduate student is enrolled in business administration is relatively high due to its popularity despite Adamâ€™s specific interests. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's personality sketch, it seems less likely that he fits the typical personality profile associated with business administration students. Thus, we might estimate this probability as \( P(E|H) = 0.05 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Since \(\neg H\) represents all other fields excluding business administration, the probability of matching the personality sketch outside of the specific field is higher. Consider \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.15 \).

Applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) can be approximated as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

So,

\[ P(E) = (0.05 \times 0.2) + (0.15 \times 0.8) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.01 + 0.12 \]

\[ P(E) = 0.13 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.2}{0.13} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.13} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0769 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): The probability that a graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science may be lower due to the field's narrower focus. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's personality sketch highly matches the typical attributes of students in this field (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy). Let's estimate this probability as \( P(E|H) = 0.6 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): For all other fields excluding agricultural and veterinary science, assume this field has a less likely match in personality sketch. So, we use \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

Applying Bayes' Theorem again:

\[ P(E) = (0.6 \times 0.1) + (0.1 \times 0.9) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.06 + 0.09 \]

\[ P(E) = 0.15 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.1}{0.15} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.15} \]

\[ P(H|E) = 0.4 \]

Based on Bayes' rule calculations, here are the likelihoods:

{
  "business administration": 0.0769,
