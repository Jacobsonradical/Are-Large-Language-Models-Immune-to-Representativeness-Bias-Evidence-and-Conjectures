To compute \( P(H|E) \) for the given fields of specialization using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \) - the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
2. \( P(E|H) \) - the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.

Finally, use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is constant in this context and we are comparing relative probabilities, we can ignore \( P(E) \) for simplicity in direct comparison.

Let's assess the probabilities for each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: This field is somewhat common but not the most popular. Let’s assume a moderate prior probability, \( 0.2 \).

2. **P(E|H)**: Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work strongly align with this field. Let’s assume a high likelihood, \( 0.8 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Given that the personality sketch is quite specific to traits suitable for agricultural and veterinary science, the likelihood of this sketch in other fields would be lower. Let’s assume \( 0.3 \).

Using Bayes’ rule simplistically:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \times 0.2 = 0.16 \]

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: This is a very common field with a high number of enrollments. Let’s assume a prior probability, \( 0.3 \).

2. **P(E|H)**: Adam's empathy, love for animals, and nature do not align well with typical characteristics for business administration. Let’s assume a low likelihood, \( 0.1 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Given the sketch, the probability of these traits fitting other fields (like science, etc.) is higher compared to business administration. Let’s assume \( 0.5 \).

Using Bayes’ rule simplistically:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \times 0.3 = 0.03 \]

Combining these results:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.16,
  "business administration": 0.03
}
```

These values are estimates and should be interpreted relatively; they suggest Adam is much more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than business administration given his personality sketch.
