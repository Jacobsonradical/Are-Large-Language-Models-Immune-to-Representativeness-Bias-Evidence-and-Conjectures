For each field, let’s go through the parameters:

Assumptions:
- P(H): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field.
- P(E|H): The probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam is in the specified field.
- P(E|¬H): The probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam is not in the specified field.

### Business Administration
- P(H) for Business Administration: Graduate fields are diverse, let’s assume there’s an equal spread across fields for simplicity, say P(H) = 0.1.
- P(E|H) for Business Administration: Business administration is less directly related to Adam’s interests and traits (nature, animals, empathy, etc.). Let’s assume a lower probability, say P(E|H) = 0.05.
- P(E|¬H) for Business Administration: This is slightly tricky, but since Adam’s traits are generally less aligned with Business Administration compared to general fields, let’s assume P(E|¬H) = 0.1.

Using Bayes rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
But since P(E) remains consistent across fields and is not directly needed to compare fields, for simplicity we follow relative probabilities.

\[ P(H|E)_{BA} \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.05 \cdot 0.1 = 0.005 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- P(H) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Assume again the default prior, P(H) = 0.1.
- P(E|H) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Given Adam’s interest in plants, nature, animals, and empathy, this field fits well. Let’s assume a higher probability, say P(E|H) = 0.35.
- P(E|¬H) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Given the nature of the field aligning well with Adam’s traits, it might be relatively low. Let’s assume P(E|¬H) = 0.05.

Using Bayes rule:
\[ P(H|E)_{AgVet} \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.35 \cdot 0.1 = 0.035 \]

Relative comparison:
\[ \text{Business Administration}: 0.005 \]
\[ \text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}: 0.035 \]

Now we normalize them to fit into a pseudo-probabilistic scale:

### Final Answer:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.125,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.875
}
```

These values represent the relative probabilities, showing that Adam is much more likely to be in Agricultural and Veterinary Science than in Business Administration given his personality traits and interests.
