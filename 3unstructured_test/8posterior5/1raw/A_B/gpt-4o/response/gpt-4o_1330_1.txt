To compute the probabilities for each field of study using Bayes' rule, we start with:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

First, I'll provide an assessment of \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

1. **Business Administration**

- \( P(H) \): The initial probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is enrolled in business administration. Business administration is a common field, so let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.15 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality if he is studying business administration. Given Adam's strong interest in nature and animals, as well as his empathy and abstract understanding, it's less likely but still possible. Let's assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.05 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality if he is not studying business administration. This is higher, given the common nature of his traits for fields outside business. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.6 \).

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Let's assume \( P(E) \approx 0.25 \) (an estimated normalizing factor common among all students).

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.15}{0.25} = \frac{0.0075}{0.25} = 0.03 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

- \( P(H) \): The initial probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. It's a less common field but also fits well with Adam's interests. So, let’s assume \( P(H) \approx 0.05 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality if he is studying agricultural and veterinary science. Given his love for nature, animals, and empathy, this is quite high. Let’s assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.7 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality if he is not studying agricultural and veterinary science. This is lower, given the significant match with this field. Let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \).

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Using the same \( P(E) \approx 0.25 \) for normalization:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{0.25} = \frac{0.035}{0.25} = 0.14 \]

Final answers:

{
  "business administration": 0.03,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.14
}
