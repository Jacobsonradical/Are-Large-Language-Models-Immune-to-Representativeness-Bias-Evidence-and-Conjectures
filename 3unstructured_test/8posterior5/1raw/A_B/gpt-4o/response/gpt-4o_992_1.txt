To compute the probabilities according to Bayes' Rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Here, we'll make some reasonable assumptions based on the personality sketch.

### 1. Business Administration:

**Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
Graduate students in business administration are quite numerous. We might assume a higher prior probability because business administration is a popular field.

\( P(H) \approx 0.2 \) (Assumed high prior due to its popularity).

**Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
Given Adam's personality traits, it's less likely but still possible that he would be in business administration. These traits don't particularly align with the typical student in this field:

\( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \) (Low likelihood based on traits).

**Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
Out of all other fields, some might match Adam's traits more closely, implying that the likelihood of his traits given he's not in business administration would be higher.

\( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \) 

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) \approx 0.8 \]

\[ P(E) \approx (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.5 \cdot 0.8) = 0.02 + 0.4 = 0.42 \]

So:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.42} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.42} \approx 0.048 \]

### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

**Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
Fewer students might be enrolled in this field compared to business administration, so we assume a lower prior probability.

\( P(H) \approx 0.05 \) 

**Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
Adam's traits highly correspond with this field, so the likelihood is high.

\( P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \) 

**Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
For all other fields, the likelihood of these personality traits is relatively moderate.

\( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \) 

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) \approx 0.95 \]

\[ P(E) \approx (0.9 \cdot 0.05) + (0.4 \cdot 0.95) = 0.045 + 0.38 = 0.425 \]

So:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.425} \approx \frac{0.045}{0.425} \approx 0.106 \]

Based on these computations, we have the probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.048,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.106
}
```
