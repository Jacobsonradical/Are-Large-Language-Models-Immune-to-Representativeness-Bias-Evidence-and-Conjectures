To estimate \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to define the following probabilities:
1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in this field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given that he was enrolled in this field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given that he was not enrolled in this field.

Using Bayes' Rule, we have:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be calculated as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For simplicity, we'll assume \( P(\neg H) \) is distributed among all other possible fields equally.

### Business Administration:
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Assume a low prior because business administration is generally not associated with the specific traits described in the sketch (curiosity about nature, love for animals, etc.).
   - Let's assume \( P(H) \) is around 0.05 (5%).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Given that Adam is in business administration, the probability of observing the traits described (warm heart, empathy, intelligence) is plausible but not high.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|H) \) is around 0.1 (10%).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - If Adam is not in business administration, the likelihood of having those traits might be higher in other fields (e.g., agricultural and veterinary science). 
   - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) \) is around 0.3 (30%).

Using these values, we calculate \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.05}{(0.1 \cdot 0.05) + (0.3 \cdot 0.95)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.285} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.005}{0.290} \approx 0.017 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Assume a higher prior because the traits strongly align with this field.
   - Let's assume \( P(H) \) is around 0.2 (20%).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Given that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science, it is highly likely to observe the traits described.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|H) \) is around 0.9 (90%).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - If Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science, the likelihood of having those traits in other fields is lower.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) \) is around 0.2 (20%).

Using these values, we calculate \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.2}{(0.9 \cdot 0.2) + (0.2 \cdot 0.8)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.18}{0.18 + 0.16} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.18}{0.34} \approx 0.529 \]

### Final Answer:

Thus, the probabilities for each field given Adam's personality sketch are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.017,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.529
}
```
