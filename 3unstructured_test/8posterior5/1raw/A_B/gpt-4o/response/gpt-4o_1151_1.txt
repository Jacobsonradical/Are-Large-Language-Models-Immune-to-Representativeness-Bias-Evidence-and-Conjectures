To calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field through Bayes' rule, we need to understand the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and conditional probabilities \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Here's a step-by-step breakdown for each field:

1. **business administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): The probability Adam is studying business administration. Without specific data, letâ€™s assume the probability a random graduate student is in business administration is relatively moderate. For the sake of simplicity, assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is in business administration. Considering Adam's interest in nature and animals, business administration seems less likely to match his personality sketch. We might estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is not in business administration. Given Adam's profile, it seems likely he falls into another field like agricultural sciences. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

2. **agricultural and veterinary science**:
   - \( P(H) \): The probability Adam is studying agricultural and veterinary science. Given the emphasis on nature, plants, and animals, we might estimate \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is in agricultural and veterinary science. This field seems highly compatible with his personality sketch. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. This remains \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.25 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For each field, we need \( P(E) \), the overall probability of observing E. We calculate this as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]

Let's calculate:

1. **business administration**:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   P(E) &= P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \\
   &= 0.1 \times 0.2 + 0.3 \times 0.8 \\
   &= 0.02 + 0.24 \\
   &= 0.26
   \end{align*}
   \]

   \[
   \begin{align*}
   P(H|E) &= \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \\
   &= \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.26} \\
   &= \frac{0.02}{0.26} \\
   &= 0.0769
   \end{align*}
   \]

2. **agricultural and veterinary science**:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   P(E) &= P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \\
   &= 0.7 \times 0.1 + 0.25 \times 0.9 \\
   &= 0.07 + 0.225 \\
   &= 0.295
   \end{align*}
   \]

   \[
   \begin{align*}
   P(H|E) &= \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \\
   &= \frac{0.7 \times 0.1}{0.295} \\
   &= \frac{0.07}{0.295} \\
   &= 0.2373
   \end{align*}
   \]
