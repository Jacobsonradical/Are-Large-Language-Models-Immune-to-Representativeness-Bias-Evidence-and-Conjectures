To compute the posterior probabilities P(H|E) for the fields of "business administration" and "agricultural and veterinary science" given the personality sketch (E) of Adam, we use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For each field, we need to estimate the following:

1. \( P(H) \) - the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field.
2. \( P(E|H) \) - the probability of the personality sketch given enrollment in the field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in the field.
4. \( P(E) \) - the overall probability of the personality sketch.

We will simplify the calculations by not explicitly computing \( P(E) \) since it is the same for both fields and will cancel out when comparing the probabilities.

### Assumptions and Estimations:

#### Business Administration:

- **P(H)**: The prior probability of enrolling in business administration (considered relatively common, but not directly aligned with personal traits).
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam having the given traits if he was in business administration (lower since interests in nature, animals, and empathy are less aligned with business administration).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of the given traits if Adam was in another field (moderate).

Let's use these estimates:
- \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.05 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.2 \)

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) = 0.05 \cdot 0.1 = 0.005 \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

- **P(H)**: The prior probability of enrolling in agricultural and veterinary science (less common overall but highly aligned with personal traits).
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam having the given traits if he was in agricultural and veterinary science (high since interests in nature, animals, and empathy are highly aligned with this field).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of the given traits if Adam was in another field (lower as many other fields are less compatible with these traits).

Let's use these estimates:
- \( P(H_{AVS}) = 0.05 \)
- \( P(E|H_{AVS}) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) = 0.2 \)

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04 \]

### Normalizing Factors:
To create probabilities that sum up, we normalize them:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.04} = \frac{0.005}{0.045} \approx 0.111 \]

\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.04}{0.005 + 0.04} = \frac{0.04}{0.045} \approx 0.889 \]
