To evaluate the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in the specified fields given his personality sketch, let's break down the probabilities as follows:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of a graduate student enrolling in each field without any other information.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is enrolled in the field H.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is not enrolled in the field H.
4. **P(H|E)**: The posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in the field given the personality sketch E.

### Field: Business Administration

#### 1. P(H)
- The overall likelihood of a graduate student enrolling in business administration is moderate to high, say \( P(H) = 0.3 \).

#### 2. P(E|H)
- Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, and his empathy, these traits are less typical for business administration students. Thus, \( P(E|H) \) is relatively low. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

#### 3. P(E|\neg H)
- For students not in business administration, Adam's traits might be more common in fields related to science or environmental studies. Thus, \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Given that \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \):

\[ 
P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.3) + (0.2 \cdot 0.7) = 0.03 + 0.14 = 0.17
\]

So:

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.3}{0.17} \approx 0.176
\]

### Field: Agricultural and Veterinary Science

#### 1. P(H)
- The likelihood of a graduate student enrolling in agricultural and veterinary science is moderate, let’s assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

#### 2. P(E|H)
- Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, strong empathy, and love for animals, these traits are very typical for students in agricultural and veterinary science. Thus, \( P(E|H) \) is high. Let’s assume \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).

#### 3. P(E|\neg H)
- For students not in agricultural and veterinary science, Adam's traits might still be common, but not as much. Let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Given that \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \):

\[ 
P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.2) + (0.2 \cdot 0.8) = 0.14 + 0.16 = 0.30 
\]

So:

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.30} \approx 0.467
\]

### Final results
{
  "business administration": 0.176,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.467
}
