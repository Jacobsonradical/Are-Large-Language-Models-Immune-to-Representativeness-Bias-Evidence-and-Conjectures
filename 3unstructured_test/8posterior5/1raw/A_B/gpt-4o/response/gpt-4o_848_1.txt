To calculate the probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Here is the step-by-step reasoning for each field:

### Field: Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
   Let's assume the prior probability that a random graduate student is in business administration is relatively common. We might estimate it to be around \( 0.15 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   Given the personality sketch of Adam, it seems less likely that someone with such high curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy is studying business administration. We may estimate this as quite low, let's say \( 0.05 \).

3. **Probability \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   This reflects the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is not in business administration. Given the traits are more geared towards fields like the sciences or veterinary studies, let's set this higher, say \( 0.30 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.15}{0.05 \cdot 0.15 + 0.30 \cdot (1 - 0.15)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.0075}{0.0075 + 0.255} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.0075}{0.2625} \approx 0.0286 \]

### Field: Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
   Let's assume the prior probability that a random graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science is less common compared to business administration. We might estimate it to be around \( 0.05 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   Given that Adam has a deep love for animals, nature, and plants, the likelihood that he is in agricultural and veterinary science appears very high. Let's estimate this as \( 0.80 \).

3. **Probability \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   This reflects the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Since his traits suggest a high likelihood of being in a related field, this might remain significant but slightly lower. Let's set this at \( 0.25 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(H|E)_{AgVS} = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.05}{0.80 \cdot 0.05 + 0.25 \cdot (1 - 0.05)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{AgVS} = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.2375} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{AgVS} = \frac{0.04}{0.2775} \approx 0.1442 \]

### Final Results:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0286,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.1442
}
```

These calculations provide the posterior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in business administration or agricultural and veterinary science, given his personality sketch.
