To compute the probabilities, let’s denote:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam’s personality sketch given that he is enrolled in the specific field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam’s personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in the specific field.
- \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in the specific field given his personality sketch.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence, which can be expressed as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Here's how we can evaluate each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
**P(H)**: Let's assign a moderate probability as agricultural and veterinary science are fields that students commonly study.
\[ P(H) = 0.1 \]

**P(E|H)**: Given Adam’s personality sketch, which includes a deep love for animals and curiosity about nature and plants, it's highly likely that he would be in this field.
\[ P(E|H) = 0.7 \]

**P(E|\neg H)**: Considering that there are many other fields of study not related to his interests in nature, animals, and plants, the likelihood of his personality matching those other fields is comparatively lower.
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \]

### Business Administration
**P(H)**: Business administration is also a common field for graduates.
\[ P(H) = 0.2 \]

**P(E|H)**: Adam’s personality sketch doesn’t strongly align with typical characteristics of someone studying business administration. 
\[ P(E|H) = 0.1 \]

**P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam having these traits if he is not in business administration might be higher than if he was.
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \]

Now, we can use these values to compute \( P(H|E) \):

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.07 + 0.18 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.25 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.25} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.07}{0.25} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.28 \]

#### Business Administration:
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.24 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.26 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.08 \]

Now putting the computed values together:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.28,
  "business administration": 0.08
}
```
