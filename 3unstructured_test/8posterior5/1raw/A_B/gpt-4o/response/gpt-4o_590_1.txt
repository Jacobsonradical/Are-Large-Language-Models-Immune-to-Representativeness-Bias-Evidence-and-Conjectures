Let's consider the given information carefully to estimate the prior probabilities (P(H)), the likelihoods (P(E|H)), and then use Bayes' Rule to compute the posterior probabilities (P(H|E)) for each field.

First, let's set up some reasonable estimates for each of the probabilities based on the given information:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H_agriculture):** This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume this field has a base probability of 0.1 for the general graduate student population, acknowledging this as one of many possible fields.

2. **P(E|H_agriculture):** This is the probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, this field seems highly compatible with his personality. We can estimate this to be high, say 0.8.

3. **P(E|¬H_agriculture):** This is the probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Since the personality traits described could also apply to students in other nature-related fields but are rare in unrelated fields, this should be lower. Let's estimate this as 0.2.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H)} \]

Substituting in the values:
\[ P(H_agriculture|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.8 \times 0.1 + 0.2 \times 0.9} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.18} = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \approx 0.31 \]


### Business Administration

1. **P(H_business):** This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. For the general graduate student population, let's assume this base probability to be 0.15.

2. **P(E|H_business):** This is the probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in business administration. The given personality traits do not strongly align with typical business administration traits. We can estimate this to be quite low, say 0.1.

3. **P(E|¬H_business):** This is the probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was not enrolled in business administration. Given the personality traits favor other fields more, let's estimate this as 0.25.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H)} \]

Substituting in the values:
\[ P(H_business|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.15}{0.1 \times 0.15 + 0.25 \times 0.85} = \frac{0.015}{0.015 + 0.2125} = \frac{0.015}{0.2275} \approx 0.066 \]

Therefore, the computed posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.31,
  "business administration": 0.066
}
```
