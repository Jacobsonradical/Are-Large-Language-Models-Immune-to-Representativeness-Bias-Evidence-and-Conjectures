Let's use Bayes' rule for this calculation. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, for this problem, we do not need to find \( P(E) \) explicitly since we are comparing the relative values of the probabilities.

Given:
- \( E \) is the personality sketch of Adam.
- \( H \) is the hypothesis for each field.
- \( \neg H \) is the negation (i.e., Adam is not in that field).

For the fields given (\( H \)):

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume a moderate prior probability based on general enrollment trends in the U.S., say \( 0.05 \).
    - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that a student in agricultural and veterinary science has Adam's characteristics. Given his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy, this is high. Let's assume \( 0.7 \).
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that a student not in agricultural and veterinary science has Adam's characteristics. Considering general students, this is lower. Let's assume \( 0.1 \).

    \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{0.7 \cdot 0.05 + 0.1 \cdot (1-0.05)} \]
    Using the above numbers:
    \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.035}{0.035 + 0.095} \approx 0.269 \]

2. **Business Administration**:
    - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in business administration. Business administration is a popular field, so let's assume a higher prior, say \( 0.15 \).
    - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that a student in business administration has Adam's characteristics. Given that business administration students might not predominantly share Adamâ€™s strong interest in nature and animals, this is lower. Let's assume \( 0.05 \).
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that a student not in business administration has Adam's characteristics. Considering general students, but excluding business administration specifically, this might be slightly higher or the same as for those in agricultural and veterinary sciences. Let's assume \( 0.1 \).

    \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.15}{0.05 \cdot 0.15 + 0.1 \cdot (1-0.15)} \]
    Using the above numbers:
    \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.0075}{0.0075 + 0.085} \approx 0.081 \]

Thus, the probabilities that Adam is enrolled in each field given his personality sketch are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.269,
  "business administration": 0.081
}
```

These are comparative probabilities and indicate that Adam is more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration given his personality traits.
