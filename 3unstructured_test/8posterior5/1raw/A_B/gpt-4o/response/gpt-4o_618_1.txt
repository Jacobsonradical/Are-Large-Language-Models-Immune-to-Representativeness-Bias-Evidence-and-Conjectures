To apply Bayes' rule, we need to calculate \(P(H)\), \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E|\neg H)\) for each field and then use these values to compute \(P(H|E)\).

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **P(H): The prior probability**: This is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field. Without specific data, we'll assume all fields are equally likely for simplicity.

2. **P(E|H): The likelihood**: This is the probability of observing the evidence (personality sketch) given Adam is enrolled in a specific field. This value will be higher if the traits described fit the field well.

3. **P(E|¬H): The likelihood of the evidence given not enrolled in the specific field**: Since we don't have details on the distribution of traits in other fields, we'll assume they are less likely to match the personality sketch well.

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**
   - We assume \(P(H) = 0.5\) since we have no specific prior data.

2. **P(E|H)**
   - Personality traits like curiosity about nature, love for animals, and a quiet demeanor are less typical for business administration.
   - Let's estimate \(P(E|H)\) to be quite low, say 0.1.

3. **P(E|¬H)**
   - Given the large variety of other fields that might fit better, we assume a higher probability for other fields fitting this personality sketch, say 0.8.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \), we get:
\[ P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.5 + 0.8 \cdot 0.5 = 0.05 + 0.4 = 0.45 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.5}{0.45} \approx 0.111 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**
   - We assume \(P(H) = 0.5\) since we have no specific prior data.

2. **P(E|H)**
   - Personality traits like curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work align well with this field.
   - Let's estimate \(P(E|H)\) to be high, say 0.9.

3. **P(E|¬H)**
   - Giving the wide variety of other fields not fitting these traits as well, let’s take it closer to 0.1.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \), we get:
\[ P(E) = 0.9 \cdot 0.5 + 0.1 \cdot 0.5 = 0.45 + 0.05 = 0.5 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = 0.9 \]
