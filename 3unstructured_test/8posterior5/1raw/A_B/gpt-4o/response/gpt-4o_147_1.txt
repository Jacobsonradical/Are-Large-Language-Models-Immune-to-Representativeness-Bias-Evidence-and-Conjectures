To estimate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, we need to rely on Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since \( P(E) \) is constant across both hypotheses, we can use the simplified version:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

We'll need to make some educated estimates for these probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field. This will be determined based on general distribution of graduate students across different fields.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in the respective field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in the respective field.

Let's assign some reasonable estimates:

### Business Administration

#### Prior Probability (\( P(H) \))
Let's consider that in the general population, approximately 10% of graduate students are enrolled in business administration.

\[ P(\text{business administration}) = 0.10 \]

#### Likelihood (\( P(E|\text{business administration}) \))
Given Adam's personality sketch, it seems less likely that he would be in business administration, which generally attracts less nature-focused, more extroverted individuals.

\[ P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.05 \]

#### Complement Likelihood (\( P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) \))
We need to consider the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in business administration. Given that other fields are more diverse and could better align with his personality traits:

\[ P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) = 0.95 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

#### Prior Probability (\( P(H) \))
Let's consider that approximately 5% of graduate students are enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.05 \]

#### Likelihood (\( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \))
Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, it is much more likely that he is studying in this field.

\[ P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.70 \]

#### Complement Likelihood (\( P(E|\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \))
The likelihood of Adam's personality outside this field would vary widely, but let's assume:

\[ P(E|\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.30 \]

Now, let's compute the posterior probabilities using Bayes' rule:

- For business administration:

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) \propto P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) = 0.05 \cdot 0.10 = 0.005 \]

- For agricultural and veterinary science:

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \propto P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.70 \cdot 0.05 = 0.035 \]

Now, normalize the values to get meaningful posterior probabilities. Since normalization isn't strictly necessary for this answer format, you can use these proportional values:

{
  "business administration": "0.005",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.035"
}
