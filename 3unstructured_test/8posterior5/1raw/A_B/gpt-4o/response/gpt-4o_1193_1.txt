Let's compute the probabilities step-by-step for both hypotheses.

### For Business Administration:

- **P(H\_business\_administration)**: Let's assume the prior probability that Adam is in business administration matches the general distribution of students in various fields. Assume the prior P(H\_business\_administration) is 0.1.
- **P(E|H\_business\_administration)**: Business administration students typically might not have as strong an interest in nature, plants, animals, or puzzles. Therefore, P(E|H\_business\_administration) is likely to be low. Let's estimate it around 0.05.
- **P(E|\neg H\_business\_administration)**: Given that Adam's profile doesn't strongly match the typical business administration student, the probability of observing E in a non-business-administration student is likely to be moderately higher. Let's approximate P(E|\neg H\_business\_administration) to be 0.3.

Now applying Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.05 \times 0.1) + (0.3 \times 0.9) = 0.005 + 0.27 = 0.275 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.1}{0.275} ≈ 0.018 \]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

- **P(H\_agricultural\_and\_veterinary)}**: Assume the prior probability that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science is smaller compared to more common fields like business administration. Assume the prior P(H\_agricultural\_and\_veterinary\_science) is 0.05.
- **P(E|H\_agricultural\_and\_veterinary\_science)**: Adam’s interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy makes this field quite fitting for him. Let’s estimate this probability to be 0.7.
- **P(E|\neg H\_agricultural\_and\_veterinary\_science)**: This would be lower since other students are less likely to match his profile. Let's estimate it around 0.2.

Now applying Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \times 0.05) + (0.2 \times 0.95) = 0.035 + 0.19 = 0.225 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.05}{0.225} ≈ 0.156 \]

### Conclusion:

  "business administration": 0.018,
