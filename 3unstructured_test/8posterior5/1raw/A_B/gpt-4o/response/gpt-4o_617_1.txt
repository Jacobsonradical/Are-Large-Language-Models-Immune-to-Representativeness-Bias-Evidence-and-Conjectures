Sure, I will evaluate the probabilities step-by-step using Bayes' rule. Let me first break down the problem.

To calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we'll use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's consider the fields:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
2. **Business Administration**

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

**Prior probability \( P(H) \):**
- Without specific data on the distribution of graduate students in different fields, we'll assume a uniform prior. For simplicity, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \) (10%) since it's a reasonable estimate given that there are many fields of study.

**Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
- Adam's personality sketch indicates a strong affinity for nature, animals, and an appreciation for hard work. These attributes are highly relevant to Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
- Thus, \( P(E|H) \) should be high. Let's estimate it at 0.9 (90%).

**Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
- This is the probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he were not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given that these traits could span several fields but are particularly strong for Agricultural and Veterinary Science, let's estimate this at 0.2 (20%).

Let's calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.9 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.09 + 0.18 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.27 \]

Thus,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{0.27} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.333 \]

### Business Administration

**Prior probability \( P(H) \):**
- Similarly, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

**Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
- Adam's personality sketch does not strongly align with typical traits needed for Business Administration (e.g., less emphasis on nature, animals, and hard-working appreciation for physical or biological matters).
- Estimate \( P(E|H) \) at 0.1 (10%).

**Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
- The probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he were not in Business Administration should be higher considering his attributes are more inclined towards other fields. Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) at 0.3 (30%).

Let's calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.01 + 0.27 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.28 \]

Thus,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.28} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.036 \]

### Conclusion

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.333,
  "business administration": 0.036
}
