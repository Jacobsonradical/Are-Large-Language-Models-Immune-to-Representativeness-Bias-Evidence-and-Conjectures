To determine the probability of Adam being enrolled in specific graduate programs given his personality sketch using Bayes' theorem, let's break down the process:

### 1. Definitions:

- \( P(H) \): The initial probability of Adam being in a particular field, without considering his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given that he is enrolled in field \( H \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given that he is not enrolled in field \( H \).
- \( P(H|E) \): The probability of Adam being in field \( H \) given his personality sketch \( E \).

Let's make reasonable assumptions to estimate these probabilities, though they are tentative and may vary:

### 2. Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \):

- For agricultural and veterinary science: The field is relatively specialized; let’s assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).
- For business administration: This field is much more common; let’s assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

### 3. Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \):

- **Agricultural and veterinary science:**
  - Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals makes it highly likely: \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
  - For people not in this field, such a personality sketch would be less common but possible: \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

- **Business administration:**
  - Though traits like high intelligence are common, love for nature and animals does not strongly align: \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
  - For people not in this field, the sketch could still fit others, so: \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.25 \).

### 4. Posterior Probabilities Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be computed as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's do the calculations:

### Agricultural and veterinary science:

1. \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \)
2. \( P(H) = 0.05 \)
3. \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \)
4. \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.95 \)

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.05) + (0.2 \times 0.95) = 0.04 + 0.19 = 0.23 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.23} \approx \frac{0.04}{0.23} \approx 0.1739 \]

### Business administration:

1. \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \)
2. \( P(H) = 0.2 \)
3. \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.25 \)
4. \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.8 \)

\[ P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.2) + (0.25 \times 0.8) = 0.02 + 0.2 = 0.22 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.22} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.22} \approx 0.0909 \]

### Conclusion:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.1739",
  "business administration": "0.0909"
