To compute \( P(H|E) \), which is the probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch, we need to apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we're comparing two fields, let's assume \( P(H) \) (the prior probability of being enrolled in each field) is equal for initial simplicity, i.e., \( P(H) = 0.5 \) for both fields. 

Next, we judge \( P(E|H) \), the likelihood of seeing Adam's personality traits given that he is in the specified field, and \( P(E|\neg H) \), the likelihood of seeing these traits given that he is *not* in the specified field.

### Business Administration:
**Hypothesis:** Adam is enrolled in Business Administration.

- **\( P(H) \) (prior probability):** Since Business Administration is a common graduate field, let's assign it a moderate prior probability. Letâ€™s stick with our equal baseline as the prior probability: \( P(H) = 0.5 \).

- **\( P(E|H) \) (likelihood given the hypothesis):** The personality traits of genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy are less typical for Business Administration students. This could be low: let's say \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).

- **\( P(E|\neg H) \) (likelihood given the negation of the hypothesis):** Given that multiple fields could exhibit these traits, but fewer would lean heavily towards them compared to science-related fields, \( P(E|\neg H) \) could be moderate: let's say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
**Hypothesis:** Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

- **\( P(H) \) (prior probability):** Although possibly less common in numbers, Agricultural and Veterinary Science is very aligned with Adam's traits. Sticking with equal baselines, \( P(H) = 0.5 \).

- **\( P(E|H) \) (likelihood given the hypothesis):** These traits fit very well with the fields of Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Therefore, let's assign a high likelihood: \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).

- **\( P(E|\neg H) \) (likelihood given the negation of the hypothesis):** For the sake of simplicity, we use a similar value as with Business Administration: \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

### Applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(H) \) is simplified to 0.5 for each case, we can compare the \( P(H|E) \) values by their individual \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

For **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.2 \times 0.5}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1}{P(E)} \]

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E)_{AVS} = \frac{0.9 \times 0.5}{P(E)} = \frac{0.45}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same in both cases, the comparison lies in the numerators.

### Simplifying Comparatively:
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} \propto 0.1 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{AVS} \propto 0.45 \]

So, comparatively:
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.1}{0.1+0.45} = \frac{0.1}{0.55} \approx 0.18 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{AVS} = \frac{0.45}{0.1+0.45} = \frac{0.45}{0.55} \approx 0.82 \]

Given these comparisons:
