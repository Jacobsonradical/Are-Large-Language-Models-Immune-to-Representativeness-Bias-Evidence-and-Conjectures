To solve this problem using Bayes' Rule, we need to determine the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). Let's establish these values for both hypotheses.

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - There are thousands of graduate fields, but Agricultural and Veterinary Science is a fairly common field, especially for someone with a strong love for nature and animals.
   - Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \) as a reasonable priorâ€”it represents the proportion of graduate students in such a field.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Given Adam's personality sketch, it is highly probable that he is enrolled in such a field.
   - Let's assign \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \) because his traits align closely with the typical interests and personalities in this field.

3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**:
   - This would be the combination of all graduates fitting Adam's personality, across all fields.
   - Difficult to estimate directly. Typically, it might be an aggregate of all likelihoods weighted by their priors. For simplicity, assume \( P(E) = 0.1 \).

4. **Likelihood of Evidence \( P(E| \neg H) \)**:
   - This is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality in other fields.
   - As most fields differ significantly, \( P(E|\neg H) \) can be lower.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.05 \).

5. **Posterior Probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.1} = 0.4
   \]

### For Business Administration:
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Business Administration is a common graduate field.
   - Assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Adam's personality seems less suited for Business Administration given his interests and empathy focused on nature and animals.
   - Let's assign \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**:
   - Remains the same, \( P(E) = 0.1 \).

4. **Likelihood of Evidence \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - We should use initial assumptions. For Business Administration, being distinct, it's less likely given other fields.
   - Assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.07 \).

5. **Posterior Probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.1} = 0.1
   \]
