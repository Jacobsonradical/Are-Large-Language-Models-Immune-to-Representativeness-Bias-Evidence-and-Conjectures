To solve the problem using Bayes' rule, we need to calculate the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\) for each field of study, given Adam's personality sketch.

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \(P(E)\) is the same irrespective of the field, we can compare the relative values based on \(P(E|H) \cdot P(H)\). Let's make judgments and assumptions for each field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam enrolling in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Graduate fields are diverse, but this particular field seems relatively specialized. Assume a prior probability of 0.05.
   
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of the personality sketch given Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - This field aligns well with Adam's love for nature, plants, animals, empathy, and understanding of hard work. Assume a likelihood of 0.7.

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood of the personality sketch given Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - This probability should be lower since the sketch closely aligns with the traits suitable for this field. Assume a likelihood of 0.2.

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam enrolling in business administration.
   - Many students might pursue business administration, making it a common choice. Assume a prior probability of 0.15.
   
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of the personality sketch given Adam is in business administration.
   - The personality sketch doesn't align as well with business administration traits. Assume a likelihood of 0.1.

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood of the personality sketch given Adam is not in business administration.
   - This would be higher than in the first field since it's a more general personality sketch that can apply to many fields. Assume a likelihood of 0.3.

Now, we compute \(P(H | E)\).

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:

\[ 
P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science} | E) = \frac{P(E | \text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) \cdot P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} 
\]

For **Business Administration**:

\[ 
P(\text{Business Administration} | E) = \frac{P(E | \text{Business Administration}) \cdot P(\text{Business Administration})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} 
\]

The term \(P(E)\) cancels during comparison, so we focus on the numerators:

\[ 
\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}: 0.7 \cdot 0.05 = 0.035 
\]

\[ 
\text{Business Administration}: 0.1 \cdot 0.15 = 0.015 
\]

Finally, normalize these values to a relative probability scale (if compared or needed to be interpreted proportionately):

\[
\text{Total} = 0.035 + 0.015 = 0.05, \quad So, \quad P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science} | E) \approx \frac{0.035}{0.05} = 0.7,\quad P(\text{Business Administration} | E) \approx \frac{0.015}{0.05} = 0.3 
\]

So, the resulting output is:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```
