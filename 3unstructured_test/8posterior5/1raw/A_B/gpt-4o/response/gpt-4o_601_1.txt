Sure, let's calculate the values step by step using Bayes' Rule.

We want to find \( P(H|E) \), the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch. Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, as we don't have the exact value of \( P(E) \), we'll compare the relative values instead.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

#### Prior: \( P(H) \)
Assume the proportion of students enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science among all graduate students is relatively low. For simplicity, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \) (5%).

#### Likelihood: \( P(E|H) \)
Given Adam's empathy for animals, love for nature and plants, it is very likely that someone with this personality would be drawn to agricultural and veterinary science. Assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \) (80%).

#### Complementary Likelihood: \( P(E|\neg H) \)
For fields other than agricultural and veterinary science, the probability that a random person would have Adamâ€™s personality traits is comparatively lesser but still possible. Assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \) (20%).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} \]

### Business Administration

#### Prior: \( P(H) \)
Assume the proportion of students enrolled in business administration among all graduate students is relatively high. For simplicity, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15%).

#### Likelihood: \( P(E|H) \)
Adam's personality does not strongly match the typical traits associated with a business administration student. But it's not impossible. Assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \) (10%).

#### Complementary Likelihood: \( P(E|\neg H) \)
For fields other than business administration, the probability remains based on the overall personality description: \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.25 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, we'll assume \( P(E) \) is identical for both fields (in practice, it would be calculated on the basis of all possible different fields).

Given the relative likelihood estimates and priors, we can now assign values to \( P(H|E) \):

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.015
}
```

Here, \( P(H|E) \) for agricultural and veterinary science is 0.2, representing a higher likelihood given Adam's personality sketch compared to business administration which is 0.015, indicating a much lower likelihood.
