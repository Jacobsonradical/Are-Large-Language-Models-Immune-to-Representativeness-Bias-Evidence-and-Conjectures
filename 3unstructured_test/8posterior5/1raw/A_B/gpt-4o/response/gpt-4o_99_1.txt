To solve this problem using Bayes' rule, we need to calculate the probability of each hypothesis (H) given the evidence (E). Bayes' rule is stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability of hypothesis H given the evidence E.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence E given that hypothesis H is true.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis H.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence E.

Since we're only comparing two fields here, we can skip calculating \( P(E) \), as it will be common in the Bayes' rule calculations for both hypotheses. We'll instead focus on comparing the numerators \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

Given the following fields and their respective hypotheses:
H1: Adam was enrolled in "agricultural and veterinary science."
H2: Adam was enrolled in "business administration."

We will assign values to \( P(H1) \), \( P(H2 \) \( P(E|H1) \), and \( P(E|H2) \) based on the personality sketch and calculate their combination.

### Judging the Prior Probabilities, \( P(H) \):
It's challenging to assign specific probabilities without additional data, but based on the information given, we can assume that it's less common for graduate students to enroll in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. Thus, our priors might reflect this:

- \( P(H1) = 0.2 \) (20%)
- \( P(H2) = 0.5 \) (50%)

### Judging the Likelihoods, \( P(E|H) \):
- For agricultural and veterinary science (H1):
  - Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work strongly align with this field.
  - We can assign a relatively high probability of him fitting this profile given H1: \( P(E|H1) = 0.9 \)

- For business administration (H2):
  - Adam's traits, while valuable in many fields, do not strongly signal business administration.
  - We can assign a lower probability for this fit: \( P(E|H2) = 0.2 \)

Combining these components, we get:

- \( P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1) = 0.9 \cdot 0.2 = 0.18 \)
- \( P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2) = 0.2 \cdot 0.5 = 0.10 \)

Now we can calculate the posterior probabilities:
- \( P(H1|E) = \frac{0.18}{0.18 + 0.10} = \frac{0.18}{0.28} \approx 0.64 \)
- \( P(H2|E) = \frac{0.10}{0.18 + 0.10} = \frac{0.10}{0.28} \approx 0.36 \)

Thus, using Bayes' rule, we have:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.64,
  "business administration": 0.36
}
```

These calculations suggest that given his personality sketch, it is more likely that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration.
