To compute \( P(H|E) \) through Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the information, let's estimate the probabilities for each field:

### Business Administration

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration. Given that there are many fields a graduate student can choose from, this might be relatively low. Let's estimate this as 0.2.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in business administration. Adam's personality traits such as a deep love for animals, curiosity about nature, and empathy seem less typical for a business administration student. Let's assume a low probability of 0.1.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in business administration. Given the wide variety of fields that would match Adam's characteristics more closely, let's assume this to be relatively high, say 0.8.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's interests, this might be higher than for business administration. Let's estimate this as 0.3.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science. Adam's traits strongly align with this field, so we will assume a high probability of 0.9.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. This is likely lower because his traits fit this field well, so let's assume 0.3.

Using the formula and these estimates, let's compute \( P(H|E) \):

#### Business Administration

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For business administration:

\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.8 \cdot (1 - 0.2)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.8 \cdot 0.8} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.64} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.02}{0.66} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} \approx 0.0303 \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

For agricultural and veterinary science:

\[ P(H|E)_{AGV} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.3}{0.9 \cdot 0.3 + 0.3 \cdot (1 - 0.3)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{AGV} = \frac{0.27}{0.27 + 0.3 \cdot 0.7} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{AGV} = \frac{0.27}{0.27 + 0.21} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{AGV} = \frac{0.27}{0.48} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{AGV} \approx 0.5625 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are approximately:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0303,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5625
}
```

These calculations indicate that based on Adam's personality sketch, there is a significantly higher probability that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration.
