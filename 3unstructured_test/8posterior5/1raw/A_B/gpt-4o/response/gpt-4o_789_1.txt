To calculate the posterior probability P(H|E) that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch (E) using Bayes' rule, we start with the following:

Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For each field, we need to estimate:
1. P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field.
2. P(E|H): The likelihood of observing the personality traits given that Adam was enrolled in the field.
3. P(E|¬H): The likelihood of observing the personality traits given that Adam was not enrolled in the field.

Let's denote the prior probability P(H) for each field intuitively, based on general prevalence of graduate students in those fields. 

Additionally, we need to estimate how likely the personality traits (E) are if Adam is, or is not, enrolled in each field (P(E|H) and P(E|¬H)).

Finally, our focus is on the relative comparisons using these heuristics, rather than exact values. For simplicity, we will for now assume P(E) is constant across different fields.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H):** Let's assume that there is a relatively moderate chance Adam is in this field given his interests in nature, plants, and animals. Let P(H ~ 0.2).
- **P(E|H):** The traits (genuine curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals) strongly align with this field. Let's estimate P(E|H ~ 0.9).
- **P(E|¬H):** It is less likely for someone with his traits to be outside this field, but not impossible. Let's assume P(E|¬H ~ 0.2).

### Business Administration
- **P(H):** There is a relatively lower chance given that Adam's traits don't particularly align with typical traits of business graduates. Let P(H ~ 0.1).
- **P(E|H):** Adam’s traits are less likely for a business administration student. Let's estimate P(E|H ~ 0.2).
- **P(E|¬H):** Given that Adam's traits favor other fields, it is more probable he is not in business administration. Let’s assume P(E|¬H ~ 0.8).

Now, we calculate the posterior probabilities using these estimates:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

Because we are focusing on relative comparison and assuming P(E) is constant for the sake of estimation, the proportional values will be:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.9 * 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.2 * 0.1
}
```

```
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.18,
  "business administration": 0.02
}
```

These values suggest that, based on the given personality sketch, it is significantly more likely that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration in 2021.
