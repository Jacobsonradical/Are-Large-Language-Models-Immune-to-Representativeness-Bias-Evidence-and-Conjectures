To estimate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to make educated guesses about the relevant probabilities: \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

### Business Administration

- **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in business administration. This can be relatively common, so let's assume \( P(H) = 0.15 \).

- **\( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in business administration. Business students may not typically exhibit a deep love for animals and nature, but they might have empathy and intelligence. Let’s assume \( P(E|H) = 0.05 \).

- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in business administration. Given the specific traits related to nature and animals, \( E \) might be more likely in other fields. Suppose \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) sums up the probabilities across all hypotheses and their complements, we can simplify calculations by agreeing that \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Here:

\[ P(E) = (0.05 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.0075 + 0.17 = 0.1775 \]

Thus:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.15}{0.1775} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.042 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This field is less common but directly aligns with Adam's personality traits. Let’s assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).

- **\( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This field strongly matches his curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals. Let’s assume \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).

- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of observing \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Since Adam's traits are specific to this field, \( P(E|\neg H) \) should be relatively lower. Let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

Using Bayes' rule for this field:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here:

\[ P(E) = (0.9 \times 0.05) + (0.1 \times 0.95) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.045 + 0.095 = 0.14 \]

Thus:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.05}{0.14} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.321 \]
