To calculate the probabilities using Bayes' Theorem, we need to estimate the following:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field (agricultural and veterinary science or business administration).
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in the specific field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in the specific field.
4. \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the specific field given his personality sketch. This is computed using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) (the marginal likelihood of the evidence) is the same for both fields, it will not affect the relative comparison:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given the personality sketch, we will estimate the values for each.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume this field represents approximately 10% of overall graduate fields.
   \[ P(H) = 0.1 \]

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science:
   - Genuine curiosity about nature and plants fits very well.
   - Strong empathy and deep love for animals fits perfectly.
   - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts are also relevant.
   
   Therefore, \( P(E|H) \) is very high:
   \[ P(E|H) = 0.9 \]

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is lower, given that his traits fit well with this field. Assuming this:
   \[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \]

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.09 \]

### Business Administration

1. **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Let's assume this field represents approximately 20% of overall graduate fields.
   \[ P(H) = 0.2 \]

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in business administration is lower because the personality traits described fit less well:
   - Genuine curiosity about nature and plants doesn't align well.
   - Strong empathy and love for animals also don't align well.
   - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts might be relevant but not particularly distinctive here.
   
   Therefore, \( P(E|H) \) is moderate:
   \[ P(E|H) = 0.2 \]

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in business administration is higher compared to agricultural science since there are many fields where these traits might still fit. Assuming this:
   \[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \]

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \cdot 0.2 = 0.04 \]

Comparing these values, we find:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \approx \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.04} = 0.69 \) (approximately),
  "business administration": \( \approx \frac{0.04}{0.09 + 0.04} = 0.31 \) (approximately)
}

For simplicity and based on relative scales:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.69,
  "business administration": 0.31
}
