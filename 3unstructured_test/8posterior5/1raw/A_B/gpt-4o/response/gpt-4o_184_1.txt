To compute the posterior probabilities using Bayes' rule, we first need to estimate the probabilities \(P(H)\), \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E|\neg H)\) for each field. Note that since we don't have exact figures, we are making educated estimations based on the given personality sketch and typical characteristics associated with each field.

1. **Business Administration**:
   - **P(H)** (the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration): Since business administration is a relatively common field of study, we might estimate it to be reasonably probable, but less likely given Adam's specific interests.
   
   - **P(E|H)** (the likelihood of observing the personality sketch if Adam were in business administration): Given Adam's love for nature, animals, and abstract concepts, this is relatively low, as these traits are less commonly associated with business administration students. 

   - **P(E|\neg H)** (the likelihood of observing the personality sketch if Adam were not in business administration): Given that Adam's traits align more with fields like science, this can be considered relatively high.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **P(H)** (the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science): Given Adam's interests and personality traits, we might estimate this field to have a higher prior probability compared to business administration.

   - **P(E|H)** (the likelihood of observing the personality sketch if Adam were in agricultural and veterinary science): Since Adam has a strong connection to nature, plants, and animals, this is high.

   - **P(E|\neg H)** (the likelihood of observing the personality sketch if Adam were not in agricultural and veterinary science): This value can be considered lower, as the specific interests in animals and nature are less likely to fit other fields.

For simplicity, let's assign some tentative illustrative values (keeping in mind these are rough estimations):

**Business Administration**:
- \(P(H) = 0.2\)
- \(P(E|H) = 0.1\)
- \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.3\)

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
- \(P(H) = 0.4\)
- \(P(E|H) = 0.8\)
- \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.2\)

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

**Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot (1 - 0.2)} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.24} = \frac{0.02}{0.26} \approx 0.077 \]

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.4}{0.8 \cdot 0.4 + 0.2 \cdot (1 - 0.4)} = \frac{0.32}{0.32 + 0.2 \cdot 0.6} = \frac{0.32}{0.32 + 0.12} = \frac{0.32}{0.44} \approx 0.727 \]

So, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.077,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.727
}
```
