To answer this question, we'll employ Bayes' theorem, which involves calculating the probability of a hypothesis given evidence. Here's the formula for Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To keep things simple, we'll qualitatively estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

**Hypothesis: Adam was enrolled in Business Administration**

1. **P(H) - The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration**: 
   - Let's say 10% of U.S. graduate students are in Business Administration. So, \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

2. **P(E|H) - The probability of Adam's personality given he is in Business Administration**:
   - His personality sketch doesn't strongly align with typical traits needed for Business Administration, such as leadership or a strong focus on business tasks. Let's estimate this at 10% or \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H) - The probability of Adam's personality if he's not in Business Administration**:
   - Considering all other fields, it seems more likely his personality matches something outside Business Administration. Let's estimate this at 30% or \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Now we can use these.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.1}{0.1 \times 0.1 + 0.9 \times 0.3} = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.27} = \frac{0.01}{0.28} \approx 0.036 \]

**Hypothesis: Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

1. **P(H) - The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Let's assume this is also 10% for simplicity, \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

2. **P(E|H) - The probability of Adam's personality given he is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - His traits match this field very well. Letâ€™s estimate this at 80% or \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H) - The probability of Adam's personality given he is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Considering all other fields of study, his traits still align fairly well with other scientific fields too. So let's keep it at 30% or \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Now we can use these.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.8 \times 0.1 + 0.9 \times 0.3} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.27} = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \approx 0.229 \]

Given the calculations:

{
  "business administration": 0.036,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.229
}
