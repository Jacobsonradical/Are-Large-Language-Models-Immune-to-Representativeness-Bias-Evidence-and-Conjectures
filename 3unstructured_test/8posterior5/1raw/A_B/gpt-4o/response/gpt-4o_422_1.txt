To apply Bayes' Theorem and compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), as well as the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \). However, since we don't have actual numerical values for these probabilities, we'll need to make educated estimates based on the given personality sketch of Adam and general knowledge about the fields.

1. **Business Administration (BA)**

- **Prior Probability \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \)**: The probability that a graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in business administration. This is quite high because many students choose this field.
  - Estimate: 0.2 (or 20%)

- **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he were in business administration. Given Adamâ€™s traits related to nature, empathy, and love for animals, this is quite low.
  - Estimate: 0.1 (or 10%)

- **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he were not in business administration. Given the large number of other fields that align better with his traits (e.g., natural sciences), this is comparatively higher.
  - Estimate: 0.7 (or 70%)

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)}\]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) P(\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.2) + (0.7 \times 0.8) = 0.02 + 0.56 = 0.58 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.58} \approx 0.0345 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS)**

- **Prior Probability \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \)**: The probability that a graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This is relatively lower than business administration but higher than some niche fields.
  - Estimate: 0.05 (or 5%)

- **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he were in agricultural and veterinary science. This is very high given his curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals.
  - Estimate: 0.9 (or 90%)

- **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he were not in agricultural and veterinary science. This is lower because fewer fields align so well with his traits.
  - Estimate: 0.5 (or 50%)

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) P(H_{\text{AVS}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) P(H_{\text{AVS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) P(\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.9 \times 0.05) + (0.5 \times 0.95) = 0.045 + 0.475 = 0.52 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.05}{0.52} \approx 0.0865 \]

Hence, the computed posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0345,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.0865
}
```
