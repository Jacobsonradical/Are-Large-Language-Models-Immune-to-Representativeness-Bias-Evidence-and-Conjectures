To compute the probabilities P(H|E) for each field using Bayes' Rule, I'll follow the format you've given and estimate the needed probabilities. Bayes' Rule can be stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Probability of observing evidence \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of observing evidence \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E) \): Total probability of observing the evidence \( E \).

### Assumptions
Since exact probabilities are not provided, I'll make reasonable estimates based on the personality sketch and the typical relevance of the traits mentioned to the fields in question.

### Business Administration
1. **P(H):** Probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in business administration.
   - Let's assume P(H) = 0.2 (due to the general popularity of the field).

2. **P(E|H):** Probability of Adam having the given personality if he is enrolled in business administration.
   - Given that Adam enjoys nature, animals, and puzzles (which are less typical traits for business), let's say P(E|H) = 0.1.

3. **P(E|\neg H):** Probability of Adam having the given personality if he is not enrolled in business administration.
   - Assuming the traits are more common outside of business administration, P(E|\neg H) = 0.3.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H):** Probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Let's assume P(H) = 0.1 (as it's a specialized field).

2. **P(E|H):** Probability of Adam having the given personality if he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Given his traits, it's highly likely P(E|H) = 0.6.

3. **P(E|\neg H):** Probability of Adam having the given personality if he is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Assuming these traits are less common outside this field, P(E|\neg H) = 0.2.

### Calculation 
- \( P(E) \) can be estimated using the law of total probability:
  \[
  P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
  \]

1. **Business Administration:**
   \[
   P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) = 0.02 + 0.24 = 0.26
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.26} \approx 0.077
   \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   \[
   P(E) = (0.6 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) = 0.06 + 0.18 = 0.24
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.1}{0.24} \approx 0.25
   \]

### Final Results
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.077,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.25
}
