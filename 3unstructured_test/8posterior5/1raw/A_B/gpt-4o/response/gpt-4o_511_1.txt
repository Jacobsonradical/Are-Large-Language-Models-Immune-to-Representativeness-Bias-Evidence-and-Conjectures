To address the problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given that the hypothesis is false.

Since exact probabilities for these values are not provided, I'll make reasonable assumptions based on the context and domain knowledge.

1. **Business Administration**:
   - **P(H)**: Let's assume the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration is relatively moderate (e.g., 0.2), as business administration is a common field of study for graduate students.
   - **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam having the traits described in E given he is in business administration is relatively low. Business administration typically does not directly involve a strong curiosity about nature, plants, or animals (e.g., 0.1).
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of Adam having the traits described in E given he is not in business administration is moderate to high, as those traits could be more common in other fields (e.g., 0.5).

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is lower (e.g., 0.1) because fewer students typically enroll in this field compared to more popular fields.
   - **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam having the traits described in E given he is in agricultural and veterinary science is very high, as this field aligns well with his interests in nature, plants, and animals (e.g., 0.8).
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of Adam having the traits described in E given he is not in agricultural and veterinary science is also moderate (e.g., 0.3), since other fields might still attract individuals with similar attributes but not predominantly.

Now, applying these assumptions to Bayes' theorem:

1. **Business Administration**:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.4} = \frac{0.02}{0.42} \approx 0.048
\]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.27} = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \approx 0.229
\]

Thus, the probabilities are:
{
  "business administration": 0.048,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.229
}
