Let's start by assigning our initial probabilities and likelihoods for each field based on Adam's personality sketch. We'll then use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probabilities.

### Business Administration (BA)
1. **P(H_BA)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration. Without any specific context, we'll consider it a relatively low probability because his interests and personality traits don't strongly align with typical traits needed for business administration.
   
2. **P(E|H_BA)**: The likelihood of the evidence (personality sketch) given that Adam was in Business Administration. Traits like curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, strong empathy, and love for animals are less aligned with business administration students.
   
3. **P(E|\neg H_BA)**: The likelihood of the evidence given that Adam was not in Business Administration. Since his traits are more likely to be found in other fields like sciences and humanities, this value will be relatively high.

Let's estimate:
- P(H_BA) ≈ 0.1
- P(E|H_BA) ≈ 0.1
- P(E|\neg H_BA) ≈ 0.9

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_BA|E) = \frac{P(E|H_BA) \cdot P(H_BA)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_BA) \cdot P(H_BA) + P(E|\neg H_BA) \cdot P(\neg H_BA) \]
\[ P(E) ≈ (0.1 \cdot 0.1) + (0.9 \cdot 0.9) ≈ 0.01 + 0.81 = 0.82 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H_BA|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.82} ≈ 0.0122 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS)
1. **P(H_AVS)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. His genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy align well with this field.
   
2. **P(E|H_AVS)**: The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. The match is strong, so this will be high.
   
3. **P(E|\neg H_AVS)**: The likelihood of the evidence given that Adam was not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. This will be lower as his personality traits align well with this field specifically.

Let's estimate:
- P(H_AVS) ≈ 0.3
- P(E|H_AVS) ≈ 0.8
- P(E|\neg H_AVS) ≈ 0.4

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_AVS|E) = \frac{P(E|H_AVS) \cdot P(H_AVS)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_AVS) \cdot P(H_AVS) + P(E|\neg H_AVS) \cdot P(\neg H_AVS) \]
\[ P(E) ≈ (0.8 \cdot 0.3) + (0.4 \cdot 0.7) = 0.24 + 0.28 = 0.52 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H_AVS|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.3}{0.52} ≈ 0.4615 \]

Summarizing the results:

{
  "business administration": 0.0122,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4615
