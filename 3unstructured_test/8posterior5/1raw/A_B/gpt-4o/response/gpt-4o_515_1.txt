Certainly! Let's start by analyzing each of the fields:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - **P(H)**: The prior probability that any randomly chosen graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. This can reasonably be estimated as low to moderate since this is not one of the more common graduate fields.
   - **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam would have the personality traits mentioned if he were enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given that Adam has a strong interest in nature, empathy for animals, and a deep love for animals, this is pretty high.
   - **P(E|¬H)**: The probability that Adam would have those same traits if he were not in agricultural and veterinary science is lower because these traits align well specifically with agricultural and veterinary sciences but less so with other fields.

   Using Bayes' rule: 
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   
   Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both hypotheses and will cancel out in our comparative analysis, we focus on the relative values.

   Values for:
   \[
   P(H) \approx 0.05 \quad (\text{low to moderate prior for a specialized field})
   \]
   \[
   P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \quad (\text{highly consistent with personality traits})
   \]
   \[
   P(E|¬H) \approx 0.3 \quad (\text{much lower probability of these traits if not in this field})
   \]

2. **Business Administration:**
   - **P(H)**: The prior probability that any randomly chosen graduate student is in business administration. This can reasonably be estimated as moderate to high since business administration is a common graduate field.
   - **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam would have the same personality traits if he were enrolled in business administration. Business administration students may not typically have the same pronounced traits related to nature and animals, so this is lower.
   - **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of Adam having those same traits if he were not in business administration is slightly higher, as these traits are less aligned with business administration.

   Values for:
   \[
   P(H) \approx 0.2 \quad (\text{moderate to high prior for a common field})
   \]
   \[
   P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \quad (\text{low probability of matching traits})
   \]
   \[
   P(E|¬H) \approx 0.4 \quad (\text{higher compared to being in business administration})
   \]

Using these estimations, let's calculate the relative posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \):

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04
\]

For **Business Administration**:
\[
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \cdot 0.2 = 0.04
\]

The absolute values for \( P(H|E) \) are scaled for each field independently.

So the resultant ratios are:

\[
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.67",
  "business administration": "0.33"
}
\]

Note: These probabilities are comparative and not absolute. The key is the relative probability that Adam fits one over the other given his personality sketch.
