Sure, let's use Bayes' rule to compute the probabilities. Bayes' rule is given by the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in the field given the personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the personality sketch.

Since \( P(E) \) will cancel out when comparing the two fields, we can omit it and compare the values of \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) instead.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H):** This is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume a small fraction of graduate students pursue this field, say \( 0.05 \) or 5%.
2. **P(E|H):** This is the probability of Adam having the given personality sketch if he is in this field. Given his love for nature, empathy, love for animals, and understanding of dedication, this would be quite high, let’s assume \( 0.8 \) or 80%.
3. **P(E|¬H):** This involves calculating the probability of Adam having this personality sketch if he is not in this field. Considering agricultural and veterinary science has a narrow scope, let's assume this to be around \( 0.1 \) or 10%.

### Business Administration
1. **P(H):** This is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration. Let’s assume a larger fraction of graduate students pursue this field, say \( 0.3 \) or 30%.
2. **P(E|H):** This is the probability of Adam having the given personality sketch if he is in business administration. Given his nature-focused and empathetic traits, this would be relatively low for business administration, with an estimation of \( 0.2 \) or 20%.
3. **P(E|¬H):** This involves calculating the probability of Adam having this personality sketch if he is not in this field. Given the generic distribution of graduates in various other fields, let’s assume this to be around \( 0.15 \) or 15%.

### Computations
We know:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04 \]

For business administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.3 = 0.06 \]

Normalizing these values (although not strictly necessary as the sum need not be 1):

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.04,
  "business administration": 0.06
}
```

This indicates relative likelihood rather than absolute probabilities. Adam is more likely to be in business administration over agricultural and veterinary science, but based on the sketch, neither field has a high probability.
