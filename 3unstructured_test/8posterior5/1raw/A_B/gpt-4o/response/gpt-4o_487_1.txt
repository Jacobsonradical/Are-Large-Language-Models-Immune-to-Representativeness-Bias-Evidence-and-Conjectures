To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplification, we will assume \( P(E) \) is a constant since it affects the denominator uniformly for all fields. We also assume that the prior probability \( P(H) \) is based on general enrollment data proportional to the number of students in each field, but specific probabilities can be adjusted later based on better data. 

Given the personality sketch, Adam's characteristics align strongly with agricultural and veterinary science and less with business administration. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: Likelihood of a graduate student being in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's estimate it's moderately common.
- **P(E|H)**: Probability that Adam exhibits the traits described given he is in this field is high due to his love for nature and animals.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability that Adam exhibits these traits given he is not in this field is lower but still possible.

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: Likelihood of a graduate student being in business administration. Let's estimate it's highly common.
- **P(E|H)**: Probability that Adam exhibits the traits described given he is in this field is low since the traits do not match the typical characteristics needed in this field.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability that Adam exhibits these traits given he is not in this field is higher because these traits can belong to students in various other fields.

Using these considerations, let's assign approximate values for easier computation:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \)

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) = 0.25 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \)

Now, calculating \( P(H|E) \):

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.09 \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.025 \]

Normalizing values to derive proportional calculations:

Let total sum \(= 0.09 + 0.025 = 0.115\)

Normalized Probability for Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.09}{0.115} \approx 0.783 \]

Normalized Probability for Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.025}{0.115} \approx 0.217 \]

Thus, we have:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.783",
  "business administration": "0.217"
}
