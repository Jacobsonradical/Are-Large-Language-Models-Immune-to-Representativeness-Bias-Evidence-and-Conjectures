To evaluate the probabilities P(H|E) for each of the fields (agricultural and veterinary science, and business administration), I will consider the given personality sketch E of Adam and apply Bayes' Theorem. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how to approach this:

1. **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field.
2. **P(E|H):** The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
3. **P(E|¬H):** The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H_agricultural):** Let's assume a moderate prior probability that Adam was enrolled in this field, as it fits well with his interests in nature, plants, animals, and empathy.
- **P(E|H_agricultural):** Given Adam's described interests and traits, the probability of his profile fitting this field should be high.
- **P(E|¬H_agricultural):** The probability of Adam having these traits but not being in this field is moderate, as these traits could also fit other fields involving empathy, nature, or animals.

### Business Administration
- **P(H_business):** The prior probability for business administration can be assumed to be low, as the personality sketch does not suggest typical traits associated with this field, such as a focus on interpersonal skills or business acumen.
- **P(E|H_business):** Given his profile, the likelihood that Adam fits the description of someone in business administration is low.
- **P(E|¬H_business):** The probability of Adam having these traits but not being in business administration is quite high, as the profile does not align well with the field.

Applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll assume P(E) to be constant for the purpose of ranking the fields.

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H_agricultural):** 0.2
- **P(E|H_agricultural):** 0.8
- **P(E|¬H_agricultural):** 0.3

\[ P(H_agricultural|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.16}{P(E)} \]

#### Business Administration
- **P(H_business):** 0.05
- **P(E|H_business):** 0.1
- **P(E|¬H_business):** 0.8

\[ P(H_business|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.005}{P(E)} \]

### Normalized Comparison
To give values relative to each other, we'll assume P(E) is the same for both:

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ \frac{0.16}{P(E)} = \text{relative strength} \]
For Business Administration:
\[ \frac{0.005}{P(E)} = \text{relative strength} \]

Normalizing these to sum up to 1:

\[ \text{Sum of relative strengths} = 0.16 + 0.005 = 0.165 \]

\[ P(H_agricultural|E) = \frac{0.16}{0.165} \approx 0.97 \]
\[ P(H_business|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.165} \approx 0.03 \]

Thus, the normalized probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.97,
  "business administration": 0.03
}
```
