To calculate \(P(H|E)\), the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch \(E\), we need to use Bayes' rule:

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

Let's first define the prior probabilities \(P(H)\) for each field and estimate the likelihoods \(P(E|H)\) and \(P(E|\neg H)\):

1. **Business Administration**
   - \(P(H)\) (prior): Business administration is a popular field, so suppose \(P(H)\) is 0.3.
   - \(P(E|H)\) (likelihood): The personality sketch suggests a strong interest in nature, empathy, and animals, which does not align well with the typical personality profile for business administration. Let's estimate this at 0.1.
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\) (complement likelihood): Assuming \(\neg H\) encompasses all other fields, and based on typical student distribution, let's estimate this at 0.5.

\[P(H|E) \text{ (Business Administration)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)}\]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - \(P(H)\) (prior): This field is less common than business administration. Let's estimate \(P(H)\) at 0.1.
   - \(P(E|H)\) (likelihood): The personality sketch is a near-perfect match for this field given the strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy. Let's estimate this at 0.8.
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\) (complement likelihood): As above, 0.5.

\[P(H|E) \text{ (Agricultural and Veterinary Science)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)}\]

To get the actual probabilities, we'd need \(P(E)\), the overall probability of the evidence. For simplicity, we can consider the normalized values since \(P(E)\) cancels out. Here are the approximate calculations for comparison:

- **Business Administration**

\[P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.3}{\text{normalizing factor}} = \frac{0.03}{\text{normalizing factor}}\]

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

\[P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{\text{normalizing factor}} = \frac{0.08}{\text{normalizing factor}}\]

Given the relative magnitudes, agricultural and veterinary science is far more likely given the personality sketch.

Thus, the approximate values are:

{
  "business administration": 0.03,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08
}

These values will be normalized against each other to sum to 1 when considering only these two fields. However, for this purpose, the raw values indicate the relative likelihoods, showing that Adam is more likely to have been enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration.
