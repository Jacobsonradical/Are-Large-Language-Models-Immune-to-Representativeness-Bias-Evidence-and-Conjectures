To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given Adam's personality sketch, we will need to estimate the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \) - The base rate probability that a graduate student is enrolled in that field.
2. \( P(E|H) \) - The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not in that field.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields, we will focus on comparing the relative values of \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

### Business Administration

1. **\( P(H) \) - Base rate probability:**
   - Let's assume roughly 10% of graduate students are enrolled in business administration programs (this is an estimate and can vary by institution).

2. **\( P(E|H) \) - Probability of the personality sketch given this field:**
   - The personality traits described (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy) may not align extremely well with typical business administration profiles.
   - Let's estimate this probability as 0.1.

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \) - Probability of the personality sketch given not being in this field:**
   - Since this personality sketch (love for nature, animals) is fairly specific, let's assume that without considering business administration, the chance of someone fitting this description is higher.
   - Let’s estimate this probability as 0.3.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.01}{P(E)} \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **\( P(H) \) - Base rate probability:**
   - Let’s assume 5% of graduate students are enrolled in agricultural and veterinary programs (again, this is an estimate).

2. **\( P(E|H) \) - Probability of the personality sketch given this field:**
   - The personality traits fit well with this field (curiosity about nature, love for animals).
   - Let's estimate this probability as 0.8.

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \) - Probability of the personality sketch given not being in this field:**
   - Similar to above, we estimate 0.3.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} = \frac{0.04}{P(E)} \]

### Relative Comparison

Now, since \( P(E) \) is a constant factor, we can compare:

For business administration:
\[ \frac{0.01}{P(E)} \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ \frac{0.04}{P(E)} \]

Clearly, the probability for agricultural and veterinary science is higher. Normalizing to compare within our context (not absolute probabilities):

{
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.04} \) ≈ 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{0.04}{0.01 + 0.04} \) ≈ 0.8,
}

So, the answers are:
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
