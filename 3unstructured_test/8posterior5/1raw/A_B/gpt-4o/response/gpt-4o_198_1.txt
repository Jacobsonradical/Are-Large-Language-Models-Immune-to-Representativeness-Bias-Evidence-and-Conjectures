To calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood of the evidence given the negation of each hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H) \). Let's go through each field step-by-step.

### Hypotheses:
1. \( H_{\text{business administration}} \)
2. \( H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} \)

### Values:

1. **Business Administration:**

   - **Prior \( P(H) \)**: The prior probability of Adam being in a business administration program. This is generally low given his personality sketch does not suggest a strong inclination toward business.
     - **Estimate**: 0.1

   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood that Adam would have his personality traits if he were in a business administration program. This is somewhat low because business administration is less aligned with his interests and empathy towards nature and animals.
     - **Estimate**: 0.2

   - **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The likelihood that Adam would have these traits if he were not in business administration. This is higher because his personality is more aligned with other fields, potentially in science or humanities.
     - **Estimate**: 0.7

   - **Posterior \( P(H|E) \)**: Using Bayes' theorem:
     \[
     P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
     \]
     Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

     \[
     P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.7 \cdot 0.9) = 0.02 + 0.63 = 0.65
     \]

     \[
     P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.65} \approx 0.0308
     \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

   - **Prior \( P(H) \)**: The prior probability of Adam being in an agricultural and veterinary science program. This is higher given his personality and interests.
     - **Estimate**: 0.4

   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood that Adam would have his personality traits if he were in an agricultural and veterinary science program. This is very high since it matches closely with his described traits.
     - **Estimate**: 0.9

   - **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The likelihood that Adam would have these traits if he were not in agricultural and veterinary science. This is lower since such personality traits are more common in the field he is potentially in.
     - **Estimate**: 0.3

   - **Posterior \( P(H|E) \)**: Using Bayes' theorem:

     \[
     P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
     \]

     \[
     P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.4) + (0.3 \cdot 0.6) = 0.36 + 0.18 = 0.54
     \]

     \[
     P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.4}{0.54} \approx 0.6667
     \]

### Final Assignment of Probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0308,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6667
}
```

These values suggest that, given Adam's personality sketch, it is significantly more likely that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration.
