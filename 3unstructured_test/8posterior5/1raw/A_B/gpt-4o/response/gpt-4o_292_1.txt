To apply Bayes' theorem to determine the probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch \( E \), we need the following components:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the personality traits given the specific field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the personality traits given he is not enrolled in that field.

Bayes' theorem is stated as follows:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the need to compute probabilities, let's define our values:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - \( P(H) = \) Assumed prior probability someone is in this field. Let's say 0.05, assuming there are many graduate fields.
    - \( P(E|H) = \) High given the described traits match well with someone interested in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's say 0.8.
    - \( P(E|\neg H) = \) Lower as most other fields would not have all the described traits so fittingly. Let's say 0.2.

2. **Business Administration**:
    - \( P(H) = \) Assumed prior probability someone is in this field. Let's say 0.2 considering business administration is popular among graduate fields.
    - \( P(E|H) = \) Low as the traits don't typically align well with business administration. Let's say 0.1.
    - \( P(E|\neg H) = \) Higher as many other fields could match some of the described traits. Let's say 0.3.

The exact computation for each field's probability would follow:

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{P(E)} \]

For **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]

We denote \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \) for both fields.
This rough computation gives the ratio of probabilities based on the given traits.

Now calculating step-by-step:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(E)_{1} = (0.8 \times 0.05) + (0.2 \times 0.95) \]
\[ = 0.04 + 0.19 \]
\[ = 0.23 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{1} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.23} \]
\[ = \frac{0.04}{0.23} \]
\[ = 0.1739 \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(E)_{2} = (0.1 \times 0.2) + (0.3 \times 0.8) \]
\[ = 0.02 + 0.24 \]
\[ = 0.26 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{2} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.26} \]
\[ = \frac{0.02}{0.26} \]
\[ = 0.0769 \]

Summarizing:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.1739,
  "business administration": 0.0769
}
