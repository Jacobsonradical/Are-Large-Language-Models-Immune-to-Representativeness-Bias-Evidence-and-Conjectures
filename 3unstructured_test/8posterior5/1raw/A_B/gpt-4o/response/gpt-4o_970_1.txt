To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need the following probabilities:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given Adam is not enrolled in that field.

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we do not have the explicit value for \( P(E) \), we can compare the relative values of \( P(H|E) \) for different \( H \). Generally, \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence and is the same for all hypotheses; therefore, it can be used as a normalizing factor at the end.

Let's denote the fields as follows:
- \( H_1 \): Business Administration
- \( H_2 \): Agricultural and Veterinary Science

Based on the information provided:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H_1) \):  This can be based on general enrollment data, but intuitively, fewer students are as aligned to Adam's personality sketch.
   - \( P(E|H_1) \): Given Adam's described traits, not very likely since business administration often doesn't directly involve nature, plants, or animals.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_1) \): This would be high as many other fields could fit Adam's personality sketch better.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H_2) \): Based on general data, less common than business administration but more likely given the match to Adam's interests.
   - \( P(E|H_2) \): Given the alignment with nature, plants, animals, and empathy, very high likelihood.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_2) \): Lower than \( P(E|\neg H_1) \) since fewer other fields (besides agricultural and veterinary science) would align so closely with Adam's attributes.

Let's assign some approximate subjective values:

- For business administration (\( H_1 \)):
  - \( P(H_1) \approx 0.3 \)
  - \( P(E|H_1) \approx 0.1 \)
  - \( P(E|\neg H_1) \approx 0.5 \)

- For agricultural and veterinary science (\( H_2 \)):
  - \( P(H_2) \approx 0.1 \)
  - \( P(E|H_2) \approx 0.7 \)
  - \( P(E|\neg H_2) \approx 0.2 \)

Using Bayes' rule without the normalizing factor (\( P(E) \)):

\[ P(H_1|E) \propto P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) = 0.1 \times 0.3 = 0.03 \]
\[ P(H_2|E) \propto P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) = 0.7 \times 0.1 = 0.07 \]

Since we are using relative probabilities, comparing these values directly gives an indication of the likelihood. Finally normalizing them:

Normalization factor = \( 0.03 + 0.07 = 0.1 \)

\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.1} = 0.3 \]
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.07}{0.1} = 0.7 \]

So we have:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
