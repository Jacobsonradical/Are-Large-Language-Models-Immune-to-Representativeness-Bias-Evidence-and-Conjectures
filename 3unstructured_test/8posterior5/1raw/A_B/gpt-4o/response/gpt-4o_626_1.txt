To apply Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch of Adam, we need to estimate the following probabilities:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) if Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) if Adam was not enrolled in that field.

Let's denote:

- \( H_1 \) as "Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science."
- \( H_2 \) as "Adam was enrolled in business administration."

For clarity, we will provide estimates for each probability component and then compute \( P(H|E) \) for both \( H_1 \) and \( H_2 \) using Bayes' rule.

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

1. **\( P(H_1) \):** 
   - Let's assume a modest prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. It's not a highly common graduate field, so let's estimate this as \( 0.05 \).

2. **\( P(E|H_1) \):** 
   - Given the personality sketch, someone in agricultural and veterinary science might exhibit a genuine curiosity about nature, a love for animals, and possibly strong empathy. These traits align well with the field. Let's estimate this as \( 0.8 \).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H_1) \):** 
   - This is the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Since multiple fields could lead to developing such a personality, we can assume this might be relatively high. Let's estimate this as \( 0.4 \).

Applying Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be estimated as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E|\neg H_1) \cdot P(\neg H_1) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.4 \cdot 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.38 = 0.42 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.42} \approx 0.095 \]

### For Business Administration:

1. **\( P(H_2) \):** 
   - Let's assume a prior probability; business administration is a very common graduate field. Let's estimate this as \( 0.2 \).

2. **\( P(E|H_2) \):** 
   - The alignment of Adam's traits with business administration may be weaker compared to agricultural and veterinary science, as empathy and love for animals are not typically central to business administration. Let's estimate this as \( 0.1 \).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H_2) \):** 
   - Similar to the previous calculation for \( P(E|\neg H_1) \), let's retain the same estimation since it doesn't change toward a specific field other than business administration. So, let's estimate this as \( 0.4 \).

Applying Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be reused from the previous calculation as:
\[ P(E) = 0.42 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.42} \approx 0.048 \]

Summarizing the results:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.095,
  "business administration": 0.048
