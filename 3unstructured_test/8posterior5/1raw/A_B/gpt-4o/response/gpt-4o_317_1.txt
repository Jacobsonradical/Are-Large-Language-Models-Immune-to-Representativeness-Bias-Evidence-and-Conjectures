To apply Bayes' rule and determine the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \), we need the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood of the evidence under the negation of the hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H) \). However, as an AI, I cannot access specific prior probabilities or specific likelihood values directly without additional context or data. Nevertheless, I can make reasonable assumptions to facilitate the calculation.

Let's establish some reasonable assumptions about the probabilities:

1. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H) \): The base probability of a graduate student being in business administration.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam's described traits if he were studying business administration.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam's described traits if he were not studying business administration.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): The base probability of a graduate student being in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam's described traits if he were studying agricultural and veterinary science.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam's described traits if he were not studying agricultural and veterinary science.

Given Adamâ€™s traits, we can consider:
- His curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science.
- Business administration may not align as naturally with Adam's personality traits as described.

**Assumed Probabilities:**
1. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H) = 0.2 \): A reasonable estimate assuming a diverse set of majors.
   - \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \): It's less likely that these traits align with this field.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.9 \): It's more likely that these traits would appear outside of this field.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H) = 0.1 \): A base probability which could be lower due to fewer students in this field.
   - \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \): Likely traits of someone in this field.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \): These traits are less likely for those not in this field.

**Using Bayes' Rule:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)} \]

1. **Business Administration:**
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.1 \times 0.2 + 0.9 \times 0.8} \]
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.72} \]
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.74} \approx 0.027 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.1}{0.7 \times 0.1 + 0.3 \times 0.9} \]
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.07}{0.07 + 0.27} \]
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.07}{0.34} \approx 0.206 \]

Thus, the estimated probabilities are as follows:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.027,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.206
}
```
These results indicate that based on Adam's personality sketch, it is more likely that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration in 2021.
