To find the probabilities \( P(H \mid E) \) for the given hypotheses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Assign prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each hypothesis.
2. Determine the likelihoods \( P(E \mid H) \) for each hypothesis.
3. Determine the likelihoods \( P(E \mid \neg H) \).

Then, we use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for all hypotheses and we're only interested in relative ratios, we can simplify to:

\[ P(H \mid E) \propto P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given the personality sketch, we can make the following assumptions:

- Adam's love for nature and animals should correlate highly with "agricultural and veterinary science".
- His personality traits do not strongly suggest interest in "business administration".

We'll assign some numerical values based on these rough assessments.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - The likelihood that a random graduate student is in this field. Assuming no specific bias, let's assign \( P(H) \) a moderate value since it's a specialized but common enough field.
   - Set \( P(H) = 0.05 \). 

2. **Likelihood \( P(E \mid H) \)**:
   - Given Adam's personality, there's a high likelihood he would be in this field.
   - Set \( P(E \mid H) = 0.7 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E \mid \neg H) \)**:
   - The probability of Adam's personality given he is not in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Given the broad range of grad fields and assuming this personality fits best here, set \( P(E \mid \neg H) = 0.01 \) (it's less likely he'd be in a completely different field).

### Business Administration

1. **Prior probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - The likelihood that a random graduate student is in this field. Assume a higher base rate because this is a common grad field.
   - Set \( P(H) = 0.15 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E \mid H) \)**:
   - Given Adam's personality, it's less likely but still possible. People with empathy and understanding solve puzzles all the time in business scenarios.
   - Set \( P(E \mid H) = 0.02 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E \mid \neg H) \)**:
   - The personality traits don't strongly correlate with business administration.
   - Set \( P(E \mid \neg H) = 0.03 \).

Now, use Bayes' Rule proportionally:

\[ P(H \mid E) \propto P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H \mid E) \propto 0.7 \times 0.05 = 0.035 \]

For business administration:
\[ P(H \mid E) \propto 0.02 \times 0.15 = 0.003 \]

To simplify the results:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.035,
  "business administration": 0.003
}
