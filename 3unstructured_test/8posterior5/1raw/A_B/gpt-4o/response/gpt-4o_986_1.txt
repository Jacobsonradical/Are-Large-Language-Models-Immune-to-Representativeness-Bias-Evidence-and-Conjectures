To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch using Bayes' Rule, we need to consider the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \) - The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
2. \( P(E|H) \) - The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he was enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he was not enrolled in that field.

Bayes' Rule is:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

### Judgments:

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- **P(H)**: Moderate, as agricultural and veterinary science is a specialized field, but aligns well with Adam's love for animals and nature; let's assume \(P(H) = 0.1\).
- **P(E|H)**: High, since Adam's personality traits such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy fit well with this field; let's assume \(P(E|H) = 0.9\).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Lower, since not all other fields will have a high density of people with these traits; let's assume \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.3\).

#### Business Administration:
- **P(H)**: Higher than agricultural and veterinary science, as business is a more commonly pursued field; let's assume \(P(H) = 0.3\).
- **P(E|H)**: Low, since Adam's personality traits such as love for animals, empathy, and curiosity about nature are less aligned with business administration; let's assume \(P(E|H) = 0.2\).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Similar to previous case, let's assume \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.3\).

### Calculation using Bayes' Rule:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{0.9 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot (1 - 0.1)}
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.27}
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.36} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Business Administration**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{0.2 \cdot 0.3 + 0.3 \cdot (1 - 0.3)}
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.21}
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.27} \approx 0.222
   \]

### Final Answer:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.25,
  "business administration": 0.222
}
