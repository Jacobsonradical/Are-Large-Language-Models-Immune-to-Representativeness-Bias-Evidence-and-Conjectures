To apply Bayes' Rule and estimate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in specific graduate fields based on the given personality sketch and general conditions, we need to start by considering the relevant probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in that field.

Bayes' Rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is constant for all hypotheses being considered, we can compare the numerators to rank the hypotheses:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

**Step 1: Estimate Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)**
Let's assume some general base rate priors for the fields:
- \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.05 \)
- \( P(\text{business administration}) \approx 0.15 \)

**Step 2: Estimate Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \)**
- For agricultural and veterinary science: Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals strongly fits this field. Thus, high likelihood: \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.8 \)
- For business administration: Adam's traits do not strongly correlate with this field. Moderate likelihood: \( P(E|\text{business administration}) \approx 0.2 \)

**Step 3: Estimate Likelihoods \( P(E|\neg H) \)**
- For agricultural and veterinary science: The personality sketch may be moderately common among the general population; thus, \( P(E|\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.3 \)
- For business administration: The personality sketch is unlikely to strongly match this field in the general population; thus, \( P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) \approx 0.2 \)

**Step 4: Compute Posterior Probabilities \( P(H|E) \) Using Bayes Rule**
1. Agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04 \]

2. Business administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \cdot 0.15 = 0.03 \]

So, the posterior probabilities (normalizing these is not required since we are comparing between fields) would be:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.04,
  "business administration": 0.03
}
