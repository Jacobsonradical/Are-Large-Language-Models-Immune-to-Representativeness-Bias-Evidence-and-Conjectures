To apply Bayes' rule, we need to approximate the probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each of the fields of study. Then we use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume this field is relatively less popular compared to other fields. Let's approximate this as \( 0.05 \) (or 5%).
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam having the described personality sketch given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his love for nature, plants, and animals, and his empathy, this seems very likely. Let’s estimate this as \( 0.9 \) (or 90%).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam having the described personality sketch given that he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. This is less likely, but some traits (like empathy and love for puzzles) aren't exclusive to agricultural sciences. Let’s estimate this as \( 0.2 \) (or 20%).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.05}{0.9 \times 0.05 + 0.2 \times 0.95} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.19} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.235} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.191 \]

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in business administration. This is a more common field, let’s approximate this as \( 0.15 \) (or 15%).
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam having the described personality sketch given that he is in business administration. Given his traits, this seems much less likely than the agricultural sciences but not impossible. Let’s estimate this as \( 0.1 \) (or 10%).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam having the described personality sketch given that he is not in business administration. This would be the same as before, \( 0.2 \) (or 20%).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.15}{0.1 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.015}{0.015 + 0.17} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.015}{0.185} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.081 \]

### Result
According to the calculations:
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.191,
  "business administration": 0.081
}
