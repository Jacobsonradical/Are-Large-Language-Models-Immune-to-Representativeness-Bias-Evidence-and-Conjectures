Sure, let's work through the steps.

First, let's judge the different probabilities.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Let's assume it is the proportion of students enrolled in this field. For estimation purposes, let's assume P(H) = 0.1.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and understanding of hard work, it's highly likely. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.9.

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - It's possible that these traits could belong in other fields but less likely. Let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.3.

We use Bayes' rule to find \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.9 \times 0.1) + (0.3 \times 0.9) = 0.09 + 0.27 = 0.36 \]
Thus,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{0.36} = \frac{0.09}{0.36} = 0.25 \]

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
   - For estimation purposes, let's assume P(H) = 0.15.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in business administration.
   - While possible, it seems less likely given interests mentioned. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.1.

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in business administration.
   - As before, let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.15) + (0.3 \times 0.85) = 0.015 + 0.255 = 0.27 \]
Thus,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{0.27} = \frac{0.015}{0.27} = 0.056 \]

Therefore, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.25,
  "business administration": 0.056
}
```

These probabilities suggest that given the personality sketch, it is more likely that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration.
