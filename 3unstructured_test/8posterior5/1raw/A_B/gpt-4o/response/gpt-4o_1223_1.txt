Based on the given personality sketch of Adam, we can make some qualitative judgments about the probabilities involved.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's description fits well with this field, let's assume **P(H) = 0.10**.
- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam having this personality sketch given he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This field involves nature, plants, and animals, so let's assume a high likelihood, say **P(E|H) = 0.90**.
- **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood of Adam having this personality sketch given he is enrolled in any other field (not agricultural and veterinary science). This seems relatively low as the personality traits are quite tailored to this field, so let's assume **P(E|¬H) = 0.30**.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.90 \times 0.10 + 0.30 \times 0.90 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.09 + 0.27 = 0.36 \]

So,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.90 \times 0.10}{0.36} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.09}{0.36} = 0.25 \]

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is enrolled in business administration. This is a very common field, so let's assume **P(H) = 0.20**.
- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam having this personality sketch given he is enrolled in business administration. The sketch does not closely match the traits typically associated with business administration, so let's assume **P(E|H) = 0.10**.
- **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood of Adam having this personality sketch given he is enrolled in any other field (not business administration). This would be the same as before, so assume **P(E|¬H) = 0.35**.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.10 \times 0.20 + 0.35 \times 0.80 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.02 + 0.28 = 0.30 \]

So,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.10 \times 0.20}{0.30} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.02}{0.30} = 0.067 \]

To summarize:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.25,
  "business administration": 0.067
}
