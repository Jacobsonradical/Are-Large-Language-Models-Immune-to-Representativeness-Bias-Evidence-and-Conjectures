To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following probabilities:

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field (before considering the personality sketch).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not enrolled in that field.
  
We use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the personality sketch, which can be computed as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Given that we're comparing two fields, we don't need to compute the exact value for \( P(E) \), as we're interested in the relative probabilities.

Let's denote:
- \( \text{agricultural and veterinary science} \) as \( H_1 \)
- \( \text{business administration} \) as \( H_2 \)

We must estimate each of the following for both fields:

1. Prior probability, \( P(H_1) \) and \( P(H_2) \)
2. Likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given each field, \( P(E|H_1) \) and \( P(E|H_2) \)
3. Likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in each field, \( P(E|\neg H_1) \) and \( P(E|\neg H_2) \)

### Estimation:

1. **Prior Probability (\( P(H_1) \) and \( P(H_2) \))**:
   - For simplicity, let's use base rates for graduate programs. Agricultural and veterinary science programs are less common compared to business administration programs.
   - \( P(H_1) = 0.2 \)
   - \( P(H_2) = 0.2 \)

2. **Likelihood of Personality Sketch Given Field (\( P(E|H_1) \) and \( P(E|H_2) \))**:
   - Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, appreciation for hard work, love for animals, and empathy align well with agricultural and veterinary science.
   - \( P(E|H_1) = 0.8 \)
   - Adam's traits do not strongly align with business administration.
   - \( P(E|H_2) = 0.2 \)

3. **Likelihood of Personality Sketch Given Not in the Field (\( P(E|\neg H_1) \) and \( P(E|\neg H_2) \))**:
   - Adam could still exhibit his personality traits in fields other than agricultural and veterinary science and business administration, but these would be less common.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_1) = 0.3 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H_2) = 0.8 \)

### Computation using Bayes' Rule:

#### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1):
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]
Using relative probabilities:
\[ P(H_1|E) \propto P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) = 0.8 \cdot 0.2 = 0.16 \]

#### For Business Administration (H2):
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E)} \]
Using relative probabilities:
\[ P(H_2|E) \propto P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) = 0.2 \cdot 0.2 = 0.04 \]

### Normalized Posterior Probabilities:

To normalize, we sum the unnormalized probabilities and divide:

\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.16}{0.16 + 0.04} = \frac{0.16}{0.20} = 0.80 \]
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.16 + 0.04} = \frac{0.04}{0.20} = 0.20 \]
