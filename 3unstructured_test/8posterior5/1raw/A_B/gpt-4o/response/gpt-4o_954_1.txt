To approach this problem, we'll use Bayesian reasoning. According to Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in the particular field.

Given that \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant and affects both fields equally, we will focus on \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) and compare relative probabilities.

Let's first assign reasonable estimates for \( P(H) \) based on general expectations about the likelihood of a graduate student being enrolled in each field:

1. \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \): The probability that Adam is a graduate student in business administration. Let's assume this to be around 0.2.
2. \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): The probability that Adam is a graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume this to be around 0.05.

Next, let's estimate \( P(E|H) \):

1. \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \): Given the personality sketch, it seems less likely for someone with strong empathy, deep love for animals, and an appreciation for nature to choose business administration. Let's rate it at around 0.1.
2. \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): Given the personality sketch, it seems much more likely for someone with these characteristics to choose agricultural and veterinary science. Let's rate it at around 0.8.

Finally, let's compute \( P(E|\neg H) \):

1. For business administration: The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given Adam is not in business administration. Given our assumptions, we might assume this to be higher since business administration does not usually correlate strongly with these traits. Let's rate \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business administration}}) \) around 0.4.
2. For agricultural and veterinary science: The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Correspondingly, this would be somewhat lower due to how well these traits align with this field. Let's rate \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \) around 0.2.

Now let's compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
\]

We do not have \( P(E) \) directly, but we'll assume its impact can be normalized out since we're comparing the relative probabilities.

For business administration:

\[
P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot (1-0.2)} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.32} = \frac{0.02}{0.34} \approx 0.059
\]

For agricultural and veterinary science:

\[
P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot (1-0.05)} = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.19} = \frac{0.04}{0.23} \approx 0.174
\]

Thus, the relative probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.059,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.174
}
```

These approximate values suggest that, based on Adam's personality sketch, it's more likely he is studying agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration.
