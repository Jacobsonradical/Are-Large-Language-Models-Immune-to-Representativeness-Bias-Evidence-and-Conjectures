To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given:
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability of Adam being in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Probability of observing the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of observing the evidence given the hypothesis is false.

In order to judge these probabilities, we need to consider the personality sketch provided for Adam and the typical characteristics of graduate students in the specified fields. 

### Psychometric Reasoning:

1. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H) \): The general probability that a graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in business administration may be estimated around 0.2, assuming a significant portion of graduate students pursue this field.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's described interests and personality traits, it's unlikely those are characteristic of a typical business administration student, which tends to focus more on management, economics, and leadership rather than nature, empathy, and solving puzzles. Let's assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.05 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): This would reflect the probability of someone fitting Adam's profile not being in business administration. Given his specific traits, \( P(E|\neg H) \) might be higher, say around 0.3, to reflect that he is more likely to be in a different field that matches his interests.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): The general probability that a graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science could be estimated as lower, maybe around 0.05, reflecting the smaller proportion of students in this specialized field.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's love for nature, plants, animals, and his empathy, the probability of these being characteristic of an agricultural and veterinary science student is quite high. Let's assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Reflecting that given Adam's traits, he fits his profile well with agriculture or veterinary science or other natural sciences, might be around \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \).

### Bayes' Formula Calculation:

We can ignore \( P(E) \) as it is common in both denominators:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

1. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \approx 0.05 \cdot 0.2 = 0.01 \)

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \approx 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04 \)

### Normalization and Inference:

- As \( P(E) \) is a common scaling factor which is ignored in comparing relative probabilities:
  - For business administration: approx value 0.01
  - For agricultural and veterinary science: approx value 0.04

Now, normalizing them:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2, // relative to agr. and vet. sci., it is 0.01/0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8 // relative 0.04/0.05
}
```

But again, these values reflect their relative likelihoods given Adam's profile; they are adjusted such that they sum to 1 only within this relative comparison.
