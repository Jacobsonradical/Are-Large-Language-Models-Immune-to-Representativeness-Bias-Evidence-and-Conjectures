To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis (i.e., each field) given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, we'll use Bayes' rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we are comparing two fields, the exact value of \( P(E) \) is not necessary; we can focus on the proportional relationship.

Here are the general perceptions of P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|\neg H) for each field based on the provided personality sketch:

### Business Administration
**P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
   - Let's assume a moderate prior for business administration relative to other fields available.
   - P(H) might be around \( 0.2 \).

**P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was in business administration.
   - Business administration requires analytical skills but may not be closely aligned with high empathy, love for animals, and genuine curiosity about nature compared to other fields.
   - P(E|H) might be relatively low, around \( 0.1 \).

**P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was not in business administration.
   - Considering there are many other fields that align more closely with Adam's traits, this would be relatively higher.
   - P(E|\neg H) might be around \( 0.3 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
**P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Let's assume a moderate prior considering fewer students might be in this field compared to broad categories like business administration.
   - P(H) might be around \( 0.1 \).

**P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - This field aligns very well with Adam's empathy, love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work.
   - P(E|H) might be relatively high, around \( 0.7 \).

**P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was not in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - There are other fields Adam could have been in, but they may align less perfectly with his traits.
   - P(E|\neg H) can be estimated around \( 0.2 \).

### Calculations
Using these values, we can compute the proportional probabilities.

#### Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02 \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.7 \times 0.1 = 0.07 \]

To compare these proportions relative to each other:
\[ P(H|E) \propto  \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.07} =  \frac{0.02}{0.09} \approx 0.222 \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto  \frac{0.07}{0.02 + 0.07} =  \frac{0.07}{0.09} \approx 0.778 \]

These relative percentages should add up to 1. Converting to approximate values:
