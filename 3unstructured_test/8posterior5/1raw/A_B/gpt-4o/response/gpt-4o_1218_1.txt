To solve this problem using Bayes' rule, we'll need to make some assumptions about the probabilities mentioned. Here's how we might do it:

1. **Prior Probability, P(H)**: The initial probability that Adam is enrolled in each field without knowing his personality sketch.
2. **Likelihood, P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in each field.
3. **Marginal Likelihood, P(E)**: The total probability of observing Adam's personality sketch across all fields.
4. **Complementary Likelihood, P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is not enrolled in the given field.
5. **Posterior Probability, P(H|E)**: The updated probability that Adam is enrolled in each field given his personality sketch.

For simplicity, let's assume the following:

- We'll take the priors P(H) to be equal for both fields, i.e., P(business administration) = 0.5 and P(agricultural and veterinary science) = 0.5.
- We need to estimate P(E|H) and P(E|¬H) based on the fit between Adam's personality and each field.

Given Adam's personality sketch, it seems more likely he fits agricultural and veterinary science due to his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy. These traits align better with this field than business administration.

Assumptions:
- P(E|business administration) = 0.1: Lower likelihood as his traits don't strongly suggest a fit for this field.
- P(E|agricultural and veterinary science) = 0.9: Higher likelihood given his traits align well with this field.
- P(E|¬business administration) and P(E|¬agricultural and veterinary science) need to be considered to compute the marginal likelihood, P(E).

Since there are many graduate fields not considered here, let's assume the complementary likelihoods are symmetrical but vary more for the sake of simplicity:
- P(E|¬business administration) = 0.6: There's a moderate chance his traits fit other fields too, not just agricultural and veterinary science.
- P(E|¬agricultural and veterinary science) = 0.2: There's a lower chance his traits fit fields other than agricultural and veterinary science.

Now we can apply Bayes' rule:

Bayes' rule: P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)

Marginal likelihood, P(E):
P(E) = P(E|business administration) * P(business administration) + P(E|agricultural and veterinary science) * P(agricultural and veterinary science)

P(E) = (0.1 * 0.5) + (0.9 * 0.5) = 0.05 + 0.45 = 0.5

Compute the posterior for each field:

1. **For business administration**:
P(business administration|E) = [P(E|business administration) * P(business administration)] / P(E)
P(business administration|E) = (0.1 * 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.05 / 0.5 = 0.1

2. **For agricultural and veterinary science**:
P(agricultural and veterinary science|E) = [P(E|agricultural and veterinary science) * P(agricultural and veterinary science)] / P(E)
P(agricultural and veterinary science|E) = (0.9 * 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.45 / 0.5 = 0.9

Putting these results together:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.9
}
```

This suggests it is very likely that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science based on his personality sketch.
