To apply Bayes' Rule, we need to evaluate three probabilities for each field of study:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in that field, representing the general proportion of graduate students in that field relative to all fields.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood that Adam exhibits the given characteristics if he is enrolled in that field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood that Adam exhibits the given characteristics if he is not enrolled in that field.

Based on these evaluations, we can calculate:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is constant for both hypotheses, it can be omitted when comparing relative probabilities. Hence, we will only compute the numerator:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \times P(H) \]

Now let's determine reasonable values for these probabilities: 

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- **P(H)**: Let's assume around 5% of graduate students might be in agricultural and veterinary sciences.
  - \( P(H) \approx 0.05 \)

- **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's characteristics (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, interest in hard work), it is highly likely he would fit into this field. Let's guess a high value.
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \)

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood that someone in any other field has these characteristics might be lower. Let's guess a moderate value.
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \)

### Business Administration:
- **P(H)**: Let's assume around 10% of graduate students are in business administration.
  - \( P(H) \approx 0.10 \)

- **P(E|H)**: Considering Adam's characteristics, it is less likely that he would be in this field. Let's guess a lower value.
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \)

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood that someone in any other field has these characteristics might be comparable or slightly higher.
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.25 \)

Using these values, we can compute the proportional relationship:

For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \times P(H) = 0.8 \times 0.05 = 0.04 \]

For **business administration**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \times P(H) = 0.1 \times 0.10 = 0.01 \]

Now, normalizing them by summing both values (0.04 + 0.01 = 0.05) and dividing each by this sum:

For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
\[ \frac{0.04}{0.05} = 0.8 \]

For **business administration**:
\[ \frac{0.01}{0.05} = 0.2 \]

Here are the final posterior probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
