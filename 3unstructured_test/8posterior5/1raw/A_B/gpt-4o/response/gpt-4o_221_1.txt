To evaluate the probabilities, we will use Bayes' rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's start with some reasonable assumptions for each field. 

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- **P(H):** The probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science without other information (prior probability). Let's assume that a moderate percentage of graduate students are in this field. We can estimate \( P(H) \) around 0.15.
- **P(E|H):** The probability of observing E (Adam's personality traits) given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy, this field fits well. Let's set \( P(E|H) \) high at 0.8.
- **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of observing E given that Adam is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Considering there are many other fields, we can estimate this as relatively low. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) \) to be 0.2.

Using these values, Bayes' rule gives us:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{P(E)} \]

### Business Administration:
- **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration. This field is quite common, so we can estimate \( P(H) \) around 0.25.
- **P(E|H):** The probability of observing E given that Adam is enrolled in business administration. Given Adam's traits, this is less likely but not impossible. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) as 0.1.
- **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of observing E given that Adam is not enrolled in business administration. Given the personality sketch, other fields are more likely to match. We can estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) to be 0.25.

Using these values, Bayes' rule gives us:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields and cancels out when comparing the results, we can simplify to a ratio comparison.

For quick calculations:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** 

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.15 = 0.12 \]

2. **Business Administration:** 

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.25 = 0.025 \]

Finally, normalizing these values:

\[ \text{Sum} = 0.12 + 0.025 = 0.145 \]

\[ \text{Normalized value for Agricultural and Veterinary Science} = \frac{0.12}{0.145} \approx 0.83 \]

\[ \text{Normalized value for Business Administration} = \frac{0.025}{0.145} \approx 0.17 \]

So, we get:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.83,
  "business administration": 0.17
}
