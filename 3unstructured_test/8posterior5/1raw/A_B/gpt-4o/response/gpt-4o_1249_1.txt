To apply Bayes' rule, we need to determine the probabilities involved. For each field, I will provide an estimated probability for the following:

- P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- P(E|H): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in that field.
- P(E|¬H): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in that field.

**Bayes' Rule:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where,
- \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \)

Given the nature of this problem, my estimations are subjective but based on logical assumptions.

**For "business administration":**
- P(H): Given that business administration is a fairly common field, I'll estimate \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
- P(E|H): The personality traits described (empathy, love for nature and animals, strong understanding and appreciation for hard work) do not strongly align with typical studies in business administration, so \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \).
- P(E|¬H): The traits seem unusual for a business administration student; thus, \( P(E|¬H) \approx 0.8 \).

**For "agricultural and veterinary science":**
- P(H): Since Adam's traits closely align with the interests and nature of agricultural and veterinary science students, I'll estimate \( P(H) = 0.05 \).
- P(E|H): The traits described are strongly suited for this field, so \( P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \).
- P(E|¬H): The traits are less likely for non-agricultural/veterinary science students; thus, \( P(E|¬H) \approx 0.2 \).

### Calculate P(H|E) Using Bayes' Rule:

For business administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.8 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.64 = 0.66 \]

Thus, \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.66} = \frac{0.02}{0.66} \approx 0.0303 \).

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.045 + 0.19 = 0.235 \]

Thus, \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.235} = \frac{0.045}{0.235} \approx 0.1915 \).
