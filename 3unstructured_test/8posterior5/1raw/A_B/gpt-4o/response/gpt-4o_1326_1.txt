Let's proceed by denoting:

- H_1 = hypothesis that Adam was in agricultural and veterinary science
- H_2 = hypothesis that Adam was in business administration
- E = personality sketch of Adam

We will evaluate:

- P(H_1) and P(H_2)
- P(E|H_1) and P(E|H_2)
- P(E|\neg H_1) and P(E|\neg H_2)
- P(H_1|E) and P(H_2|E) using Bayes' theorem: \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \)

1. **Assessing P(H_1) and P(H_2)**: Prior probabilities. Based on general perception and common enrollment data in the U.S. for graduate students:
   - P(H_1) (agricultural and veterinary science) ≈ 0.03
   - P(H_2) (business administration) ≈ 0.2

2. **Assessing P(E|H_1) and P(E|H_2)**: Likelihoods.
   - P(E|H_1): Adam fits perfectly into the field of agricultural and veterinary science given his genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals. Thus, P(E|H_1) ≈ 0.9
   - P(E|H_2): Business administration does not seem a natural fit for someone with Adam's profile. Hence, P(E|H_2) ≈ 0.1

3. **Assessing P(E|\neg H_1) and P(E|\neg H_2)**: These represent how likely personality sketch E is if Adam is not in these fields.
   - P(E|\neg H_1): Consider all fields excluding agricultural and veterinary science; still, E is relatively distinctively fitting for fields related to nature. Thus, P(E|\neg H_1) ≈ 0.2
   - P(E|\neg H_2): Considering all other fields except business administration, which include fields like biology, ecology, etc., P(E|\neg H_2) ≈ 0.5

4. **Computing P(H_1|E) and P(H_2|E)** using Bayes' theorem:
   - First, compute the evidence P(E): 
     \[
     P(E) = P(E|H_1)P(H_1) + P(E|\neg H_1)P(\neg H_1)
     \approx (0.9 * 0.03) + (0.2 * 0.97) 
     = 0.027 + 0.194
     = 0.221
     \]
   - Then compute P(H_1|E):
     \[
     P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1)P(H_1)}{P(E)} 
     = \frac{0.9 * 0.03}{0.221}
     \approx 0.122
     \]

   - For business administration:
     \[
     P(E) = P(E|H_2)P(H_2) + P(E|\neg H_2)P(\neg H_2)
     = (0.1 * 0.2) + (0.5 * 0.8)
     = 0.02 + 0.4
     = 0.42
     \]
   - Then compute P(H_2|E):
     \[
     P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2)P(H_2)}{P(E)}
     = \frac{0.1 * 0.2}{0.42}
     \approx 0.048
     \]

Therefore, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.122,
  "business administration": 0.048
}
```
