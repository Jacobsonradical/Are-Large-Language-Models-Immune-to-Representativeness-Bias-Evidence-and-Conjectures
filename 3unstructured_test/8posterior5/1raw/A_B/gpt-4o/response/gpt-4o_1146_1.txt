To calculate \( P(H|E) \), we will use Bayes' rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both hypotheses and we are interested in the relative probabilities, we can simplify our calculations and focus on \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

First, we need to estimate \( P(H) \) (the prior probability), \( P(E|H) \) (the likelihood), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) (the probability of E given not H) for each field:

1. **Business Administration:**
   - **\( P(H) \)** (prior probability of being enrolled in this field): This is generally high because business administration is a common graduate field.
     - Assume \( P(H) = 0.3 \)
   - **\( P(E|H) \)** (likelihood given hypothesis): Adam's personality sketch does not align strongly with typical traits desired in business, such as leadership ambition, interest in finance or management.
     - Assume \( P(E|H) = 0.05 \)
   - **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of having Adam's characteristics not being in business administration.
     - Assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.8 \)

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - **\( P(H) \)** (prior probability of being enrolled in this field): This is typically lower compared to business administration but still significant given his interests.
     - Assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \)
   - **\( P(E|H) \)** (likelihood given hypothesis): Adam's personality sketch matches well with this field, showing strong alignment with nature, animals, and hard work.
     - Assume \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \)
   - **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of having Adam's characteristics not being in agricultural and veterinary science.
     - Assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \)

Now, we calculate \( P(H|E) \):

1. For Business Administration:
   \[ P(H|E)_{BA} \approx P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.05 \cdot 0.3 = 0.015 \]

2. For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
   \[ P(H|E)_{AG_VET} \approx P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.09 \]

So, the computed probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.015,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.09
}
```
