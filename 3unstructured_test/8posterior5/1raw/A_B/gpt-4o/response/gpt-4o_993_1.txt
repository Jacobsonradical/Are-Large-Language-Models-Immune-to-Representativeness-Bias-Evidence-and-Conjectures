To solve this using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the following probabilities:
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given Adam is enrolled in that field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given Adam is not enrolled in that field.

Then, using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, we'll assume that there are many possible fields, so the prior \( P(H) \) is relatively low for any specific field. Let's make reasonable assumptions. Note that these values are subjective estimates based on the provided information.

### 1. Business Administration
- **P(H)**: Suppose the chance of any one specific field is equally likely, so we might assume \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.1 \).
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given business administration can be estimated as low because business administration isn't directly related to nature, plants, or animals, and typically doesn't require a strong appreciation for animals or nature. Let's say \( P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.1 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given not business administration might be higher because there are other fields more closely related to his interests. Suppose \( P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) = 0.3 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{\text{normalizing factor}} \]
\[ = \frac{0.01}{\text{normalizing factor}} \]

### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: Suppose the chance of any one specific field is equally likely, so we might assume \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.1 \).
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given agricultural and veterinary science can be estimated as high because it involves a strong understanding and appreciation for animals and nature. Let's say \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.7 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given not agricultural and veterinary science is lower because his interests align well with this field. Suppose \( P(E|\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.2 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{\text{normalizing factor}} \]
\[ = \frac{0.07}{\text{normalizing factor}} \]

Since \( P(E) \) remains constant over the two calculations, the normalizing factor ensures that the total probability across all hypotheses sums to 1. However, with only two fields to compare, we can directly compare their relative likelihoods.

### Relative Probabilities
For business administration:
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) \propto 0.01 \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \propto 0.07 \]

While we don't know the exact normalizing factor, the ratio of these two is what matters for the comparison.

Therefore, the results can be expressed as:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.01,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.07
}
```

These numbers indicate that Adam is much more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration.
