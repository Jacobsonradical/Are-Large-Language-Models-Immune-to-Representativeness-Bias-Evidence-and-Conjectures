To compute the probabilities, we first assess the values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \), and then apply Bayes' rule. Given no specific numerical values, we'll rely on reasonable qualitative judgments and the structures of probabilities within typical contexts.

1. **Business Administration**:

   - **\( P(H) \)**: The proportion of graduate students enrolled in business administration among all fields. Let's assume there's moderate interest in this field, say \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
   - **\( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood of Adam showing the described characteristics if he were in business administration. Given his profile, this seems less likely, say \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
   - **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The likelihood of Adam's characteristics if he were not in business administration. Given other fields, it is higher because other fields might more naturally align with his traits. Say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

   Using Bayes' rule:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
   \]

   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.32} = \frac{0.02}{0.34} \approx 0.059
   \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:

   - **\( P(H) \)**: The proportion of graduate students in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume a moderate interest, say \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
   - **\( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, this field seems highly likely. Assume \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).
   - **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The likelihood of Adam's characteristics if he were in another field. This likelihood might be lower, say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

   Using Bayes' rule:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
   \]

   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.7 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.07}{0.07 + 0.27} = \frac{0.07}{0.34} \approx 0.206
   \]

These calculations yield the following estimated probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.059,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.206
}
