To compute \( P(H|E) \), we will use Bayes' rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

However, since we are comparing just two fields, we can use a relative comparison which doesn't require calculating \( P(E) \). This allows us to focus on the ratio:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Let's consider the two fields in question: "agricultural and veterinary science" and "business administration."

### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **Prior (\( P(H) \))**: Graduate students in agricultural and veterinary science are a smaller subset compared to fields like business administration. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

- **Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \))**: Given his love for nature, plants, animals, and appreciation for hard work, these traits align very well with agricultural and veterinary science. We'll assign a high likelihood here. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).

- **Likelihood (\( P(E| \neg H) \))**: The probability that Adam's personality fits the profile but he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Given the number of other fields, this is lower, but not impossible. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

### 2. Business Administration

- **Prior (\( P(H) \))**: Graduate students in business administration are more common than those in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.3 \).

- **Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \))**: His warm heart, empathy, and love for animals do not strongly align with business administration. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).

- **Likelihood (\( P(E| \neg H) \))**: Given his personality, it is less likely for him to fit in business administration, so letâ€™s assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.8 \).

Using these assumptions, let's compute the relative posteriors:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.9 \times 0.1 = 0.09 \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \times 0.3 = 0.06 \]

After normalizing these values (as relative comparisons):

Given \(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.09}\) and \(\text{Business Administration: 0.06}\):

\[
P(H|E)_{\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}} = \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.06} \approx 0.6
\]
\[
P(H|E)_{\text{Business Administration}} = \frac{0.06}{0.09 + 0.06} \approx 0.4
\]

Thus, the computed values are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.4
}
```
These are approximate calculations based on the given assumptions about priors and likelihoods. Adjusting these assumptions would yield different results.
