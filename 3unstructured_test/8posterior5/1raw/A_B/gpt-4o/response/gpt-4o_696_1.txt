Let's denote the given sketch information as \( E \) and the hypotheses as follows:
- \( H_1 \): Hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( H_2 \): Hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in business administration.

To solve this using Bayes' Rule, we need to judge the probabilities mentioned and then calculate accordingly. Recall, Bayes' Rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We will do this step-by-step for each field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

#### Prior Probability \( P(H_1) \):
This is the initial probability of Adam being in agricultural and veterinary science. Given that it is a fairly specialized field, we might assign a moderate probability.
\[ P(H_1) = 0.15 \]

#### Likelihood \( P(E|H_1) \):
Given E, the nature-loving, empathy, animal-loving personality aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science. Thus,
\[ P(E|H_1) = 0.9 \]

#### \( P(E|\neg H_1) \):
This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he was not in agricultural and veterinary science. Given that love for nature and empathy might not be very common in fields distinctively separate from agriculture and veterinary science,
\[ P(E|\neg H_1) = 0.3 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(H_1|E) \):

\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E|\neg H_1) \cdot (1 - P(H_1))} \]

\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.15}{0.9 \cdot 0.15 + 0.3 \cdot 0.85} \]

\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.135}{0.135 + 0.255} \]

\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.135}{0.39} \]

\[ P(H_1|E) \approx 0.3462 \]

### Business Administration

#### Prior Probability \( P(H_2) \):
The prior probability of Adam being in business administration. Given the wide range of interests and practical nature of many students, we may assign a moderate but less likely for Adam specifically:
\[ P(H_2) = 0.2 \]

#### Likelihood \( P(E|H_2) \):
Given E, the personality described does not align perfectly with typical business administration (although there are outliers),
\[ P(E|H_2) = 0.2 \]

#### \( P(E|\neg H_2) \):
Generally, the traits described would be rare among those not in business administration. Aligning with those outside business, 
\[ P(E|\neg H_2) = 0.6 \]

Now we will calculate \( P(H_2|E) \):

\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) + P(E|\neg H_2) \cdot (1 - P(H_2))} \]

\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.2 \cdot 0.2 + 0.6 \cdot 0.8} \]

\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.48} \]

\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.52} \]

\[ P(H_2|E) \approx 0.0769 \]

Putting it all together:

  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3462,
