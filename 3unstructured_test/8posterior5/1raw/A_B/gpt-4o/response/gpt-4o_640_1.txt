To compute the probabilities, we need to apply Bayes' rule, which is stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \(P(E)\) is the same for both fields and we are only comparing the probabilities, we can omit \(P(E)\) and focus on the numerator. Here's the analysis:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): This is the prior probability that Adam, a graduate student in the U.S., is in the field of Business Administration. Let's assume \(P(H_{\text{business}}) = 0.25\) (This figure is arbitrary but reasonable based on the assumption that Business Administration is a common field).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam having the described personality sketch given he is enrolled in Business Administration. Given that Adam's personality shows a genuine curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, and a love for animals, such traits are less characteristic of business students. So, assume \(P(E|H_{\text{business}}) = 0.1\).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam having the described personality sketch given he is not enrolled in Business Administration. Since there are many other fields with varying degrees of fit for this personality, for simplicity, let's assume \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}}) = 0.5\).

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): This is the prior probability that Adam, a graduate student in the U.S., is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Let's assume \(P(H_{\text{agricultural}}) = 0.05\) (This figure is lower because Agriculture and Veterinary Science is a more specialized field).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam having the described personality sketch given he is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given his curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and love for animals, Adamâ€™s personality traits fit well with this field. So, assume \(P(E|H_{\text{agricultural}}) = 0.8\).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam having the described personality sketch given he is not enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. For simplicity, let's again assume \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural}}) = 0.5\).

Now let's compute the posterior probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for each field:

1. **Business Administration**:
   \[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}})}{P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{business}})} \]
   \[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.5 \cdot 0.75} \]
   \[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{0.025}{0.025 + 0.375} = \frac{0.025}{0.4} = 0.0625 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[ P(H_{\text{agricultural}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agricultural}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural}})}{P(E|H_{\text{agricultural}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{agricultural}})} \]
   \[ P(H_{\text{agricultural}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.5 \cdot 0.95} \]
   \[ P(H_{\text{agricultural}}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.475} = \frac{0.04}{0.515} \approx 0.0777 \]

Based on the calculations, here are the posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0625,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.0777
}
