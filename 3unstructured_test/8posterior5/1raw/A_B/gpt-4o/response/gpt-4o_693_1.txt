Let's break down the probabilities first:

1. **Business Administration (H1)**
   - **P(H1)**: The prior probability that a graduate student is in business administration. Let's assume the proportion of graduate students in business administration is roughly average. Therefore, we'll estimate P(H1) = 0.15.
   - **P(E|H1)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in business administration. Considering Adam's traits (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals), these do not particularly align well with typical traits of business administration students. P(E|H1) might be low. Therefore, P(E|H1) = 0.05.
   - **P(E|\neg H1)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in business administration. Inverse logic applies here. Since his traits align poorly with business administration, P(E|\neg H1), given the diverse pool of non-business disciplines, might be relatively higher. We'll suppose P(E|\neg H1) = 0.3.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H2)**
   - **P(H2)**: The prior probability that a graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. Assuming this field's popularity is lower than business but still considerable, we might estimate P(H2) = 0.05.
   - **P(E|H2)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science. Adam's traits, particularly his love for nature, plants, animals, and empathy, align very well with this field. P(E|H2) is likely high. We choose P(E|H2) = 0.7.
   - **P(E|\neg H2)**: Similarly to the previous case, considering our assumptions about non-disciplinary traits diversifying away from the perfect alignment, P(E|\neg H2) might be set at a lower value considering the diverse nature of other graduate fields. We can assume P(E|\neg H2) = 0.15.

Next, we use Bayes' Rule to compute P(H|E):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For **Business Administration**:
- P(E) = (0.05 * 0.15) + (0.3 * 0.85) = 0.0075 + 0.255 = 0.2625
- P(H1|E) = (0.05 * 0.15) / 0.2625 = 0.0075 / 0.2625 ≈ 0.0286

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
- P(E) = (0.7 * 0.05) + (0.15 * 0.95) = 0.035 + 0.1425 = 0.1775
- P(H2|E) = (0.7 * 0.05) / 0.1775 = 0.035 / 0.1775 ≈ 0.1972

Thus, the results leveraging the provided information are:

{
  "business administration": 0.0286,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.1972
}
