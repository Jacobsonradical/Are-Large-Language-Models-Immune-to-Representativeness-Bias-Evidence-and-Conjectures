To estimate the probabilities, we first need to understand how well the described personality sketch fits each field (i.e., the likelihood \( P(E|H) \)) and the base rates for each field (i.e., the prior \( P(H) \)). No exact data is given, so we'll need to rely on reasonable assumptions.

Let’s break down the reasoning step by step.

1. **Prior Probability (\( P(H) \))**:
   - **Business Administration**: This is a popular field among graduate students. We could assume a higher prior probability, say 0.3.
   - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This is a more specialized field, likely to have fewer students. Let's assume a lower prior probability, say 0.1.

2. **Probability of Personality Sketch Given Field (\( P(E|H) \))**:
   - **Business Administration**: The described personality sketch does not strongly align with typical business administration traits. So, let's assume a lower likelihood, say 0.2.
   - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The personality sketch is highly compatible with this field, given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals. Thus, let’s assign a higher likelihood, say 0.9.

3. **Probability of Personality Sketch Given Not in Field (\( P(E|\neg H) \))**:
   - **Business Administration**: Students in fields other than business administration might also have these traits. Since we have many other fields, let’s assume a moderate probability, say 0.7.
   - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Other fields might have a lower chance of matching the described personality sketch as closely as agricultural and veterinary science, let’s say 0.4.

Now we can compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) \) is the normalizing constant.

Since \( P(E) \) is difficult to determine without concrete data, we can use relative comparisons. It turns out we will just compare the numerators to get a sense of relative likelihoods:

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{\left( 0.2 \cdot 0.3 \right) + \left( 0.9 \cdot 0.1 \right)} = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.09} = \frac{0.06}{0.15} = 0.4 \]

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{\left( 0.2 \cdot 0.3 \right) + \left( 0.9 \cdot 0.1 \right)} = \frac{0.09}{0.06 + 0.09} = \frac{0.09}{0.15} = 0.6 \]

So the results are:

{
  "business administration": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
