To solve this, we'll need to assess the following probabilities to use Bayes' rule:

- P(H): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the field.
- P(E|H): The probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is in that field.
- P(E|\neg H): The probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is not in that field.
- P(H|E): The posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in the field given the evidence.

Using Bayes' rule: \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \)
Since \( P(E) \) is constant for each field, we'll compare relative probabilities.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - P(H): Let's say the prior probability of a student being in this field is relatively low, say 0.1.
   - P(E|H): Given Adam's love for animals, nature, and the characteristics described, this field seems very fitting. Let's estimate it as 0.9.
   - P(E|\neg H): Given the specificity of these traits, it would be less likely for a randomly chosen student. So let's say 0.3.
   
   Using Bayes' rule (without normalizing by P(E)):
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.9 \times 0.1}{P(E)} = 0.09 / P(E)
   \]
   
2. **Business Administration**
   - P(H): The prior probability of a student being in this more common field might be higher, say 0.2.
   - P(E|H): Given Adamâ€™s personality, it seems less fitting. Let's estimate this as 0.2.
   - P(E|\neg H): Same reasoning, so 0.3.
   
   Using Bayes' rule (without normalizing by P(E)):
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.2 \times 0.2}{P(E)} = 0.04 / P(E)
   \]

Putting these into a comparable context:

\[
{
  \text{"agricultural and veterinary science"}: \frac{0.09}{P(E)}, \\
  \text{"business administration"}: \frac{0.04}{P(E)}
}
\]

Since we're only comparing relative probabilities, we can ignore \( P(E) \) and use the raw products of \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(H) \).

Therefore, the approximate values might be:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.09,
  "business administration": 0.04
}
```

This implies it's more likely that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science compared to Business Administration based on the given evidence and assumptions.
