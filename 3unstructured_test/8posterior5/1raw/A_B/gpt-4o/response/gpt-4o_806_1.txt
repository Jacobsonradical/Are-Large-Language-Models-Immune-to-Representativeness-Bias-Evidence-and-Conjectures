To evaluate the likelihood that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, to simplify, we're interested in the relative probabilities of the two fields. We need to consider the following probabilities:
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability of Adam being in each field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in each field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is *not* in each field.

Let’s estimate these probabilities:

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is in business administration. Given that business administration is a common field, we might estimate a moderate prior:
  \[ P(H) = 0.1 \]
- **P(E|H)**: Probability that Adam's personality sketch fits someone in business administration. Given Adam’s personality (curiosity about nature, love for animals, appreciation for hard work), it seems less likely:
  \[ P(E|H) = 0.02 \]
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability that Adam's personality sketch fits someone not in business administration. Since Adam’s characteristics are more in line with other fields, particularly nature-related ones, we can consider this probability higher:
  \[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.15 \]

Using Bayes' rule, the relative probability \( P(H|E) \) can be computed as:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam’s interests and personality, it seems more plausible:
  \[ P(H) = 0.05 \]
- **P(E|H)**: Probability that Adam's personality sketch fits someone in this field. Given his genuine curiosity about nature and love for animals, this probability is quite high:
  \[ P(E|H) = 0.8 \]
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability that Adam's personality sketch fits someone not in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his match with characteristics of this field, this probability seems lower:
  \[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \]

Using Bayes' rule, the relative probability \( P(H|E) \) can be computed as:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

### Relative Probabilities
For illustrative purposes, we do not need to normalize them, but the findings are:

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) \propto 0.02 \times 0.1 = 0.002 \]
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.05 = 0.04 \]

Thus, comparing these values gives us an indication of the relative probabilities.

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.002,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.04
}
```

These relative values suggest that Adam is far more likely to have been enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration, given his personality sketch.
