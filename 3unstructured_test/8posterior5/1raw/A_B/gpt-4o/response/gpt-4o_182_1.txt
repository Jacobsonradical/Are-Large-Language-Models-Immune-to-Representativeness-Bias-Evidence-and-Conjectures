Sure, let's apply Bayes' Rule to compute the probabilities.

Bayes' Rule is defined as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in a field given the personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was in a particular field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was in a particular field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch, which can be expanded as:
  \[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's proceed with each field:

### Business Administration

- \( P(H) \) (Prior): The base rate probability of a graduate student being enrolled in Business Administration. Given the vast number of business graduates, let's assume this probability is relatively high, say 0.2.

- \( P(E|H) \) (Likelihood): The probability of having Adam's personality sketch given he is in Business Administration. Given the personality traits leaning towards nature, puzzles, animals, and empathy, these traits don't particularly align strongly with typical characteristics associated with Business Administration. Let's assume this probability is low, say 0.1.

- \( P(E|\neg H) \) (Likelihood under the alternative): The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in Business Administration. Given the sketch, he is likely in a field related to curiosity, nature, and animals. So, let's assume this probability is moderately high, say 0.3.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- \( P(H) \) (Prior): The base rate probability of a graduate student being enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. This field is less common than Business Administration. Let's assume a lower prior probability, say 0.05.

- \( P(E|H) \) (Likelihood): The probability of having Adam's personality sketch given he is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. The traits mentioned fit well with this field. Hence, we can assume this probability is high, say 0.7.

- \( P(E|\neg H) \) (Likelihood under the alternative): Similar to above, the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given the specificity of the traits, this probability is moderate, say 0.2.

Now let's calculate \( P(H|E) \):

### For Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Assume \( P(\neg H) \approx 0.8 \):

Equation:
\[ P(E) \approx (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) = 0.02 + 0.24 = 0.26 \]

Substitute \( P(E) \):
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.26} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.26} \approx 0.077 \]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assume \( P(\neg H) \approx 0.95 \):

Equation:
\[ P(E) \approx (0.7 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95) = 0.035 + 0.19 = 0.225 \]

Substitute \( P(E) \):
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{0.225} \approx \frac{0.035}{0.225} \approx 0.156 \]

Thus, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.077,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.156
}
```
These values express that, given the personality sketch, Adam is more likely to have been enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science than in Business Administration.
