To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field (H) given Adam's personality sketch (E), we'll use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in that field.

Since we need to estimate these probabilities, we'll make some reasonable assumptions:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - \( P(H) \): It's reasonable to think that a smaller percentage of graduate students are in this field. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).
    - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, it is highly likely he is in this field. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality in fields other than agricultural and veterinary science could be lower. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

2. **Business Administration**:
    - \( P(H) \): A larger percentage of graduate students might be in this field. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
    - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's personality, it is less likely that he is in this field. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.05 \).
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality in fields other than business administration could be higher. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Considering these assumptions, we compute:

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.7 \cdot 0.05 + 0.1 \cdot 0.95 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.035 + 0.095 = 0.13 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{0.13} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.035}{0.13} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.269 \]

### For Business Administration:
\[ P(E) = 0.05 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.01 + 0.24 = 0.25 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.2}{0.25} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.25} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.04 \]

Here are the results in the requested format:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.269,
  "business administration": 0.04
}
```

Please note these values are rough estimates based on the assumptions made above, and they could vary with different assumptions about the prior probabilities and likelihoods.
