In order to compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to apply the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we are comparing two hypotheses, it is more practical to compute the relative likelihoods of each scenario.

Let's start by making reasonable estimations based on the given personality sketch of Adam.

1. **Hypothesis H: Adam was enrolled in business administration**
   
   - \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. This is generally low because we want to account for all graduate fields. We'll estimate this as:
     \[
     P(H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.1
     \]

   - \(P(E|H)\): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given he is enrolled in business administration. Given his traits (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals), this likelihood is relatively low.
     \[
     P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.2
     \]

   - \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits in fields other than business administration. Given the wide variety of fields and the specific nature traits, this is higher.
     \[
     P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.8
     \]

2. **Hypothesis H: Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science**
   
   - \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Considering his traits, this is notably higher.
     \[
     P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) \approx 0.05
     \]

   - \(P(E|H)\): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. His traits strongly correlate with this field.
     \[
     P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \approx 0.9
     \]

   - \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits in fields other than agricultural and veterinary science. Considering his specific interests in nature and animals, this is lower than for business administration.
     \[
     P(E|\neg H_{\text{AgVet}}) \approx 0.4
     \]

Compute \( P(H|E) \):

1. **For business administration:**

   \[
   P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{BA}})}
   \]

   \[
   P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.8 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.72} = \frac{0.02}{0.74} \approx 0.027
   \]

2. **For agricultural and veterinary science:**

   \[
   P(H_{\text{AgVet}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AgVet}})}{P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{AgVet}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{AgVet}})}
   \]

   \[
   P(H_{\text{AgVet}}|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.9 \cdot 0.05 + 0.4 \cdot (1 - 0.05)} = \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.4 \cdot 0.95} = \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.38} = \frac{0.045}{0.425} \approx 0.106
   \]

So, the probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": 0.027,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.106
}
