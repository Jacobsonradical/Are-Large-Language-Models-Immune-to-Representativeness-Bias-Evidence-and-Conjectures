To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' theorem, we need to use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis H.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing E given H.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing E given not H.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing E.

Let's make a simplified set of assumptions for each field based on the personality sketch of Adam. 

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- **P(H)**: The probability that a graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, hypothetically let's assume it is 0.1 (10%) based on an average university population distribution.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing E given that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's love for nature, plants, animals, and his empathy, this field seems very fitting. Let's assume it is 0.8 (80%).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing E given that Adam is in a different field. Given the general alignment of Adam's traits to nature-related fields, but accounting for the broad range of other fields he could be in. Let's assume it is 0.2 (20%).

### For Business Administration:
- **P(H)**: The probability that a graduate student is enrolled in business administration, let's assume it is 0.1 (10%) as well.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing E given that Adam is in business administration. Business administration does not seem to align closely with Adamâ€™s deep love for animals, nature, and solving puzzles related to those areas. Let's assume it is 0.2 (20%).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing E given that Adam is in a different field. Given the specific traits, this would be more frequent in other fields than business administration. Let's assume it is 0.3 (30%).

To simplify the weight of overall P(E), we will limit our calculation of \( P(H|E) \) to the comparisons between Agricultural and Veterinary Science and Business Administration.

To calculate P(E):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)\times P(H) + P(E|\neg H)\times P(\neg H) \]
Since H and \neg H (not H) are binary for simplicity:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times (1 - P(H)) \]

**For Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \times 0.1 + 0.2 \times 0.9 = 0.08 + 0.18 = 0.26 \]

**For Business Administration**:
\[ P(E) = 0.2 \times 0.1 + 0.3 \times 0.9 = 0.02 + 0.27 = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \):

**For Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.26} \approx 0.308 \]

**For Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{0.29} \approx 0.069 \]

So, the approximate posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.308,
  "business administration": 0.069
}
```

These probability values represent the likelihood that Adam is enrolled in the given field given his personality sketch.
