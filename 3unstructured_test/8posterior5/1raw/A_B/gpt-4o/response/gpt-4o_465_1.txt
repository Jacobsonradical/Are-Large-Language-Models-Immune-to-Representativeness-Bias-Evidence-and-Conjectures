In order to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in each field, given his personality sketch \( E \), we need to use Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's break down the calculations for both fields: business administration and agricultural and veterinary science.

1. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): Prior probability that a given graduate student is in business administration.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood that a student in business administration matches the personality sketch \( E \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likelihood that a student not in business administration matches the personality sketch \( E \).

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Prior probability that a given graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood that a student in agricultural and veterinary science matches the personality sketch \( E \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likelihood that a student not in agricultural and veterinary science matches the personality sketch \( E \).

Assuming the following rough estimates (as exact probabilities are not given):

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \): Business administration is a common field.
- \( P(E|H) \approx 0.05 \): Personality traits like a deep love for animals and strong empathy are not commonly associated with business administration.
- \( P(E|\neg H) = \frac{P(E) - P(E|H)P(H)}{1 - P(H)} \): This is a calculation that requires an estimate of \( P(E) \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \): Less common field compared to business administration but plausible.
- \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \): Given traits such as love for animals and nature, and high understanding and appreciation for hard work.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) can be estimated similarly to above but is expected to be lower than \( P(E|H) \) for this field.

For simplicity, letâ€™s estimate \( P(E) \approx 0.3 \). Given the general nature of the traits, it's somewhat plausible but not extremely common.

Now, applying these estimates:

### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.05 \times 0.2}{0.3} \approx \frac{0.01}{0.3} \approx 0.033 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.3} \approx \frac{0.08}{0.3} \approx 0.267 \]

Therefore, based on the aforementioned estimates and calculations:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.033,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.267
}
```

These should be taken as illustrative estimates to demonstrate the use of Bayes' rule. The actual probabilities would require more precise priors and likelihoods.
