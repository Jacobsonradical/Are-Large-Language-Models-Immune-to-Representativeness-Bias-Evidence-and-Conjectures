To estimate the probabilities, we will use Bayes' theorem, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the evidence.

Given that \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant and since we are only interested in comparing the relative probabilities, we can focus on the numerators and treat \( P(E) \) as a constant.

Let's break down the hypotheses and the corresponding probabilities:

### Business Administration
1. **P(H\_business):** The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in Business Administration. Given the statistical spread of disciplines among graduate students, let’s estimate it as 10-15%.
2. **P(E|H\_business):** The probability of observing Adam's characteristics given that he is a graduate student in Business Administration. This would generally be low, as business students may less frequently display high curiosity about nature, strong empathy towards animals, and interest in solving puzzles. Let's estimate this at 0.1.
3. **P(E|\neg H\_business):** The probability of observing Adam's characteristics given that he is not a graduate student in Business Administration. This would be higher since students of other disciplines are more likely to exhibit these traits. Let's estimate this at 0.5.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H\_agriculture):** The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. This likelihood is smaller but still reasonable, say around 2-5%.
2. **P(E|H\_agriculture):** The probability of observing Adam's characteristics given that he is a graduate student in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. This is very high due to the direct alignment of his traits with this field. Let's estimate this at 0.9.
3. **P(E|\neg H\_agriculture):** The probability of observing Adam's characteristics given that he is not a graduate student in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. This might be considerably lower. Let's estimate this at 0.3.

### Calculation
Given that we only need to compare the relative probabilities, let’s simplify the Bayes' rule application:

For Business Administration:

\[ P(H|E)_\text{business} \propto P(E|H)_\text{business} \cdot P(H)_\text{business} \]
\[ P(H|E)_\text{business} \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.125 \]
\[ P(H|E)_\text{business} \propto 0.0125 \]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[ P(H|E)_\text{agriculture} \propto P(E|H)_\text{agriculture} \cdot P(H)_\text{agriculture} \]
\[ P(H|E)_\text{agriculture} \propto 0.9 \cdot 0.035 \]
\[ P(H|E)_\text{agriculture} \propto 0.0315 \]

### Relative Probabilities
Normalization is unnecessary here since we only need comparative values. Clearly, the relative likelihood of Adam being in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is higher compared to Business Administration, given his personality sketch.

Here are the results:
