To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in various fields, we use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

It's important to evaluate:

1. \( P(H) \): Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in each field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not enrolled in each field.

We then use these to compute:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

For simplicity, let's assume that \( P(E) \) normalizes our probabilities correctly.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **\( P(H) \)**: Suppose we fairly believe there's a 0.1 probability that a random student is in agricultural and veterinary science.
2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's interests and personality traits (love for nature, empathy, high intelligence) strongly align with this field. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: For a student not in this field, Adam's personality sketch is less typical. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.18} = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \approx 0.308 \]

### Business Administration

1. **\( P(H) \)**: Suppose we estimate a 0.2 probability that a random student is in business administration.
2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: Business students are less likely to have strong interests in nature and animals; hence, let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).
3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: For a student not in business administration, Adam's traits might be somewhat likely but not highly. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.2 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.32} = \frac{0.04}{0.36} \approx 0.111 \]

Putting this into the required format:

  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.308,
  "business administration": 0.111
