To compute the probabilities, we'll use Bayes' rule, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since \(P(E)\) is the same for all fields and non-fields, we only need to compare the numerator, i.e., \( P(E|H) \times P(H) \).

We'll denote:
- \(P(H) = P\) for the prior probability of being enrolled in the field.
- \(P(E|H)\) for the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\) for the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis is false (not in that field).

Here's the reasoning for each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability, \(P\), of someone being enrolled in this field is more common than some other fields but not the most popular, letâ€™s assume a moderate value. 
2. **P(E|H)**: Adam's love for nature, plants, animals, and his empathy strongly align with Agricultural and Veterinary Science, so this should be high.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Given his personality, it's less likely but not impossible that these traits would align with many other fields.

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability, \(P\), of someone being enrolled in this field is relatively high, as Business Administration is a popular field.
2. **P(E|H)**: His personality traits don't seem to align particularly well with Business Administration. His interest in nature, plants, and animals, and his empathy may not be as strongly related to business.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: There are many students not in Business Administration who might share these traits, so this likelihood might be moderate.

Let's assign some hypothetical values based on the above reasoning:
- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
  - \(P(H)\) = 0.1
  - \(P(E|H)\) = 0.9
  - \(P(E|\neg H)\) = 0.2

- For Business Administration:
  - \(P(H)\) = 0.3
  - \(P(E|H)\) = 0.2
  - \(P(E|\neg H)\) = 0.7

So for each field:

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \times 0.3}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) will be the same for all fields, we compare the numerators:

- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \(0.9 \times 0.1 = 0.09\)
- Business Administration: \(0.2 \times 0.3 = 0.06\)

Now we'll normalize these so the total is 1:

Sum = 0.09 + 0.06 = 0.15

Normalized probabilities:
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \(0.09 / 0.15 = 0.6\)
- Business Administration: \(0.06 / 0.15 = 0.4\)

Therefore, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.4
}
```
