To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need the following elements:

1. **Prior probability \( P(H) \)**: The initial probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field without considering his personality traits.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing Adam’s personality traits given that he is enrolled in a particular field.
3. **Anti-Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of observing Adam’s personality traits given that he is not enrolled in that particular field.

Bayes' Rule formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be calculated as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Since we are comparing two fields and to simplify, we only need relative values, and we can ignore \( P(E) \) as a normalizing constant because it will be the same for both fields.

### Assumptions:
1. **Priors \( P(H) \)**: Without specific statistics, we can assume general popularity or likeliness. Let's assume equal priors for simplicity.
2. **P(E|H)** and **P(E|\neg H)** Based on personality fit:
   - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Higher probability given Adam’s traits of empathy, a love for animals, and appreciation for nature.
   - Business Administration: Lower probability given that it is not explicitly related to Adam’s traits.

#### Numerical Considerations:
Let's assign the probabilities with the following assumptions:

- \( P(H) \): Equal for both fields, let's assume \( 0.5 \).
- \( P(E|H) \) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Given Adam's traits, let's assign a high likelihood \( 0.9 \).
- \( P(E|H) \) for Business Administration: Given not a direct fit to traits, let's assign a lower likelihood \( 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given that \( \neg H \) is a general non-specific field, let's split it with some considerations.

### Bayesian Updates:
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
    - \( P(H) = 0.5 \)
    - \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \)
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Assign low for agri/vet-specific \( 0.2 \).

2. **Business Administration**
    - \( P(H) = 0.5 \)
    - \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \)
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Assign moderate \( 0.7 \).

### Calculations:
We only need a comparative probability:

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.9 \cdot 0.5 = 0.45 \]

#### Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \cdot 0.5 = 0.1 \]

### Relative Conversion:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.45, 
  "business administration": 0.1
}

Since these are relative probabilities directly, they might not necessarily need summing to 1.

### Final Answer:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.45,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
