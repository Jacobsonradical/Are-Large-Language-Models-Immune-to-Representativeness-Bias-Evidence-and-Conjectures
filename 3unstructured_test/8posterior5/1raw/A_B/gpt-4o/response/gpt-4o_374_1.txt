To solve this task, we need to use Bayes' rule, which is expressed as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \(P(E)\) is the same for both fields, we will focus primarily on \(P(E|H) \cdot P(H)\) for comparison purposes.

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability P(H)**: The likelihood that any given graduate student is in business administration. This is fairly high given that business administration programs are common.
   - Let's assign \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.2 \) (hypothetical value; could be less given Adam’s traits).

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H_{BA})\)**: The likelihood that someone with Adam’s personality traits would be enrolled in business administration. This is relatively low because business administration students typically do not focus on nature, plants, animals, or solving puzzles.
   - Let's say \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.1 \).

3. **Complementary likelihood \(P(E|\neg H_{BA})\)**: The likelihood of finding someone with Adam’s personality traits in a field other than business administration. Considering Adam’s traits, this is relatively high, as many other fields fit better.
   - Let's say \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.9 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability P(H)**: The likelihood that any given graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. This is relatively lower than business administration in the general population of graduate students.
   - Let's assign \(P(H_{Ag}) = 0.05\) (hypothetical value).

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H_{Ag})\)**: The likelihood that someone with Adam’s personality traits would be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This is very high because these traits align well with the study of nature, plants, animals, and empathy.
   - Let’s say \( P(E|H_{Ag}) = 0.8 \).

3. **Complementary likelihood \(P(E|\neg H_{Ag})\)**: This is the likelihood of finding someone with Adam’s personality traits in fields other than agricultural and veterinary science. This is lower compared to agricultural and veterinary science since Adam's traits align closely with that field.
   - Let’s say \( P(E|\neg H_{Ag}) = 0.4 \).

Now we apply Bayes' Rule for both fields:

### Business Administration

\[ 
P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{P(E)}
\]
(Note: \(P(E)\) is the sum of the probabilities of \(H_{BA}\) and its complement.)

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

\[ 
P(H_{Ag}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{Ag}) \cdot P(H_{Ag})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{P(E)}
\]

We need the ratio between the two posteriors:

\[ 
\frac{P(H_{BA}|E)}{P(H_{Ag}|E)} \approx \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.8 \times 0.05} = \frac{0.02}{0.04} = 0.5.
\]

This implies \(P(H_{Ag}|E)\) is twice as likely as \(P(H_{BA}|E)\).

Hence, for illustrative purposes, we propose:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4
}
```

(Please note that the above values are based on hypothetical probability assignments and may vary with real data.)
