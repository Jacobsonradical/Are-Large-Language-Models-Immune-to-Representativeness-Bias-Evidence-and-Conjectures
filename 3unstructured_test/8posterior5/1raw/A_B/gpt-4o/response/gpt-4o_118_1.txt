Let's use Bayes' theorem, which states: 

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here’s how we might estimate the relevant probabilities step-by-step for each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability (P(H))**:
   - This is the probability that Adam, as a graduate student in the U.S., is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Assume a rough prior based on general statistics of graduate fields. Given that this is a specialized field, we assign a hypothetical value of 0.05.

2. **Likelihood (P(E|H))**:
   - This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Given Adam’s genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and understanding of dedication, it is highly likely that these traits align with this field. Thus, assign a value of 0.80.

3. **Complement Likelihood (P(E|¬H))**:
   - This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Adam’s traits could somewhat align with other fields too, but to a lesser extent. Assign a value of 0.30.

4. **Normalization Constant (P(E))**:
   - This is calculated based on the total probability of observing E across all possible hypotheses. For simplification, consider the types of fields discussed.
   - Use a rough estimate: \(P(E) \approx P(E|H)*P(H) + P(E|¬H)*(1-P(H))\)
   - Substitution: \(P(E) \approx (0.80 * 0.05) + (0.30 * 0.95) \approx 0.295\)

5. **Posterior Probability (P(H|E))**:
   - Apply Bayes’ theorem: \(P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.80 * 0.05}{0.295} \approx 0.1356\)

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability (P(H))**:
   - This is the probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration.
   - Assume a higher chance for a general field among graduate students, so assign a hypothetical value of 0.20.

2. **Likelihood (P(E|H))**:
   - This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is enrolled in business administration.
   - His traits are less likely to align directly with business administration. Assign a value of 0.20.

3. **Complement Likelihood (P(E|¬H))**:
   - This is the probability of observing Adam's traits if he is not in business administration.
   - Given above values, assign the complement based on remaining likelihoods. Assign a value of 0.35.

4. **Normalization Constant (P(E))**:
   - Again as mentioned above for normalization.
   - Use: \(P(E) \approx P(E|H)*P(H) + P(E|¬H)*(1-P(H))\)
   - Substitution: \(P(E) \approx (0.20 * 0.20) + (0.35 * 0.80) \approx 0.30\)

5. **Posterior Probability (P(H|E))**:
   - Apply Bayes’ theorem: \(P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.20 * 0.20}{0.30} \approx 0.1333\)

### Final Posterior Probabilities

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.1356,
  "business administration": 0.1333
}

These calculated values provide an estimate of the probability that Adam is enrolled in each field given his personality traits.
