Let's start by analyzing the probabilities. 

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** This probability indicates how likely it is, in general, for a graduate student to be enrolled in this field. Given that Adam has a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, it is reasonably plausible. However, not all graduate students choose this field, so let’s assume a moderate prior probability. 
   - Let P(H) = 0.1 

2. **P(E|H) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** This is the probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given Adam's strong interest in nature, animals, and a high understanding of abstract concepts, it is highly likely he would fit well in this field. 
   - Let P(E|H) = 0.9

3. **P(E|¬H) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** This is the probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam is not enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Let’s assume the likelihood of finding someone with this exact personality sketch outside this field is lower but not negligible. 
   - Let P(E|¬H) = 0.2

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} 
\]

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{0.9 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9} 
\]

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.18} = \frac{0.09}{0.27} \approx 0.333 
\]

### Business Administration

1. **P(H) for Business Administration:** This probability indicates how likely it is, in general, for a graduate student to be enrolled in this field. Given Adam's interest and personality sketch, this is less likely than Agricultural and Veterinary Science, but it is still a common field. Let's assume a moderate prior probability.
   - Let P(H) = 0.1 

2. **P(E|H) for Business Administration:** This is the probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration. Adam's personality traits do not strongly correlate with typical characteristics sought in Business Administration, but they are not entirely unlikely either. 
   - Let P(E|H) = 0.3

3. **P(E|¬H) for Business Administration:** This is the probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam is not enrolled in Business Administration. Since traits like empathy, love for animals, curiosity about nature, etc., might be less common in Business Administration, this could be slightly higher. 
   - Let P(E|¬H) = 0.4

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} 
\]

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.3 \cdot 0.1 + 0.4 \cdot 0.9} 
\]

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.36} = \frac{0.03}{0.39} \approx 0.077 
\]
