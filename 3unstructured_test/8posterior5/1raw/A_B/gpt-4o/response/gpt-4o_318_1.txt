To calculate the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch, we need to apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( H \) is the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in a particular field, and \( E \) is the personality sketch of Adam. We'll need to estimate the following probabilities for each field:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing the personality sketch (this can be simplified in a ratio form for comparing different hypotheses).

We will assume certain reasonable values based on the personality sketch:

1. **Agricultural and veterinary science**:
   - \( P(H) \): The probability that any given graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume this is relatively low compared to other fields. E.g., 0.05.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The probability of having the given personality sketch if Adam is an agricultural and veterinary science student. This seems high given his genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. E.g., 0.8.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of having the given personality sketch if Adam is not an agricultural and veterinary science student. This would generally be lower. E.g., 0.1.

2. **Business administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): The probability that any given graduate student is in business administration. This is relatively higher compared to agricultural and veterinary science. E.g., 0.20.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The probability of having the given personality sketch if Adam is a business administration student. This seems lower given his traits that align more with nature and empathy. E.g., 0.2.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of having the given personality sketch if Adam is not a business administration student. This would be slightly higher than for agricultural and veterinary science as it includes a larger pool of fields. E.g., 0.15.

For simplicity in comparing hypotheses, we assume \( P(E) \) normalizes \( P(H|E) \).

Using Bayes' rule:

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} \]

For business administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

Given \( P(E) \) will normalize these results:
\[ \text{Normalized } P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural}} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.2} = \frac{0.04}{0.08} = 0.5 \]
\[ \text{Normalized } P(H|E)_{\text{business}} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.2} = \frac{0.04}{0.08} = 0.5 \]

Although the above calculations yielded equal probabilities, the initial assumption values may be too similar; adjusting \( P(E|\neg H) \) might yield more variation. However, given the simplified values:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.5
}
```

These values reflect the normalized probabilities given our initial assumptions. Adjustments could refine this analysis.
