To apply Bayes' rule to calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to carefully estimate the probabilities involved. Let's consider:

- \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the specified field.
- \(P(E|H)\): The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is enrolled in the specified field.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is not enrolled in the specified field.
- \(P(E)\): The overall probability of observing the personality sketch, which can be computed as a weighted average of \(P(E|H)\) and \(P(E|\neg H)\).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is common across all fields, we only need to compute the numerator for each hypothesis and compare them relatively.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \(P(H)\): This field is not the most common graduate field, but given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, it seems more likely than average.
  - Estimate: 0.1
- \(P(E|H)\): Adam's characteristics align very well with someone in this field.
  - Estimate: 0.8
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of having these traits if not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science may be lower.
  - Estimate: 0.2

### Business Administration
- \(P(H)\): This field is very common and has a higher base rate among graduate students.
  - Estimate: 0.2
- \(P(E|H)\): Adam's personality does not typically match what is expected in business administration.
  - Estimate: 0.1
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of having these traits if not in Business Administration might be higher because the traits are more associated with other fields.
  - Estimate: 0.3

Let's compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field assuming \(P(E)\) as a constant normalization factor.

### Bayesian Calculation
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   \[ \text{Numerator} = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]

2. **Business Administration**
   \[ \text{Numerator} = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

Since we are dealing with relative comparisons, we don't necessarily need to normalize these values strictly if we aim to compare probabilities across fields.

### Results
\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science} & : \approx 0.08 \\
\text{Business Administration} & : \approx 0.02 \\
\end{align*}
\]
