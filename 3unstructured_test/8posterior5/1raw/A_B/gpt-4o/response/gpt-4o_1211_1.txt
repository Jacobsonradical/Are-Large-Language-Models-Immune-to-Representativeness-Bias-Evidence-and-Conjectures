To solve this problem using Bayes' theorem, we first need to define and assess a few probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The base rate or prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) (Adam's personality sketch) given that Adam was in the field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \), given that Adam was not in the field.
4. \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field given the evidence \( E \) (which we need to compute).

Bayes' theorem states:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

However, we can simplify the computation by comparing the relative values of \( P(H|E) \) for different fields since we're looking for a comparison rather than an exact value. Essentially, we're interested in the relative magnitude of the probabilities rather than their absolute values.

Now, let's break down the probabilities for each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. \( P(H) \): This is the prior probability of being enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Assuming no prior information, \( P(H) \) might be relatively low since not all graduate students enroll in this field. For simplicity, let’s estimate it at 0.05 (5%).

2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam having the described personality if he is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. This is likely high because his interests in nature, plants, and animals align well with this field. Let's estimate it at 0.8 (80%).

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam having the described personality if he is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. This is likely lower because not every field would attract someone with these specific traits. Let's estimate it at 0.1 (10%).

### Business Administration

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of being enrolled in Business Administration. This field is more common for graduate students, so we might estimate it at 0.2 (20%).

2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam having the described personality if he is in Business Administration. This is likely lower because his interests and traits do not typically align with this field. Let's estimate it at 0.1 (10%).

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam having the described personality if he is not in Business Administration. This would be similar to the previous non-agricultural and veterinary fields estimate. Let’s estimate it at 0.1 (10%).

Now we will compute the posterior probabilities using Bayes' theorem. For simplicity, we assume \( P(E) \) is constant and compare relative values:

\[
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H)
\]

### Calculations

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:

\[
P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.05 = 0.04
\]

2. **Business Administration**:

\[
P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02
\]

Now we normalize these values so they sum to 1 (this step is for consistency in interpretation):

Let:

\[
\text{Total} = 0.04 + 0.02 = 0.06
\]

Then:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.06} \approx 0.6667
\]

2. **Business Administration**:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.06} \approx 0.3333
\]

Therefore, the final result is:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6667,
  "business administration": 0.3333
}
