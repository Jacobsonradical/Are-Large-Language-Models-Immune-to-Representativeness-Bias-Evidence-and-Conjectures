To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the marginal likelihood \( P(E) \). Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we are only asked to consider two hypotheses—whether Adam is enrolled in business administration or agricultural and veterinary science—we can ignore \( P(E) \) for relative comparisons. This process focuses on estimating the relative likelihoods.

### Hypotheses:

1. \( H_{\text{BA}} \): Adam is enrolled in business administration.
2. \( H_{\text{AVS}} \): Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

### Prior Probabilities (\( P(H) \)):

1. \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): The general popularity of business administration as a graduate field.
2. \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \): The popularity of agricultural and veterinary science as a graduate field.

Assuming there are several Graduate Programs, business administration is typically more popular:

- \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.6 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.2 \)

### Likelihoods (\( P(E|H) \)):

1. \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality traits, given he is enrolled in business administration.
2. \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality traits, given he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Adam's traits such as a deep love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science rather than business administration. Therefore:

- \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.8 \)

### Calculating Posterior Probabilities (\( P(H|E) \)):

We can use a simplified version of Bayes’ rule, noting that \( P(E) \) can be considered constant across comparisons:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

For business administration:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.2 \times 0.6 = 0.12 \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.8 \times 0.2 = 0.16 \]

Thus, in relative terms, the probabilities are as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.12,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.16
}
```

These values suggest that, given Adam's personality sketch, he is more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration.
