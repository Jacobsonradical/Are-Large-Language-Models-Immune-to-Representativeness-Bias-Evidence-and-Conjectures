To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Rule, we need the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field (\( P(H) \)), the likelihood of the personality sketch given that field (\( P(E|H) \)), and the probability of the personality sketch given the negation of that field (\( P(E|\neg H) \)). The formula for Bayes' Rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, for this calculation, we will just focus on the relative values since we are not given the exact value of \( P(E) \).

1. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H) \): Since many students pursue business administration, let's assume a moderate prior of 0.2.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The personality sketch of Adam does not sound typical for business administration students, so let's assign it a low likelihood, say 0.1.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Considering other fields, the sketch might be more probable, so let's assign a likelihood of 0.5.
   - Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): Given Adam's interest in nature, animals, and plants, let's assume a slightly lower prior of 0.1 for this field, recognizing it is less common than business administration.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The personality sketch strongly aligns with this field, so let's assign it a high likelihood, say 0.8.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): This would be lower given Adam's interests, so let's set it at 0.2.

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]

Now we can compare the proportional values of \( P(H|E) \) for each field to understand the relative likelihoods:

- Business Administration: 0.02
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.08

Based on these values, let's present the results:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08
}
