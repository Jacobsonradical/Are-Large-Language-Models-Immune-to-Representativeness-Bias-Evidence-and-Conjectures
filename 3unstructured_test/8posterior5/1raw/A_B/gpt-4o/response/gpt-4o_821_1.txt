Sure, let's use Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study, given Adam's personality sketch.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of being in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the evidence \( E \).

We also need to compute \( P(E|\neg H) \), which is the likelihood of the evidence if the hypothesis is false.

### For Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   The probability that a random graduate student is in business administration could be assumed relatively common, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   Based on the personality sketch which highlights a deep interest in nature, animals, and abstract concepts, it seems less likely for a graduate student with these attributes to be in business administration. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   This is the likelihood of observing the personality traits in any other field. Given Adam's traits, it seems quite likely to observe these traits in non-business fields, so let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   Let's assume the prior probability of being in agricultural and veterinary science is \( P(H) = 0.05 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   Given Adam's traits, especially his love for animals and nature, it is very likely he would be in this field. So let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   This would be similar to the other non-agricultural fields, so let's set it to \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Now, using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \), we can calculate:

### For Business Administration

\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.8 = 0.02 + 0.4 = 0.42 \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.42} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.42} \approx 0.048 \]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science

\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.3 \cdot 0.95 = 0.04 + 0.285 = 0.325 \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.325} \approx \frac{0.04}{0.325} \approx 0.123 \]

Therefore, summarizing the results:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.048,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.123
}
