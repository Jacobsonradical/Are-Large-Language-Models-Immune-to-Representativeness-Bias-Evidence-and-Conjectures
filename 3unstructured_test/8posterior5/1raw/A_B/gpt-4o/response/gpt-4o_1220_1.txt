To begin, we'll analyze the personality sketch ("E") of Adam and how it correlates with the given fields of study. We'll assign our probabilities to the hypotheses ("H").

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, it's reasonable to consider that this field aligns well with his interests and traits.

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a random graduate student is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Without specific statistics, let's assume a moderate value (e.g., 0.1).
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability that Adam's personality sketch occurs given he is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. This is likely high because his traits are well-suited to this field (e.g., 0.8).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability that Adam's personality sketch occurs given he is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. This covers all other fields and is likely lower given his very specific traits (e.g., 0.2).

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))} \]

Substitute values:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.18} = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \approx 0.3077 \]

### Business Administration
This field seems less aligned with Adam's traits for interests in nature and animals. However, we'll still assign probabilities:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a random graduate student is in Business Administration. Without exact statistics, but considering it's a common field, we can assume (e.g., 0.2).
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability that Adam’s personality sketch occurs given he is in Business Administration. This is likely lower since his traits seem less aligned with this field (e.g., 0.2).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability that Adam’s personality sketch occurs given he is not in Business Administration (e.g., 0.4).

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))} \]

Substitute values:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.2 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.32} = \frac{0.04}{0.36} \approx 0.1111 \]

Now we combine the results:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3077,
  "business administration": 0.1111
}
