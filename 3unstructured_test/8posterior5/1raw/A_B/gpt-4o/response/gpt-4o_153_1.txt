Given the personality sketch of Adam and the fields of study, we can make educated guesses for the probabilities based on the given information.

First, let's assign values to the initial probabilities (P(H)) for each field of study:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - P(H): This field is broadly popular among graduate students, but it might not perfectly align with Adam's interest in nature, animals, and abstract concepts.
   - Let's assume P(H) for business administration is 0.1.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - P(H): This field very closely aligns with Adam's described interests in nature, plants, and animals.
   - Let's assume P(H) for agricultural and veterinary science is 0.3.

Next, let's assign values for P(E|H), the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - P(E|H): While business administration might tangentially involve problem-solving and abstract concepts, it doesn't strongly align with Adam's more nature-focused interests.
   - Let's assume P(E|H) for business administration is 0.01.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - P(E|H): This hypothesis strongly aligns with Adam's interests and aspects of his personality.
   - Let's assume P(E|H) for agricultural and veterinary science is 0.8.

Now, let's assign values for P(E|\neg H), the probability of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - P(E|\neg H): Given the diversity of fields other than business administration, the given personality traits could more likely align with other fields.
   - Let's assume P(E|\neg H) for business administration is 0.2.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - P(E|\neg H): Adam's traits are very characteristic of this field, so assuming this hypothesis false means the evidence would be less likely compared to other fields.
   - Let's assume P(E|\neg H) for agricultural and veterinary science is 0.05.

Using Bayes' Rule, we compute P(H|E):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Calculate P(E) for each case:

1. **Business Administration**:
   \[ P(E) = (0.01 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) \]
   \[ P(E) = 0.001 + 0.18 = 0.181 \]
   Then, \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01 \cdot 0.1}{0.181} \approx 0.0055 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.3) + (0.05 \cdot 0.7) \]
   \[ P(E) = 0.24 + 0.035 = 0.275 \]
   Then, \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.3}{0.275} \approx 0.8727 \]

Conclusion in the specified format:

{
  "business administration": 0.0055,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8727
}
