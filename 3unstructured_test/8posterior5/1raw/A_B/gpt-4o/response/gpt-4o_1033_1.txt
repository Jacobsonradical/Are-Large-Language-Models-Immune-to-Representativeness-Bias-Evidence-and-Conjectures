To estimate the probabilities of Adam being enrolled in either business administration or agricultural and veterinary science, we will use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam is in hypothesis H given the evidence E.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing evidence E given that Adam is in hypothesis H.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis H.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing evidence E.

Given the nature of the problem, we need to assess each term in this formula for both hypotheses. Note that \( P(E) \) remains constant for both hypotheses, so we can ignore it for comparative purposes.

### Business Administration

- **P(H):** The probability that any given graduate student is in business administration. Let's denote this as P(H_b). Suppose this is moderate, say 0.20.
- **P(E|H):** The probability of Adam having the personality traits E given that he is studying business administration (H_b). Given the traits described, it's less likely but not impossible. Let's estimate this to be low, perhaps 0.05.
- **P(E|¬H):** The probability of Adam having these traits if he is not studying business administration. This encompasses all other fields, so would be higher. Let's estimate this to be 0.10.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.05 \times 0.20}{P(E)} \]

Since P(E) is common across all fields, we will only compare ratios:
\[ P(H_b|E) \propto 0.05 \times 0.20 = 0.01 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H):** The probability that any given graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's denote this as P(H_a). Suppose this is lower, say 0.05.
- **P(E|H):** The probability of Adam having the personality traits E given that he is studying agricultural and veterinary science (H_a). This seems more likely given his traits. Let's estimate this to be high, perhaps 0.80.
- **P(E|¬H):** The probability of having these traits if not in agricultural and veterinary science. Using the same previous estimate: 0.10.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.80 \times 0.05}{P(E)} \]

Again using proportionality:
\[ P(H_a|E) \propto 0.80 \times 0.05 = 0.04 \]

### Conclusion

Comparing these proportional values for better clarity:
- Business Administration: 0.01
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.04

Hence, the relative probabilities suggest Adam is much more likely to be studying agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration.

Hence, the results are:
