To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the fields "agricultural and veterinary science" and "business administration," we need to establish reasonable values for the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis is false \( P(E|\neg H) \). Then, we can use Bayes' rule to find \( P(H|E) \).

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Let's assume the following reasonable estimates and compute:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume this to be 0.05 (5%).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam having the described personality sketch given he is studying agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's strong interest and empathy towards nature and animals, let's assume this to be 0.8 (80%).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam having the described personality sketch given he is not studying agricultural and veterinary science. Since the traits are relatively more aligned with this field than average, let's assume 0.2 (20%).

2. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a graduate student is studying business administration. Let's assume this to be 0.10 (10%).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam having the described personality sketch given he is studying business administration. Since the personality sketch is less aligned with business administration, let's assume this to be 0.1 (10%).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam having the described personality sketch given he is not studying business administration. Assuming other fields including the aligned one "agricultural and veterinary science" could make it less probable relatively, let's assume 0.25 (25%).

Let's compute \( P(E) \),
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{agri}) \cdot P(H_{agri}) + P(E|\neg H_{agri}) \cdot P(\neg H_{agri}) \]

For "agricultural and veterinary science":
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95) = 0.04 + 0.19 = 0.23 \]

Using Bayes' rule for "agricultural and veterinary science":
\[ P(H_{agri}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{agri}) \cdot P(H_{agri})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.23} \approx 0.174 \]

For "business administration":
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{bus}) \cdot P(H_{bus}) + P(E|\neg H_{bus}) \cdot P(\neg H_{bus}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.10) + (0.25 \cdot 0.90) = 0.01 + 0.225 = 0.235 \]

Using Bayes' rule for "business administration":
\[ P(H_{bus}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{bus}) \cdot P(H_{bus})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.10}{0.235} \approx 0.043 \]
