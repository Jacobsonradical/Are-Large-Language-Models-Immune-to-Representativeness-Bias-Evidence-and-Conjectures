To apply Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following components:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in the field.

Let's assign some reasonable values based on the personality sketch provided.

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Let's assume this to be a relatively common field, but not the most likely given Adam's sketch.
    - \( P(H) = 0.1 \)

2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits if he were enrolled in business administration. Given Adam's strong appreciation for nature, animals, and solving puzzles (which may not directly align with typical business administration traits), this is moderately low.
    - \( P(E|H) = 0.05 \)

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits if he were not enrolled in business administration. Given the wide range of other fields that could fit Adam's traits better, this is higher.
    - \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \)

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)} \]

Substitute the values in:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{0.05 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.27} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.275} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.018 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This is quite likely given the personality sketch provided.
    - \( P(H) = 0.05 \)

2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits if he were enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given the perfect alignment with Adam's love for nature, animals, and empathy, this is high.
    - \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \)

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits if he were not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given there are other fields but much fewer that fit so well, this is moderate.
    - \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \)

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)} \]

Substitute the values in:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.9 \cdot 0.05 + 0.3 \cdot 0.95} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.285} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.33} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.136 \]

So, summarizing the results:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.018,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.136
}
```
