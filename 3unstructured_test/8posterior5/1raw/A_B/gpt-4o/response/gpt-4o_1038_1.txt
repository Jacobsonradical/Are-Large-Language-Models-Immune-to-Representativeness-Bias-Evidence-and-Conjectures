To compute \( P(H|E) \), the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given the personality sketch \( E \), we'll use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given:
- \( H \): Hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
- \( E \): Personality sketch.

We need to estimate the following for each field (business administration and agricultural and veterinary science):
1. \( P(H) \): Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in that field.
4. \( P(E) \): Marginal probability of observing the personality sketch (which we do not need to calculate explicitly, as it cancels out in the final ratio).

### Business Administration
1. **\( P(H) \)**: Let's consider that business administration is a relatively common graduate field. Suppose \( P(H) \) for business administration is 0.1.
2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: Given that business administration students might not typically have the personality traits described (warm heart, strong empathy, love for animals, etc.), \( P(E|H) \) might be relatively low. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) as 0.1.
3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: We consider the traits in \( E \) to be more likely in graduate fields outside of business administration, so \( P(E|\neg H) \) might be higher. Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) as 0.5.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

For \( P(H|\neg E) \):
\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.1 + 0.5 \cdot 0.9 = 0.01 + 0.45 = 0.46 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.46} \approx 0.0217 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **\( P(H) \)**: This field aligns well with Adam's personality traits, so let's increase \( P(H) \) to 0.15 for agricultural and veterinary science.
2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: Given that the personality sketch fits well with this field, \( P(E|H) \) is likely high. Let's estimate this to be 0.8.
3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: If not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, the likelihood of observing these personality traits is lower. Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) as 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \]

For \( P(H|\neg E) \):
\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85 \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H)_cdot P(\neg H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.3 \cdot 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.255 = 0.375 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.375} = \frac{0.12}{0.375} \approx 0.32 \]

### Final Probability Estimates:

{
  "business administration": 0.0217,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.32
}

These are the posterior probabilities that Adam was enrolled in the respective fields given his personality sketch.
