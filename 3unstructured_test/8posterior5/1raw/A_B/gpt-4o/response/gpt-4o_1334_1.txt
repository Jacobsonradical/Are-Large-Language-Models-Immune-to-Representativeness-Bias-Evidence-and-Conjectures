To solve this problem, we first need to make reasonable assumptions about the probabilities involved. These assumptions are crucial to applying Bayes' Rule.

**Let's denote:**

- \( P(H_{bus}) \) as the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(H_{agri}) \) as the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H_{bus}) \) as the probability of E given that Adam was in business administration.
- \( P(E|H_{agri}) \) as the probability of E given that Adam was in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg{H_{bus}}) \) as the probability of E given that Adam was not in business administration.
- \( P(E|\neg{H_{agri}}) \) as the probability of E given that Adam was not in agricultural and veterinary science.

For the sake of this exercise, let's assume the following priors and likelihoods:

### For Business Administration:
- \( P(H_{bus}) = 0.2 \): Assume that there's a 20% chance Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|H_{bus}) = 0.1 \): Given his characteristics, it's less likely they match a typical business administration student.
- \( P(E|\neg{H_{bus}}) = 0.6 \): Given the general pool of graduate students, it's possible that 60% may have similar traits to Adam.

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- \( P(H_{agri}) = 0.05 \): Assume that there's a 5% chance Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H_{agri}) = 0.9 \): Given his characteristics, it is highly likely they match an agricultural and veterinary science student.
- \( P(E|\neg{H_{agri}}) = 0.6 \): Similar to the previous example, the general pool might have 60% similar traits.

Now let's apply Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) * P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|\neg H) * P(\neg H) \]

### For Business Administration:
\[ P(E)_{bus} = (0.1 \times 0.2) + (0.6 \times 0.8) \]
\[ P(E)_{bus} = 0.02 + 0.48 = 0.50 \]

\[ P(H_{bus}|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.50} \]
\[ P(H_{bus}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.50} = 0.04 \]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(E)_{agri} = (0.9 \times 0.05) + (0.6 \times 0.95) \]
\[ P(E)_{agri} = 0.045 + 0.57 = 0.615 \]

\[ P(H_{agri}|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.05}{0.615} \]
\[ P(H_{agri}|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.615} \approx 0.073 \]

Therefore, the results formatted as specified in your request are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.04,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.073
