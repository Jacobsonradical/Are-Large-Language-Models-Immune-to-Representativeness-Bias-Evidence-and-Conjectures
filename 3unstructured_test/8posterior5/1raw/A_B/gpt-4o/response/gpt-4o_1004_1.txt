Sure, let's break down the probabilities for each field given the provided personality sketch and use Bayes' Theorem to compute the posterior probabilities.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - **P(H)**: Assume the prior probability that any random graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assign it a value of 0.1 (10%) since it's a specialized field.
   - **P(E|H)**: Given that Adam has a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as empathy and dedication, it's highly likely that he would be in this field. Let's assign P(E|H) a value of 0.8 (80%).
   - **P(E|¬H)**: The probability that Adam has this personality sketch given that he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume this is relatively lower since his personality traits are highly aligned with this field. We'll assign P(E|¬H) a value of 0.2 (20%).

   Using these values, Bayes' Theorem allows us to compute \( P(H|E) \):

   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
   = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9}
   = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.18}
   = \frac{0.08}{0.26}
   \approx 0.3077
   \]

2. **Business Administration**
   - **P(H)**: Assume the prior probability that any random graduate student is in business administration. Let’s assign it a value of 0.2 (20%) since it's a common field.
   - **P(E|H)**: Given that Adam prefers solving puzzles and abstract concepts, there’s some alignment, but he also has a strong empathy and love for animals which is less typical in business administration. Let's assign P(E|H) a value of 0.3 (30%).
   - **P(E|¬H)**: The probability that Adam has this personality sketch given that he is not in business administration. Likely compared with the probability for agricultural and veterinary science but adjusted for a larger number of alternative fields. We'll assign P(E|¬H) a value of 0.6 (60%).

   Using these values, Bayes' Theorem allows us to compute \( P(H|E) \):

   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
   = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.6 \cdot 0.8}
   = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.48}
   = \frac{0.06}{0.54}
   \approx 0.1111
   \]

Therefore, the answers are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3077,
  "business administration": 0.1111
}
```
