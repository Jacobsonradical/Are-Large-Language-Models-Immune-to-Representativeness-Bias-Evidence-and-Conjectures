Sure, let's analyze and estimate the probabilities step by step.

Firstly, let's assign prior probabilities \( P(H) \) based on typical enrollment distributions in graduate fields in the U.S.

### Business Administration:

- P(H) for Business Administration: Business Administration is a popular field with a significant number of graduate students. Let's assume \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.25 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

- P(H) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science: This field is less common than Business Administration but still substantial. Let's assume \( P(H_{AVS}) = 0.10 \).

Next, we estimate \( P(E|H) \), the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given each hypothesis.

### Business Administration:

- P(E|H): A personality sketch indicating a strong curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals doesn't strongly align with the typical personality of a Business Administration student. Let's assume this is fairly low, around \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.05 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

- P(E|H): Adam's personality seems highly aligned with someone in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, given his love for nature, plants, animals, and appreciation for hard work. Let's assign this a higher value, around \( P(E|H_{AVS}) = 0.40 \).

Now, we need \( P(E|\neg H) \), the likelihood of the personality sketch given Adam is not in each field. This is challenging but let's use general expectations:

### Business Administration:

- P(E|\neg H): Given the personality sketch doesn't align strongly with Business Administration, a somewhat average value might be assigned here: \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.20 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

- P(E|\neg H): Given the sketch strongly aligns with Agricultural and Veterinary Science, it's much less likely if Adam were not in this field. Let's set this to a lower value: \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) = 0.10 \).

Applying Bayes' Theorem for each field:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be derived from the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H)) \]

### Business Administration:
\[ P(E_{BA}) = (0.05 \times 0.25) + (0.20 \times 0.75) = 0.0125 + 0.15 = 0.1625 \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.25}{0.1625} = \frac{0.0125}{0.1625} \approx 0.077 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(E_{AVS}) = (0.40 \times 0.10) + (0.10 \times 0.90) = 0.04 + 0.09 = 0.13 \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.40 \times 0.10}{0.13} = \frac{0.04}{0.13} \approx 0.308 \]

Thus, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.077,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.308
}
```
