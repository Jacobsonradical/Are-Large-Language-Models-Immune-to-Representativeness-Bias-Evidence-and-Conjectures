To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field based on his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of having the personality sketch \( E \) given that he was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of having the personality sketch \( E \), which can be considered as a normalization factor.

Given that we do not have actual numerical data for priors and likelihoods, we will use informed estimates instead.

Let's start with the estimates:

### Business Administration
- **P(H):** The prior probability \( P(H) \) for Business Administration among all graduate fields is moderate.
- **P(E|H):** The likelihood \( P(E|H) \) that someone in Business Administration exhibits the personality traits mentioned (strong empathy, love for animals, appreciation for hard work) is relatively low because this field typically emphasizes different skill sets.
- **P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood of having the personality sketch \( E \) for fields other than Business Administration would be higher because such qualities are more common in other fields (e.g., sciences, humanities).

Estimates:
- \( P(H_{BA}) \approx 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \approx 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \approx 0.3 \)

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{(0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8)} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx \frac{0.02}{ 0.02 + 0.24 } \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx \frac{0.02}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx 0.077 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H):** The prior probability \( P(H) \) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science is relatively low compared to more popular fields, but not negligible.
- **P(E|H):** The likelihood \( P(E|H) \) that someone in Agricultural and Veterinary Science exhibits the personality traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals) is very high.
- **P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood of having the personality sketch \( E \) for fields other than Agricultural and Veterinary Science would be lower.

Estimates:
- \( P(H_{AV}) \approx 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H_{AV}) \approx 0.8 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{AV}) \approx 0.2 \)

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H_{AV}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AV}) \cdot P(H_{AV})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{AV}|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{(0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9)} \]
\[ P(H_{AV}|E) \approx \frac{0.08}{ 0.08 + 0.18 } \]
\[ P(H_{AV}|E) \approx \frac{0.08}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H_{AV}|E) \approx 0.308 \]
