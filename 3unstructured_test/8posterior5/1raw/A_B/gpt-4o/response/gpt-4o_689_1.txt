To determine the likelihood that Adam was enrolled in each specified field, we will use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in the specified field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in the specified field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the specified field.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of Adam's personality sketch.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in the specified field.

### Assumptions:
1. **P(H) and P(\neg H)**:
   - For business administration (\(P(H)\)): A rough estimate of graduate students in business administration might be around 0.15.
   - For agricultural and veterinary science (\(P(H)\)): A rough estimate of graduate students in agricultural and veterinary sciences might be around 0.05.

2. **P(E|H)**:
   - For business administration (\(P(E|H)\)):
     - Students of business administration might not commonly exhibit the detailed personality traits described in E (e.g., deep love for nature, animals, and abstract concepts). We can assume this probability to be relatively low, around 0.01.
   
   - For agricultural and veterinary science (\(P(E|H)\)):
     - Students of agricultural and veterinary sciences are likely to exhibit many of the traits in E, such as curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and love for animals. We can assume this probability to be relatively high, around 0.5.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**:
   - This is the probability of Adam exhibiting these personality traits given that he is not enrolled in the specified field.
   - General population of students might exhibit these traits at a certain rate. For simplicity, let's estimate this to be fairly low, around 0.05.

Given these estimated probabilities:

### Calculations:
1. **Business Administration**:
   \[
   P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} = \frac{P(E|H) * P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.01 * 0.15}{P(E)}
   \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[
   P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} = \frac{P(E|H) * P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.5 * 0.05}{P(E)}
   \]

Since P(E) is the same in both fields, it cancels out when comparing relative probabilities.

Let's normalize the probabilities to sum to 1 (although in real scenarios, they might not sum exactly to 1 due to other fields):

\[
\text{Normalization factor} = 0.01 * 0.15 + 0.5 * 0.05 = 0.0015 + 0.025 = 0.0265
\]

For business administration:
\[
P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} = \frac{0.0015}{0.0265} \approx 0.0566037736
\]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[
P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} = \frac{0.025}{0.0265} \approx 0.943396226
\]

### Result:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.056,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.943
}
```

This computation shows the relative likelihoods given the provided personality sketch and our assumptions. Note that these values are based on initial assumptions and may vary with more precise data.
