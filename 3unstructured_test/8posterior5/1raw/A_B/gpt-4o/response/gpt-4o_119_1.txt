To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to make some reasonable assumptions for the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the marginal probability \( P(E|\neg H) \). Here's the process:

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: The initial probability \( P(\text{business administration}) \) could be considered moderate, as many students enroll in this field. Let's assume it is 0.2.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) if Adam were a business administration student is likely to be low, as his traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, etc.) are not typically associated with business. Let's assume it is 0.1.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) if Adam were NOT in business administration might be higher since his traits align more with other fields. Let's assume it is 0.3.

Let's calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ 
P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)}
\]

Where:

\[ 
P(E) = P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) + P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) \cdot P(\neg \text{business administration}) 
\]

\[ 
P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8 = 0.02 + 0.24 = 0.26
\]

Now:

\[ 
P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.26} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.26} \approx 0.077
\]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: The initial probability \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \) is likely lower as fewer students enroll in this specialized field. Let's assume it is 0.05.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) if Adam were in agricultural and veterinary science is very high, as his traits align strongly with this field. Let's assume it is 0.9.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) if Adam were NOT in agricultural and veterinary science might be lower. Let's assume it is 0.2.

Now, let's calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ 
P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)}
\]

Where:

\[ 
P(E) = P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) + P(E|\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science})
\]

\[ 
P(E) = 0.9 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.95 = 0.045 + 0.19 = 0.235
\]

Now:

\[ 
P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.235} \approx \frac{0.045}{0.235} \approx 0.191
\]


Based on these calculations, the posterior probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": 0.077,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.191
}


These calculations give a rough estimation of how likely Adam is to be enrolled in the given fields, given the personality sketch.
