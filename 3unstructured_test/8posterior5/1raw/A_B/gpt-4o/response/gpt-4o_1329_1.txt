Sure, let's evaluate these probabilities one by one.

For **agricultural and veterinary science (denoted as H_a)**:

1. **P(H_a)**: This represents the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given that he was a graduate student in the U.S. The probability that any random graduate student is in this field is relatively low compared to more popular fields. Let's cautiously estimate this probability to be around 0.05.

2. **P(E|H_a)**: This represents the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, this seems like a fitting field for him. I'd estimate this to be quite high, around 0.8.

3. **P(E|¬H_a)**: This represents the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Considering the number of other graduate fields, many of which might not align so closely with his personality traits, this probability would be relatively lower. Let's estimate it at 0.2.

Now, using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H_a | E) = \frac{P(E | H_a) \cdot P(H_a)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_a | E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.95} \]
\[ P(H_a | E) = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.19} \]
\[ P(H_a | E) = \frac{0.04}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H_a | E) \approx 0.174 \]

For **business administration (denoted as H_b)**:

1. **P(H_b)**: This represents the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given that he was a graduate student in the U.S. Business administration is a very popular field among graduate students. Let's estimate this probability to be around 0.2.

2. **P(E|H_b)**: This represents the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in business administration. Adam's traits (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals) do not particularly align with a typical business administration student. Let's estimate this probability to be quite low, around 0.1.

3. **P(E|¬H_b)**: This represents the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is not enrolled in business administration. The personality traits might fit better with many other fields compared to business administration, so this would be higher. Let's estimate this probability to be around 0.3.

Now, using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H_b | E) = \frac{P(E | H_b) \cdot P(H_b)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_b | E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8} \]
\[ P(H_b | E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.24} \]
\[ P(H_b | E) = \frac{0.02}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H_b | E) \approx 0.077 \]
