Let's break down the probabilities for each field using Bayesian reasoning.

1. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
     - Since the majority of graduate students are not in business administration, we'll assign a lower prior. Let's assume \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.05 \).
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he's in business administration.
     - Adam's traits like a genuine curiosity about nature and deep love for animals are less congruent with business administration, though some traits like high intelligence could be present in any field. Assign a low likelihood, say \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he's not in business administration. 
     - Given that nature and animal interests are more likely in other fields, assign a higher value, say \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.5 \).

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
     - This field is less common, but Adam's attributes match well, so assign a higher prior. Let's assume \( P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) = 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he's in agricultural and veterinary science.
     - Adam's traits like curiosity about nature and love for animals fit well here. Assign a high likelihood, say \( P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) = 0.8 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AgVet}}) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he's not in agricultural and veterinary science.
     - Given the good match with agricultural and veterinary science, assign a lower value, say \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AgVet}}) = 0.3 \).

Now using Bayes' Rule for each hypothesis \( H \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) can be derived proportionally for comparison, we can ignore its absolute value and only compare the numerators:

For **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{BA}})P(H_{\text{BA}}) \]
\[ = 0.1 \times 0.05 = 0.005 \]

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H_{\text{AgVet}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}})P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) \]
\[ = 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \]

Normalizing these values to obtain the probabilities (they don't need to add up to 1, but just to provide a comparable sense of proportion):

{
  "business administration": 0.005,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08
}

As observed, Adam's personality sketch makes it significantly more likely that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration.
