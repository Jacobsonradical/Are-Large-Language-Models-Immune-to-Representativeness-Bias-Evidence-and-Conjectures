To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need three components:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality traits given he was enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality traits given he was not enrolled in that field.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

For simplicity, to compute relative probabilities, we can ignore \( P(E) \) as it is a normalizing constant. We'll compare \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for each field. Here are reasonable estimates:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assign this a moderate prior, say 0.3 (assuming fewer people enroll in this field compared to more common fields like business administration).
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's traits if he were in this field. Given his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, we can estimate this to be quite high, say 0.9.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing his traits if he were not in this field. These traits are somewhat specific to this field, but not exclusive. Let's assign this a moderate value, say 0.4.

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.9 \cdot 0.3 = 0.27 \]

### Business Administration

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of being enrolled in business administration. Let's assign this a relatively higher prior, say 0.5 (assuming more people enroll in this field).
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's traits if he were in this field. These traits are less aligned with business administration, so let's assign this a lower value, say 0.2.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing his traits if he were not in this field. These traits could easily describe someone not in business administration. Let's assign this the same moderate value, 0.4.

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \cdot 0.5 = 0.1 \]

### Normalizing Constants

To get the final probabilities, we should also consider the total probability to normalize.

\[ P(E) \propto 0.27 + 0.1 = 0.37 \]

Then normalize each probability by dividing by the total:

- Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.27}{0.37} \approx 0.73 \]

- Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.37} \approx 0.27 \]

### Final Answer
