To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' rule, which is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since \( P(E) \) is the same for both hypotheses, we can compare just the numerators to see which field is more likely. Let's denote:

- \( H_{BA} \): The hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( H_{AVS} \): The hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Given the provided traits and background, let's assign and estimate some probabilities.

1. **business administration**:

    - \( P(H_{BA}) \): Let's assume a prior probability. Graduate students in business administration are quite common compared to very specialized fields. Let's somewhat arbitrarily assign:
      \[
      P(H_{BA}) = 0.3
      \]
    - \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): The empathy, appreciation for hard work, and high intelligence do match somewhat with business administration, but interest in nature and animals is not typical. So, a relatively low probability:
      \[
      P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.1
      \]
    - \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \): Since there are many other fields (not just AVS) that could match Adam's personality:
      \[
      P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \approx 0.7 \text{ (due to a diverse set of fields excluding business)}
      \]

2. **agricultural and veterinary science**:

    - \( P(H_{AVS}) \): This is a more specific field, so let's assume a prior probability:
      \[
      P(H_{AVS}) = 0.1
      \]
    - \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \): The traits match quite well with someone in this field, so a high probability:
      \[
      P(E|H_{AVS}) = 0.8
      \]
    - \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \): Since excluding AVS, many fields could still suit Adam's empathy, intelligence, and love for animals:
      \[
      P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \approx 0.6
      \]

Now we compute \( P(H_{BA}|E) \) and \( P(H_{AVS}|E) \):

\[
P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)}
\]

\[
P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)}
\]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same, we compare just the numerators:

\[
P(H_{BA}|E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.3 = 0.03
\]

\[
P(H_{AVS}|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08
\]

Normalizing these for our purposes:

\[
P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.08} = \frac{3}{11} \approx 0.27
\]

\[
P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.03 + 0.08} = \frac{8}{11} \approx 0.73
\]

Therefore, the estimated probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.27,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.73
}
```
