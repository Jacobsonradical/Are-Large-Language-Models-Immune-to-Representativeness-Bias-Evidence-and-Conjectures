To find the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in that field.

Since we do not have exact values, we will use reasonable assumptions to estimate these probabilities and then compute \( P(H|E) \). 

### Business Administration
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Let's assume the probability of any graduate student being enrolled in business administration is about 0.20.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Adam's personality sketch shows a strong interest in nature, empathy, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work. These traits are not typical for someone in business administration, but let's assume there's some overlap. Assign a likelihood of 0.05.

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - For fields other than business administration, Adam's traits are more common. We can assume this likelihood to be higher, let's say 0.50.

Using these, we apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.20}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) \] is not given, but it normalizes the probabilities across all possible hypotheses, so we'll work with the proportionality for now.

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.05 \cdot 0.20 = 0.01 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Assume the probability of any graduate student being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is about 0.10.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Adam's personality traits are highly consistent with someone in agricultural and veterinary science. Assign a high likelihood of 0.80.

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - For fields other than agricultural and veterinary science, Adam's traits are less common. Assume a likelihood of 0.30.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.10}{P(E)} \]
Again, normalizing the probabilities might not be necessary for a comparative answer:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.80 \cdot 0.10 = 0.08 \]

### Summary:
Comparing the proportional values from both fields:

- Business Administration: \( 0.01 \)
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( 0.08 \)

We observe that \( P(H|E) \) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science is higher.
