To solve this, we use Bayes' theorem which states that:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( H \) is the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
- \( E \) is the evidence provided by the personality sketch.
- \( \neg H \) denotes the hypothesis that Adam was not enrolled in the particular field.

We're calculating posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field of specialization given the personality sketch \( E \).

Let's denote:
- \( P(H) \) as the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \) as the likelihood of observing the personality sketch if Adam was indeed enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) as the likelihood of observing the personality sketch if Adam was not enrolled in that field.

For simplicity, assume:
- \( P(E) \) remains constant across fields since it’s the same personality sketch.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
   It's reasonable to assume that a small proportion of graduate students are in this field. Let’s assume \[ P(H) = 0.05 \] or 5%.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   Adam's personality sketch fits well with agricultural and veterinary science due to his warm heart, strong empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature. Let’s give this a high value, say \[ P(E|H) = 0.8 \].

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   This would be the likelihood of finding someone with Adam's personality sketch not in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume this to be less, given Adam's specific interests, say \[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \].

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} \]

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
   There might be a larger proportion of students in this field compared to agricultural and veterinary science. Let’s assume \[ P(H) = 0.15 \] or 15%.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   Adam's personality sketch fits less well with business administration since it focuses more on abstract reasoning and puzzles rather than business administration traits. Let's assume \[ P(E|H) = 0.3 \].

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   Given that many students in other fields may share Adam's traits, let's give this a moderate value, say \[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \].

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \]

### Normalizing the Probabilities

To compare these probabilities properly, we need to normalize them. Let's calculate the unnormalized posterior probabilities first:

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agri}} \approx (0.8 \cdot 0.05) \]

For business administration:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{bus}} \approx (0.3 \cdot 0.15) \]

Now, the total \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = (P(E|H)_{\text{agri}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{agri}}) + (P(E|H)_{\text{bus}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{bus}}) + \text{other terms} \]

We don't have other fields and their specifics but we'll assume only these terms for simplicity.

\[ P(E) \approx (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.3 \cdot 0.15) \]

Now, 
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agri}} = \frac{(0.8 \cdot 0.05)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{bus}} = \frac{(0.3 \cdot 0.15)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agri}} = \frac{0.04}{0.085} \approx 0.47 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{bus}} = \frac{0.045}{0.085} \approx 0.53 \]

Thus, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.47,
  "business administration": 0.53
}
```
