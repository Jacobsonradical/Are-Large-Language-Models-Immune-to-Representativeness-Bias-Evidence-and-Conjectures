Let's denote:

- H1: Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- H2: Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- E: The personality sketch of Adam.

### Assessing Probabilities:

To use Bayes' rule, we need three probabilities for each hypothesis:

1. P(H): The prior probability of the hypothesis.
2. P(E|H): The probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (how likely the personality traits are if Adam is enrolled in the specified field).
3. P(E|¬H): The probability of the evidence given that the hypothesis is not true (how likely the personality traits are if Adam is not enrolled in the specified field).

### Hypothesis 1: Business Administration (H1)

- **P(H1):** This is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration. Without specific data, let's assume it to be a general prior probability that a graduate student is in business administration. Let's estimate it at 0.2.
  
- **P(E|H1):** Given the personality description (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy), while not impossible, these traits do not strongly align with business administration. We should assign a relatively lower probability, say 0.1.
  
- **P(E|¬H1):** If Adam is not in business administration, he could be in any other field. Considering his interests, it seems a bit more likely he would fit in a field that’s not business administration. Let's estimate this at a higher probability, say 0.7.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1)}{P(E)} \]
Since P(E) is a normalizing factor and considering only relative comparisons:
\[ P(H1|E) \propto P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1) \]
\[ P(H1|E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

### Hypothesis 2: Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H2)

- **P(H2):** Let's say the prior probability that a graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science is also 0.2 (both fields are quite common but not overwhelmingly dominant).

- **P(E|H2):** The given traits (love for animals, curiosity about nature) align well with agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assign a higher probability, say 0.8.
  
- **P(E|¬H2):** This is the probability of having such traits when not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given the specific alignment of the traits with this field, let's estimate it at 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H2|E) \propto P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2) \]
\[ P(H2|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.2 = 0.16 \]

### Comparing and Normalizing Values

For an intuitive comparison, let's scale the results:

1. **Business Administration:**
   \[ P(H1|E) = 0.02 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   \[ P(H2|E) = 0.16 \]

Therefore, to keep the values proportional but adjusted to between 0 and 1 for clarity:

\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02+0.16} = \frac{0.02}{0.18} \approx 0.1111 \] 
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.16}{0.02+0.16} = \frac{0.16}{0.18} \approx 0.8889 \]

Thus, the answers are:

{
  "business administration": 0.1111,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8889
}
