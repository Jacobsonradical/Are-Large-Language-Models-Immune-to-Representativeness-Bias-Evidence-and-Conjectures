To use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \), we need to estimate the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihoods \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each hypothesis.

**Estimates:**

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1)**:
   - **P(H1)**: The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given the popularity of various fields, let's estimate this as around 0.05.
   - **P(E|H1)**: The likelihood that Adam’s personality sketch fits if he is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given his interest in nature, love for animals, and empathy, this is very high. Let's estimate this as 0.9.
   - **P(E|\neg H1)**: The likelihood that Adam’s personality sketch fits if he is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Because his traits are somewhat specific to Agricultural and Veterinary Science, this might be lower. Let's estimate this at 0.3.

2. **Business Administration (H2)**:
   - **P(H2)**: The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in Business Administration. Given the popularity of MBA programs, let's estimate this as about 0.15.
   - **P(E|H2)**: The likelihood that Adam’s personality sketch fits if he is in Business Administration. Given his traits don’t closely align with common traits expected in Business Administration, this is likely lower. Let's estimate this as 0.2.
   - **P(E|\neg H2)**: The likelihood that Adam’s personality sketch fits if he is not in Business Administration. Considering \(\neg H2\) encompasses many fields, the personality traits might more broadly fit. Let's estimate this at 0.7.

**Bayes' Rule Computations**:

\( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \)

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1):
\[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.05) + (0.3 \cdot 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.045 + 0.285 = 0.33 \]
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.33} \]
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.33} \]
\[ P(H1|E) \approx 0.136 \]

For Business Administration (H2):
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.15) + (0.7 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.03 + 0.595 = 0.625 \]
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{0.625} \]
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.625} \]
\[ P(H2|E) = 0.048 \]

So our posterior probabilities based on the given personality description are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.136,
  "business administration": 0.048
}
```
