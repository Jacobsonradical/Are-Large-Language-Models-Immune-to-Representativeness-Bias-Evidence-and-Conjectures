To compute the probabilities of Adam being enrolled in either business administration or agricultural and veterinary science based on his personality sketch using Bayes' theorem, we need to consider the following:

- P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- P(E|H): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given he was in that field.
- P(E|¬H): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given he was not in that field.

Let's break it down:

### Business Administration

**P(H)**:
- The probability of Adam being enrolled in a business administration program, P(H), is somewhat less likely given his interests and personality. Let's assume a prior probability of 0.1.

**P(E|H)**:
- Given that Adam is in business administration, the likelihood of his personality matching the profile described (curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work in abstract concepts) is considerably low. Let's assign a value of 0.05.

**P(E|¬H)**:
- Given that Adam is not in business administration, the probability of his personality matching the profile could be more probable since other fields might align more closely with his traits. Let's assume P(E|¬H) is 0.5.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.1}{0.05 \times 0.1 + 0.5 \times 0.9} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.45} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.455} \approx 0.011 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

**P(H)**:
- The probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is higher given his described characteristics. Let's assume a prior probability of 0.2.

**P(E|H)**:
- Given that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science, the likelihood of observing his personality characteristics is very high. Let's assign a value of 0.9.

**P(E|¬H)**:
- Given that Adam is not in this field, the probability of his personality matching the profile is relatively lower compared to this field. Let's assume P(E|¬H) is 0.4.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.2}{0.9 \times 0.2 + 0.4 \times 0.8} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.18}{0.18 + 0.32} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.18}{0.50} = 0.36 \]

Therefore, the probabilities of Adam being enrolled in the respective fields based on the personality sketch provided are:

{
  "business administration": 0.011,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.36
}
