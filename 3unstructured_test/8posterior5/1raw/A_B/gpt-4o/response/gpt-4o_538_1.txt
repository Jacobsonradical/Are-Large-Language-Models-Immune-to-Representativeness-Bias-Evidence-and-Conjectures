To apply Bayes' rule, we first need to assess the prior probabilities \(P(H)\), the likelihoods \(P(E|H)\), and the likelihood of the evidence given that the hypothesis is not true \(P(E|\neg H)\).

### Hypotheses:
- \(H_1\): Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \(H_2\): Adam was enrolled in business administration.

### Prior Probabilities \(P(H)\):
The prior probability represents how likely we think it is, before seeing the evidence, that Adam is enrolled in each field. 

Given Adam's curiosity about nature, animals, and his empathy, it is more likely that he would be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science rather than business administration. Therefore, while these priors might be subjective, a reasonable assumption might be:
- \(P(H_1)\) is higher than \(P(H_2)\).

We will assign rough priors:
- \(P(H_1) = 0.3\)
- \(P(H_2) = 0.1\)

### Likelihoods \(P(E|H)\):

- \(P(E|H_1)\): This is the probability of Adam having the described personality traits given that he is studying agricultural and veterinary science. Given his love for nature, animals, and empathy, this probability should be quite high.
- \(P(E|H_2)\): This is the probability of Adam having the described personality traits given that he is studying business administration. This is plausible but seems less likely compared to \(H_1\).

Let's assign values:
- \(P(E|H_1) = 0.8\)
- \(P(E|H_2) = 0.2\)

### Evidence Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\):
This represents the probability of observing Adam's personality traits given he is not in the field \(H\).
- For \(H_1\) (agricultural and veterinary science), we need to consider the probability of Adam's traits if he were not in this field. Given his traits, the fields like environmental science or biology might also be quite probable, meaning \(P(E|\neg H_1)\) might also be fairly high.
- For \(H_2\) (business administration), the same logic applies but with different considerations. If he is not in business administration, it doesn't particularly impact the likelihood of his traits being observed except that they are less fitting.

Assign values:
- \(P(E|\neg H_1) = 0.5\)
- \(P(E|\neg H_2) = 0.7\)

### Applying Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

For \(H_1\) (agricultural and veterinary science):
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.3}{0.8 \cdot 0.3 + 0.5 \cdot (1 - 0.3)} \]
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.24}{0.24 + 0.35} \]
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.24}{0.59} \]
\[ P(H_1|E) \approx 0.41 \]

For \(H_2\) (business administration):
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.7 \cdot (1 - 0.1)} \]
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.63} \]
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.65} \]
\[ P(H_2|E) \approx 0.031 \]

Now, putting these into the required format:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.41,
  "business administration": 0.031
}
```
