To solve this problem, we will evaluate the probabilities associated with Adam's profile and use Bayes' rule to update our beliefs about which field he might be studying.

### Business Administration

**1. Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**:
   - Business administration is a common field for graduate students, but not as likely given Adam's personality sketch.
   - Let's estimate \(P(H)\) for business administration as 0.2.

**2. Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**:
   - Adam's curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals do not strongly align with business administration.
   - Therefore, \(P(E|H)\) might be relatively low. Let's estimate it as 0.1.

**3. Complementary Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)**:
   - This is the probability of observing Adam's characteristics if he is not a business administration student.
   - Given Adam’s personality sketch, it seems more aligned with fields like agricultural and veterinary sciences, so let's estimate this higher at 0.3.

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.24} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.26} \approx 0.077 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

**1. Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**:
   - Given Adam's interest in nature, empathy, and love for animals, these traits align strongly with agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Let's estimate \(P(H)\) for agricultural and veterinary science as 0.1.

**2. Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**:
   - Adam’s characteristics are very fitting for this field.
   - Let's estimate \(P(E|H)\) as quite high, say 0.8.

**3. Complementary Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)**:
   - This is the likelihood of observing Adam's characteristics if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Since Adam’s characteristics would less strongly align with unrelated fields, let’s estimate this lower at 0.2.

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.18} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \approx 0.308 \]

### Final Answer:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.077,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.308
}
