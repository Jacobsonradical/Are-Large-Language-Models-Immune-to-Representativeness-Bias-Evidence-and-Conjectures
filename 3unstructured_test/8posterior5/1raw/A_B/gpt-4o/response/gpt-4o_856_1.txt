We need to use Bayes' Rule to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \), the likelihood that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch.

Bayes' Rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's break down the required components for each field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**:
   - This is the probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Let’s assume \( P(H) \) = 0.10 (assumed for illustrative purposes)

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, along with his empathy and intelligence, this aligns strongly with agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Let’s assume \( P(E|H) \) = 0.80

3. **The Complement, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Since interests in nature, plants, and animals are less common outside this field, this is lower.
   - Let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) \) = 0.15

Using Bayes’ rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.10) + (0.15 \cdot 0.90) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.135 = 0.215 \]

So, the posterior probability:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.10}{0.215} \approx 0.372 \]

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**:
   - This is the probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in business administration.
   - Let’s assume \( P(H) \) = 0.20 (assumed for illustrative purposes)

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in business administration.
   - Given Adam's profile, it aligns less well with business administration, which typically emphasizes leadership, decision-making, and organizational skills.
   - Let’s assume \( P(E|H) \) = 0.10

3. **The Complement, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not in business administration.
   - Let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) \) = 0.20

Using Bayes’ rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.10 \cdot 0.20) + (0.20 \cdot 0.80) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.16 = 0.18 \]

So, the posterior probability:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.10 \cdot 0.20}{0.18} \approx 0.111 \]

### Summary

Thus, the probabilities are approximately:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.372,
  "business administration": 0.111
}
