To solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem, we need to compute the probabilities accordingly. Here's the breakdown:

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis H given evidence E.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence E given hypothesis H.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis H.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of evidence E (which can be calculated using the law of total probability, but as we don't need to normalize across multiple fields, we can exclude this for proportional comparisons).

Let's denote:
- H1: Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- H2: Adam was enrolled in business administration.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H1)**: Initial guess could be moderate, as agricultural and veterinary science isn't a minority or highly popular field. Let's say \( P(H1) = 0.1 \).
- **P(E|H1)**: Given Adam's profile, it's highly likely that he would excel in this area because of his love for nature, animals, and his empathy. Let's set \( P(E|H1) = 0.9 \).
- **P(E|\neg H1)**: This is the likelihood of Adam's characteristics not matching with agricultural and veterinary science background. It can be estimated as mid-range considering his qualities could fit other fields too. Let's set \( P(E|\neg H1) = 0.4 \).

### Business Administration
- **P(H2)**: Initial guess could be lower here, as Adam's personality seems less suited to a traditional business administration role. Let's say \( P(H2) = 0.05 \).
- **P(E|H2)**: Given Adam's profile, it's less likely he will fit the typical personality traits associated with business administration. Thus, let's set \( P(E|H2) = 0.1 \).
- **P(E|\neg H2)**: This is the likelihood that Adam's characteristics don't match a business administration background. Considering Adam’s profile, it's higher. Let’s set \( P(E|\neg H2) = 0.8 \).

Now we use Bayes' Theorem to calculate:

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1)}{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1) + P(E|\neg H1) \cdot P(\neg H1)} \]

Plug in the values:
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{0.9 \cdot 0.1 + 0.4 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.36} = \frac{0.09}{0.45} = 0.2 \]

### For Business Administration:
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2)}{P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2) + P(E|\neg H2) \cdot P(\neg H2)} \]

Plug in the values:
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.05}{0.1 \cdot 0.05 + 0.8 \cdot 0.95} = \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.76} = \frac{0.005}{0.765} \approx 0.0065 \]

So, the final answers are:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.0065
}
```
