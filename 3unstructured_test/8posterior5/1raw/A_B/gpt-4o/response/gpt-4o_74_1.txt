First, let's break down the probabilities for each field, starting with the field of business administration and then moving on to agricultural and veterinary science.

### Business Administration

1. P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Since this doesn't seem to strongly correlate with Adam's personality sketch, we can consider it relatively low compared to other fields. Let's say P(H) = 0.05.

2. P(E|H): The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Given Adam's empathy, warm heart, and intelligence, some soft skills are relevant to business administration. However, his love for nature, puzzles, and animals makes this less likely. Let's estimate P(E|H) = 0.10.

3. P(E|\neg H): The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in business administration. Given that there are many fields aligned closer to his interests (such as agricultural and veterinary science), let's estimate P(E|\neg H) = 0.90.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

But since P(E) = \( P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \), we get:
\[ P(E) = (0.10 \times 0.05) + (0.90 \times 0.95) = 0.005 + 0.855 = 0.86 \]

So,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.10 \times 0.05}{0.86} \approx 0.0058 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This field is highly relevant to Adam's curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals. Let's say P(H) = 0.10.

2. P(E|H): The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This aligns very closely with his interests and personality. Let's estimate P(E|H) = 0.90.

3. P(E|\neg H): The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This incorporates all other fields, so it would be lower. Let's estimate P(E|\neg H) = 0.50.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

But since P(E) = \( P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \), we get:
\[ P(E) = (0.90 \times 0.10) + (0.50 \times 0.90) = 0.09 + 0.45 = 0.54 \]

So,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.90 \times 0.10}{0.54} \approx 0.1667 \]

Thus, the values are:

{
  "business administration": 0.0058,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.1667
}
