To determine the probabilities we need using Bayes' rule, we will start by estimating the necessary probabilities.

Let's define:

- \( P(H_{\mathrm{BA}}) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|H_{\mathrm{BA}}) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\mathrm{BA}}) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he was not enrolled in business administration.

Similarly, for agricultural and veterinary science:

- \( P(H_{\mathrm{AVS}}) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H_{\mathrm{AVS}}) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\mathrm{AVS}}) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Let's approximate:

1. **Business Administration**:
    - \( P(H_{\mathrm{BA}}) \): Given the number of fields of specialization, let's assume it's around 0.1 (10%), since business administration is a common field.
    - \( P(E|H_{\mathrm{BA}}) \): Adam's personality traits don't necessarily align strongly with typical business administration characteristics. Let's estimate this as 0.1 (10%).
    - \( P(E|\neg H_{\mathrm{BA}}) \): Given that there are many other fields where his traits might be a better fit, let's estimate this as 0.9 (90%).

    Using Bayes’ rule:
    \[
    P(H_{\mathrm{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\mathrm{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\mathrm{BA}})}{P(E)}
    \]
    Since \( P(E) \) is a normalization factor, the exact value is not required here, as we are comparing fields. But we do need it for the exact value:
    
    Simplify \( P(E) \approx P(E|H_{\mathrm{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\mathrm{BA}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\mathrm{BA}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\mathrm{BA}}) \):
    \[
    P(E) \approx (0.1 \cdot 0.1) + (0.9 \cdot 0.9) = 0.01 + 0.81 = 0.82
    \]
    Now, plug it into Bayes’ rule:
    \[
    P(H_{\mathrm{BA}}|E) = \frac{(0.1 \cdot 0.1)}{0.82} \approx 0.0122
    \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - \( P(H_{\mathrm{AVS}}) \): Let's assume it has a lower prior probability, around 0.05 (5%), because it is less common compared to business.
    - \( P(E|H_{\mathrm{AVS}}) \): Adam's personality traits strongly align with this field. Let's set this as 0.8 (80%).
    - \( P(E|\neg H_{\mathrm{AVS}}) \): Given his traits, other fields are less likely to align this strongly. Let's estimate this as 0.2 (20%).

    Using Bayes’ rule:
    \[
    P(H_{\mathrm{AVS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\mathrm{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\mathrm{AVS}})}{P(E)}
    \]
    Simplify \( P(E) \approx P(E|H_{\mathrm{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\mathrm{AVS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\mathrm{AVS}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\mathrm{AVS}}) \):
    \[
    P(E) \approx (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95) = 0.04 + 0.19 = 0.23
    \]
    Now, plug it into Bayes’ rule:
    \[
    P(H_{\mathrm{AVS}}|E) = \frac{(0.8 \cdot 0.05)}{0.23} \approx 0.1739
    \]
