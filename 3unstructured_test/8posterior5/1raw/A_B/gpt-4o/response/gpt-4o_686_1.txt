To solve this, we will use Bayes' rule, which states that:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing Adam's personality sketch, which can be calculated based on all possible fields.

Given this, let's break it down specifically for the two fields:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that a random graduate student is studying agricultural and veterinary science. Given a large number of graduate fields, let's assume a reasonable prior probability, say 0.05 (5%).

- **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam's personality sketch matches someone in this field. Given his love for animals, curiosity about nature, and empathy, it's reasonable to think that he fits well in this field. Let's estimate this to be relatively high, say 0.8 (80%).

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that Adam's personality sketch matches someone not in this field. Since his specific interests strongly align with agricultural and veterinary science, this might be lower. Let's estimate this to be around 0.2 (20%).

### Business Administration

- **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that a random graduate student is studying business administration. Given its popularity, let's assume it's relatively higher, say 0.1 (10%).

- **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam's personality sketch matches someone in this field. Given his interests in puzzles and abstract concepts, he might fit, but not as strongly as in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's estimate this at 0.3 (30%).

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that Adam's personality sketch matches someone not in this field. Since his personality does not strongly indicate business administration, this might be slightly higher. Let's estimate this at 0.4 (40%).

Now we can compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assume \( P(E) \) is influenced by both fields and their complements:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{ag}) \cdot P(H_{ag}) + P(E|\neg H_{ag}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{ag})) \]

\[ P(E) \approx 0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot (1 - 0.05) \]

\[ P(E) \approx 0.04 + 0.19 \]

\[ P(E) \approx 0.23 \]

For **business administration**:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{bus}) \cdot P(H_{bus}) + P(E|\neg H_{bus}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{bus})) \]

\[ P(E) \approx 0.3 \cdot 0.1 + 0.4 \cdot (1 - 0.1) \]

\[ P(E) \approx 0.03 + 0.36 \]

\[ P(E) \approx 0.39 \]

Using these results:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.23} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.04}{0.23} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.1739 \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.39} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.03}{0.39} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0769 \]

So the final probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.1739,
  "business administration": 0.0769
}
```
