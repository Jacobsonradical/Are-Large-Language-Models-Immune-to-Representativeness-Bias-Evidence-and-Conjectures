Let's firstly assess the probabilities for each field.

### Business Administration (H1)

1. **P(H1)**: The probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
    - Business administration is a common graduate field, so we can assign a moderate prior. Let's say **P(H1) = 0.2** (20%).

2. **P(E|H1)**: The probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
    - Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, along with his empathy and love for solving puzzles, don't strongly align with typical characteristics of business administration students. Let's assign a lower likelihood. **P(E|H1) = 0.1** (10%).

3. **P(E|\neg H1)**: The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in business administration.
    - Since P(E|H1) is low, we can assume P(E|\neg H1) would be somewhat higher. **P(E|\neg H1) = 0.25** (25%).

Using Bayes' Rule, we can calculate P(H1|E):

\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1)}{P(E)} \]

We need to estimate P(E):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1) + P(E|\neg H1) \cdot P(\neg H1) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.25 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.2 = 0.22 \]

Now, P(H1|E):

\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.22} \]
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.22} = 0.0909 \]

Approximately:

\[ P(H1|E) \approx 0.09 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H2)

1. **P(H2)**: The probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
    - Given Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, this seems like a high prior. Let's assign **P(H2) = 0.1** (10%).

2. **P(E|H2)**: The probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
    - This field strongly aligns with Adam's interests and traits. Let's assign a high likelihood. **P(E|H2) = 0.8** (80%).

3. **P(E|\neg H2)**: The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
    - Since P(E|H2) is high, we assume P(E|\neg H2) is lower. **P(E|\neg H2) = 0.2** (20%).

Using Bayes' Rule, we can calculate P(H2|E):

\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2)}{P(E)} \]

We need to estimate P(E):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2) + P(E|\neg H2) \cdot P(\neg H2) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.18 = 0.26 \]

Now, P(H2|E):

\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.26} = 0.3077 \]

Approximately:

\[ P(H2|E) \approx 0.31 \]

Putting it all together:

  "business administration": 0.09,
