To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we'll look at the following components:
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given he is in the field \( H \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given he is not in the field \( H \).

Given:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

We will compare the relative probabilities rather than absolute values, making assumptions about the observed probabilities.

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: The prior probability of being enrolled in business administration is relatively high since it is a common field, but we'll assume a moderate prior due to the variety of fields.
- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of having Adam's traits in this field seems low to moderate. Business administration students might have some of these qualities, but traits like strong empathy, deep love for animals, and genuine curiosity about nature are less typical.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of the personality sketch if not in business administration would be similar or even higher, as these traits might better fit fields like science, veterinary science, or other empathetic disciplines.

Assume:
- \( P(H) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \)

Using Bayes’ formula:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)}
\]
Where:
\[
P(E) \approx P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]
\[
P(E) \approx (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) = 0.02 + 0.24 = 0.26
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.26} \approx 0.077
\]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: The prior probability of being in agricultural and veterinary science is moderate to high because it's less common than business but aligns more with Adam's traits.
- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given Adam is in this field is high. Traits like curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy align very well.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of the personality sketch if not in this field is lower, as these specific traits are more aligned with agricultural and veterinary science.

Assume:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \)

Using Bayes’ formula:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)}
\]
Where:
\[
P(E) \approx P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]
\[
P(E) \approx (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.414
\]

The results are summarized below:
