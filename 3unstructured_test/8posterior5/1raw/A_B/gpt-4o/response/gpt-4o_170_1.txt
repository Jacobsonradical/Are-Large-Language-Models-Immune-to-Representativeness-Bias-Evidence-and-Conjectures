First, let's assess the probabilities for each field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam chose this field. Given Adam's deep love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work, it's reasonable to assume a higher baseline probability for this field. Let's estimate **P(H) = 0.3**.
   
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he's in this field is high. His love for animals and nature aligns well with agriculture and veterinary science. Let's estimate **P(E|H) = 0.9**.
   
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he's not in this field should encompass a range of other fields where his personality traits could fit. Given that his nature-based interests strongly point towards this field, we'll estimate a lower probability for other fields. Let's estimate **P(E|¬H) = 0.2**.

Now, using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

So:

\[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.3) + (0.2 \cdot 0.7) = 0.27 + 0.14 = 0.41 \]

Therefore:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.3}{0.41} = \frac{0.27}{0.41} \approx 0.6585 \]

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam chose this field. Given his interest in nature and animals, this seems less likely. Let's estimate **P(H) = 0.1**.
   
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he's in this field is lower because his traits do not strongly align with business administration. Let's estimate **P(E|H) = 0.2**.
   
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he's not in this field should still consider that there are many other fields left. Let's estimate **P(E|¬H) = 0.3**.

Now, using Bayes' rule again:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

So:

\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) = 0.02 + 0.27 = 0.29 \]

Therefore:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.29} = \frac{0.02}{0.29} \approx 0.0689 \]

Here are the final probabilities in the required format:

  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6585,
