To compute the probabilities, let's break down the Bayesian analysis:

**Bayes' Theorem:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis H (the field).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence E given the hypothesis H.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence E given the hypothesis not H.
- \( P(\neg H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis not H (any other field).

For both fields, let's estimate the probabilities:

### **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1)**

**P(H1):** Let's assume a prior probability that a given graduate student is in this field. Since this includes many specific fields but is relatively specialized, we can estimate it to be low. Let's assume:
\[ P(H1) = 0.05 \]

**P(E|H1):** The personality sketch of Adam fits well with someone in agricultural and veterinary sciences (interest in nature, plants, love for animals, etc.). Hence:
\[ P(E|H1) = 0.8 \]

**P(E|\neg H1):** The likelihood of observing this evidence in students from fields other than agricultural and veterinary science would be lower, as the traits described are more specific to this field. Let's assume:
\[ P(E|\neg H1) = 0.1 \]

### **Business Administration (H2)**

**P(H2):** Considering the general popularity and broad applicability of business administration, the prior probability should be higher compared to agricultural sciences. Let's assume:
\[ P(H2) = 0.25 \]

**P(E|H2):** The personality sketch of Adam doesn't fit as well with business administration since it mentions interest in nature and animals, which are less commonly associated with this field. Hence:
\[ P(E|H2) = 0.1 \]

**P(E|\neg H2):** The likelihood of observing this evidence in students outside business administration might be higher, as many other fields can have profiles fitting the given information. Assume:
\[ P(E|\neg H2) = 0.2 \]

Let's calculate the Bayesian probabilities:

### Calculation

**1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1)}{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1) + P(E|\neg H1) \cdot P(\neg H1)} \]
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.1 \cdot 0.95} \]
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.095} \]
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.135} \]
\[ P(H1|E) \approx 0.296 \]

**2. Business Administration:**

\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2)}{P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2) + P(E|\neg H2) \cdot P(\neg H2)} \]
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75} \]
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.025}{0.025 + 0.15} \]
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.025}{0.175} \]
\[ P(H2|E) \approx 0.143 \]
