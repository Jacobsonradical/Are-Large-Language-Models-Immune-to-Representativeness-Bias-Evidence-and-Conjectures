To compute P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need to understand the prior probability of H (P(H)), the likelihood of E given H (P(E|H)), and the likelihood of E given not H (P(E|¬H)).

Let's start with each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **P(H)** (prior probability of being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science): Given Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, it is reasonable to assume a higher prior probability for this field compared to the general population of graduate students. Let's estimate it at 0.3.
   - **P(E|H)** (likelihood of Adam's personality given enrollment in agricultural and veterinary science): Given Adam's traits (curiosity about nature, empathy for animals, and appreciation for hard work), these align well with this field. Let's set this value high at 0.8.
   - **P(E|¬H)** (likelihood of Adam's personality given enrollment in another field): Since his traits are quite specialized, the probability of someone with these traits being in another field would be lower. Let's estimate this at 0.2.

   Using Bayes' rule:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   For simplicity, we can assume P(E) is the normalization factor, but eventually, we care about the relative comparison. Thus:
   \[
   P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24
   \]

2. **Business Administration**:
   - **P(H)** (prior probability of being enrolled in business administration): Considering Adam's personality, it seems less likely he would choose business administration, so let's estimate this lower at 0.1.
   - **P(E|H)** (likelihood of Adam's personality given enrollment in business administration): Adam's traits don't strongly align with business administration. Let's estimate this likelihood relatively low at 0.2.
   - **P(E|¬H)** (likelihood of Adam's personality given enrollment in another field): This remains the same as estimated before, 0.2.

   Using Bayes' rule again:
   \[
   P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \cdot 0.1 = 0.02
   \]

Putting all this together:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.24,
  "business administration": 0.02
}
```

These values are not absolute probabilities but rather normalized values indicating the relative likelihood of Adam being in each field given his personality sketch.
