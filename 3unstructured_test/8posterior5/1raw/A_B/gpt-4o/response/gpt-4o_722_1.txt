To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to consider three values:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is not enrolled in the given field.

Here's the setup:

1. **Business Administration**

- \( P(H)_{BA} \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|H)_{BA} \): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is in business administration.
- \( P(E|\neg H)_{BA} \): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is not in business administration.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

- \( P(H)_{AVS} \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H)_{AVS} \): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H)_{AVS} \): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is not in agricultural and veterinary science.

### Assumptions:

1. Prior Probabilities (`P(H)`):
   - Business Administration: From general knowledge, the likelihood of a student being in business administration is relatively high compared to other fields, so let's assume \( P(H)_{BA} = 0.2 \).
   - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: This field is less common but plausible given Adam's interests, so let's assume \( P(H)_{AVS} = 0.05 \).

2. Likelihoods (`P(E|H)`):
   - Business Administration: The probability of Adam’s traits aligning with someone in business administration might be relatively low due to the nature-oriented interests, so let's assume \( P(E|H)_{BA} = 0.1 \).
   - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: This field is closely related to Adam's traits, so let's assume \( P(E|H)_{AVS} = 0.7 \).

3. Complementary Likelihoods (`P(E|\neg H)`):
   - Business Administration: The probability of Adam’s traits if he is not in business administration could be broader, so let's assume \( P(E|\neg H)_{BA} = 0.4 \).
   - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: The probability of Adam’s traits if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science is lower because his traits are quite specific to this field, so let's assume \( P(E|\neg H)_{AVS} = 0.3 \).

### Calculation:

Bayes' rule: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E| \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

#### Business Administration:

\[ P(E)_{BA} = P(E|H)_{BA} \cdot P(H)_{BA} + P(E|\neg H)_{BA} \cdot P(\neg H)_{BA} \]
\[ = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.4 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ = 0.02 + 0.32 \]
\[ = 0.34 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{P(E|H)_{BA} \cdot P(H)_{BA}}{P(E)_{BA}} \]
\[ = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.34} \]
\[ = \frac{0.02}{0.34} \]
\[ \approx 0.0588 \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[ P(E)_{AVS} = P(E|H)_{AVS} \cdot P(H)_{AVS} + P(E|\neg H)_{AVS} \cdot P(\neg H)_{AVS} \]
\[ = (0.7 \cdot 0.05) + (0.3 \cdot 0.95) \]
\[ = 0.035 + 0.285 \]
\[ = 0.32 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{AVS} = \frac{P(E|H)_{AVS} \cdot P(H)_{AVS}}{P(E)_{AVS}} \]
\[ = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{0.32} \]
\[ = \frac{0.035}{0.32} \]
\[ \approx 0.1094 \]

### Final Answer:
