To compute the conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields, it can be treated as a normalizing constant. Therefore, we focus on comparing the numerator \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

### For Business Administration

- **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration as a graduate student. This is generally lower, considering the number of graduate fields and Adam’s specific interests.
  
  Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

- **P(E|H):** The probability that Adam meets the personality sketch if he is enrolled in Business Administration. Given that Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, this does not strongly correlate with a typical business administration profile.
  
  Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

- **P(E|\neg H):** The probability that Adam meets the personality sketch if he is not enrolled in Business Administration. This would be higher as his interests align more with other fields.
  
  Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.9 \).

Using Bayes’ rule and simplifying with the same \( P(E) \) for normalization:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For Business Administration:

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.1 = 0.01 \]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given his strong interest in plants and animals, this field is more likely to attract someone with his personality sketch.

  Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.3 \).

- **P(E|H):** The probability that Adam meets the personality sketch if he is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Since this field is closely related to his interests, this value is high.

  Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).

- **P(E|\neg H):** The probability that Adam meets the personality sketch if he is not enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. This is generally lower as his sketch fits well with this field.

  Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

Using Bayes’ rule and simplifying with the same \( P(E) \) for normalization:

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.9 \times 0.3 = 0.27 \]

### Normalizing the Probabilities
Let's denote the constants derived as \( K \) shared equally for normalization:

\[ K = P(E) = 0.01 + 0.27 = 0.28 \]

Hence, the posterior probabilities are calculated as follows:

\[ P(H|E, \text{Business Administration}) = \frac{0.01}{0.28} \approx 0.036 \]
\[ P(H|E, \text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) = \frac{0.27}{0.28} \approx 0.964 \]

### Final Answer
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.036,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.964
}
