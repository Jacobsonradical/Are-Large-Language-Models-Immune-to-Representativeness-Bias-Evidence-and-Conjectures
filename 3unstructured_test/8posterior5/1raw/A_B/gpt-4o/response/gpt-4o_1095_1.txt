To determine \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need estimates of the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field. 
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in that field.

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since \( P(E) \) remains constant across comparisons, we can focus on the proportional relationship:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given our discussion, let's make reasonable estimates:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): Graduate students are enrolled in various fields, and business administration is a common field, so assume a moderate prior. Let's set \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given the personality sketch, Adam's interest in nature, empathy, and love for animals are not particularly indicative of business administration. Let's set \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam having this personality sketch if he’s in any other field could reasonably be higher due to the diversity of fields that match. Let's set \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \).

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Assuming fewer students enroll in this field compared to business administration, let's set \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam’s personality sketch strongly matches the characteristics often associated with students in agricultural and veterinary sciences. Let's set \( P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): As before, let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \).

Using these estimates, we compute:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

For business administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.09 \]

Next, we normalize these values. Note that our total does not have to add up to 1, but we should show the relative likelihood.

Let's compile the relative probabilities:

{
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.09} = \frac{0.02}{0.11} \approx 0.18 \),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{0.09}{0.02 + 0.09} = \frac{0.09}{0.11} \approx 0.82 \)
}

So the final approximate normalized answers are:

{
  "business administration": 0.18,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.82
}
