We can use Bayes' Theorem to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \). Bayes' Theorem is stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the evidence.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is not enrolled in that field.

Let's compute these for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

- \( P(H) \): Assuming a relatively low prior since this isn't a vastly populated field among all possible fields, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's personality sketch, the evidence strongly aligns with agricultural and veterinary science because of his love for nature, animals, and empathy. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.80 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): If Adam is enrolled in any other field, the probability of him having such a close match with the detailed personality traits described is lower. Assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.10 \).

Now, we need \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H)) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.80 \cdot 0.05 + 0.10 \cdot 0.95 = 0.04 + 0.095 = 0.135 \]

Applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.05}{0.135} = \frac{0.04}{0.135} \approx 0.296 \]

2. **Business Administration**

- \( P(H) \): Business administration is quite a common field. Assuming a moderate prior, let's use \( P(H) = 0.20 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Adam's personality traits do not align well with this field, except for his intelligence. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.10 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Using the same reasoning as above, \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.10 \).

We can reuse \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = 0.10 \cdot 0.20 + 0.10 \cdot 0.80 = 0.02 + 0.08 = 0.10 \]

Applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.10 \cdot 0.20}{0.10} = \frac{0.02}{0.10} = 0.20 \]

Summarizing the results:
