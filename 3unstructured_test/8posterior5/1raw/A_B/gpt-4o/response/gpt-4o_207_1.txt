To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' Rule to compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study. Bayes' Rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we don't have information about \( P(E) \), we can compare the relative likelihoods of Adam being in each field using the numerator \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \), which is sufficient for computing and comparing the posterior probabilities.

Let's go step-by-step:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Agricultural and veterinary science is a less common field compared to many others, but it's more likely given Adam's personality sketch, so let’s estimate it at 0.05.

2. **P(E|H)**: This is the probability of observing E given that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given his love for nature, plants, animals, and his high empathy, it strongly aligns with this field. Let's estimate this at 0.9.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: This is the probability of observing E given that Adam is not enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. This will be lower considering the uniqueness of the qualities like strong empathy and love for plants and animals, maybe around 0.1.

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration. Business Administration is a very common field, so let’s estimate it at 0.3.

2. **P(E|H)**: This is the probability of observing E given that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration. Knowing Adam's personality traits, this seems much less likely as they don’t tightly align with the attributes needed for business administration. Let's estimate this at 0.1.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: This is the probability of observing E given that Adam is not enrolled in Business Administration. This will have a negligible adjustment effect compared to the agricultural field. Say around 0.3.

Now, calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule. We can compare the numerators since \( P(E) \) is the same for both:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = 0.9 \cdot 0.05 = 0.045
   \]

2. **Business Administration**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = 0.1 \cdot 0.3 = 0.03
   \]

Comparing these values:

\[
\frac{0.045}{0.03} = 1.5
\]

So, Adam is 1.5 times more likely to be enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science compared to Business Administration based on the given personality sketch.

Therefore, the results are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.4
}
```

Note: The exact value does not sum to 1 since these are relative probabilities, but for interpretation: Adam is more likely to be in Agricultural and Veterinary Science compared to Business Administration based on his personality sketch.
