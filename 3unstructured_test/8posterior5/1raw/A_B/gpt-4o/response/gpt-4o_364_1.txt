To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to use Bayes' rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we're working with two fields \( H_1 \) (agricultural and veterinary science) and \( H_2 \) (business administration), let's assess the probabilities as follows:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **Prior probability, \( P(H_1) \):**
   - Let's assume that there is a reasonable chance that a graduate student could be enrolled in this field. We might estimate this at around 0.1 or 10% given many graduate fields of study exist.

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H_1) \):**
   - Given Adam's personality sketch includes a love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as a strong empathy and understanding of dedication, it is highly likely he would be interested in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Let's set this high, at around 0.8 or 80%.

3. **Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H_1) \):**
   - This is the probability of E given that Adam is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his interests, it seems less likely he'd be in fields unrelated to his personality traits. We can estimate this at around 0.2 or 20%.

### Business Administration
1. **Prior probability, \( P(H_2) \):**
   - Business administration is another common field, so we might assign a similar initial estimate of 0.1 or 10%.

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H_2) \):**
   - Business administration does not directly align with Adam's expressed interests and personality traits, which are more focused on nature and animals. Therefore, this likelihood would be lower.
   - Let's set this at around 0.1 or 10%.

3. **Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H_2) \):**
   - This is the probability of E given that Adam is not enrolled in business administration. Since other fields might better align with his traits, this is relatively higher.
   - Let's estimate this at around 0.7 or 70%.

### Calculation:
We can omit calculating \( P(E) \) directly as we are dealing with the ratio. Instead, we can compare \( P(H|E) \) for each field directly.

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]
\[ \propto P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E)} \]
\[ \propto P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) = 0.1 \cdot 0.1 = 0.01 \]

Thus, normalizing these probabilities (so they sum to 1 within our considered fields), we compare \( 0.08 \) and \( 0.01 \):

\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.01} = \frac{0.08}{0.09} \approx 0.89 \]
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.08 + 0.01} = \frac{0.01}{0.09} \approx 0.11 \]
