Let's denote the probability of each hypothesis \( H \) and the evidence \( E \) accordingly.

* \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field.
* \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
* \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in that field.
* \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in the field given the evidence \( E \), which we can compute using Bayes' Rule: 

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since \( P(E) \) is a common denominator, we can simplify the comparison by ignoring \( P(E) \) and focusing on the relative values.

For each field:

### Business Administration

* \( P(H) \) (prior probability): Let's assume the likelihood a graduate student is in business administration is moderate, say 0.2.
* \( P(E|H) \) (likelihood given the field):
  * Adam's curiosity about nature and love for animals are not particularly aligned with business administration.
  * However, his intelligence and puzzle-solving abilities can be valuable.
  * Given this, we assign a moderate value: 0.2.
* \( P(E|\neg H) \) (likelihood given not the field): Given that the personality traits are more suited to other fields such as sciences or agriculture:
  * Let's assume 0.4.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

* \( P(H) \) (prior probability): Given Adam's traits, the likelihood is higher, say 0.3.
* \( P(E|H) \) (likelihood given the field):
  * Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy are highly aligned.
  * Given this, we assign a high value: 0.8.
* \( P(E|\neg H) \) (likelihood given not the field): 
  * This field fits Adam well, so the likelihood of the personality traits given he is in another field is relatively lower, say 0.3.

Now, using Bayes' Rule without the \( P(E) \) factor to get the relative \( P(H|E) \):

### Business Administration:

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|\neg H)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.4} = 0.1 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \cdot P(E|\neg H)}{ \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.3}{0.3}} = \approx 0.24 \]

So, the comparative prior probabilities of Adam being in each field given the evidence:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.24
}
