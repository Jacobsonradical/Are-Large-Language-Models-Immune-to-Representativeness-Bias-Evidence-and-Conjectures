To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we will use Bayes' rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given values are:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch fits given that he is in the given field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch fits given that he is not in the given field.
- \( P(E) \): The marginal likelihood of the personality sketch. \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \)

We'll make some assumptions and estimates for these probabilities:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H)**: Assume that there is a moderately small fraction of students in this field, say, \( 0.1 \).
2. **P(E|H)**: The personality sketch fits very well for someone in this field, so let's say \( 0.9 \).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: For fields other than Agricultural and Veterinary Science, this sketch is less likely to fit. Let's estimate \( 0.3 \).

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) = 0.09 + 0.27 = 0.36 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{0.36} = \frac{0.09}{0.36} = 0.25 \]

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)**: Assume that a larger fraction of students are in this field, say, \( 0.2 \).
2. **P(E|H)**: The personality sketch fits poorly for someone in this field. Let's say \( 0.1 \).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: For fields other than Business Administration, this sketch is still more likely to fit. Let's estimate \( 0.35 \).

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.35 \cdot 0.8) = 0.02 + 0.28 = 0.30 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.30} = \frac{0.02}{0.30} \approx 0.067 \]

So the results are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.25,
  "business administration": 0.067
}
```

These values represent the computed posterior probabilities that Adam was enrolled in the respective fields, given his personality sketch.
