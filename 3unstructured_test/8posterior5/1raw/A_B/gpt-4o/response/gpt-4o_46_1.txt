To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis given the personality sketch \( E \) and using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the complement likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Bayes' rule is:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the small example data and several assumptions:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - **P(H)**: Graduate programs like business administration are common, but not as common as some general fields like education, so let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.15 \).
   - **P(E|H)**: Someone in business administration is likely to have empathy and intelligence, but may not necessarily have a strong love for nature and animals. So, \( P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \).
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: Given there are many fields, the complement probability of having these traits might be moderate, say \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \).

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **P(H)**: This field is less common than others, but since Adam loves nature and animals, let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.05 \).
   - **P(E|H)**: Highly likely given Adamâ€™s traits such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, etc., so \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \).
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: Given exclusion from all fields except agricultural and veterinary science, the probability is lower for remaining fields. So, \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \).

Using Bayes' rule for each hypothesis:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

For **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{0.2 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.17} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.20} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.15 \]

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.3 \cdot 0.95} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.285} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.325} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.123 \]

Putting these into the JSON format:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.15,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.123
}
```

These values are only indicative and based on assumptions about the priors and likelihoods. Adjustments based on more precise data could change the results.
