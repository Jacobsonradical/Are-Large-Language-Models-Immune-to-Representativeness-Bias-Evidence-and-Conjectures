To compute the probability of Adam being enrolled in either "business administration" or "agricultural and veterinary science" given his personality sketch, we use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that hypothesis \( H \) is true given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of evidence \( E \), given by:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Since the field possibilities are numerous and not just the two mentioned, the total may not add up to 1. Let's estimate values for each parameter for both fields:

### Business Administration

1. **P(H):**
   - Let's assume the prior probability \( P(H) \) that Adam was enrolled in business administration is relatively low because his personality sketch does not strongly suggest it. Let's assign \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.05 \).

2. **P(E|H):**
   - The evidence \( E \) being personality traits, let's assume the likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \) of business administration students having Adam's traits is low. Let's assign \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H):**
   - The likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \) could be higher due to more suitable fields than business. Let's assign \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.5 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \]

Let's assume \( P(E) \) is approximated as a constant for simplifying here.

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H):**
   - Let's assume that the prior probability \( P(H) \) that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is higher given his traits. Let's assign \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.2 \).

2. **P(E|H):**
   - The likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \) is high because his personality aligns well with students in this field. Let's assign \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.8 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H):**
   - The likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \) is lower due to fewer suitable fields than agricultural/veterinary science. Let's assign \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.3 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}})}{P(E)} \]

Let's assume \( P(E) \) is approximated as a constant for simplifying here.

\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

Given that \( P(E) \) approximates the total probability of those fields:
\[ P(E) \approx (0.1 \cdot 0.05) + (0.5 \cdot 0.95) + (0.8 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) \]

Now, calculating the actual Bayes rule results:

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.05}{(0.1 \cdot 0.05 + 0.8 \cdot 0.2 + P(\text{other fields}))} \approx 0.025 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{(0.1 \cdot 0.05 + 0.8 \cdot 0.2 + P(\text{other fields}))} \approx 0.16 \]

So, considering Adam's personality sketch and the given fields:

{
  "business administration": "0.025",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.16"
}
