To compute \(P(H|E)\), we will use Bayes' Rule, which can be expressed as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We will need estimates for \(P(H)\), \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E|\neg H)\). Note that \(P(E)\) can be computed as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Since we are not provided with exact values and need to provide a relative sense, I'll make some reasonable assumptions based on the information given. 

### Business Administration
**1. \(P(H)\)**: The prior probability that any given graduate student is in Business Administration.
Let's assume this is around 0.15 (Graduate Business programs are common but not the most common).

**2. \(P(E|H)\)**: The likelihood of having Adam's personality if he is a Business Administration student.
Given the described traits, it doesn't strongly align with the characteristics typically associated with Business programs (e.g., teamwork and leadership often emphasized over puzzles and empathy). Let's estimate this at 0.05.

**3. \(P(E|\neg H)\)**: The likelihood of having Adam's personality if he is not a Business Administration student.
We'll assume students in other fields, especially non-business ones, more likely align with his traits on average. Let's estimate this at 0.2.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
**1. \(P(H)\)**: The prior probability that any given graduate student is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
This might be less common than Business Administration. Let's assume this is around 0.1.

**2. \(P(E|H)\)**: The likelihood of having Adam's personality if he is an Agricultural or Veterinary Science student.
Adam's traits highly align with what is expected in this field (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy). Let's estimate this at 0.7.

**3. \(P(E|\neg H)\)**: The likelihood of having Adam's personality if he is not an Agricultural and Veterinary Science student.
Assuming the given traits are less common outside these fields, let's set this at 0.1.

### Calculation:
For Business Administration:
\[
P(E) = (0.05 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.0075 + 0.17 = 0.1775
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.15}{0.1775} \approx 0.042
\]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[
P(E) = (0.7 \times 0.1) + (0.1 \times 0.9) = 0.07 + 0.09 = 0.16
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.1}{0.16} \approx 0.438
\]

Thus:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.042,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.438
}
