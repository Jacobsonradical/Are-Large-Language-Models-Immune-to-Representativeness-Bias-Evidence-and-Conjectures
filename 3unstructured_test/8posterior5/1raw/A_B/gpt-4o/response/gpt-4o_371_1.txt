To calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to consider the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the marginal likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \). 

Let's break it down:

1. **Business Administration**
    - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Generally, assuming a fairly distributed graduate population, let's assign this a value of 0.2 for being a plausible yet less likely field for someone with his described interests.
    - \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality traits \( E \) given that Adam is in business administration. Given Adam's characteristics, it doesn't strongly align with typical business administration interests. We'll assign this a value of 0.1.
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality traits \( E \) given that Adam is not in this field. Since there are many fields where Adam's traits might fit better, we'll assign a value of 0.5.

    Using Bayes' Rule:
    \[
    P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
    = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.4} = \frac{0.02}{0.42} \approx 0.048
    \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
    - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This aligns better with his interests. Let's assign it a value of 0.3.
    - \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality traits \( E \) given that Adam is in this field. Adam's personality traits fit very well into this field. We'll assign this a value of 0.8.
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality traits \( E \) given that Adam is not in this field. Given the prior, we might expect a smaller number. We'll assign a value of 0.3.

    Using Bayes' Rule:
    \[
    P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
    = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.3}{0.8 \cdot 0.3 + 0.3 \cdot 0.7} = \frac{0.24}{0.24 + 0.21} = \frac{0.24}{0.45} \approx 0.533
    \]

Using the above calculations, the answers are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.048,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.533
}
