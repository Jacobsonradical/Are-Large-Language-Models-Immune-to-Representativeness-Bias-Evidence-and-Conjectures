Let's evaluate each hypothesis (H) and how the evidence (E) aligns with it. 

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that any given graduate student is studying business administration. Considering business administration is a popular field, we can estimate this to be about 0.2.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of the evidence given that Adam is a business administration student. The evidence includes a strong curiosity about nature, a love for animals, and empathy, all of which are not typically associated with business administration students. Thus, this probability might be quite low, say 0.05.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of the evidence given that Adam is not a business administration student is harder to estimate but given the traits listed, they might fit many other fields better. We can assume it to be relatively higher, say 0.1.

Using Bayes’ rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.2}{0.1} = \frac{0.01}{0.1} = 0.1 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that any given graduate student is studying agricultural and veterinary science. This field is less common than business administration, but still has a dedicated group of students. Estimate 0.1.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of the evidence given that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy, this seems to fit very well. So, we might estimate this to be 0.8.
- **P(E| ¬H)**: For students not in agricultural and veterinary science, these traits are less common. Estimate this to be lower than the corresponding for ¬business administration. So, about 0.05.

Using Bayes’ rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.05 + 0.8 * 0.1} = \frac{0.08}{0.13} \approx 0.615 \]

Therefore, the values are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.615
}
