To arrive at \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis, we need to use Bayes' Theorem, which is stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll proceed by estimating the values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

### Business Administration

1. \( P(H) \) for Business Administration:
   - Let's assume the prior probability that a graduate student might be in business administration is relatively moderate, say \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

2. \( P(E|H) \) for Business Administration:
   - Given Adam's traits, the probability that he fits the personality sketch if enrolled in business administration is likely low because his interests and personality are less aligned with business administration. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \):
   - This represents the probability that Adam fits the personality sketch given that he is in any other field. Since his personality sketch aligns well with fields like agricultural and veterinary science, assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. \( P(H) \) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
   - Assume the prior probability that a graduate student might be in agricultural and veterinary science is moderate, say \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

2. \( P(E|H) \) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
   - Given Adam's traits, the probability that he fits the personality sketch if enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is high because his interests and personality align well with this field. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \):
   - This represents the probability that Adam fits the personality sketch given that he is in any other field. Since his personality sketch aligns well with fields like agricultural and veterinary science but less with others like business administration, assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \).

### Calculation

Now, using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

We will assume a simple scenario where \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) \).

#### For Business Administration:
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.6 \cdot 0.8) = 0.02 + 0.48 = 0.5 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{business} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.5} = \frac{0.02}{0.5} = 0.04 \]

#### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.6 \cdot 0.9) = 0.08 + 0.54 = 0.62 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{agri\&vet} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.62} = \frac{0.08}{0.62} \approx 0.129 \]

So, the values are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.04,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.129
}
```
