Sure, to solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam enrolling in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the given personality sketch if Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the given personality sketch if Adam is not enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of the personality sketch, which is influenced by all possible fields Adam could be enrolled in.

Let's assign the prior probabilities based on available general information about graduate fields of specialization:

1. **Business Administration**: Generally, many students pursue business administration, so we'll assign a general prior probability.
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This is a more specialized field. Given Adam's personality sketch, there seems to be a stronger fit.

### Assigning values subjectively:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): 0.2 (20% prior probability for business administration)
   - \( P(E|H) \): 0.1 (10% probability for having the given personality sketch in business administration; business students may care about hard work but not necessarily nature and animals)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): 0.2 (20% probability for the personality sketch among other fields)

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): 0.05 (5% prior probability for agricultural and veterinary science, since fewer students choose this field)
   - \( P(E|H) \): 0.6 (60% probability for the personality sketch matching the field of agricultural and veterinary science closely; curiosity about nature and animals fits well)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): 0.1 (10% probability for the personality sketch among other fields)

### Calculation using Bayes' theorem:

1. **Business Administration**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)}
   \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)}
   \]

Since \( P(E) \) is common for both posterior probabilities, we can ignore it for comparison purposes. Thus, we can normalize the values to ensure they are comparable.

\[
\text{Normalization factor} = P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.6 \cdot 0.05) = 0.02 + 0.03 = 0.05
\]

Now plug back in for each \(P(H|E)\):

1. **Business Administration**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.05} = 0.4
   \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.05} = 0.6
   \]

Therefore, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
```
