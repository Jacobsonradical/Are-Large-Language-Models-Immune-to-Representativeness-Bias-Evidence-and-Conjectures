To calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll assume \( P(H) \) (the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field) and estimate values for \( P(E|H) \) (the likelihood of the personality sketch given each hypothesis) and \( P(E|\neg H) \) (the likelihood of the personality sketch given not the hypothesis). We'll also need \( P(E) \), which can be computed as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Since there are other fields, \( P(\neg H) \) will not simply be \( 1 - P(H) \). For simplicity, we will make reasonable assumptions:

1. Assume equal priors for both fields and other fields summing to a reasonable total.
2. Estimate likelihoods based on Adam's interests and traits.

### Business Administration:

1. **P(H)**: Let's assume a prior probability of 0.1 (10%) given that graduates can enroll in many different fields.
2. **P(E|H)**: Business administration might be less likely given Adam's love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles. We’ll assume a low likelihood, say 0.05.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: We'll estimate this as the average likelihood of traits which are not specific to the hypothesis, say 0.5.

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.05 \cdot 0.1 + 0.5 \cdot (1 - 0.1) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.005 + 0.45 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.455 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{0.455} \approx 0.011 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

1. **P(H)**: Assume a higher prior probability of 0.2 (20%) because of Adam's strong interest in nature and animals.
2. **P(E|H)**: This field is much more aligned with Adam’s traits. We’ll assume a high likelihood, say 0.9.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Again average likelihood, let's assume 0.5.

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.9 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot (1 - 0.2) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.18 + 0.4 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.58 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.2}{0.58} \approx 0.310 \]

### Combining Results:

The probability values are as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.011,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.310
}
```

These results suggest that given Adam's personality sketch, he is significantly more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration.
