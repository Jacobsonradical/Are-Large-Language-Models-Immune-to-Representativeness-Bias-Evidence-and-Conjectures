To answer the question using Bayesian inference, we need to estimate the following probabilities for each field:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in that specific field.
2. \( P(E | H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is in that field.
3. \( P(E | \neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is not in that field.
4. \( P(H | E) \): The posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in that field given his personality traits, which we compute using Bayes' rule.

Bayes' rule formula:
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Although \( P(E) \) (the marginal probability of observing Adam's personality traits) can be somewhat complex to calculate without more data, we can simplify by comparing the relative probabilities across the two fields.

Assumptions:
1. Let’s assume \( P(H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science might be relatively low, given it’s a specialized field.
2. \( P(H) \) for business administration might be higher, given it’s a more common field.
3. Adam’s personality traits like empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science, suggesting a higher \( P(E | H) \) for this field. 
4. These traits seem less aligned with business administration, suggesting a lower \( P(E | H) \) for this field relative to agricultural sciences but still nonzero because abstract thinking and problem-solving also apply to business contexts.
5. \(P(E | \neg H)\) would consider the prevalence of Adam-like traits in all other fields combined.

Let’s assign some reasonable but arbitrary values here for \( P(H) \), \( P(E | H) \), and \(P(E | \neg H)\).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. \( P(H) = 0.1 \) (10% chance a random graduate student is in this field)
2. \( P(E | H) = 0.7 \) (70% chance Adam’s traits fit this field)
3. \( P(E | \neg H) = 0.1 \) (10% chance Adam’s traits fit other fields equally well)

### Business Administration
1. \( P(H) = 0.2 \) (20% chance a random grad student is in this field)
2. \( P(E | H) = 0.2 \) (20% chance Adam’s traits fit this field)
3. \( P(E | \neg H) = 0.1 \) (10% chance Adam’s traits fit other fields equally well)

### Applying Bayes' Rule
#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H | E) \approx \frac{0.07}{P(E)} \]

#### Business Administration
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H | E) \approx \frac{0.04}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is common and acts as a normalizing factor, we can compare the numerators directly.

Relative weighting:
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.07
- Business Administration: 0.04

Normalizing these to express them as probabilities that add up based on just these two fields:
\[ P(H_{agricultural} | E) \approx \frac{0.07}{0.07 + 0.04} \approx 0.636 \]
\[ P(H_{business} | E) \approx \frac{0.04}{0.07 + 0.04} \approx 0.364 \]
