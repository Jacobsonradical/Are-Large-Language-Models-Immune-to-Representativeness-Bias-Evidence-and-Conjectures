To estimate \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to:

1. Assign an initial probability \( P(H) \) for each hypothesis \( H \).
2. Estimate \( P(E|H) \) - the probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is in that field.
3. Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) - the probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is not in that field.
4. Apply Bayes' theorem: 

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we are comparing multiple fields, we won't compute \( P(E) \) directly, but rather focus on the relative values.

Here is the assessment for each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Initial Probability \( P(H) \):**
   Since there are many possible fields, letâ€™s assign \( P(H) \) conservatively for each field, such as 0.1 (as a simplification).

2. **Probability \( P(E|H) \):**
   Given Adam's deep love for animals, appreciation of nature and plants, and empathy, it's quite high that these traits fit well with agricultural and veterinary science.
   Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) as 0.8.

3. **Probability \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   Considering the diversity of graduate fields and the fact that these characteristics can also be relevant to some other fields but less directly, let's estimate this as 0.3.

### Business Administration

1. **Initial Probability \( P(H) \):**
   Let's assign this the same initial probability of 0.1.

2. **Probability \( P(E|H) \):**
   The personality sketch suggests a strong disconnect with business administration, which typically focuses more on financial, managerial, and operational capabilities rather than empathy, animals, and nature.
   Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) for business administration as 0.1.

3. **Probability \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   Using the same logic as above, we have \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

### Applying Bayes' Rule:

For "agricultural and veterinary science":

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \]

For "business administration":

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.1 = 0.01 \]

Given the relative proportions, the normalized results are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08 / (0.08 + 0.01) = 0.888,
  "business administration": 0.01 / (0.08 + 0.01) = 0.112
}

However, since the absolute probabilities are what we need:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08,
  "business administration": 0.01
}
