To solve this problem using Bayes' rule, let's denote:

- \( H_{\text{bus}} \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( H_{\text{agri}} \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( E \) as the personality sketch of Adam.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

1. **Business Administration**

For business administration (\( H_{\text{bus}} \)):
- **Prior probability (\( P(H_{\text{bus}}) \))**: Business administration is a common field, but given Adam's interests and personality traits, it feels less likely compared to agricultural and veterinary science. Let's estimate it at 0.1.
- **Likelihood (\( P(E|H_{\text{bus}}) \))**: Adam's personality traits (interest in nature, love for animals, etc.) seem less aligned with business administration. Let's estimate it at 0.05.
- **Complement likelihood (\( P(E|\neg H_{\text{bus}}) \))**: This is the chance of seeing Adam's personality sketch among people not in business administration. Given the specific traits, this value might be relatively high compared to the alignment with business administration. Let's estimate it at 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_{\text{bus}}|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

For agricultural and veterinary science (\( H_{\text{agri}} \)):
- **Prior probability (\( P(H_{\text{agri}}) \))**: Given Adam's interests, this field seems very likely. Let's estimate it at 0.3.
- **Likelihood (\( P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) \))**: Adam's personality sketch fits well with this field. Let's estimate it at 0.8.
- **Complement likelihood (\( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agri}}) \))**: This would be the chance of seeing Adam's traits among people not in this field. It might be lower given the fit between his personality and this field. Let's estimate it at 0.2.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \]

To find the exact values using the total probability \( P(E) \), we need the normalizing constant. However, we can compare them proportionally ignoring the denominator as it cancels out when comparing two hypotheses.

The relative probabilities can therefore be computed as:
\[ P(H_{\text{bus}}|E) \propto 0.05 \cdot 0.1 = 0.005 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \]

Finally, normalizing these values:
\[ P(H_{\text{bus}}|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.24} \approx 0.0208 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) = \frac{0.24}{0.005 + 0.24} \approx 0.9792 \]

So the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0208,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.9792
}
