To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis, we need to use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability (the probability of H before taking E into account).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood (the probability of E given H).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) represents the probability of E given that H is false.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of E, which is found using the law of total probability.

Since the total does not need to add up to 1, we will ignore \( P(E) \) and focus on the relative values of \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) compared to their alternatives.

1. **Business Administration**

- **P(H)** (prior probability of a graduate student enrolled in business administration): This is moderate because business programs are quite common but not overwhelming.
- **P(E|H)** (probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in business administration):
  - Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants: unlikely.
  - Enjoys solving puzzles: moderate, problem-solving is useful in business.
  - Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals: these are less related to business skills.
  - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts: moderate, as business does require cognitive skills.
  - Appreciation for hard work and dedication: likely in business students.

Given these factors, \( P(E|H) \) for business administration is relatively low.

- **P(E|\neg H):** Moderate, as Adam's traits are generally not highly correlated with business fields, but they aren't impossible either. 

Using these qualitative assessments, we can hypothesize that \( P(H|E) \) for business administration is relatively low.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

- **P(H)** (prior probability of a graduate student enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science): This is lower compared to business, as the enrollment in these fields is specialized.
- **P(E|H)** (probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science):
  - Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants: highly likely.
  - Enjoys solving puzzles: highly relevant for scientific study.
  - Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals: aligns perfectly.
  - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts: essential for science.
  - Appreciation for hard work and dedication: absolutely necessary in these fields.

Given these factors, \( P(E|H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science is very high.

- **P(E|\neg H):** Lower, as other fields typically don't align as well with Adam's traits.

Given these qualitative assessments, we can hypothesize that \( P(H|E) \) for agricultural and veterinary science is relatively high.

Based on the qualitative assessments, here are the numerical estimates in the required format:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.9
}

These values are estimated based on how well Adam's personality sketch matches with the fields in question.
