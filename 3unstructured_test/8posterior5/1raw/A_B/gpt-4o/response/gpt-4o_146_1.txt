To calculate the probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E|\neg H) \). Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Firstly, let's assign some reasonable values to \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)**: Probability that Adam would enroll in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
- **P(E|H)**: Probability that Adam would have the given personality sketch if he were enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability that Adam would have the given personality sketch if he were not enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, we can estimate these probabilities as follows:

- \( P(H) \): Reasonably high due to the match with Adam's personality.
  \[
  P(H) \approx 0.3
  \]
- \( P(E|H) \): High likelihood that someone in Agricultural and Veterinary Science would have Adam's personality.
  \[
  P(E|H) \approx 0.8
  \]
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Lower likelihood but not negligible because these personality traits can be present in students from other fields.
  \[
  P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2
  \]

### Business Administration

- **P(H)**: Probability that Adam would enroll in Business Administration.
- **P(E|H)**: Probability that Adam would have the given personality sketch if he were enrolled in Business Administration.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability that Adam would have the given personality sketch if he were not enrolled in Business Administration.

Considering Adam's traits are less commonly associated with Business Administration:

- \( P(H) \): Lower because Adam's traits donâ€™t align closely with typical Business Administration students.
  \[
  P(H) \approx 0.05
  \]
- \( P(E|H) \): Lower likelihood that someone in Business Administration would have Adam's personality.
  \[
  P(E|H) \approx 0.2
  \]
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): As previously, reasonably since other fields might share these traits.
  \[
  P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2
  \]

### Calculating \(P(H|E)\)

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)}
\]

For Business Administration:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)}
\]

Since \(P(E) \approx P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)\):

Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[
P(E) \approx (0.8 \cdot 0.3) + (0.2 \cdot 0.7) = 0.24 + 0.14 = 0.38
\]
\[
P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.3}{0.38} \approx 0.632
\]

Business Administration:
\[
P(E) \approx (0.2 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95) = 0.01 + 0.19 = 0.2
\]
\[
P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.05}{0.2} = 0.05
\]

### Final probabilities

Therefore:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.632,
  "business administration": 0.05
}
```
