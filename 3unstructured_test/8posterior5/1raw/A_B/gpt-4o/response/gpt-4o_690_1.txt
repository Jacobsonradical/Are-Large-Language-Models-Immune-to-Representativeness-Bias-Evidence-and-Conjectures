To solve for \( P(H|E) \) for Business Administration and Agricultural and Veterinary Science, we need to follow the Bayesian formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \), we can assume certain values based on the given personality description.

Let's consider the personality sketch \( E \). Given that Adam has a strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy, it seems more likely he would be inclined towards Agricultural and Veterinary Science rather than Business Administration. With that context, let's assign some approximate values to \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

### Business Administration
- **P(H):** The prior probability that a random graduate student is studying Business Administration. Let's assume it's around 0.2.
- **P(E|H):** The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is studying Business Administration. Considering his traits, this is likely lower, say 0.1.
- **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is NOT studying Business Administration. Given his traits, this is relatively high, let's assume 0.9.

Now, compute \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.1 \times 0.2 + 0.9 \times 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.72 = 0.74 \]

Now, apply Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.74} \approx 0.027 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H):** The prior probability that a random graduate student is studying Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Let's assume it's around 0.1.
- **P(E|H):** The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is studying Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Considering his love for nature and animals, this is very high, say 0.9.
- **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is NOT studying Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Let's assume this is lower, say 0.6 (since not all fields outside Agri/Vet would correlate well with his traits).

Now, compute \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.9 \times 0.1 + 0.6 \times 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.09 + 0.54 = 0.63 \]

Now, apply Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 \times 0.1}{0.63} \approx 0.143 \]

Thus, the final probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.027,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.143
}
