To compute the probabilities using Bayes' rule, we need to make some reasonable estimates about the prior probability \(P(H)\), the likelihood \(P(E|H)\), and the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis is false \(P(E|\neg H)\). 

Let's do an evaluation for each of the given fields:

### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

#### Estimations:
- \(P(H)\): The prior probability of a graduate student being in agricultural and veterinary science. Assume this is reasonably common, so let's estimate \(P(H) = 0.10\).
- \(P(E|H)\): The probability of the evidence (Adam's personality sketch) given he is in agricultural and veterinary science would be quite high because his traits fit well with this field. Let's estimate \(P(E|H) = 0.7\).
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of the evidence given he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Since his traits also fit reasonably well with several other fields, let's assume \(P(E| \neg H) = 0.3\).

Now, using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Calculating \(P(E)\):
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.10) + (0.3 \cdot 0.90) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.07 + 0.27 = 0.34 \]

Thus, the posterior probability:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.10}{0.34} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.206 \]

### 2. Business Administration

#### Estimations:
- \(P(H)\): The prior probability of a graduate student being in business administration. Assume this is a relatively common field, so let's estimate \(P(H) = 0.20\).
- \(P(E|H)\): The probability of the evidence given he is in business administration would be lower compared to agricultural and veterinary science as not all his traits fit well here. Let's estimate \(P(E|H) = 0.2\).
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of the evidence given he is not in business administration. Since traits like empathy and a love for animals are less aligned with business administration, \(P(E|\neg H)\) should be somewhat higher. Let's assume \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.4\).

Now, using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Calculating \(P(E)\):
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.20) + (0.4 \cdot 0.80) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.32 = 0.36 \]

Thus, the posterior probability:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.20}{0.36} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.111 \]

So, the final computed probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.206,
  "business administration": 0.111
}
