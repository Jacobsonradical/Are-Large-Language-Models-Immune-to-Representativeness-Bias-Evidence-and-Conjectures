To calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' theorem, we need to use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis,
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis,
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis,
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

Let's estimate these probabilities for each field of study:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): The general prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science can be estimated as relatively low as it is a specialized field. Let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.05 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's personality sketch, including his genuine curiosity about nature, plants, animals, and empathy, it is highly likely he fits into agricultural and veterinary science. Assigning a high likelihood \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch occurring in fields other than agricultural and veterinary science, while not zero, will be lower than the likelihood given \( H \). Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.1 \).

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): The general prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in business administration is relatively higher compared to a specialized field like agricultural science. Let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's personality sketch, it is less likely that someone with such a profile would fit seamlessly into business administration. Assigning a lower likelihood \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch occurring in fields other than business administration can be relatively higher, given the general wording of his traits compared to specifically business traits like competitiveness or leadership. Assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) \text{ for agricultural and veterinary science} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H|E) \text{ for business administration} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

To normalize \( P(E) \), we consider more hypotheses, but for this specific answer just relative judgments:

- \( P(E) \approx P(E|H_{\text{agricultural}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural}}) + P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}}) + \ldots \)
- Here, we'll focus on the relative comparison of the two fields.

Thus simplifying:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.1 \cdot 0.2} \approx \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.02} \approx 0.67 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.1 \cdot 0.2} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.04 + 0.02} \approx 0.33 \]

So the estimated probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.67,
  "business administration": 0.33
}
