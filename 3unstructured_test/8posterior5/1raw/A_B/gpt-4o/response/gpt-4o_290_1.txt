To apply Bayes' rule, we need to use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since there are other possible fields of specialization, we don't have to compute \( P(E) \), as it would cancel out when comparing the relative probabilities.

Let's denote and assume the following:
1. \(P(H_{\text{BA}})\): Prior probability that Adam is studying business administration.
2. \(P(H_{\text{AG}})\): Prior probability that Adam is studying agricultural and veterinary science.
3. \(P(E|H_{\text{BA}})\): Probability that Adam's personality aligns with business administration.
4. \(P(E|H_{\text{AG}})\): Probability that Adam’s personality aligns with agricultural and veterinary science.
5. \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}})\) and \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{AG}})\): Probabilities that Adam's personality doesn’t align with the specific field when considering the opposite field.

### Assumptions and Prior Probabilities:
1. **Prior probabilities**: Without specific data, assume priors are influenced by the general distribution of graduate students. Let's assume a balanced but not equal prior for simplicity.
   - \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.05 \): Small probability due to Adam’s personality.
   - \( P(H_{\text{AG}}) = 0.2 \): Higher probability given Adam's interest in nature and love for animals.

### Likelihoods:
2. **Likelihoods based on personality**:
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.05 \): Personality fit is low for business administration.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{AG}}) = 0.7 \): Good personality fit for agricultural and veterinary science.

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - Considering that \(\neg H_{\text{BA}}\) includes students not in business administration, we estimate high as it's more aligned with other fields.
     - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.5 \)
   - Considering that \(\neg H_{\text{AG}}\) includes all other fields, we estimate lower compared to H_AG.
     - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AG}}) = 0.1 \)

### Posterior Calculations:
Following the formulas,

1. For **Business Administration**:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)}
   \]
   - Estimation for P(E): Assuming normalization is not needed:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \approx \frac{0.05 \times 0.05}{0.5} = \frac{0.0025}{0.5} = 0.005
   \]

2. For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{AG}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AG}}) P(H_{\text{AG}})}{P(E)}
   \]
   - Estimation for P(E): Assuming normalization is not needed:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{AG}}|E) \approx \frac{0.7 \times 0.2}{0.1} = \frac{0.14}{0.1} = 1.4
   \]

**Adjusted Scale**: Likelihood for AG must be capped to realistic level. Normalize to sum probabilities < 1.

### Final Answer:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.005,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```
With the normalization consideration, AG has a dominant probability of alignment to Adam’s traits among options.
