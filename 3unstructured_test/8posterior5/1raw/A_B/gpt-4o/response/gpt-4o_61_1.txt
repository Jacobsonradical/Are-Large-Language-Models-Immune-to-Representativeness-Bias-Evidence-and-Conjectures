To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Let's assess these probabilities qualitatively before assigning numerical values. 

### Business Administration

- **P(H)** (the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration):
  - Business administration is a common graduate field, so let's assume there is a moderate to high prior probability.
  - Prior (qualitative guess): Medium (say around 0.3).

- **P(E|H)** (the probability of E given H, i.e., Adam's personality given he is in business administration):
  - While some attributes like high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts could fit, other attributes like love for nature and animals don't traditionally align with business administration.
  - Likelihood (qualitative guess): Low (say around 0.1).

- **P(E|\neg H)** (the probability of E given not H, i.e., given that Adam is not in business administration):
  - The negation of business administration suggests various fields not involving typical business traits, so it could fit multiple other fields better.
  - Complimentary likelihood (qualitative guess): Medium (say around 0.6).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)** (the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science):
  - Agricultural and veterinary science is less common but not unlikely for someone with a deep love for nature and animals.
  - Prior (qualitative guess): Medium to low (say around 0.2).

- **P(E|H)** (the probability of E given H, i.e., Adam's personality given he is in agricultural and veterinary science):
  - This field strongly aligns with Adam's interest in nature, animals, and appreciation for hard work.
  - Likelihood (qualitative guess): High (say around 0.9).

- **P(E|\neg H)** (the probability of E given not H, i.e., given that Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science):
  - Given Adam could be in various other fields, the characteristics overall fit less clearly into non-agricultural/veterinary fields.
  - Complimentary likelihood (qualitative guess): Medium (say around 0.6).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

### Normalizing (Optional)

Though not asked explicitly, we normalize over the fields if we want more consolidated probabilities:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{ba}) \cdot P(H_{ba}) + P(E|H_{avs}) \cdot P(H_{avs}) \]
\[ P(E) \approx (0.1 \cdot 0.3) + (0.9 \cdot 0.2) \approx 0.03 + 0.18 = 0.21 \]

Now compute the normalized \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H_{ba}|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.3}{0.21} = 0.143 \]
\[ P(H_{avs}|E) \approx \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.2}{0.21} = 0.857 \]

Therefore, the probability statements are:

{
  "business administration": "0.143",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.857"
}
