Sure, let's go through the steps to compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields and only serves as a normalizing constant, we'll mainly focus on calculating the numerator, \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \), for each hypothesis.

**1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

- \( P(H) \): This is the prior probability that a randomly selected graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Assuming equal likelihood among various fields but slightly higher given Adam's traits, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.10 \).
  
- \( P(E|H) \): Given that Adam's personality sketch includes a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, love for animals, and a deep appreciation for hard work, it's reasonable to assume this fits well with agricultural and veterinary science. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.80 \).

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing E given Adam is not pursuing agricultural and veterinary science. Given the specific relevance of his traits to agricultural and veterinary science, let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.80 \times 0.10 = 0.08 \]

**2. Business Administration:**

- \( P(H) \): This is the prior probability that a randomly selected graduate student is enrolled in business administration. Assuming a higher enrollment in business administration programs, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.20 \).
  
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's traits, business administration appears to be a less likely match, since his interests and personality align more with nature and animals than with business. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.10 \).

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): As in the first case, this will be influenced by the specificity of the traits to other fields. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \) due to the broader spectrum of non-relevant programs.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.10 \times 0.20 = 0.02 \]
