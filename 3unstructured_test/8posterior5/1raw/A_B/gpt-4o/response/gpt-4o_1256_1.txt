To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the fields of "business administration" and "agricultural and veterinary science," we first need to determine the following:

1. \( P(H) \) - The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \) - The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in the given field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in the given field.
4. Using Bayes' Rule: \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \), where \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch.

Given the information, let's assign some reasonable estimates for these probabilities.

### Business Administration

1. **\( P(H) \):** The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in business administration is relatively high as it's a common field. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

2. **\( P(E|H):** The given personality sketch (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, etc.) does not strongly align with typical traits associated with business administration students. Let's set \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H):** This is a bit tricky, but generally, these traits may be more common in other fields of graduate study compared to business administration. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.02}{P(E)} \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **\( P(H) \):** The prior probability of a graduate student being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is somewhat lower compared to business administration. Letâ€™s assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).

2. **\( P(E|H):** The given personality sketch aligns well with traits expected in students of agricultural and veterinary science. Let's set \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H):** This would be the probability of having the personality sketch if Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Since these traits can also be found in some other fields, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.25 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} = \frac{0.035}{P(E)} \]

Now, to complete the calculations, we would need \( P(E) \), the overall probability of the personality sketch. However, since we only need the relative likelihoods for comparison:

```json
{
  "business administration": (0.02 / P(E)),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": (0.035 / P(E))
}
```

Calculation without \( P(E) \):

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.035
}
```

Hence, Adam is more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration based on the given personality sketch.
