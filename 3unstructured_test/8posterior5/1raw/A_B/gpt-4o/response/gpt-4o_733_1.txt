To solve this problem, we'll need to use Bayes' theorem, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing evidence \( E \) given that hypothesis \( H \) is true.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of observing evidence \( E \).

Now let's calculate these values for both fields.

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H_{BA}) \):**

The base rate for graduate students in business administration relative to all graduate students is typically high. Let's arbitrarily assign \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.2 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{BA}) \):**

A student with a personality sketch like Adam's (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, high intelligence) is less likely to be in a business administration field, as these traits are more aligned with nature-oriented or social service professions. Thus, we'll set \( P(E|H_{BA}) \) to a relatively low value, such as 0.1.

3. **Likelihood given not in Business Administration \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \):**

If Adam is not in business administration, he could be in many other fields where his personality traits are more common. Therefore, \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \) should be higher, perhaps around 0.3.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H_{AVS}) \):**

The base rate for students in agricultural and veterinary science is likely lower than in business administration. Let's assign \( P(H_{AVS}) = 0.05 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \):**

Adamâ€™s traits align well with this field, given his love for nature, animals, empathy, and understanding of hard work. Set \( P(E|H_{AVS}) = 0.7 \).

3. **Likelihood given not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \):**

If Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science, he could be in many other fields. Hence, \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \) is also around 0.3.

### Probability of Evidence \( P(E) \):

To compute \( P(E) \), we need to consider all possible hypotheses fields.
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{BA})P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA})P(\neg H_{BA}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.1)(0.2) + (0.3)(0.8) = 0.02 + 0.24 = 0.26 \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{AVS})P(H_{AVS}) + P(E|\neg H_{AVS})P(\neg H_{AVS}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.7)(0.05) + (0.3)(0.95) = 0.035 + 0.285 = 0.32 \]

These values need to be combined in some way, but for simplicity in this scenario, let's take the direct means.

### Calculating Posterior Probabilities \( P(H|E) \):

1. **Business Administration:**
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA})P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} = \frac{(0.1)(0.2)}{(0.26)} \approx 0.077 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS})P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)} = \frac{(0.7)(0.05)}{(0.32)} \approx 0.109 \]

Finally,

{
  "business administration": 0.077,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.109
}

These probabilities suggest that, while still low, Adam is slightly more likely to be in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration, given his personality traits.
