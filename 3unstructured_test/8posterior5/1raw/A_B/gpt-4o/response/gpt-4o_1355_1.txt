To apply Bayes' Rule to compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) (the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch), we need the following probabilities:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is not enrolled in that field.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) \) can be computed as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

1. **P(H)**:
   The prior probability, \( P(H) \), for agricultural and veterinary science. Assuming in a typical graduate environment, agricultural and veterinary science might have a moderate enrollment rate. Let's approximate:
   \[ P(H) = 0.1 \]

2. **P(E|H)**:
   Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is relatively high.
   \[ P(E|H) = 0.8 \]

3. **P(E|\neg H)**:
   The likelihood of having Adam's personality sketch if he is not enrolled in agricultural or veterinary science. This can be lower due to the specific nature of his interests.
   \[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \]

Now we can apply these values to Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.18} = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \approx 0.308 \]

### Business Administration:

1. **P(H)**:
   The prior probability, \( P(H) \), for business administration, which might generally have a higher enrollment rate.
   \[ P(H) = 0.2 \]

2. **P(E|H)**:
   Given Adam's personality, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for business administration might be lower due to his specific interests in nature and animals.
   \[ P(E|H) = 0.1 \]

3. **P(E|\neg H)**:
   The likelihood of having Adam's personality sketch if he is not enrolled in business administration.
   \[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \]

Now we can apply these values to Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.4} = \frac{0.02}{0.42} \approx 0.048 \]

### Final Results:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.308,
  "business administration": 0.048
}
```
These values give us the posterior probabilities for Adam being enrolled in each respective field given his personality sketch.
