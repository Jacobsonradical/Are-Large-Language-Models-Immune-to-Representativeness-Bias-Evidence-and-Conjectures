To calculate the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the fields of "agricultural and veterinary science" and "business administration," we need to go through a few steps. Specifically, we need to estimate the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \), and then use these to apply Bayes' rule. 

### Step-by-Step Calculation

1. **Define Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - \( P(H_\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.1 \): Let's assume 10% of graduate students are in this field.
   - \( P(H_\text{business administration}) = 0.2 \): Let's assume 20% of graduate students are in this field.

2. **Define Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.8 \): Given Adam's interests and personality, it's very likely he would be in this field.
   - \( P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.1 \): Adam's personality traits are less aligned with this field, so it's less likely.

3. **Define Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - \( P(E|\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.2 \): The traits are less common outside this field, but not impossible.
   - \( P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) = 0.7 \): There are other fields where these traits might still be likely.

### Calculation Using Bayes' Rule

Bayes' rule formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

\[ P(E|H) = 0.8 \]
\[ P(H) = 0.1 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \]
\[ P(\neg H) = 0.9 \]

\[ P(H_\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.8 \times 0.1 + 0.2 \times 0.9} \]
\[ = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.18} \]
\[ = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \]
\[ = 0.3077 \]

#### Business Administration

\[ P(E|H) = 0.1 \]
\[ P(H) = 0.2 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.7 \]
\[ P(\neg H) = 0.8 \]

\[ P(H_\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.1 \times 0.2 + 0.7 \times 0.8} \]
\[ = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.56} \]
\[ = \frac{0.02}{0.58} \]
\[ = 0.0345 \]

### Results

Thus, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3077,
  "business administration": 0.0345
}
```
