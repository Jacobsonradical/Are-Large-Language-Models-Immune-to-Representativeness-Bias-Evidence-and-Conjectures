Let's start by specifying reasonable values for the probabilities based on the given information:

1. \( P(H) \) - the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \) - the probability of observing E (Adam's personality sketch) given that Adam is enrolled in a specified field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - the probability of observing E (Adam's personality sketch) given that Adam is not enrolled in a specified field.
4. \( P(H|E) \) - the posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specified field given his personality sketch E, computed using Bayes' rule: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have exact values and proportions for \( P(E) \), we'll assume it is similar for any field, effectively becoming a normalization constant for comparing fields.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H)** (prior) - Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, it is reasonable to think the prior probability is relatively high. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.3 \).
2. **P(E|H)** (conditional on H) - Adam's personality fits well with this field. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).
3. **P(E|\neg H)** (conditional not on H) - While other fields will also include people like Adam, it’s less likely outside natural sciences. Let's assign \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ \text{Since } P(E) \text{ is same for all: } P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.9 \cdot 0.3 = 0.27 \]

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)** - Considering Adam's qualities, business administration is less likely. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).
2. **P(E|H)** - Adam's personality sketch doesn’t strongly align with classic business administration traits. Let’s assume \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).
3. **P(E|\neg H)** - Same as above, \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.05 = 0.01 \]
