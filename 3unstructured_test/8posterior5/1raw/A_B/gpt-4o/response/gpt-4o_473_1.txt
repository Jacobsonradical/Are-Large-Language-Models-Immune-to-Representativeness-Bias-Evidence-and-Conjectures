To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' theorem, we need estimates or hypothetical values for the following probabilities:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in the field \( H \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in the field \( H \).

Let's start with rough estimates for these fields:

1. **Business Administration**:
    - \( P(H) \): Let's assume roughly 10% of graduate students are in business administration.
    - \( P(E|H) \): Given his personality sketch, the traits do not strongly align with a typical business administration student. Let's say 0.1 (10% chance).
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of having his personality sketch given he's not in business administration might be higher. Let's assume 0.4 (40%).

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - \( P(H) \): Let's assume roughly 5% of graduate students are in agricultural and veterinary science.
    - \( P(E|H) \): Given his love for nature, animals, and empathy, this field seems like a strong match. Let's say 0.7 (70% chance).
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of having his personality sketch given he's not in agricultural and veterinary science is lower. Let's assume 0.2 (20%).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields and involving this term in the final calculation of each probability doesn't add further discrimination, we'll compare the numerator parts directly.

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \times 0.1 = 0.01 \]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.7 \times 0.05 = 0.035 \]

Given these proportions, we can conclude:

{
  "business administration": 0.01,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.035
