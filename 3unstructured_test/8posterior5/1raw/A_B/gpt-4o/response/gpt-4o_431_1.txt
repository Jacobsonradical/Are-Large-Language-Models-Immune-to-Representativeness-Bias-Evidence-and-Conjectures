Let's start by evaluating our probabilities:

1. **Hypothesis (H):** Adam was enrolled in "agricultural and veterinary science" or "business administration".

2. **Personality Sketch (E):** The personality details about Adam provided.

3. **Prior Probability, P(H):**
   - For agricultural and veterinary science: Given Adam's strong love for animals, nature, and a generally suitable personality for this field, we'll assign a higher prior probability.
   - For business administration: While Adam does have high intelligence which might be useful in business, his affinity for nature and animals makes this less likely.

4. **Likelihood, P(E|H):**
   - For agricultural and veterinary science: The described personality traits strongly align with this field, so this will be higher.
   - For business administration: The described traits do not particularly align with business administration, so this will be lower.

5. **Prior Probability, P(E|Â¬H):**
   - For both fields, this represents how well the personality sketch fits graduate students in fields other than agricultural and veterinary science or business administration.

Let's assume some reasonable values for these probabilities:
- P(H): 0.2 for agricultural and veterinary science, 0.05 for business administration (based on graduate students distribution and Adam's personality)
- P(E|H): 0.7 for agricultural and veterinary science, 0.2 for business administration (based on fit between Adam's characteristics and the field)

We also need to consider the total probability of E, P(E), which we can estimate by averaging across all fields, and using the complement probability for agricultural and veterinary science and business administration for normalization:

\[ P(E|\neg H) \approx \frac{P(E) - P(E|H) \times P(H)}{1 - P(H)} \]

Assuming P(E) to be fairly high given Adam's personality unique fit (say, 0.5):

Finally, using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.2}{0.5} = \frac{0.14}{0.5} = 0.28 \]

For business administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.05}{0.5} = \frac{0.01}{0.5} = 0.02 \]

Therefore, the results are:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.28,
  "business administration": 0.02
}
