To solve this problem, let’s use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is given by the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis H.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing evidence E given that H is true.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing evidence E given that H is not true.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing evidence E (which can be calculated as \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \)).

We'll first make an educated estimate of the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the conditional probabilities \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \). 

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

#### Prior Probability \( P(H) \)
Assume the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is relatively low because not too many graduate students choose this field. Let’s assign \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

#### Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)
Given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, it is very likely that such a personality fits someone in this field. Hence, let’s assign \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

#### Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)
Given that Adam’s interests and personality favor Agricultural and Veterinary Science, it’s less likely to see these traits in other fields. So let's assign \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{(0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9)} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.27} = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \approx 0.2286 \]

### Business Administration

#### Prior Probability \( P(H) \)
Assume the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration is somewhat higher because many graduate students choose this field. Let’s assign \( P(H) = 0.3 \).

#### Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)
Given Adam's personality traits related to empathy and puzzle-solving, it is less likely that he is in Business Administration. So let's assign \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).

#### Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)
It’s more probable that Adam's traits fit fields other than Business Administration. So let's assign \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \).

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{(0.2 \cdot 0.3 + 0.6 \cdot 0.7)} = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.42} = \frac{0.06}{0.48} \approx 0.125 \]

Finally, the results are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.2286,
  "business administration": 0.125
}
