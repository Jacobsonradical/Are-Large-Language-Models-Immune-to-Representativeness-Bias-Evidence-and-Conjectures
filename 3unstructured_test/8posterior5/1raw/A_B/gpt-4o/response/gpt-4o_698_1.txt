Sure, let’s break this down and apply Bayes’ theorem. Bayes’ theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence given the hypothesis is false.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence.
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.

Let’s assume \( P(H) \) for both fields is roughly equal to the general distribution of graduate students in these fields. In the U.S., there are significantly fewer students in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. Thus, we assign a lower prior probability for agricultural and veterinary science and a higher prior probability for business administration.

Let’s estimate:
- \( P(H_{\text{agricultural}}) \) ≈ 0.05
- \( P(H_{\text{business}}) \) ≈ 0.20

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural}}) \): High, since Adam’s love for nature, plants, and animals aligns well with this field. Let's assume ≈ 0.8.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural}}) \): This would be lower since not all other fields match Adam’s interests. Let's assume ≈ 0.2.

### Business Administration
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \): Low, since Adam's interests don’t align well with typical business administration characteristics. Let's assume ≈ 0.1.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}}) \): This would be higher since many other fields can match Adam’s interests. Let's assume ≈ 0.5.

We don’t have \( P(E) \) directly, but we know:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{agricultural}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{agricultural}}) \]

and

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{business}}) \]

However, for simplicity, we'll assume \( P(E) \) is constant and high due to Adam's strong match with a scientific field.

Now applying Bayes’ theorem:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agricultural}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural}})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural}}|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} = \frac{0.04}{P(E)} \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.20}{P(E)} = \frac{0.02}{P(E)} \]

By comparing the numerators, the posterior probability for Agricultural and Veterinary Science is higher.

Thus, our answers are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.67,
  "business administration": 0.33
}

Note that this is a simplified estimation and real-world calculations may require more precise data and considerations.
