To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Rule, we need to estimate the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the evidence (Adam's personality sketch) given that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the evidence (Adam's personality sketch) given that Adam was not enrolled in a specific field.
4. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of the evidence, but we can skip calculating this since we are comparing the posterior probabilities directly.

Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Now, let's estimate these values:

### 1. Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): Assume a moderate prior probability because business administration is a common field. Let's set this as \( 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam's personality (curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy) fits a typical business administration student is low. Let's set this as \( 0.05 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in any other field is generally higher than for business administration, especially considering other fields like agricultural and veterinary science. Let's set this as \( 0.1 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]
Since \( P(E) \) is common in the denominator for all comparisons, we can compare numerators directly:
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = 0.01 \]

### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): Assume a lower prior probability than business administration but still reasonable. Let's set this as \( 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam's personality fits someone in agricultural and veterinary science is very high. Let's set this as \( 0.8 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in agricultural and veterinary science is still lower but more aligned with this field's characteristics: \( 0.1 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]
Again, comparing numerators directly:
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = 0.08 \]

### Summary
Based on these calculations, our answers will be:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.01,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08
}
