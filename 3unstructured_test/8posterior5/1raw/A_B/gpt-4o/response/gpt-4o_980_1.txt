To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch \( E \), we use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here's what each term stands for:
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \): Total probability of observing the personality sketch, which can be computed by summing over all fields.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in that specific field.

We do not have specific values for these probabilities, but we can provide reasonable estimates based on the information given.

### Assumptions
- For agricultural and veterinary science, it seems highly aligned with Adam's personality sketch. Hence, \( P(E|H) \) should be high.
- For business administration, it doesn't align very well with Adam's described interests and traits. Hence, \( P(E|H) \) should be low.

We will assume equal prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for simplicity. Let’s assume generic values to illustrate the computation:

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \) (quite a few students might enroll in this field).
- \( P(E|H) \approx 0.7 \) (high, as the field aligns well with Adam’s personality).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \) (the personality could marginally fit some other fields).

#### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \) (similarly, many students might enroll in this).
- \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \) (low, as it doesn't align well).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.35 \) (Adam's personality is more likely to fit other fields).

Since many plausible fields exist and we don't have their exact probabilities, we'll assume \( P(E) = 0.5 \) for simplicity in our illustrated calculation.

### Computation
#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.5} = 0.14 \]

#### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.5} = 0.02 \]

Therefore:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.14,
  "business administration": 0.02
}

This simplified formula provides a rough estimate given the limited data and assumptions. In a real-world scenario, the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), conditional probabilities \( P(E|H) \), and their complements would ideally be derived from more concrete data.
