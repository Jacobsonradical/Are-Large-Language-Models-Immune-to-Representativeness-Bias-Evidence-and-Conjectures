Let's evaluate the probabilities for both of the given fields using Bayes' Rule. Bayes' Rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we do not have the exact value for \( P(E) \). But since we are asked for relative probabilities, we can omit \( P(E) \) in the calculations, and then normalize results if needed.

First, we need to define:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in a specific field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adamâ€™s personality sketch given that he is not in that specific field.

Let's assign estimates for the relevant probabilities based on the given personality sketch. These estimates are somewhat subjective but should reflect logical reasoning based on the provided information.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- \( P(H) \): The overall probability of a graduate student being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This could be low to moderate.
  - Assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \)

- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, empathy for animals, and appreciation for hard work, it is highly likely he fits in this field.
  - Assume \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \)

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of someone with Adam's personality traits not being in agricultural and veterinary science. This is lower because fewer other fields would align so well with his traits.
  - Assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \)

Using Bayes' Rule (and ignoring \( P(E) \) since we aren't normalizing):

\[
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.7 \times 0.1 = 0.07
\]

### Business Administration

- \( P(H) \): The overall probability of a graduate student being enrolled in business administration. This could be moderate to high.
  - Assume \( P(H) = 0.3 \)

- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's traits, he doesn't particularly fit the typical profile of a business administration student. 
  - Assume \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \)

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of someone with Adam's personality traits not being in business administration. This is higher because many other fields could align better with his traits.
  - Assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \)

Using Bayes' Rule (and ignoring \( P(E) \) since we aren't normalizing):

\[
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \times 0.3 = 0.06
\]

### Results

\[
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.07,
  "business administration": 0.06
}
\]

These values indicate that based on the given personality sketch, Adam is more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration.
