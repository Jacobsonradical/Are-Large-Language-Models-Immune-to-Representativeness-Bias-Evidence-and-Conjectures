Sure, let's analyze this step-by-step. 

### Business Administration

1. **P(H): Prior Probability**
   - This represents the likelihood that Adam, as a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021, was enrolled in a business administration program. Generally, business administration is a common field, but given Adam's specific interests and qualities mentioned in the sketch, it may not be as likely.
   - Let's assume P(H) as 0.2.

2. **P(E|H): Likelihood**
   - This is the probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he were in a business administration program. Many traits listed (curiosity about nature, love for animals, interest in plants) don't strongly align with business administration.
   - Let's assume P(E|H) as 0.1.

3. **P(E|¬H): Probability of Evidence given Not H**
   - This is the probability of Adam exhibiting the listed traits, assuming that he is not in business administration. Given his traits align more with fields like science, agriculture, or veterinary studies, this seems more plausible.
   - Let's assume P(E|¬H) as 0.8.

4. **Bayes Rule Calculation for Business Administration**
   - P(H|E) = P(E|H)P(H) / [P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|¬H)P(¬H)]
   - P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.8
   - P(H|E) = (0.1 * 0.2) / [(0.1 * 0.2) + (0.8 * 0.8)]
   - P(H|E) = 0.02 / (0.02 + 0.64)
   - P(H|E) = 0.02 / 0.66 ≈ 0.0303

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H): Prior Probability**
   - This represents the likelihood that Adam was enrolled in an agricultural and veterinary science program. Given his strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, this seems more likely.
   - Let's assume P(H) as 0.3.

2. **P(E|H): Likelihood**
   - This is the probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he were in an agricultural and veterinary science program. Given the alignment, this seems very feasible.
   - Let's assume P(E|H) as 0.9.

3. **P(E|¬H): Probability of Evidence given Not H**
   - This is the probability of Adam exhibiting the listed traits, assuming that he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. This would consider other fields.
   - Let's assume P(E|¬H) as 0.2.

4. **Bayes Rule Calculation for Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - P(H|E) = P(E|H)P(H) / [P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|¬H)P(¬H)]
   - P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.7
   - P(H|E) = (0.9 * 0.3) / [(0.9 * 0.3) + (0.2 * 0.7)]
   - P(H|E) = 0.27 / (0.27 + 0.14)
   - P(H|E) = 0.27 / 0.41 ≈ 0.6585
