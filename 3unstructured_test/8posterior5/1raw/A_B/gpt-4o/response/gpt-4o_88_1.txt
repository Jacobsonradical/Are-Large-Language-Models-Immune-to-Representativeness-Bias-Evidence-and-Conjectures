To determine the likelihood \( P(H|E) \) that Adam is enrolled in each field given his personality sketch, we will use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality given that he is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality given that he is not enrolled in the field.

Since we do not have exact numerical probabilities for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \), we will need to make educated assumptions based on the provided information.

### Assumptions
1. **Agricultural and veterinary science**
    - Adam has a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals. This would fit well with agricultural and veterinary science.
    - Likelihood of Adam's characteristics fitting this field (\( P(E|H) \)) is high.
    - The base rate of students in this field \( P(H) \) might be moderate.

2. **Business administration**
    - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which are useful in business administration.
    - However, his strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for nature are less aligned with typical business administration characteristics.
    - Likelihood of Adam's characteristics fitting this field (\( P(E|H) \)) might be lower.
    - The base rate of students in this field \( P(H) \) is typically high.

### Estimations
- \( P(H_{agr}) \): Moderate (e.g., 0.2)
- \( P(E|H_{agr}) \): High (e.g., 0.8)
- \( P(H_{bus}) \): High (e.g., 0.3)
- \( P(E|H_{bus}) \): Lower (e.g., 0.2)
- \( P(E) \): Average across all fields (assuming it normalizes to 1 in the context).

### Calculations
For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
\[ P(H_{agr}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{agr}) \cdot P(H_{agr})}{P(E)} \]

Since we assume \( P(E) \) normalizes, we can compare the relative probabilities:
\[ P(H_{agr}|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{1} = 0.16 \]

For **business administration**:
\[ P(H_{bus}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{bus}) \cdot P(H_{bus})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_{bus}|E) \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{1} = 0.06 \]

### Final Results
Since the provided values do not need to sum to 1, the results are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.16,
  "business administration": 0.06
}
