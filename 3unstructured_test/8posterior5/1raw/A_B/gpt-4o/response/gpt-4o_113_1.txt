To compute \( P(H|E) \), we'll use Bayes' Rule, which in this context states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

First, let's break it down for each field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

#### Hypothesis: Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in this field.
  - Assuming a larger, diverse graduate student population but recognizing his interest in nature, animals, and plants, let's estimate it as somewhat likely.
  - Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

- **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is in this field.
  - Given the alignment with his interests in nature, animals, and empathy, this is quite high.
  - Let's say \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).

- **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is *not* in agricultural and veterinary science.
  - While these traits can fit other fields, they are more specific to agricultural sciences compared to many others.
  - Let's estimate \( P(E|¬H) = 0.3 \).

Remember, \( P(E) \) can be computed by:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) = 0.18 + 0.24 = 0.42 \]

So, applying Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.2}{0.42} \approx \frac{0.18}{0.42} \approx 0.4286 \]

### Business Administration

#### Hypothesis: Adam was enrolled in business administration.

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in this field.
  - Business administration is a common field, but given Adam's personality, it's less likely.
  - Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

- **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is in this field.
  - The traits do not strongly align with typical business administration characteristics.
  - Let's say \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).

- **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is *not* in business administration.
  - Given the multitude of other, more suitable fields for his personality, this is higher.
  - Let's estimate \( P(E|¬H) = 0.4 \).

Again, \( P(E) \) is the same as calculated before:

\[ P(E) = 0.42 \]

Applying Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.42} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.42} \approx 0.0476 \]

So, summarizing:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4286,
  "business administration": 0.0476
