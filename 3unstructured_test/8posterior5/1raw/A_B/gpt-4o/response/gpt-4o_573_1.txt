To estimate \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Rule, we need to consider the following probabilities:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the evidence (Adam's personality sketch) if he was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the evidence if he was not enrolled in that field.

Given the personality sketch of Adam, we will make reasonable assumptions about these probabilities based on the information provided.

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is relatively low compared to more common fields like business administration. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).

- \( P(E|H) \): Given that Adam has a deep love for animals, high intelligence, and an appreciation for hard work, these traits are highly consistent with someone in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): This is the probability of Adam's personality traits if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Since such traits can be found in various fields, we can assume this to be moderately high. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

### For Business Administration

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in business administration is relatively high. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's personality sketch, it seems less likely he would pursue business administration, as his traits align more with nature, animals, and abstract concepts rather than typical business focuses. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): This is the probability of Adam's personality traits if he is not in business administration. Since these traits aren't specifically tied to business and can apply to many other fields, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Now, we use Bayes' Rule to compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
\]

\[
P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H)
\]

Let's compute these for each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

\[
P(\neg H) = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{0.7 \cdot 0.05 + 0.3 \cdot 0.95} = \frac{0.035}{0.035 + 0.285} = \frac{0.035}{0.32} \approx 0.109
\]

### Business Administration

\[
P(\neg H) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.2 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.24} = \frac{0.04}{0.28} \approx 0.143
\]

Thus, the probabilities after applying Bayes' Rule are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.109,
  "business administration": 0.143
}
```
