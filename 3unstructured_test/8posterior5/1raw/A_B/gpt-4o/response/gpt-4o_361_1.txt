To calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Estimate \( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field.
2. **Estimate \( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given Adam was enrolled in each field.
3. **Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given Adam was not enrolled in each field.
4. **Compute \( P(H|E) \)**: The posterior probability using Bayes' rule.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that \( P(E) \) is constant for both fields, we can simplify our calculations by using proportionality:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Let's go through each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Estimate \( P(H) \)** (hypothesis that Adam is in this field):
   - Agricultural and veterinary science is a relatively smaller field compared to business administration. Let's assume prior probability \( P(H) \) is 0.05.

2. **Estimate \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Adam's characteristics such as a love for nature, plants, animals, and a genuine curiosity about them, align very well with this field. Hence, we can assign a high probability to \( P(E|H) \), say 0.9.

3. **Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - For other fields not directly related to nature or animals, Adam's personality sketch might be less aligned. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) \) is 0.1.

### Business Administration

1. **Estimate \( P(H) \)** (hypothesis that Adam is in this field):
   - Business administration is a very common field with many students. Let's assume prior probability \( P(H) \) is 0.15.

2. **Estimate \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - The personality traits such as empathy, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could align with business administration, though not as directly as with the previous field. Let's assign \( P(E|H) \) as 0.3.

3. **Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - Similar to the previous calculation, the likelihood could be 0.1.

Now, using Bayes' rule proportionality:

\[ P(Agricultural \, and \, Veterinary \, Science|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(Business \, Administration|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

So:

\[ P(Agricultural \, and \, Veterinary \, Science|E) \propto 0.9 \cdot 0.05 = 0.045 \]
\[ P(Business \, Administration|E) \propto 0.3 \cdot 0.15 = 0.045 \]

We can normalize these probabilities by summing their values and dividing each by the total:

Total = \( 0.045 + 0.045 = 0.09 \)

Normalized probabilities:

\[ P(Agricultural \, and \, Veterinary \, Science|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.09} = 0.5 \]
\[ P(Business \, Administration|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.09} = 0.5 \]

Thus:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.5",
  "business administration": "0.5"
}
