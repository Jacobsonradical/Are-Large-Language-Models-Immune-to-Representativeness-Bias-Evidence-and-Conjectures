To solve this problem using Bayes' rule, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Estimate Prior Probabilities (\(P(H)\))**: This is the probability that Adam was enrolled in each given field before considering the personality sketch.
2. **Estimate Likelihoods (\(P(E|H)\))**: This is the probability that Adam's personality sketch matches given that he was enrolled in each respective field.
3. **Estimate Marginal Probabilities (\(P(E|\neg H)\))**: This is the probability that Adam's personality sketch matches given that he was not enrolled in the respective field.
4. **Compute Posterior Probabilities (\(P(H|E)\))**: Using Bayes' rule.

Here's how we decode each part:
- \( H \): Hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
- \( E \): Adam's personality sketch.

### Given Fields:

#### Business Administration
1. **Prior \(P(H)\)**: With no special information, let's assume an equal prior for each field among a large number of potential fields. For simplicity, let's assume \(P(H) = 0.01\) (a 1% chance initially).
2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: Business administration does not directly align with Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals. It's less likely but not impossible. Let's assign \(P(E|H)\) as 0.01.
3. **Marginal Probability \(P(E|\neg H)\)**: For fields other than business administration, the chances of matching Adam's personality sketch might still be fairly high given his described traits. Let's assume \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.2\).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}\]

Plugging in the values for business administration:
\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.01 \cdot 0.01}{0.01 \cdot 0.01 + 0.2 \cdot 0.99}\]
\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.0001}{0.0001 + 0.198}\]
\[P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.0001}{0.1981} \approx 0.0005\]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **Prior \(P(H)\)**: Similarly, assume \(P(H) = 0.01\) initially.
2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: This field aligns well with Adam's interests and personality. Let's assign \(P(E|H)\) as 0.8.
3. **Marginal Probability \(P(E|\neg H)\)**: The chances of matching Adam's personality sketch given he was not in this field are similar to the previous case. Let's assume \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.2\).

Using the same Bayes' rule:
\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}\]

Plugging in the values for agricultural and veterinary science:
\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.01}{0.8 \cdot 0.01 + 0.2 \cdot 0.99}\]
\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.008}{0.008 + 0.198}\]
\[P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.008}{0.206}\]
\[P(H|E) \approx 0.0388\] (approximately)

Putting it all together:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0005,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.0388
}
