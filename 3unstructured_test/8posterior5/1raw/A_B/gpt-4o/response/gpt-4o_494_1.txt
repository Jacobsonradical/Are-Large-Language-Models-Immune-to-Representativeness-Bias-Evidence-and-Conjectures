Sure, let's start by assessing each of the probabilities involved for each field of specialization.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H)** (Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science): 
   - Given Adam's strong curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, it seems reasonably likely, but we don't have the context about the general distribution of students across various graduate fields. Let's assume P(H) = 0.1 for a somewhat typical distribution but slightly adjusted for his interests.

2. **P(E|H)** (Probability of the evidence given that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science): 
   - Adam's characteristics such as love for nature, animals, and empathy fit well with this field. It's very likely, so let's assume P(E|H) = 0.8.

3. **P(E|¬H)** (Probability of the evidence given that Adam is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science):
   - Adam's love for nature and animals might still be present in other fields, but perhaps less likely to fit as perfectly. Assume P(E|¬H) = 0.2.

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

But since we evaluate different fields independently, we can ignore the P(E) denominator:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \]

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)** (Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration):
   - Business administration is a common field and assuming some level of general distribution, let's take P(H) = 0.1 but consider that his interests don't align particularly well with this field.

2. **P(E|H)** (Probability of the evidence given that Adam is enrolled in business administration):
   - Adam's profile doesn't align as strongly with the typical traits one might expect for a business administration student. Assume P(E|H) = 0.1.

3. **P(E|¬H)** (Probability of the evidence given that Adam is not enrolled in business administration):
   - Given his actual profile, it seems more likely that P(E|¬H) would remain relatively constant across a variety of fields outside business administration. Assume P(E|¬H) = 0.3.

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \times 0.1 = 0.01 \]

Given the above details, here is the final output in the requested format:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08,
  "business administration": 0.01
}
```
This suggests that based on the given personality sketch, it is significantly more likely that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration.
