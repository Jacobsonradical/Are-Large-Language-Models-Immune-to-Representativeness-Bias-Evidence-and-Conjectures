To compute the probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for each field given the personality sketch \(E\) of Adam, we will use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the field.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given Adam is enrolled in the field.
- \(P(E)\) is the marginal likelihood of observing the personality sketch, which serves as a normalizing constant.
- \(\neg H\) denotes the opposite hypothesis, i.e., Adam not being enrolled in that field.

First, let's make educated assumptions about the values for the variables required:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \(P(H)\): Moderate. Agricultural and veterinary science is a common and favored field for someone with a deep love for animals and plants.

    Let's estimate \(P(H) = 0.3\).

- \(P(E|H)\): High. A student in agricultural and veterinary science is likely to have a strong empathy towards animals and a curiosity about plants. 

    Let's estimate \(P(E|H) = 0.7\).

- \(P(E|\neg H)\): Moderate. Although empathy for animals and curiosity about plants can be found in students in various other fields as well, including natural sciences and biological sciences.

    Let's estimate \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.3\).

### Business Administration
- \(P(H)\): Lower. Business administration does not intuitively align with Adam's personality sketch focused on empathy, animals, and plants.

    Let's estimate \(P(H) = 0.1\).

- \(P(E|H)\): Low. It's less likely that a business administration student will have characteristics that align with a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals.

    Let's estimate \(P(E|H) = 0.1\).

- \(P(E|\neg H)\): Higher. If Adam is not enrolled in business administration, the given traits are more likely to be seen in other fields such as natural sciences or social work.

    Let's estimate \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.4\).

For both fields:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) \]

Now, let's calculate the values:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
\[ P(E) = 0.7 \cdot 0.3 + 0.3 \cdot 0.7 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.21 + 0.21 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.42 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.3}{0.42} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.21}{0.42} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.5 \]

2. **Business Administration**
\[ P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.1 + 0.4 \cdot 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.01 + 0.36 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.37 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.37} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.37} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.027 \]

So the results are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.027
}
```
