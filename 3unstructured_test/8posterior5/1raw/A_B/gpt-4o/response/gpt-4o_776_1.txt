To calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, let's assume the following notional values based on the given information:

1. **Agricultural and veterinary science:**
   - \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in this field. Let's assume it is 0.1.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given that he is in this field. Based on Adam’s interests in nature, plants, animals, and appreciation for hard work, let's assume it is 0.7.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given that he is not in this field. Let's assume it is 0.1.

2. **Business administration:**
   - \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in this field. Let's assume it is 0.2.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \): The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given that he is in this field. Given the personality sketch, this is less likely, so let's assume it is 0.2.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business administration}}) \): The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given that he is not in this field. Let's assume it is 0.2.

To simplify our calculations, we won’t calculate \( P(E) \) explicitly, since it will cancel out in the normalization step.

Now, we calculate the unnormalized values of \( P(H|E) \):

- \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.7 \cdot 0.1 = 0.07 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.2 \cdot 0.2 = 0.04 \)

To normalize, we sum these values and divide each by the sum:

- Normalizing constant \( = 0.07 + 0.04 = 0.11 \)

- \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{0.07}{0.11} \approx 0.636 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.11} \approx 0.364 \)

So the final result is:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.636,
  "business administration": 0.364
}
```
