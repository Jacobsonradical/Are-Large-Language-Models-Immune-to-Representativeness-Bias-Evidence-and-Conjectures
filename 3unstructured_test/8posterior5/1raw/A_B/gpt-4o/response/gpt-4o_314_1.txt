To estimate the probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \), and then use Bayes' Theorem to compute \( P(H|E) \), let's go through each field based on Adam's personality sketch.

### Business Administration:

1. **\( P(H) \)**: The overall probability of a graduate student being in business administration.
   - Let's assume the probability of any given graduate student being in business administration is moderate since it is a common field.
   - \( P(H_{\text{business}}) = 0.3 \)

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing the given personality sketch \( E \) if Adam is enrolled in business administration.
   - Business administration students may have high intelligence and understanding of hard work but may not strongly align with a deep love for nature, animals, and empathy.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) = 0.1 \)

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of observing the given personality sketch \( E \) if Adam is not in business administration.
   - Given the sketch, it's more likely Adam is not in business administration, but we must consider all other fields.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}}) = 0.5 \)

   Using Bayes' Theorem \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \), and assuming \( P(E) \) is a normalization constant:

   \( P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \)

   Since \( P(E) \) = \( P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|{\neg H})P({\neg H}) \),

   \( P(E) \approx 0.1 \cdot 0.3 + 0.5 \cdot 0.7 \)

   \( P(E) \approx 0.03 + 0.35 = 0.38 \)

   So,

   \( P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.38} \approx 0.079 \)

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

1. **\( P(H) \)**: The overall probability of a graduate student being in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - This field is less common, but Adamâ€™s personality traits align very well.
   - \( P(H_{\text{agri\_vet}}) = 0.1 \)

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing the given personality sketch \( E \) if Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - The traits such as a love for nature, animals, strong empathy, and curiosity about plants are highly aligned.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{agri\_vet}}) = 0.8 \)

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of observing the given personality sketch \( E \) if Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - This is the same consideration as with the business administration case.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agri\_vet}}) = 0.4 \)

   Using Bayes' Theorem \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \), and assuming \( P(E) \) is the same overall normalization constant:

   \( P(H_{\text{agri\_vet}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \)

   \( P(E) \approx 0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.4 \cdot 0.9 \)

   \( P(E) \approx 0.08 + 0.36 = 0.44 \)

   So,

   \( P(H_{\text{agri\_vet}}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.44} \approx 0.182 \)

### Summary:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.079,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.182
}
```

These values give the probabilities that Adam is enrolled in the respective fields given his personality sketch.
