Sure, let’s use Bayes’ Rule to compute the posterior probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for Adam being enrolled in each of the given fields, based on the personality sketch \(E\).

Bayes' Rule formula: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's denote:
- "business administration" as \(H_1\)
- "agricultural and veterinary science" as \(H_2\)

To find \(P(H_1|E)\) and \(P(H_2|E)\), we need to estimate the following components:
- \(P(H_1)\) and \(P(H_2)\): These represent the prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field.
- \(P(E|H_1)\) and \(P(E|H_2)\): These represent the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam is enrolled in each field.
- \(P(E|\neg H_1)\) and \(P(E|\neg H_2)\): These represent the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam is not enrolled in each field.

### Estimation of Prior Probabilities:

Though exact data may vary:
- Business administration encompasses many students, let’s assume a prior of \(P(H_1) = 0.3\).
- Agricultural and veterinary science has fewer students than business administration, so let’s assume a prior of \(P(H_2) = 0.1\).

### Likelihood Estimation:

Given Adam's personality sketch aligns more closely with agricultural and veterinary sciences:
- \(P(E|H_1)\) might be low as the interests and traits in the personality sketch (nature, animals, empathy) don’t fit typically with business administration. So, let’s assume \(P(E|H_1) = 0.1\).
- \(P(E|H_2)\) would be higher, as these traits align well with agricultural and veterinary science. So, let’s assume \(P(E|H_2) = 0.7\).

Estimating the overall likelihood of the evidence:
- \(P(E)\) can be computed as a weighted sum: 
  \[
  P(E) = P(E|H_1)P(H_1) + P(E|H_2)P(H_2) + P(E|\neg H_1 \land \neg H_2)P(\neg H_1 \land \neg H_2)
  \]
- As exact values for fields outside the two given are not provided, we'll approximate:
  \[
  P(E) \approx P(E|H_1)P(H_1) + P(E|H_2)P(H_2)
  \]
  Assuming that fields other than the two given have lower probabilities and their contribution is minimal.

Thus, let's compute:

\[
P(E) \approx (0.1 * 0.3) + (0.7 * 0.1) = 0.03 + 0.07 = 0.10
\]

Now apply Bayes' Rule:

\[
P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.3}{0.1} = 0.3
\]

\[
P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.1} = 0.7
\]

So, the posterior probabilities are as follows:

{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
