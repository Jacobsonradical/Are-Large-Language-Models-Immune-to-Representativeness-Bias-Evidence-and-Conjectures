To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \), we'll use Bayes' rule, which states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We are given:
- \( P(H) \) which represents the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \) which represents the probability of E given H.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) which represents the probability of E given that Adam is not enrolled in the field H.

We'll make some assumptions and estimations based on typical characteristics associated with students in each field and their likelihood to match Adam's personality sketch \( E \).

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability (P(H))**: Let's assume graduate students have a fairly broad distribution across fields, but business administration is a common graduate field. We'll assume \( P(H) = 0.3 \).

2. **P(E|H)**: The personality sketch describes qualities that are less common in business administration students (such as a strong appreciation for nature and animals). So we'll set this to a relatively low probability. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: This is the likelihood of observing Adam's traits among students not enrolled in business administration. Assuming diverse fields, let's set it to \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability (P(H))**: This field is less common among graduate students than business administration, but it aligns with many of Adam's traits. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

2. **P(E|H)**: Adam's traits strongly match this field's characteristics (curiosity about nature, love for animals, etc). Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: This represents the probability of having Adam's personality traits not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given that his traits are specialized and fit well in this field, we'll assume a lower value. Let's set \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

Now, we need to use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \) for both fields.

### Calculation for Business Administration

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.3) + (0.2 \cdot 0.7) = 0.03 + 0.14 = 0.17 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.3}{0.17} = 0.3 \cdot \frac{0.1}{0.17} \approx 0.176 \]

### Calculation for Agricultural and Veterinary Science

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.1) + (0.1 \cdot 0.9) = 0.07 + 0.09 = 0.16 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.16} = 0.1 \cdot \frac{0.7}{0.16} \approx 0.4375 \]

Thus, we have:

{
  "business administration": 0.176,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4375
}
