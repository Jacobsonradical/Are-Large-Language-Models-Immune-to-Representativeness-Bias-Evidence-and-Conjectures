To determine \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of being enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch given enrollment in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the personality sketch across all possible fields.

Just for simplicity, let's assume \( P(E) \) is a normalizing factor which won't affect the relative comparisons between the fields, hence it can be omitted from the proportional reasoning.

Here’s the step-by-step approach to compute the values:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

- **\( P(H) \)**: Agricultural and Veterinary Science isn't the most common graduate field, but there is a reasonable number of students in these fields. Let’s assume \( P(H) \approx 0.05 \).
  
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: Adam’s personality sketch is strongly correlated with interests in nature, plants, animals, and empathy. This fits well with someone in Agricultural and Veterinary Sciences. Let’s assume a high probability, \( P(E|H) \approx 0.7 \).

- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: There are many fields where Adam's attributes might be much less expected. Let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.1 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.7 \cdot 0.05 = 0.035 \]

2. **Business Administration**

- **\( P(H) \)**: Business Administration is one of the more common fields for graduate studies. Let’s assume \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \).
  
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's personality sketch does not strongly align with what you might typically expect from a Business Administration student, whose profile might lean more towards strategic thinking, leadership, and less towards nature and empathy. Let’s assume a lower probability, \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \).

- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: As before, let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.1 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

Now normalizing, but maintaining the proportions:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.035,
  "business administration": 0.02
}

If normalization to a total probability of 1 were necessary, the values would be approximately:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{0.035}{0.035+0.02} \approx 0.636 \),
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.02}{0.035+0.02} \approx 0.364 \)
}

However, since we are only asked to provide values between 0 and 1 without necessarily normalizing, the original values stand correct:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.035,
  "business administration": 0.02
}
