Sure, let's go through the process step by step for each field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science as his field. Generally, let's assume this is a specific field and could have a moderate probability.
   P(H) ≈ 0.1

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing E given H. Adam's personality traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, appreciation for hard work) strongly align with this field.
   P(E|H) ≈ 0.8

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing E given not H. While some traits might align with other fields, it's less likely they would align as well as they do with agricultural and veterinary science.
   P(E|¬H) ≈ 0.2

Using Bayes' rule, we calculate:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

Calculating \(P(E)\):
\[ P(E) = (0.8 * 0.1) + (0.2 * 0.9) = 0.08 + 0.18 = 0.26 \]

Now, calculating \(P(H|E)\):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 * 0.1}{0.26} \approx 0.307 \]

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. This field is less specific and more common, so let's assume it has a somewhat higher prior probability.
   P(H) ≈ 0.2

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing E given H. Adam's traits, particularly curiosity about nature and love for animals, are less likely to align with business administration.
   P(E|H) ≈ 0.1

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing E given not H. This might be higher given the diversity of other fields that could align better with Adam's traits.
   P(E|¬H) ≈ 0.3

Using Bayes' rule and the same methodology as above:
\[ P(E) = (0.1 * 0.2) + (0.3 * 0.8) = 0.02 + 0.24 = 0.26 \]

Now, calculating \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 * 0.2}{0.26} \approx 0.077 \]

So, the results would be:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.307,
  "business administration": 0.077
}
