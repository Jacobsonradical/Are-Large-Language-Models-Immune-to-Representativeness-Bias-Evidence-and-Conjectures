To determine the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we only need comparative probabilities relative to each of the hypotheses, let's assign arbitrary values and focus on the relationships between them. Here's a breakdown of the probabilities:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Agricultural and Veterinary Science (\( H_1 \)): Let's assume \( P(H_1) = 0.05 \) (as it's a relatively specialized field).
   - Business Administration (\( H_2 \)): Let's assume \( P(H_2) = 0.20 \) (as it's a more common graduate field).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's traits given he's in that field.
   - Agricultural and Veterinary Science (\( H_1 \)):
     - Curiosity about nature and plants: High
     - Love for animals: High
     - High intelligence and good at abstract concepts: Medium
     - Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work: Medium
     Assuming these align well, let's set \( P(E|H_1) = 0.8 \).

   - Business Administration (\( H_2 \)):
     - Curiosity about nature and plants: Low
     - Love for animals: Low
     - High intelligence and good at abstract concepts: Medium
     - Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work: High
     Assuming these align moderately well, let's set \( P(E|H_2) = 0.2 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is the average likelihood of observing Adamâ€™s traits over all fields, excluding the specific one.
   - If we make a rough assumption that other fields (excluding the ones we're comparing) share no strong alignments with the traits, let's arbitrarily set this to \( P(E|\neg H_1) \approx P(E|\neg H_2) = 0.3 \).

Using these estimates:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]

\[
\begin{aligned}
P(H_1|E) &= \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} \\
P(E) &= P(E|H_1)P(H_1) + P(E|H_2)P(H_2) + \cdots \\
&= (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.20) + \cdots \\
&= 0.04 + 0.04 + \cdots \approx 0.10
\end{aligned}
\]

\[
P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.10} = 0.4
\]

### Business Administration:

\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E)} \]

\[
\begin{aligned}
P(H_2|E) &= \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.20}{P(E)} \\
P(E) &= 0.10 \\
\end{aligned}
\]

\[
P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.10} = 0.4
\]

Consequently, adjusting for the context and given values, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.4
}
```

Note: The probabilities appear equal in this simplified calculation, but in reality, the actual values could differ based on a comprehensive context-specific analysis.
