To calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need the following probabilities:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the evidence (personality sketch) given that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the evidence given that Adam was not enrolled in a specific field.

We'll start by making informed estimates for these probabilities based on the details provided in the personality sketch and general knowledge about different fields of graduate study.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in this field. Given the diversity of fields in graduate studies, we can estimate this as a reasonable proportion of all graduate students.
  \[
  P(H) \approx 0.1 \quad \text{(10\%)}
  \]

- **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam's personality traits given he's in this field. His traits align well with curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy.
  \[
  P(E|H) \approx 0.7 \quad \text{(70\%)}
  \]

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam's personality traits given he is not in this field. These traits are somewhat common but less so in fields unrelated to nature and animals.
  \[
  P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \quad \text{(30\%)}
  \]

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
Where \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \)

\[
P(E) = (0.7 \times 0.1) + (0.3 \times 0.9) = 0.07 + 0.27 = 0.34
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.1}{0.34} \approx 0.2059
\]

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in this field, considering the prevalence of business programs.
  \[
  P(H) \approx 0.1 \quad \text{(10\%)}
  \]

- **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam’s personality traits given he’s in this field. Business administration typically doesn't require a strong love for nature or animals, though strategic and abstract thinking and understanding of hard work might be relevant.
  \[
  P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \quad \text{(10\%)}
  \]

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam’s traits given he's not in business administration, as his traits are common in other fields like sciences, arts, and humanities.
  \[
  P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.35 \quad \text{(35\%)}
  \]

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[
P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.1) + (0.35 \times 0.9) = 0.01 + 0.315 = 0.325
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.1}{0.325} \approx 0.0308
\]

Therefore, the answers can be summarized as:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.2059,
  "business administration": 0.0308
}
```
