To compute the probabilities, we can utilize Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
 
First, we need to estimate the probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Let's assume reasonable estimates for these probabilities based on Adam's personality sketch and the typical attributes associated with students in these fields.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given his interest and curiosity about nature and animals, it's reasonable to assume a relatively higher prior probability.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. The evidence fits very well with this field, so this should be high.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the evidence if Adam is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. While Adam’s profile can fit into other fields too, it’s less likely to match as well as it does with Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration. Given his attributes, this is less likely, but not impossible.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is in Business Administration. The evidence is less fitting for this field but still possible.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Pretty similar to the degree that Adam’s profile should fit other fields which are not Business Administration.

I'll provide some estimated values in a logical range below:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)** = 0.15
- **P(E|H)** = 0.9
- **P(E|\neg H)** = 0.2

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.15}{(0.9 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85)} = \frac{0.135}{0.135 + 0.17} = \frac{0.135}{0.305} \approx 0.4426
\]

### Business Administration
- **P(H)** = 0.05
- **P(E|H)** = 0.3
- **P(E|\neg H)** = 0.2

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.05}{(0.3 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95)} = \frac{0.015}{0.015 + 0.19} = \frac{0.015}{0.205} \approx 0.0732
\]

So, the probabilities will look something like this:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4426,
  "business administration": 0.0732
}
```
