Let's apply Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study. Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam is in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence \( E \) if Adam is not in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the evidence \( E \).

Because we're not given specific values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \), we'll make reasoned estimates based on the personality sketch and general knowledge.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **\( P(H) \) (Prior probability):** This field has a sizable number of graduate students, estimated at about 0.1 (assuming 10% of students might be in this field, it's reasonable given the depth and breadth of agricultural sciences).
2. **\( P(E|H) \) (Probability of evidence given the hypothesis):** Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, and empathy, this probability would be high, perhaps around 0.8.
3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \) (Probability of evidence given not the hypothesis):** Adam's traits could be suitable for other fields too, but generally less specific fields. We'd estimate this at around 0.3.

### Business Administration

1. **\( P(H) \) (Prior probability):** This field is also common but usually attracts a different type of personality. We might estimate this around 0.15.
2. **\( P(E|H) \) (Probability of evidence given the hypothesis):** Business administration might not fit well with Adam's interests and traits, so we might estimate this around 0.1.
3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \) (Probability of evidence given not the hypothesis):** Given the broad categories, maybe this is around 0.4.

Next, we use these values to compute \( P(H|E) \).

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's calculate \( P(E) \) for both fields.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.27 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.35 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.35} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.229 \]

### Business Administration

\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.15) + (0.4 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.015 + 0.34 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.355 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{0.355} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.015}{0.355} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.042 \]

So, the likelihoods are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.229,
  "business administration": 0.042
}
```

These values suggest that Adam is much more likely to be enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science than in Business Administration, based on his personality traits and interests.
