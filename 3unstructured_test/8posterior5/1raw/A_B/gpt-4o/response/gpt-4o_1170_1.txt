Sure, let's analyze the probabilities for each field with respect to Adam's personality sketch \( E \).

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume this is moderately likely, based on the subject's general attributes, say 0.1.

   - \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam’s deep love for animals and nature, this seems quite high. Let's assign this a value of 0.8.

   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Since Adam's attributes are quite specific to nature and animals, this probability might be lower, say 0.2.

2. **Business Administration:**

   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Let's assume this is less likely, based on the subject’s attributes, say 0.05.

   - \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Adam’s attributes do not align well with typical traits needed for business administration. This probability is low; let's assign it 0.1.

   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in business administration. This would be relatively higher because the specific traits Adam shows are not typically aligned with business administration, let's say 0.3.

Now, let's apply Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we are working with comparative values, we will not calculate the exact \( P(E) \) but will compare the numerators for relative likelihoods.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[ P(H|E)_{Agri} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{P(E)} = 0.08 / P(E) \]

### Business Administration:

\[ P(H|E)_{BusAdm} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.05}{P(E)} = 0.005 / P(E) \]

We see that \( \frac{0.08}{P(E)} \) is much larger than \( \frac{0.005}{P(E)} \).

So, relative to each other, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.05
}
```

These values represent the relative likelihoods, with agricultural and veterinary science being significantly more likely given Adam's personality sketch compared to business administration.
