To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Let's examine these for each field: agricultural and veterinary science, and business administration.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: Probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   Given that this is a less common field compared to business in graduate programs, let's assume:
   \( P(H_{\text{ag\_vet}}) = 0.10 \) (10%).

2. **P(E|H)**: Probability of Adam's personality traits given he was in agricultural and veterinary science.
   His traits align well with this field (curiosity about nature, plants, love for animals):
   \( P(E|H_{\text{ag\_vet}}) = 0.90 \) (90%).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability of Adam's personality traits given he was not in agricultural and veterinary science.
   Considering a pool of all other possible graduate fields, these traits are less common, so:
   \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{ag\_vet}}) = 0.20 \) (20%).

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: Probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
   This is a common field, so let's assume:
   \( P(H_{\text{bus\_admin}}) = 0.20 \) (20%).

2. **P(E|H)**: Probability of Adam's personality traits given he was in business administration.
   His traits don't significantly align with typical business administration traits:
   \( P(E|H_{\text{bus\_admin}}) = 0.10 \) (10%).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability of Adam's personality traits given he was not in business administration.
   Again considering a pool of all other possible graduate fields:
   \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{bus\_admin}}) = 0.25 \) (25%).

Now, apply Bayesâ€™ rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

While \( P(E) \) (the overall likelihood of Adam's personality traits) is the same for each field, relative comparisons can be made without it since it cancels out when comparing ratios.

### Calculations

1. For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
   \[ P(H_{\text{ag\_vet}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{ag\_vet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ag\_vet}})}{P(E)} \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[ P(H_{\text{ag\_vet}}|E) \propto 0.90 \times 0.10 = 0.09 \]

2. For **business administration**:
   \[ P(H_{\text{bus\_admin}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{bus\_admin}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{bus\_admin}})}{P(E)} \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[ P(H_{\text{bus\_admin}}|E) \propto 0.10 \times 0.20 = 0.02 \]

### Normalization (optional for total probability but not required as per instruction):

The values can be interpreted directly relatively.
