Sure, let's evaluate the probabilities and use Bayes' theorem to determine \( P(H|E) \) for each field.

For "agricultural and veterinary science" (denoted as H1):
- \( P(H1) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in this field. Given that we do not have exact data, we will make a reasonable assumption. Let's assume that the prior probability of a graduate student being in this field is 0.1.
- \( P(E|H1) \) is the probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Considering his traits such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy, this probability would likely be high. Let's assign it a value of 0.7.
- \( P(E| \neg H1) \) is the probability of observing the evidence if Adam is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This might still be relatively high but not as high as \( P(E|H1) \). Let's assign it a value of 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1) + P(E| \neg H1) \cdot P(\neg H1) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.7 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.07 + 0.27 = 0.34 \]

So:
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.34} \approx 0.2059 \]

For "business administration" (denoted as H2):
- \( P(H2) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in this field. Again, let's make a reasonable assumption that it's 0.1.
- \( P(E|H2) \) is the probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is enrolled in business administration. Considering his traits, this probability would likely be lower because they are not directly related to business administration. Let's assign it a value of 0.2.
- \( P(E| \neg H2) \) is the probability of observing the evidence if Adam is not enrolled in business administration. This might still be the same as in the previous case. Let's assume it's 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the same as above (0.34).

So:
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.34} \approx 0.0588 \]

Summarizing the results:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.2059,
  "business administration": 0.0588
