In order to estimate the probabilities, let's start with our hypotheses and their relevant probabilities based on the given personality sketch (E) of Adam.

### Denote Probabilities:
- P(H): Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- P(E|H): Probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is in that field.
- P(E|¬H): Probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not in that field.
- P(H|E): Posterior probability of Adam being in a particular field given the personality sketch \( E \).

### Estimations:
Let's subjectively estimate these probabilities:

#### Business Administration:
- P(H) for Business Administration: Let's say 0.10 (10%), since business administration is a common graduate field.
- P(E|H): The given personality sketch mentions a curiosity about nature, love for plants and animals, empathy, solving puzzles, and an appreciation for dedication, which does not strongly align with typical traits for a business administration graduate. Thus, let's estimate it as 0.05 (5%).
- P(E|¬H): Suppose that among all other possible fields, the probability of this personality sketch being observed in other fields (not business administration) is let's say 0.20 (20%).

Now, we can compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

So,

\[ P(H|E)_{Business Admin} = \frac{0.05 \times 0.10}{0.05 \times 0.10 + 0.20 \times 0.90} \]

\[ P(H|E)_{Business Admin} = \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.18} \]

\[ P(H|E)_{Business Admin} = \frac{0.005}{0.185} \]

\[ P(H|E)_{Business Admin} \approx 0.027 \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- P(H) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Let's say 0.05 (5%), assuming fewer students go into this specialized field.
- P(E|H): The personality sketch precisely fits traits of someone likely enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, therefore we estimate it as 0.80 (80%).
- P(E|¬H): Suppose that among all other possible fields, the probability of this personality sketch being observed in other fields (not Agricultural and Veterinary Science) is similar to above: 0.20 (20%).

Applying Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E)_{AgVetSci} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

So,

\[ P(H|E)_{AgVetSci} = \frac{0.80 \times 0.05}{0.80 \times 0.05 + 0.20 \times 0.95} \]

\[ P(H|E)_{AgVetSci} = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.19} \]

\[ P(H|E)_{AgVetSci} = \frac{0.04}{0.23} \]

\[ P(H|E)_{AgVetSci} \approx 0.174 \]
