To calculate the probability \( P(H|E) \), we will use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to evaluate the following for each field (H):
1. \( P(H) \) - The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \) - The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was not in that field.

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both cases and will proportionally affect the results the same way, we will ignore it for simplicity in a comparative sense.

### Evaluation:

1. **Business Administration**
   - \( P(H) \): Let's assume the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration is around 0.15 (15%).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Since the personality sketch doesn't strongly match the typical characteristics of a business administration student, we'll assume a lower probability, say 0.1.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Assuming the complement set of Business Administration covers all other students, many of whom might better fit the personality sketch, we estimate 0.3.

Using Bayes’ theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{0.1 \cdot 0.15 + 0.3 \cdot 0.85} = \frac{0.015}{0.255} \approx 0.0588 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - \( P(H) \): Let's assume the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is about 0.05 (5%).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam’s characteristics (love of nature, animals, empathy), it's highly likely in this field, so we assume 0.9.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Again, for the complement set, we might assume it to be lower, say 0.25 due to the specificity of his interests.

Using Bayes’ theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.9 \cdot 0.05 + 0.25 \cdot 0.95} = \frac{0.045}{0.2625} \approx 0.1714 \]
