To compute the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration or agricultural and veterinary science based on the given personality sketch (E), we employ Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of \( E \) given \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of \( E \).

First, assign some reasonable estimates for the involved probabilities:

1. **business administration:**
    - \( P(H_{BA}) \) (assuming business administration is a common field) = 0.2
    - \( P(E|H_{BA}) \) (the likelihood of having Adam’s personality if he's studying business administration) = 0.1
    - \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \) (the likelihood of having Adam’s personality if he's not studying business administration) = 0.8

2. **agricultural and veterinary science:**
    - \( P(H_{AVS}) \) (assuming agricultural and veterinary science is a less common field) = 0.05
    - \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \) (the likelihood of having Adam’s personality if he's studying agricultural and veterinary science) = 0.7
    - \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \) (the likelihood of having Adam’s personality if he's not studying agricultural and veterinary science) = 0.4

Next, compute the posterior probabilities:

1. **business administration:**
    \[
    P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)}
    \]
    We need to estimate \( P(E) \). Using a weighted sum for example (assuming it's a total \( P(E) = 1 \)):

    \[
    P(E) \approx P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})
    \]
    \[
    P(E) \approx 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.7 \cdot 0.05 = 0.02 + 0.035 = 0.055
    \]

    \[
    P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.055} = \frac{0.02}{0.055} \approx 0.36
    \]

2. **agricultural and veterinary science:**
    \[
    P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)}
    \]
    \[
    P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{0.055} = \frac{0.035}{0.055} \approx 0.64
    \]

Thus, the final probabilities are:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.36,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.64
}
```
