To calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is constant for both fields, we can simplify the comparison by finding the relative values. Here is our step-by-step analysis for each field:

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021. Since there are many graduate fields, let's assume the prior probability is relatively low. We'll take a hypothetical value:
   \[ P(H_{BA}) = 0.1 \]

2. **P(E|H)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he was enrolled in business administration. Given his interests and traits, it is unlikely (but not impossible) that someone with his characteristics would be in this field:
   \[ P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.1 \]

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not in business administration. Considering the vast number of other fields that may better match his personality, this should be significantly higher:
   \[ P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.25 \]

Then the corresponding \( P(H|E) \) is relatively low.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021. Given his love for nature, animals, plants, and empathy, let's assume the prior probability is relatively higher:
   \[ P(H_{AV}) = 0.2 \]

2. **P(E|H)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his interests and traits, this seems highly likely:
   \[ P(E|H_{AV}) = 0.8 \]

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. This may encompass many fields but likely lower than the previous case:
   \[ P(E|\neg H_{AV}) = 0.2 \]

Then the corresponding \( P(H|E) \) is relatively high.

### Summary of Judgements

Based on these values, let's calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field (relative values, not actual probabilities):

1. **Business Administration**:
    \[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) = 0.1 \cdot 0.1 = 0.01 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    \[ P(H_{AV}|E) \propto P(E|H_{AV}) \cdot P(H_{AV}) = 0.8 \cdot 0.2 = 0.16 \]

Normalizing these within the context of these two fields only:

Sum = \( 0.01 + 0.16 = 0.17 \)

Therefore:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.17} \approx 0.059 \]
\[ P(H_{AV}|E) = \frac{0.16}{0.17} \approx 0.941 \]
