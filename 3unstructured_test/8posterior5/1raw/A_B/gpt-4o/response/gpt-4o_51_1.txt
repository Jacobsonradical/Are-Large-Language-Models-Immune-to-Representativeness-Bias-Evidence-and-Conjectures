To solve for the probabilities \( P(H|E) \), where \( H \) corresponds to the hypotheses of Adam being enrolled in either "agricultural and veterinary science" or "business administration," we need to apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( E \) is the personality sketch of Adam.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
#### Hypothesis \( H \): Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This is the general likelihood of a graduate student being in this field. Let's assume 10% of graduate students are in this field. Hence, \( P(H) = 0.10 \).
   
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The personality sketch fits well with someone in this field. Adam’s interest in nature, plants, animals, and his empathy align strongly. So, let’s assume \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).
   
3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Since similar traits could be found in many other related fields (like environmental science, biology, etc.), let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.25 \).

### Business Administration
#### Hypothesis \( H \): Adam was enrolled in business administration.

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This is the general likelihood of a graduate student being in this field. Let’s assume 15% of graduate students are in this field. Hence, \( P(H) = 0.15 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The personality sketch doesn’t align very strongly with typical business administration traits. So, assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in business administration. Since similar traits could be found in many other fields, let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.25 \).

### Normalizing Constant \( P(E) \)
Since we don’t have comprehensive data for all fields, we can use a simplifying assumption:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

Given there are many more fields than these two, we approximate \( P(E) \) by using information from both hypotheses:

\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H_{agriculture})P(H_{agriculture}) + P(E|H_{business})P(H_{business}) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

Let’s optimize this approximation calculation:
\[ P(E) \approx (0.9 \cdot 0.10) + (0.1 \cdot 0.15) + (0.25 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.09 + 0.015 + 0.1875 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.2925 \]

### Posterior Probabilities
Now, use Bayes’ theorem:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{agriculture} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.10}{0.2925} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{agriculture} \approx 0.307 \]

2. **Business Administration**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{business} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{0.2925} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{business} \approx 0.051 \]

### Final Answer
Therefore:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.307,
  "business administration": 0.051
}
```
