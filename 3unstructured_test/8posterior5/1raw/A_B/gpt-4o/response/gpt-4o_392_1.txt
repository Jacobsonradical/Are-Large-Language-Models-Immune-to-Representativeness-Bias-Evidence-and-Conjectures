To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to consider P(H), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Bayes' Rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields, we can use the simplified form for comparison:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

### Business Administration (BA)

1. **P(H):** The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in Business Administration.
   - Given the diverse range of fields graduate students enroll in, let's assume a low initial probability for business administration. For simplicity, let's set \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.1 \).

2. **P(E|H):** The probability of observing the personality traits (E) given that Adam is a BA student.
   - The personality traits described (appreciation for nature, puzzles, empathy, animals, understanding abstract concepts) seem less aligned with typical traits for business administration students. Assume \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.05 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of observing the personality traits if Adam is not a BA student.
   - Given graduate students can come from a wide range of fields that might fit Adam's personality better (like sciences or humanities), let's assume a relatively higher probability for \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.3 \).

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto 0.05 \times 0.1 = 0.005 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS)

1. **P(H):** The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
   - Similarly, let's assume a low but slightly higher prior for AVS because it aligns a bit more with his interests. Set \( P(H_{AVS}) = 0.2 \).

2. **P(E|H):** The probability of observing the personality traits (E) given that Adam is an AVS student.
   - The personality traits are highly aligned with Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Assume \( P(E|H_{AVS}) = 0.8 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of observing the personality traits if Adam is not an AVS student.
   - Similar to before, assume \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) = 0.3 \).

\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.2 = 0.16 \]

### Normalized Estimates

To normalize and obtain comparable posterior probabilities:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E_{total})} \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E_{total})} \]

\[ P(E_{total}) = P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) + \text{other fields terms} \]

For simplification, we assume the posterior probabilities difference is significant enough that:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx \frac{0.005}{0.165} = \frac{0.005}{0.165} \approx 0.030 \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \approx \frac{0.16}{0.165} = \frac{0.16}{0.165} \approx 0.970 \]
