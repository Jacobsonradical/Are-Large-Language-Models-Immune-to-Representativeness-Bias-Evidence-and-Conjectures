To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the given fields using Bayes' rule, we need to consider:

1. \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is constant for both fields, we only need to compute the numerator for each field to compare.

### For business administration:

- **\( P(H) \)**: Business administration is a common graduate program, but given Adam's interests, we might initially think \( P(H) \) is lower compared to more aligned fields like agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume a generic prior probability \( P(H) \) = 0.1.
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's personality sketch, which shows a preference for nature, animals, and abstract thinking, the probability that he'd have such traits if enrolled in business administration may be considered lower. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) = 0.1.
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Given that \( E \) could be common in certain STEM fields, we might estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) = 0.2.

\[ P(H|E)_{business admin} \approx \frac{0.1 \times 0.1}{P(E)} = 0.01 / P(E) \]

### For agricultural and veterinary science:

- **\( P(H) \)**: This field aligns closely with Adam's interests and skills. Let's assume \( P(H) \) = 0.2.
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: The probability that Adam's personality sketch matches someone in this field is very high. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) = 0.8.
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Given \( E \) could be common in fields heavily related to nature or animals, similar to agricultural and veterinary science, we might estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) = 0.3.

\[ P(H|E)_{agri & vet sci} \approx \frac{0.8 \times 0.2}{P(E)} = 0.16 / P(E) \]

Since we are comparing relative probabilities and assuming \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields:

- \( \frac{P(H|E)_{business admin}}{P(E)} = 0.01 \)
- \( \frac{P(H|E)_{agri & vet sci}}{P(E)} = 0.16 \)

Normalizing these with respect to each other, we obtain relative probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.01,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.16
}

Thus, based on relative likelihoods:

{
  "business administration": 0.0588,  // Approx 0.01 / (0.01 + 0.16)
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.9412  // Approx 0.16 / (0.01 + 0.16)
}

Converting these estimated values to more straightforward terms gives:

{
  "business administration": 0.06,  // Rounded
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.94  // Rounded
}
