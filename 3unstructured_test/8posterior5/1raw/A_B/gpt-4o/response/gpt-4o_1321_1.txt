Sure, let's go through this step by step:

1. **Personality Sketch (E):** Adam is curious about nature and plants, loves solving puzzles, has strong empathy and love for animals, is intelligent, appreciates hard work, and was a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021.

2. **Hypotheses (H and \neg H):**
    - H: Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
    - \neg H: Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
    - H: Adam was enrolled in business administration.
    - \neg H: Adam was not enrolled in business administration.

3. **Prior Probability (P(H)):**
    - P(H_agricultural): The probability that an arbitrary graduate student in the U.S. is studying agricultural and veterinary science. This would be based on the enrollment data from 2021.
    - P(H_business): The probability that an arbitrary graduate student in the U.S. is studying business administration. This would be based on the enrollment data from 2021.
    
    Let's assume rough estimates (these should ideally be founded on actual enrollment statistics, but for the sake of calculation, we'll use plausible estimates):
    - P(H_agricultural) is around 0.05
    - P(H_business) is around 0.20

4. **Likelihood (P(E|H)):**
    - P(E|H_agricultural): The probability of Adam having the described personality sketch given that he is studying agricultural and veterinary science. This is likely quite high, given his deep love for nature, plants, and animals.
    - P(E|H_business): The probability of Adam having the described personality sketch given that he is studying business administration. This is likely lower, given his interests and traits.

    Rough estimates (again, cautious approximations):
    - P(E|H_agricultural) is around 0.8
    - P(E|H_business) is around 0.2

5. **Marginal Probability (P(E)):**
    - This would be the sum of the likelihoods across the possible fields, but for simplicity and since we are focusing on these two fields, we can approximate it using their respective contributions.

6. **Complementary Likelihood (P(E|\neg H)):**
    - P(E|\neg H): This needs to be calculated for both fields in question, reflecting the probability of E given other fields.
    - For agricultural and veterinary science: P(E|\neg H_agricultural) might be lower compared to P(E|H_agricultural).
    - For business administration: P(E|\neg H_business) might be higher compared to P(E|H_business) considering it includes more diverse fields.

    Let's approximate (cautiously):
    - P(E|\neg H_agricultural) might be around 0.1
    - P(E|\neg H_business) might be around 0.6

Now, we will compute the posterior probabilities P(H|E) using Bayes' Rule: 

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)

Approximate P(E) calculation:
- P(E) = P(E|H_agricultural) * P(H_agricultural) + P(E|\neg H_agricultural) * P(\neg H_agricultural)
- P(E)_agricultural ≈ 0.8 * 0.05 + 0.1 * 0.95 = 0.04 + 0.095 = 0.135

- P(E) = P(E|H_business) * P(H_business) + P(E|\neg H_business) * P(\neg H_business)
- P(E)_business ≈ 0.2 * 0.20 + 0.6 * 0.80 = 0.04 + 0.48 = 0.52

Now applying Bayes' Rule:

For "agricultural and veterinary science":
P(H_agricultural|E) ≈ [0.8 * 0.05] / 0.135 ≈ 0.04 / 0.135 ≈ 0.296

For "business administration":
P(H_business|E) ≈ [0.2 * 0.20] / 0.52 ≈ 0.04 / 0.52 ≈ 0.077

Here's the formatted answer:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.296,
  "business administration": 0.077
}
```
