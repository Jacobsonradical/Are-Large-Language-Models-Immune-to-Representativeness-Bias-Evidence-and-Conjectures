To calculate \( P(H|E) \), we use Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Since we don't have explicit numerical values, we'll make reasonable assumptions based on the provided personality sketch and typical distributions of interest in graduate fields.

Let's denote:

- \( H_1 \): Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( H_2 \): Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H_1) \)**:
   - Business administration is a common graduate field, but based on Adam's interests, it might be less likely. Let's assume \( P(H_1) \) is moderately low: \( P(H_1) = 0.1 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_1) \)**:
   - The personality sketch does not strongly align with typical business administration students. Interests in nature, animals, and puzzles don't directly suggest business administration. Therefore, let's assume a low likelihood: \( P(E|H_1) = 0.05 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_1) \)**:
   - There are many other fields that might match Adam's personality profile better. Let's intuitively assume \( P(E|\neg H_1) \) is higher than \( P(E|H_1) \), say \( P(E|\neg H_1) = 0.5 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H_2) \)**:
   - Considering Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, animals, and empathy, agricultural and veterinary science seems very suitable. Thus, \( P(H_2) = 0.2 \) (reasonably higher than business administration).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_2) \)**:
   - Adamâ€™s personality sketch highly matches someone in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume a high likelihood: \( P(E|H_2) = 0.8 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_2) \)**:
   - It should be lower than \( P(E|H_2) \) but not negligible. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_2) = 0.3 \).

### Calculation of Posterior Probabilities

Using Bayes' Rule for each field, we need to compute \( P(E) \). However, since we're comparing two hypotheses and focused on their relative probabilities rather than their absolute values, we can ignore \( P(E) \) (it acts as a normalization constant in the comparison):

For business administration:
\[
P(H_1|E) \propto P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) = 0.05 \cdot 0.1 = 0.005
\]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[
P(H_2|E) \propto P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) = 0.8 \cdot 0.2 = 0.16
\]

After normalization, the approximate posterior probabilities will be:

\[
P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.16} \approx 0.03
\]
\[
P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.16}{0.005 + 0.16} \approx 0.97
\]

Thus, our formatted answer will be:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.03,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.97
}
```
