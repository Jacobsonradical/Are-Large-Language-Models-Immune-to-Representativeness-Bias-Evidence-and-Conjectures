To compute \( P(H|E) \), we use Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given:
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given Adam is not enrolled in that field.

Let's estimate each component for the two fields:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and understanding of hard work, the prior probability of him being in this field is relatively high.
     \[ P(H) \approx 0.2 \] 
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood is very high because his traits match well with this field.
     \[ P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \]
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that these traits would occur if Adam were not in this field is moderate because other fields may also attract individuals with these traits.
     \[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \]

   Now using Bayes' Rule:
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

2. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being in this field is lower given his personality sketch does not strongly align with typical traits associated with business administration.
     \[ P(H) \approx 0.1 \]
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood is lower since his traits are less common in this field.
     \[ P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \]
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that these traits would occur if Adam were not in this field is higher given the mismatch.
     \[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.7 \]

   Now using Bayes' Rule:
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is common for both calculations, we do not need its exact value to compare the relative values of \( P(H|E) \).

Finally, the relative posterior probabilities are:
\[ P(H|E) \text{ (agricultural and veterinary science)} \propto 0.9 \cdot 0.2 \]
\[ P(H|E) \text{ (business administration)} \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.1 \]

Calculating these:
\[
\frac{0.9 \cdot 0.2}{0.9 \cdot 0.2 + 0.2 \cdot 0.1} \approx 0.82
\]
\[
\frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.9 \cdot 0.2 + 0.2 \cdot 0.1} \approx 0.18
\]

Thus:
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.82",
  "business administration": "0.18"
}
