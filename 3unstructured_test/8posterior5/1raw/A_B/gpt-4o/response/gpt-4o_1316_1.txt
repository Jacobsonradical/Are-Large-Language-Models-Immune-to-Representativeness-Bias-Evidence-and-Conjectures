To determine the probabilities, we need to apply Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we don't have specific numerical values for these probabilities, I will provide reasonable estimates based on the information given in the personality sketch and the typical characteristics of graduate students in these fields.

### Analyzing "Business Administration":
- **P(H):** The prior probability that a randomly selected graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in business administration. Business administration is a popular graduate field, so we might estimate a moderate prior probability, say around 0.15.
- **P(E|H):** The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is studying business administration. While business administration students can have empathy and intelligence, Adam's deep love for nature, animals, and puzzles is less typical. Let's put this at a relatively low value, say 0.05.
- **P(E|¬H):** The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not studying business administration. Given the specifics of his personality, his traits might be more commonly found in fields related to nature and animals. Therefore, let's set this at 0.10.

### Analyzing "Agricultural and Veterinary Science":
- **P(H):** The prior probability that a randomly selected graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This is less common than business administration, so we might place the prior at around 0.05.
- **P(E|H):** The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is studying agricultural and veterinary science. Adam's interests and traits are highly aligned with this field, so we'll put this at a high value, say 0.80.
- **P(E|¬H):** The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not studying agricultural and veterinary science. This should be relatively low since his traits strongly suggest alignment with agrarian/animal-focused studies; let's put this at 0.05.

Given these estimates, we can now apply Bayes' Rule to get the posterior probabilities.

### For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]
\[ P(E) \approx (0.05 \cdot 0.15) + (0.10 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.0075 + 0.085 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.0925 \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.15}{0.0925} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.0075}{0.0925} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0811 \]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]
\[ P(E) \approx (0.80 \cdot 0.05) + (0.05 \cdot 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.040 + 0.0475 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.0875 \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.05}{0.0875} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.040}{0.0875} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.4571 \]

Thus, after applying the above estimations and calculations, we end up with the following posterior probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.0811,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4571
}

These results reflect that given Adam's personality sketch, it's much more likely he is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science than Business Administration.
