To solve this problem using Bayes' theorem, we need to assess the probabilities as defined by the relationships:

1. \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field.
2. \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood of Adam having the given personality sketch given that he was enrolled in the field.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): The likelihood of Adam having the given personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in the field.

Using Bayes' Theorem, we have:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where \(P(E)\) can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let us assume Adam's prior likelihood of being in either field (i.e., \(P(H)\)) as a starting point:
1. \(P(H)\) for agricultural and veterinary science: Let's assume 0.15.
2. \(P(H)\) for business administration: Let's assume 0.10.

Next, we need to evaluate how well Adam’s personality fits each field given his personality sketch:

1. \(P(E|H)\):

- For agricultural and veterinary science: Given his love for nature, animals, and empathy, this seems like a strong fit. Let's assume a high value \(P(E|H) = 0.70\).
- For business administration: Given his interest in puzzles and abstract thinking, there may be some relevance, but it seems less aligned. Let's assume a lower value \(P(E|H) = 0.30\).

2. \(P(E|\neg H)\):

- To account for the complementary situation where Adam's personality might fit other fields but not the given one:
  - For fields other than agricultural and veterinary science: Let's assume \(P(E|\neg H)\) is 0.20.
  - For fields other than business administration: Let's assume \(P(E|\neg H)\) is 0.20.

Therefore:

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H) = 0.15 \]
\[ P(E|H) = 0.70 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.20 \]
\[ \neg H \) for agricultural and veterinary science = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 \]

Applying Bayes’ Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.70 \cdot 0.15}{(0.70 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.105}{(0.105 + 0.17)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.105}{0.275} = 0.3818 \]

For business administration:
\[ P(H) = 0.10 \]
\[ P(E|H) = 0.30 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.20 \]
\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90 \]

Applying Bayes’ Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.30 \cdot 0.10}{(0.30 \cdot 0.10 + 0.20 \cdot 0.90)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{(0.03 + 0.18)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.21} = 0.1429 \]

Therefore, the results are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3818,
  "business administration": 0.1429
}
