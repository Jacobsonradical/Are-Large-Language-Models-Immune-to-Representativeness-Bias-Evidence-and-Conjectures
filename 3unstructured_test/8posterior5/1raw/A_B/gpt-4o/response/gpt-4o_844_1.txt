To compute the conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field given Adam's personality sketch \( E \), we will use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

First, let's establish some assumptions about the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \):

### Business Administration

1. **\( P(H) \)**: Let's assume that the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in Business Administration is reasonably high, given its popularity among graduate students, say \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
   
2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood of Adam having the described personality traits given that he is in Business Administration seems somewhat low, as the field doesn't primarily align with nature, plants, and animals. We'll estimate this as \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of Adam having these personality traits given that he is **not** in Business Administration could be higher, since his traits seem more aligned with other fields (like agricultural sciences), say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **\( P(H) \)**: Let's assume that the prior probability for Agricultural and Veterinary Science is lower than that for Business Administration, given its specialization, say \( P(H) = 0.05 \).
   
2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood of Adam having these personality traits given he is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is very high, as his genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals perfectly align with this field. We'll estimate this as \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of Adam having these personality traits given that he is **not** in Agricultural and Veterinary Science should be lower, as we've moved from a very specialized field to broader ones, say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

### Calculations

Using Bayes' Rule:

1. For **Business Administration**:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.1 \cdot 0.1 + 0.5 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.45} = \frac{0.01}{0.46} \approx 0.0217 \]

2. For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.9 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.95} = \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.19} = \frac{0.045}{0.235} \approx 0.1915 \]

Now, let's put it all together:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0217,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.1915
}
```

These values reflect the relative likelihoods that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration or Agricultural and Veterinary Science based on the given personality sketch, recognizing that many other fields could also be considered.
