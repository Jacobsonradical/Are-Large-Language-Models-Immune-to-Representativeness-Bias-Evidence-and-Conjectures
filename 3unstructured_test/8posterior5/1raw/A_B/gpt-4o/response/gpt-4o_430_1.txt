Let's start by making an educated guess for each of the probabilities required to calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is in this field.
   - Given that Adam has a strong love for animals and nature, and his interests align well with this field.
   - Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam would have the given personality sketch if he were in this field.
   - Adam's characteristics (love for animals, nature, puzzles, empathy, and hard work) are highly consistent with a graduate student in this field.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

3. **P(E| \neg H)**: The probability that Adam would have the personality sketch if he were in any other field.
   - While empathy, curiosity, and intelligence are broad traits, the specific focus on nature and animals suggests that other fields would be less likely to produce exactly this set of traits.
   - Let's assume \( P(E| \neg H) = 0.1 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \)
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.2) + (0.1 \cdot 0.8) = 0.16 + 0.08 = 0.24 \]

Then:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{0.24} = \frac{0.16}{0.24} = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.67 \]

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is in this field.
   - Business Administration is a common field, but Adam’s traits don’t particularly align with typical characteristics needed for this discipline.
   - Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam would have the given personality sketch if he were in this field.
   - While possible, the interest in nature and animals, and solving puzzles is not strongly aligned with Business Administration.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

3. **P(E| \neg H)**: The probability that Adam would have the personality sketch if he were in any other field.
   - Same as before, broadly fitting traits are still less likely to be strongly present outside his peculiar interests.
   - Let's assume \( P(E| \neg H) = 0.2 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \)
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95) = 0.005 + 0.19 = 0.195 \]

Then:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.05}{0.195} = \frac{0.005}{0.195} \approx 0.026 \]

### Final Answer
