To determine the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in either "business administration" or "agricultural and veterinary science" based on his personality sketch, we will use Bayes' theorem. First, let's break down the components we need for Bayes' theorem calculation:

**Bayes' Theorem**:  
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:  
- \( P(H|E) \): Posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood of the personality sketch given Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E) \): Evidence probability, the overall likelihood of the personality sketch (which can be derived from the other probabilities).

**Assumptions and Estimates**:
1. **Prior Probabilities** \( P(H) \):
   - Given that business administration is a popular field of study in the U.S., we assign \( P(H_{\text{business}}) = 0.2 \).
   - Agricultural and veterinary science is less common but still significant for someone with a love for nature and animals. We assign \( P(H_{\text{ag-vet}}) = 0.1 \).

2. **Likelihoods** \( P(E|H) \):
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \) is expected to be low since Adam's traits do not align well with the typical business administration focus. We assign \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) = 0.05 \).
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{ag-vet}}) \) is expected to be high given his genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals. We assign \( P(E|H_{\text{ag-vet}}) = 0.7 \).

3. **Complement Likelihoods** \( P(E|\neg H) \):
   - For \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}}) \), we assume that given the broad range of other possible fields, the sketch is moderately probable. We assign \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}}) = 0.3 \).
   - For \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{ag-vet}}) \), considering other related fields could also align with his traits, we assign \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{ag-vet}}) = 0.4 \).

Now, using Bayes' theorem:

1. **Business Administration**:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}})}{P(E)}
   \]
   \[
   P(E) \text{ is a normalization factor and can be skipped since we only need relative probabilities.}
   \]
   \[
   P(H_{\text{business}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}}) = 0.05 \times 0.2 = 0.01
   \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{ag-vet}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{ag-vet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ag-vet}})}{P(E)}
   \]
   \[
   P(H_{\text{ag-vet}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{ag-vet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ag-vet}}) = 0.7 \times 0.1 = 0.07
   \]

Finally, normalizing the relative probabilities gives us:

\[
P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.07} = \frac{0.01}{0.08} = 0.125 
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{ag-vet}}|E) = \frac{0.07}{0.01 + 0.07} = \frac{0.07}{0.08} = 0.875 
\]

Thus, the approximate probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.125,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.875
}
```
