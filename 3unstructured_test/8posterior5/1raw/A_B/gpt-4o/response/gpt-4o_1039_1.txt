To calculate the posterior probabilities \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' theorem, we need to consider the prior probabilities \(P(H)\), the likelihoods \(P(E|H)\), and the complement likelihoods \(P(E|\neg H)\). 

Given:
- \(H\)=likelihood of being enrolled in a specific field.
- \(E\)=personality sketch of Adam.

Bayes' theorem is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We can rewrite this as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))} \]

### Assumptions for Prior Probabilities:

1. **Business Administration**:
    - \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): Typically many students enroll in business programs, making this a common field.
    - \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): Low, as Adam's personality sketch does not align closely with common traits for business administration.
    - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \): Higher, as Adam's traits are more common in non-business fields.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \): Less common than business administration but still significant.
    - \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \): High, as Adam's personality sketch closely matches traits common for this field.
    - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \): Lower, as these traits are less common in other fields.

### Estimations for Prior and Likelihoods:

1. Business Administration:
    - \(P(H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.3\)
    - \(P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.1\)
    - \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.5\)

2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
    - \(P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.1\)
    - \(P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.7\)
    - \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.2\)

### Calculations using Bayes' Theorem:

#### Business Administration:
\[ 
P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{\text{BA}}))} 
\]
\[ 
= \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.3}{0.1 \cdot 0.3 + 0.5 \cdot 0.7} 
\]
\[ 
= \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.35} 
\]
\[ 
= \frac{0.03}{0.38} 
\]
\[ 
= 0.079 
\]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ 
P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}})}{P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{\text{AVS}}))} 
\]
\[ 
= \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.7 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9} 
\]
\[ 
= \frac{0.07}{0.07 + 0.18} 
\]
\[ 
= \frac{0.07}{0.25} 
\]
\[ 
= 0.28 
\]

### Summary:

  "business administration": 0.079,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.28
