Certainly! Let's go through the computations step-by-step. For simplicity, I'll assume some reasonable prior probabilities and conditional probabilities. Feel free to adjust these values based on more specific data or more accurate estimations.

Let's start with the given fields:

### Business Administration

#### Bayesian Analysis:
1. **P(H)**:
   - Suppose the prior probability that any given graduate student is studying business administration. Let's say it's 0.2 (20%).

2. **P(E|H)**:
   - The likelihood that Adam, with his personality sketch, is in business administration. Given that business administration is less likely to be closely related to a deep love for animals and plants, strong empathy, and quiet puzzles, let's estimate this to be 0.05.

3. **P(E|¬H)**:
   - The likelihood that Adam has this personality sketch given he's NOT in business administration. Given his traits are more aligned with other fields like agricultural science or veterinary science, let's say it's 0.3.


Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence which can be found using the law of total probability:
\[ 
P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|¬H) \times P(¬H)
\]

Plugging in the values:
\[ 
P(E) = 0.05 \times 0.2 + 0.3 \times 0.8 = 0.01 + 0.24 = 0.25
\]

Now:
\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.2}{0.25} = \frac{0.01}{0.25} = 0.04
\]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

#### Bayesian Analysis:
1. **P(H)**:
   - Suppose the prior probability that any given graduate student is studying agricultural and veterinary science. Let's say it's 0.1 (10%).

2. **P(E|H)**:
   - The likelihood that Adam, with his personality sketch, is studying agricultural and veterinary science. Given his traits perfectly align with this field, let's estimate this to be 0.8.

3. **P(E|¬H)**:
   - The likelihood that Adam has this personality sketch given he's NOT in agricultural and veterinary science. Given the specific interest in animals and plants, let's estimatel for this to be 0.1.

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence which can be found using the law of total probability:
\[ 
P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|¬H) \times P(¬H)
\]

Plugging in the values:
\[ 
P(E) = 0.8 \times 0.1 + 0.1 \times 0.9 = 0.08 + 0.09 = 0.17
\]

Now:
\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.17} = \frac{0.08}{0.17} \approx 0.47
\]

### Results:
Based on these estimates, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.04,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.47
}
```
