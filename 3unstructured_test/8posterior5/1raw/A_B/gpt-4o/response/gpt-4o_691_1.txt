To calculate \( P(H|E) \), we will use Bayes' rule, which is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in the field \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in the field \( H \).

Given the nature of Adam's interests, we will make some assumptions:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- **P(H):** This field objectively seems very likely given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and his deep love for animals. Let's assume an average probability of enrollment in any field for a graduate student is \(0.1\), and adjust upward due to the strong fit: \(0.3\).
- **P(E|H):** The personality sketch \( E \) aligns well with this field of study. Let's assume \( 0.8 \).
- **P(E|\neg H):** Let's assume Adam could still have the same personality traits even if not pursuing agricultural and veterinary science, but with a significantly lower likelihood: \( 0.2 \).

Thus,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \]
We need to calculate \( P(E) \). For simplicity, let's assume \( P(E) = \sum P(E|H_i)P(H_i) \) in a broader context and normalize later.

### Business Administration:
- **P(H):** This field seems quite less likely given Adam's personality sketch. Let's assume \(0.1\).
- **P(E|H):** The personality sketch \( E \) does not align as strongly with business administration as it does with agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume \( 0.2 \).
- **P(E|\neg H):** Similar to above, let's assume the likelihood of having the same personality traits if not pursuing business administration with less selectiveness: \( 0.2 \).

Thus,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

Given the two fields:
Assuming the other fields could be normalized as well but not crucial in a straightforward comparison:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": Let's normalize within the context given probabilities are: \( \frac{0.24}{T} \) where \( T \approx (0.24 + 0.02 + \ldots \text{others}) \), so higher than others: \(0.86 \)
  "business administration": For simplicity, \( 0.08 / T \) left: \(0.08)
}

So the output approximate values are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.86",
  "business administration": "0.08"
}
```
