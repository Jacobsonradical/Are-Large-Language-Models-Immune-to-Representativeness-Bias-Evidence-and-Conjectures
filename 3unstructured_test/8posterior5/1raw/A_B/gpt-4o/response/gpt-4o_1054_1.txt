To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to follow these steps for each hypothesis:

1. **Calculate \( P(H) \):** This is the prior probability that Adam would be enrolled in that field.
2. **Calculate \( P(E|H) \):** This is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
3. **Calculate \( P(E|\neg H) \):** This is the likelihood of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis.

Then we use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

But for simplicity, we can avoid calculating \( P(E) \) directly since we are only comparing the relative probabilities.

### 1. Business Administration
- **P(H):** Business administration is a common graduate field but not necessarily aligned with Adam's interests in nature, puzzles, and animals. Suppose **P(H) = 0.1**.
- **P(E|H):** The probability that Adam has the described traits given he is studying business administration is relatively low since his traits (interest in nature, empathy for animals) do not align well with the typical focus in business administration. Suppose **P(E|H) = 0.1**.
- **P(E|\neg H):** The probability that Adam has the described traits given he is not studying business administration is higher as it includes fields more aligned with his interests. Suppose **P(E|\neg H) = 0.5**.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.1 = 0.01 \]

### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H):** Agricultural and veterinary science is less common but is directly aligned with Adam's interests in nature and animals. Suppose **P(H) = 0.05**.
- **P(E|H):** The probability that Adam has the described traits given he is studying agricultural and veterinary science is high since his traits match well with this field. Suppose **P(E|H) = 0.8**.
- **P(E|\neg H):** The probability that Adam has the described traits given he is not studying agricultural and veterinary science is lower because other fields less aligned with his interests are involved. Suppose **P(E|\neg H) = 0.4**.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04 \]

Now we normalize these values to sum to 1 to compare relative probabilities:

Relative probabilities:
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = 0.01 \]
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = 0.04 \]

Normalized:
- Normalizing factor = \(0.01 + 0.04 = 0.05\)
- For business administration: \( \frac{0.01}{0.05} = 0.2 \)
- For agricultural and veterinary science: \( \frac{0.04}{0.05} = 0.8 \)

Therefore:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
