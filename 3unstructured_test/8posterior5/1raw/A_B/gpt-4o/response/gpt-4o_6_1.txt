To estimate the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in either of the given fields based on his personality sketch, we'll use Bayesian inference as outlined.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

**P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy, it's reasonable to assume a moderate to high prior probability for this field.

Let's assume: 
\[ P(H) = 0.4 \]

**P(E|H):** The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given that this field aligns well with his interests and traits, this should be high.

Let's assume: 
\[ P(E|H) = 0.8 \]

**P(E|\neg H):** The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. While some of Adam's traits might align with other fields, the alignment is not as strong. 

Let's assume:
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \]

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.4) + (0.2 \cdot 0.6) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.32 + 0.12 = 0.44 \]

Then:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.4}{0.44} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.727 \]

### Business Administration

**P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration. This field does not strongly align with his personality traits, so the prior should be lower.

Let's assume:
\[ P(H) = 0.2 \]

**P(E|H):** The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in Business Administration. Given the traits, this should be lower than for Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

Let's assume:
\[ P(E|H) = 0.1 \]

**P(E|\neg H):** The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in Business Administration. This should be higher as his traits are more likely to align with fields outside of Business Administration.

Let's assume:
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \]

Using Bayes' rule again:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.24 = 0.26 \]

Then:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.077 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in the given fields are:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.727,
  "business administration": 0.077
}
```
