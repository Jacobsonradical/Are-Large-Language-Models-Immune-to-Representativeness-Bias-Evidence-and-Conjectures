To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to follow these steps:

1. We need \( P(H) \), the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field.
2. We need \( P(E|H) \), the likelihood of Adam having these personality traits given he is in each field.
3. We need \( P(E|\neg H) \), the likelihood of Adam having these personality traits given he is not in each field.
4. Finally, we'll use Bayes' rule: \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(H) \cdot P(E|H)}{P(E)} \).

For simplicity, since we don't have exact values, I'll make reasonable assumptions for these probabilities based on the given sketch. Note that these are simplifications.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. We assume this to be somewhat low given the wide array of possible graduate fields. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam having his personality traits if he is in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his interest in nature, plants, and animals, it seems quite high. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of Adam having these traits if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. This might be lower as these traits are particularly suited to this field. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

We have:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(H) \cdot P(E|H)}{P(E)} \]

where \( P(E) = P(H) \cdot P(E|H) + P(\neg H) \cdot P(E|\neg H) \).

\[ P(E) = 0.05 \cdot 0.8 + 0.95 \cdot 0.1 = 0.04 + 0.095 = 0.135 \]

So,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.8}{0.135} \approx 0.296 \]

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration. Let’s assume this is higher than agricultural and veterinary science due to the popularity of the field. Let’s assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam’s personality traits if he is in business administration. This seems lower since his personality sketch does not align strongly with typical business administration traits. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: We keep the same as before since it reflects the probability of these traits given he is not in the specific field. Let’s keep it \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

Again:

\[ P(E) = P(H) \cdot P(E|H) + P(\neg H) \cdot P(E|\neg H) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.2 + 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.04 + 0.08 = 0.12 \]

So,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.12} \approx 0.333 \]

Therefore:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.296",
  "business administration": "0.333"
}

These probabilities suggest that, based on the given personality sketch, Adam is somewhat more likely to be in business administration than in agricultural and veterinary science, but neither field is highly probable without considering other possible fields of study.
