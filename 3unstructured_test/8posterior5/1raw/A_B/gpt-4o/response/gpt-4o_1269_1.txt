Sure, let's go through the problem using Bayes' Rule. Bayes' Rule states:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that the hypothesis is true given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence.

Let's denote the following:
- Agricultural and veterinary science: \( H_1 \)
- Business administration: \( H_2 \)

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
    For simplicity, let's assume equal priors:
    \[
    P(H_1) = P(H_2) = 0.5
    \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
    - For Agricultural and veterinary science:
        Given Adam's love for nature, animals, and empathy, it seems more likely he would be enrolled in this field.
        \[
        P(E|H_1) = 0.9
        \]
    - For Business administration:
        Adam's interest in nature and animals is less closely aligned with business administration.
        \[
        P(E|H_2) = 0.1
        \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
    - For Agricultural and veterinary science:
        \[
        P(E|\neg H_1) = 0.1
        \]
    - For Business administration:
        \[
        P(E|\neg H_2) = 0.9
        \]

### Calculating Posterior Probability

Given Bayes' Rule:
- For Agricultural and veterinary science:
    \[
    P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)}
    \]

- For Business administration:
    \[
    P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E)}
    \]

We need to compute \( P(E) \):
\[
P(E) = P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)
\]
Substituting:
\[
P(E) = 0.9 \cdot 0.5 + 0.1 \cdot 0.5 = 0.45 + 0.05 = 0.5
\]

Substitute back into Bayes' Rule:
- For Agricultural and veterinary science:
    \[
    P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = 0.9
    \]

- For Business administration:
    \[
    P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = 0.1
    \]

### Final Answers
\[
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.9,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
\]
