To compute the conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis being true.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence given the hypothesis is true.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence given the hypothesis is false.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the evidence.

We don't have the exact values for prior probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) as we're working with qualitative assessments. However, we can intuitively estimate these values based on the given personality sketch and general knowledge.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): The probability that a graduate student in the U.S. is studying agricultural and veterinary science is relatively low because it's a more specialized field compared to others.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's characteristics (love for nature, animals, empathy) strongly align with this field.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): While Adam could also fit into other fields, the fit isn't typically as strong.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): The probability that a graduate student in the U.S. is studying business administration is high because it's one of the most popular fields.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's characteristics (empathy, intelligence) could be beneficial in business, but they donâ€™t strongly suggest this field specifically.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The traits are more moderately likely across various other fields.

Let's assign qualitative probabilities:

- \( P(H) \approx 0.05 \) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science (since it's specialized).
- \( P(H) \approx 0.20 \) for Business Administration (since it's more common).
- \( P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science (strong fit).
- \( P(E|H) \approx 0.4 \) for Business Administration (moderate fit).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \) for Business Administration.

Given these, let's calculate the conditional probabilities:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(E) \approx P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \approx (0.9 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95) = 0.045 + 0.19 = 0.235 \)
   - \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.235} \approx 0.19 \)

2. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(E) \approx P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \approx (0.4 \cdot 0.20) + (0.3 \cdot 0.80) = 0.08 + 0.24 = 0.32 \)
   - \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.20}{0.32} \approx 0.25 \)

Therefore:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.19,
  "business administration": 0.25
