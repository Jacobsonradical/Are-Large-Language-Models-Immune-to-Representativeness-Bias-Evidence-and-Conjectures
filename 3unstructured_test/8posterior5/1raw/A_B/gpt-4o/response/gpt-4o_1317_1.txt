To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the hypotheses that Adam was enrolled in either "business administration" or "agricultural and veterinary science," we need to use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's define the prior and likelihood probabilities for each field based on the given personality sketch \( E \), and then use these to compute the posterior probabilities.

### Steps:
1. Define the priors \( P(H) \) for each field.
2. Define the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) for each field.
3. Define the likelihoods \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field.
4. Compute \( P(E) \) using the law of total probability.
5. Compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule.

### Definitions:
Assume priors as follows (these are educated guesses since exact priors are not given):

- \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.1 \)

The likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \):

- \( P(E|\text{business administration}) \) is lower because the characteristics described (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals) are not typically associated with business administration students.
- \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \) is higher because the traits described are strongly associated with students in this field.

Estimated values:
- \( P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.6 \)
- \( P(E|\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.3 \)

Let's calculate the probability of evidence \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) + P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) \cdot P(\neg \text{business administration}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9 = 0.01 + 0.18 = 0.19 \]

\[ P(E) = P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) + P(E|\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.6 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9 = 0.06 + 0.27 = 0.33 \]

Now apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.19} = \frac{0.01}{0.19} \approx 0.053 \]

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.1}{0.33} = \frac{0.06}{0.33} \approx 0.182 \]

### Final Results in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.053,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.182
}
```

These results suggest that based on the personality sketch, Adam is more likely to have been enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration.
