Sure, let's break it down using Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we are comparing two fields, we can assume a common denominator \(P(E)\) and focus on the numerator for each hypothesis \(H\).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H)**: The probability of being enrolled in this field. Let's assume a moderate value of 0.15, given that it's not an extremely common field but fits the profile well.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality traits given that Adam is in this field. This is high because his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align well. Let's set this to 0.8.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing these personality traits given that Adam is not in this field. Traits like empathy and love for animals are relatively common but specific interest in nature is not. Let's assign a moderate probability of 0.3.

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H)P(H) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 \]

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)**: The probability of being enrolled in this field. Let's assume this is slightly more common than agricultural and veterinary science. Let's set this to 0.25.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality traits given that Adam is in this field. This is relatively low because business administration often requires different kinds of traits. Let's assign a value of 0.2.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing these personality traits given that Adam is not in business administration. This should be similar to the earlier scenario. Let's assign a moderate probability of 0.3.

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H)P(H) = 0.2 * 0.25 = 0.05 \]

Combining these intermediate probabilities and ignoring the common denominator since we're comparing:
