Let's start by analyzing the provided personality sketch of Adam and the fields "agricultural and veterinary science" (AVS) and "business administration" (BA). 

From the personality sketch:

- A genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
- Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles.
- Warm-hearted, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
- Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

These traits seem more aligned with AVS given the emphasis on nature, plants, and animals compared to BA, which generally focuses on leadership, management, finance, etc.

Now let's estimate the probabilities P(H) (prior probability for each hypothesis), P(E|H) (likelihood of E given H), and P(E|¬H) (likelihood of E given not H). Keep in mind that these are subjective estimates:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS)
Given the strong alignment of Adam’s traits with AVS:

- P(H) = 0.15 (since graduate programs in AVS are less common but not rare)
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (high probability that someone in AVS would have such traits)
- P(E|¬H) = 0.1 (lower probability that someone outside AVS would have all these traits)

### Business Administration (BA)
Adam's traits do not align well with the typical BA student profile:

- P(H) = 0.25 (since BA programs are common among graduate fields)
- P(E|H) = 0.1 (lower probability that someone in BA would have such traits)
- P(E|¬H) = 0.2 (since the BA profile is diverse and might include some of these traits)

Now let's use Bayes' rule to compute P(H|E) for each field.

Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, we'll calculate the numerator for each and then compare them without normalizing by P(E), as we're interested in relative comparisons.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS):

\[ P(AVS|E) \propto P(E|AVS)P(AVS) = 0.8 \times 0.15 = 0.12 \]

### Business Administration (BA):

\[ P(BA|E) \propto P(E|BA)P(BA) = 0.1 \times 0.25 = 0.025 \]

Upon comparison, P(AVS|E) is much higher than P(BA|E).

So, the final results are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.12,
  "business administration": 0.025
}
```

These results indicate that it is more likely Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration, given the personality sketch provided.
