To calculate the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch (E), we will use Bayesâ€™ rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

We need to estimate the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was not in that field.

Let's start with some reasonable estimates based on the personality sketch.

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration. Let's assume there is a broad interest in this field among graduates, so we'll say:
   \[ P(H_{BA}) \approx 0.15 \]

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he was in Business Administration. Given that his interests (nature, animals, puzzles, etc.) don't particularly align with this field, we assign a lower probability:
   \[ P(E|H_{BA}) \approx 0.05 \]

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he was not in Business Administration. This might be higher since his interests are more aligned with other fields. We can assign:
   \[ P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \approx 0.30 \]

Plugging these into Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.15}{(0.05 \cdot 0.15) + (0.30 \cdot 0.85)} \approx \frac{0.0075}{0.2675} \approx 0.028 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Assuming these fields are less common than Business Administration but still popular, we might estimate:
   \[ P(H_{AVS}) \approx 0.10 \]

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he was in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given his interest in nature and animals, this is quite high:
   \[ P(E|H_{AVS}) \approx 0.80 \]

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he was not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Assuming these characteristics are uncommon for those outside this field:
   \[ P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \approx 0.20 \]

Plugging these into Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.10}{(0.80 \cdot 0.10) + (0.20 \cdot 0.90)} \approx \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.18} \approx \frac{0.08}{0.26} \approx 0.31 \]

The final computed probabilities are:

  "business administration": 0.028,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.31
