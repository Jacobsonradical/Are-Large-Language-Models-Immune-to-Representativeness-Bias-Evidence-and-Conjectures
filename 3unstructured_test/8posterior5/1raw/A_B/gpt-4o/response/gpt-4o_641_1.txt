To apply Bayes' rule, we first need to estimate the probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field. Then we will use these to compute \( P(H|E) \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Graduate students in these fields might not be extremely common, but given Adam's interest in nature and animals, we might consider this likely:
   - Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.10 \).

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, this seems quite likely:
   - Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.90 \).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Since Adam's characteristics are quite aligned with nature-related fields but not necessarily exclusive to them, this might be moderately likely:
   - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.30 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.90 \times 0.10) + (0.30 \times 0.90) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.09 + 0.27 = 0.36 \]

Then:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.90 \times 0.10}{0.36} = \frac{0.09}{0.36} = 0.25 \]

### Business Administration

1. **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration. Graduate students in business administration are relatively common, but Adam's personality sketch doesn't strongly indicate this field:
   - Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.20 \).

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in business administration. Adam's empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for nature are somewhat less aligned with typical business administration characteristics:
   - Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.10 \).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in business administration. Given his characteristics, the sketch might be more aligned with non-business fields:
   - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.40 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.10 \times 0.20) + (0.40 \times 0.80) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.32 = 0.34 \]

Then:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.10 \times 0.20}{0.34} = \frac{0.02}{0.34} \approx 0.059 \]
