To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' theorem, we need the following probabilities:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given the negation of the hypothesis \( H \).

We use Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

### 1. Business Administration (BA)

#### Assumptions:
- \( P(H_{BA}) \): Let's assume the prior probability that a graduate student is in business administration is relatively common but not overwhelmingly dominant. So, we could estimate it to be around 0.15.
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): Given Adam's curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals, it is less likely for him to be in Business Administration. We can estimate this low, say 0.05.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \): Given that there are many other fields that align better with Adam’s interests, let's assume this is relatively high, around 0.4.

#### Calculation:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{BA}))} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.15}{0.05 \cdot 0.15 + 0.4 \cdot 0.85} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.0075}{0.0075 + 0.34} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx \frac{0.0075}{0.3475} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx 0.0216 \]

### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS)

#### Assumptions:
- \( P(H_{AVS}) \): Let’s assume the prior probability that a graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science is lower than business administration, say 0.05.
- \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \): Given Adam's interest in nature and animals, this probability should be high, say 0.7.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \): This would be the probability of the evidence given any other field, which can be assumed somewhat lower than the previous case, say 0.3.

#### Calculation:
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) + P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{AVS}))} \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{0.7 \cdot 0.05 + 0.3 \cdot 0.95} \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.035}{0.035 + 0.285} \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.035}{0.32} \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \approx 0.1094 \]
