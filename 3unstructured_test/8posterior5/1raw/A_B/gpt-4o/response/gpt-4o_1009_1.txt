To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Here is the Bayesian formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) \) can be computed as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

#### Prior Probability \( P(H) \)
Given Adam's interest in nature and animals, it is reasonable to assign a high prior probability that he would choose a field related to these interests.
\[ P(H_{\text{agri}}) = 0.6 \] (This assumes a higher likelihood due to the personality match)

#### Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)
Given Adam's specific traits (empathy, love for animals, understanding of dedication) and high intelligence, this fits well with the profile required for agricultural and veterinary sciences.
\[ P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) = 0.9 \]

#### Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)
For fields other than agricultural and veterinary science, the probability of having similar personality characteristics is lower but not impossible.
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{agri}}) = 0.2 \]

Combining these:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agri}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{agri}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{agri}}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.9 \cdot 0.6 + 0.2 \cdot 0.4 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.54 + 0.08 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.62 \]

Posterior Probability \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agri}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.6}{0.62} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) \approx 0.87 \]

### Business Administration

#### Prior Probability \( P(H) \)
Given Adam's profile, it is less likely that he would choose business administration over agricultural and veterinary science.
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1 \] (Less likely due to misalignment with stated interests)

#### Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)
The traits of strong empathy and warm-heartedness are somewhat relevant but not a perfect match for typical business administration students.
\[ P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.4 \]

#### Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)
For fields other than business administration, the same probability can be assumed as other non-business fields.
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.5 \]

Combining these:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.4 \cdot 0.1 + 0.5 \cdot 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.45 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.49 \]

Posterior Probability \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.1}{0.49} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \approx 0.082 \]
