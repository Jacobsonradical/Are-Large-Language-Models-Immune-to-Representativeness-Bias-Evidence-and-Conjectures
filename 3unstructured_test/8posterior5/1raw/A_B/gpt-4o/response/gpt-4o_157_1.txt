Sure, let's evaluate the probabilities step by step.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H_agricultural):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume a reasonable estimate given the number of possible graduate fields is 0.1.
2. **P(E|H_agricultural):** The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals, this seems quite high. Let's estimate this as 0.8.
3. **P(E|¬H_agricultural):** The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is **not** in agricultural and veterinary science. Since his personality seems to align more with agricultural and veterinary science than with other fields (like business administration), we can assume this is lower. Let's estimate this as 0.2.

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Substituting in the values:

\[ P(H_{agricultural}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9} \]
\[ P(H_{agricultural}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.18} \]
\[ P(H_{agricultural}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \approx 0.3077 \]

### Business Administration
1. **P(H_business):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Let's assume a reasonable estimate given the number of possible graduate fields is 0.1.
2. **P(E|H_business):** The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in business administration. Given his strong empathy, warm heart, and love for animals, these traits are less aligned with business administration. Let's estimate this as 0.2.
3. **P(E|¬H_business):** The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is **not** in business administration. Since his personality aligns more with agricultural and veterinary science than business administration, we can assume this is higher. Let's estimate this as 0.4.

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H_{business}|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Substituting in the values:

\[ P(H_{business}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.4 \cdot 0.9} \]
\[ P(H_{business}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.36} \]
\[ P(H_{business}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.38} \approx 0.0526 \]

So, our final probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3077,
  "business administration": 0.0526
}
```
