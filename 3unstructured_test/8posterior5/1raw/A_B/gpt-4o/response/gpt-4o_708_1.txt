Let's analyze the two fields given, business administration and agricultural and veterinary science, considering Adam's personality sketch. We will estimate the probabilities and then apply Bayes' Theorem to compute P(H|E).

### Business Administration
- **P(H):** The prior probability that a student is enrolled in business administration. Business administration is a common field of study, so we'll estimate this as 0.25.
- **P(E|H):** The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in business administration. The traits described (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals) do not strongly align with typical business administration traits. Therefore, we might estimate this as 0.10.
- **P(E|¬H):** The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is *not* in business administration. Since the personality sketch strongly suggests alignment with fields closer to nature and science, we'll estimate this as 0.70.

Applying Bayes’ theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.10 \cdot 0.25}{0.10 \cdot 0.25 + 0.70 \cdot 0.75} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.025}{0.025 + 0.525} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.025}{0.55} \approx 0.0455 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H):** The prior probability that a student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This is a less common field compared to business administration, so we'll estimate this as 0.10.
- **P(E|H):** The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science. The traits (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals) strongly align with this field, so we'll estimate this as 0.80.
- **P(E|¬H):** The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is *not* in agricultural and veterinary science. Considering the uniqueness of his personality traits being closely aligned with this field, we'll estimate this as 0.40.

Applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.10}{0.80 \cdot 0.10 + 0.40 \cdot 0.90} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.36} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.44} \approx 0.1818 \]

The computed probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0455,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.1818
}
```
These values suggest that it is more likely that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration, given his personality sketch.
