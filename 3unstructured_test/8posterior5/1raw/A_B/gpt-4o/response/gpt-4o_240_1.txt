To estimate \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study, we need to consider Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability that Adam has the described personality sketch given he is enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability that Adam has the described personality sketch given he is not enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch E.

Because \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields and can be considered as a normalizing constant in this case, we can focus on the relative values of \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) to rank the hypotheses. Let's estimate these probabilities:

### Business Administration
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H_{\text{business}}) \)**: This might be relatively high because business administration is a common graduate field.
    - \( P(H_{\text{business}}) \approx 0.2 \)
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \)**: The personality sketch does not strongly align with typical traits expected in business administration, which might more commonly include skills and interests in leadership, strategy, and finance rather than empathy, nature, and animals.
    - \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \approx 0.1 \)
3. **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}}) \)**: The probability of having the described personality sketch in other fields might be higher given the alignment with scientific curiosity and empathy.
    - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}}) \approx 0.3 \)

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H_{\text{agri-vet}}) \)**: Less common than business administration but relevant.
    - \( P(H_{\text{agri-vet}}) \approx 0.05 \)
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{agri-vet}}) \)**: This aligns very well with Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy.
    - \( P(E|H_{\text{agri-vet}}) \approx 0.7 \)
3. **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agri-vet}}) \)**: Higher probability of matching E in this specific field due to exact alignment.
    - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agri-vet}}) \approx 0.3 \)

### Calculation of Posterior Probability using Bayes' Rule
Relative ranking:
\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}}) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agri-vet}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{agri-vet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agri-vet}}) = 0.7 \cdot 0.05 = 0.035 \]

Normalizing:
\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.035} \approx 0.36 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agri-vet}}|E) = \frac{0.035}{0.02 + 0.035} \approx 0.64 \]

Final Answer:
{
  "business administration": 0.36,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.64
}
