To apply Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate the following for each field (H):

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in the given field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in the given field.

Finally, we use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we do not have specific values, we'll make reasonable assumptions based on the information provided.

### Assuming Reasonable Values

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. \( P(H_{\text{ag}}) \):
   - Prior probability that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, let's assume this is moderately likely for a graduate student.
   - **Assumption**: \( P(H_{\text{ag}}) = 0.15 \).

2. \( P(E|H_{\text{ag}}) \):
   - The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Strong fit with Adam's interests and empathy.
   - **Assumption**: \( P(E|H_{\text{ag}}) = 0.9 \).

3. \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{ag}}) \):
   - The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - This could still be fairly high but not as high since there are many other fields where empathy and nature interests can be relevant.
   - **Assumption**: \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{ag}}) = 0.3 \).

#### Business Administration

1. \( P(H_{\text{bus}}) \):
   - Prior probability that Adam is in business administration.
   - Given Adam's quiet nature and lack of typical business traits in the sketch, this is less likely.
   - **Assumption**: \( P(H_{\text{bus}}) = 0.05 \).

2. \( P(E|H_{\text{bus}}) \):
   - The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is in business administration.
   - Less likely since the sketch aligns less with typical business administration traits.
   - **Assumption**: \( P(E|H_{\text{bus}}) = 0.1 \).

3. \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{bus}}) \):
   - The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in business administration.
   - Could be higher than given he might fit numerous other fields.
   - **Assumption**: \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{bus}}) = 0.6 \).

### Bayes' Rule Calculation

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H_{\text{ag}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{ag}}) P(H_{\text{ag}})}{P(E)} \]
We estimate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{ag}})P(H_{\text{ag}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{ag}})P(\neg H_{\text{ag}}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.9 \times 0.15) + (0.3 \times 0.85) = 0.135 + 0.255 = 0.39 \]
Thus:
\[ P(H_{\text{ag}}|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.15}{0.39} \approx 0.346 \]

For business administration:
\[ P(H_{\text{bus}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{bus}}) P(H_{\text{bus}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{bus}})P(H_{\text{bus}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{bus}})P(\neg H_{\text{bus}}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.05) + (0.6 \times 0.95) = 0.005 + 0.57 = 0.575 \]
Thus:
\[ P(H_{\text{bus}}|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.05}{0.575} \approx 0.0087 \]
