To solve this, let’s identify and compute the required probabilities step-by-step for each field (business administration and agricultural and veterinary science):

1. **Prior Probability, \(P(H)\):** This is the probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field before knowing anything about his personality sketch.
2. **Conditional Probability, \(P(E|H)\):** This is the probability that Adam has the described personality traits given that he was enrolled in the given field.
3. **Conditional Probability, \(P(E|\neg H)\):** This is the probability that Adam has the described personality traits given that he was not enrolled in the given field.
4. **Posterior Probability, \(P(H|E)\):** This is the probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field given his personality sketch, calculated using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we need only relative values, and not the exact probabilities (as the total need not be 1), we can focus on computing:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

**Assumptions:**
1. Prior probabilities \(P(H)\):
   - There are many fields of graduate study, so let's assume equal priors for simplicity:
   - \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.05 \) (Not a very common field to have interests directly connected to nature and animals but certainly plausible).
   - \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.1 \) (More likely given Adam’s interests).

2. Conditional probabilities \( P(E|H) \):
   - For business administration, having strong empathy, intelligence, and appreciation could be lower because the field typically focuses on corporate/strategic goals rather than natural curiosity and animals:
     - \( P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.2 \)
   - For agricultural and veterinary science, Adam’s traits align very well with this field given his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy:
     - \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.8 \)

3. Conditional probabilities \(P(E|\neg H)\):
   - The complement probability can be assumed by taking the broad range of other fields; given the personality sketch might be more rare:
     - \( P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) = 0.05 \)
     - \( P(E|\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.1 \)

Many specific fields other than agricultural and veterinary science might not fit Adam’s profile well. 

Let's compute via Bayes' theorem ratios:

### Business Administration:
\[ 
P(\text{business administration}|E) \propto P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})
\]
\[ 
P(\text{business administration}|E) \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.05 = 0.01 
\]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ 
P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \propto P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})
\]
\[ 
P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 
\]

### Relative Posterior Probabilities:

{
  "business administration": "0.01",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.08"
}

These relative posterior probabilities suggest that it is much more likely that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science rather than business administration given his personality profile.
