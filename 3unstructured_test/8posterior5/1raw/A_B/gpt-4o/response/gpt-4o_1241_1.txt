Let's go through the Bayesian reasoning for each of the hypotheses.

We need to estimate:
1. \( P(H) \) — the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field of study.
2. \( P(E|H) \) — the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch E given that he was enrolled in the particular field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) — the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch E given that he was not enrolled in the particular field.

Then we can use Bayes' Rule, which states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) \) can be estimated through the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's estimate these probabilities for the given fields:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - **P(H)**: The prior for a random graduate student in the U.S. to be in business administration could be estimated around 0.1 (10%), considering it's a popular field of study.
   - **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's personality traits of loving nature, empathy towards animals, and solving puzzles, these traits do not strongly match a business administration profile. Let's assume this to be around 0.02.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: This is the probability of the same personality sketch well-matching fields different from business administration. Given the specificity of his traits, let’s suppose this is around 0.1.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **P(H)**: The prior for a random graduate student being in agricultural and veterinary science might be around 0.05 (5%), considering it's less common than business administration but fits Adam's profile better.
   - **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's traits and curiosity about nature and animals, this likelihood is high, say about 0.8.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch in other fields (not agricultural and veterinary science) remains the same, say 0.1 as previously estimated.

Now we can calculate posterior probabilities using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02 \cdot 0.1}{(0.02 \cdot 0.1) + (0.1 \cdot 0.9)} = \frac{0.002}{0.002 + 0.09} = \frac{0.002}{0.092} \approx 0.0217 \]

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{(0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.1 \cdot 0.95)} = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.095} = \frac{0.04}{0.135} \approx 0.296 \]

Thus, given the personality sketch of Adam, the probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": 0.0217,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.296
}

Note: The exact numerical values depend on more precise estimations and available data. The values here are estimated based on typical characteristics and prevalence of these fields among graduate students.
