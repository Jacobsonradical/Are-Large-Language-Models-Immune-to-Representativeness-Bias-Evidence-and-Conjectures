To solve this problem using Bayes' theorem, we need to estimate the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field. 
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch matches if he was enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch matches if he was not enrolled in that field.

### Assumptions:
- \( P(H) \): Given no prior information about Adam's choice of field, let's assume an initially equal distribution among all possible fields.

- \( P(E|H) \): This is the likelihood that Adam's profile matches his enrollment in the field. For a field like agricultural and veterinary science, which aligns well with his love for nature, animals, and empathy, this will be high. For a field like business administration, which might not align as well with his described traits, this will be lower.

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): This is trickier because it involves all alternative fields. However, as a rough estimate, we can distribute it based on general fit with the profile.

Values will be estimates due to lack of specific statistics.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science \( (H_1) \)**
   - Prior: \( P(H_1) \approx 0.1 \) (Assuming 10% since he could be in wide range of fields)
   - Likelihood: \( P(E | H_1) \approx 0.8 \) (Strong alignment with nature, animals, empathy)
   - Complement Likelihood: \( P(E | \neg H_1) \approx 0.2 \) (Low, because few other fields would align this well)

2. **Business Administration \( (H_2) \)**
   - Prior: \( P(H_2) \approx 0.1 \) (Assuming 10% given many fields)
   - Likelihood: \( P(E | H_2) \approx 0.1 \) (Weak alignment with business traits)
   - Complement Likelihood: \( P(E | \neg H_2) \approx 0.7 \) (Higher, as more fields fit Adamâ€™s profile better than business)

### Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E | H) \cdot P(H) + P(E | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

We'll simplify \( P(E) \) assuming equal distribution over a broad range of fields for simplicity in lack of specific data but note our assumption introduces some imprecision.

### Calculations:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
\[ P(E) \approx 0.8 \times 0.1 + 0.2 \times 0.9 = 0.08 + 0.18 = 0.26 \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.26} \approx 0.308 \]

2. **Business Administration**
\[ P(E) \approx 0.1 \times 0.1 + 0.7 \times 0.9 = 0.01 + 0.63 = 0.64 \]
\[ P(H_2 | E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.1}{0.64} \approx 0.016 \]

Based on these estimations:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.308,
  "business administration": 0.016
}
```

These values express that Adam's profile is more likely to fit agricultural and veterinary science than business administration.
