To compute the posterior probabilities using Bayes' Rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field, the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) of observing Adam's personality sketch given each hypothesis, and the overall likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \) of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not enrolled in that specific field.

### Field 1: Business Administration
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):** This is the general likelihood of a graduate student being enrolled in Business Administration. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** Given that Business Administration typically attracts students interested in management and finance rather than nature, animals, and empathy, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is relatively low. Let's set \( P(E|H) = 0.05 \).
3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):** This is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch among all graduate students who are not studying Business Administration. Since Adamâ€™s traits more closely align with fields like agricultural and veterinary science, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).
4. **Posterior Probability \( P(H|E) \)**:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
Given \( P(E) \) is the sum of \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) over all hypotheses, let's evaluate it using relative values without normalizing:
\[
P(E) \approx P(E|H_1)P(H_1) + P(E|H_2)P(H_2) + \text{...}
\]

\[
P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.2}{(0.05 \cdot 0.2 + 0.8 * 0.3)} \approx \frac{0.01}{0.25} \approx 0.04
\]

### Field 2: Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):** This is the general likelihood of a graduate student being enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** Given Adam's close alignment with nature, animals, and empathy, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is relatively high. Setting \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).
3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):** Given he isn't in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Overall, it's still \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).
4. **Posterior Probability \( P(H|E) \)**:
\[
P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{(0.3 \cdot 0.1 + 0.7 * 0.3)} \approx \frac{0.03}{0.24} \approx 0.125
\]

Putting it all together:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.04,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.125
}
```

These values are indicative of the relative probabilities, showing that Adam is more likely to be enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science than in Business Administration given his personality sketch.
