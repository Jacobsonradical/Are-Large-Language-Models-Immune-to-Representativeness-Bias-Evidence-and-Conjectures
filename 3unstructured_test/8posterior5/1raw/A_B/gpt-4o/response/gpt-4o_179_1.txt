Certainly! Here's the analysis and the computed probabilities for each field based on the given personality sketch of Adam:

**For Business Administration:**

- P(H): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration.
  - Generally, Business Administration is a common field of study, so let's assume a moderate prior. Let's assign P(H) a value of 0.2.

- P(E|H): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he is enrolled in Business Administration.
  - Business Administration students may possess some of these traits, but traits like love for nature, empathy for animals, and strong curiosity about nature are not strictly aligned with it. Let's give this a value of 0.1.

- P(E|\neg H): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he is not enrolled in Business Administration.
  - Considering Adam's unique traits, it's more likely these traits would appear if he were not in Business Administration. Let's assign P(E|\neg H) a value of 0.7.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.7 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.56 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.58 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.58} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.58} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.034 \]

**For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

- P(H): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
  - Given his traits, it's reasonable to assume interest in this field could be a bit higher than in Business Administration. Let's assume P(H) a value of 0.1.

- P(E|H): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
  - Given traits such as love for nature, empathy for animals, and curiosity, these align strongly with Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Let's give this a high value of 0.8.

- P(E|\neg H): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he is not enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
  - This would be significantly lower since these traits highly match with Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Let's assign P(E|\neg H) a value of 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.27 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.35 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.35} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.229 \]
