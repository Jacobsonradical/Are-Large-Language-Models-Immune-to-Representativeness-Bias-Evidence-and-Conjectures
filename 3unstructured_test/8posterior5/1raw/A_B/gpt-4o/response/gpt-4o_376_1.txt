To use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study, we need to consider the following probabilities:

1. P(H): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
2. P(E|H): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
3. P(E|\neg H): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in the specific field.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) \) can be computed using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's evaluate the fields:

### Business Administration

#### Prior Probability, P(H)
Assuming there's no given information, let's assign prior probabilities based on general distribution of students in different graduate fields. This is somewhat subjective, but for the sake of calculation, let's assume an even starting point or use any known general statistics (for illustration, I'll apply equal likelihood for simplicity).
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.2 \]

#### Likelihood, P(E|H)
Given that the personality sketch describes a person with a deep love for nature, plants, animals, empathy, and intelligence, it seems less typical for a business administration student.
\[ P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.1 \]

#### Complement Likelihood, P(E|\neg H)
The probability of observing the personality sketch if Adam is not in business administration might be higher as the sketch fits more closely with fields related to nature and animals.
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.4 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

#### Prior Probability, P(H)
Let's consider the same prior assumption (equal likelihood, just for simplicity).
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.2 \]

#### Likelihood, P(E|H)
The personality sketch highly matches with qualities expected in a student enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
\[ P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.8 \]

#### Complement Likelihood, P(E|\neg H)
The probability of observing the personality sketch if Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science is comparatively lower.
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.2 \]

Now, using these values to compute \( P(H|E) \):

#### For Business Administration:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.4 \cdot 0.8) = 0.02 + 0.32 = 0.34 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.34} \approx 0.06 \]

#### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.2) + (0.2 \cdot 0.8) = 0.16 + 0.16 = 0.32 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{0.32} = 0.5 \]

Now compiling these results:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.06,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5
}
```
As calculated, Adam has a higher probability of being enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science based on the given personality sketch.
