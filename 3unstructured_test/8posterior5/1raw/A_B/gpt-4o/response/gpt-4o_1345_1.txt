To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific graduate field, we can use Bayes' Rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that \( P(E) \) is constant for all hypotheses, we can simplify our calculations to finding the relative probabilities and then normalizing them. 

Here's how we break it down:

1. **P(H)**: The probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field before knowing his personality sketch.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in that specific field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is not enrolled in that specific field. This is often harder to estimate, but we can infer the likelihood of his personality traits being common or uncommon in general.

Let's estimate these probabilities for both fields:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)**: This is the prior probability of any given graduate student being in this field. Let's assume a rough estimate like 10%.
\[
P(H) \approx 0.10
\]

- **P(E|H)**: Considering Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, and having a warm heart, this fits well with a student in agricultural and veterinary science. So, this probability might be quite high. 
\[
P(E|H) \approx 0.80
\]

- **P(E|\neg H)**: This is the probability of Adam's personality sketch appearing if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Since his traits might be shared with students in other nature-oriented fields, but less so in non-related fields:
\[
P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.20
\]

By Bayes' Rule:
\[
P(H|E) \propto \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
Since \( P(E) \) is common, we compare:
\[
P(H|E) \propto 0.80 \cdot 0.10 = 0.08
\]

### Business Administration

- **P(H)**: Again, the prior probability of any given graduate student being in this field. Let's assume a rough estimate like 15%.
\[
P(H) \approx 0.15
\]

- **P(E|H)**: Given Adam’s personality sketch, it doesn't strongly align with the traits typically associated with business administration, which may focus more on strategic thinking, leadership, and less directly on love for animals and nature.
\[
P(E|H) \approx 0.10
\]

- **P(E|\neg H)**: Similar reasoning as above. Adam’s personality is likely more fitting in a field related to nature or animals:
\[
P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.20
\]

By Bayes' Rule:
\[
P(H|E) \propto \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
Since \( P(E) \) is common, we compare:
\[
P(H|E) \propto 0.10 \cdot 0.15 = 0.015
\]

### Conclusion

Now, let's normalize these for comparison:

\[
\text{agricultural and veterinary science} \propto 0.08
\]
\[
\text{business administration} \propto 0.015
\]

The normalized probabilities are then:

\[
P( \text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.015} \approx 0.842
\]
\[
P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.015}{0.08 + 0.015} \approx 0.158
\]

Expressing these probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.842,
  "business administration": 0.158
}
