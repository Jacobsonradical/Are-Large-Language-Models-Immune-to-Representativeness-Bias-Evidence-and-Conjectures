To solve for \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Theorem, we need to use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field without considering his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in a particular field \( H \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in the particular field \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \).

Since we have only two fields to consider, we can simplify the computation by focusing on relative probabilities for the given fields.

### Assumptions
1. Let's assume \( P(H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science is relatively moderate due to Adam's interests in nature and animals.
2. Let's assume \( P(H) \) for business administration is relatively lower because Adam's personality traits do not strongly align with typical characteristics valued in business administration.

### Estimates
Let's assign some estimates based on logical reasoning provided by the personality sketch:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \) (a priori belief): 0.3
   - \( P(E|H) \) (Adam's traits fitting this field): 0.8
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): 0.2 (assuming limited overlap of his traits with other fields)

2. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \) (a priori belief): 0.1
   - \( P(E|H) \) (Adam's traits fitting this field): 0.2
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): 0.3 (assuming some traits could be useful, but not a perfect fit)

### Calculations
**For Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \]

**For Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

We don't have the exact value of \( P(E) \), so we'll look at relative comparisons:
- Let's find a relative scaling factor for each field by assuming \( P(E) \) to normalize the proportional values.

### Relative Probabilities:
Normalizing proportional values for both fields based on Bayes' rule:

\[ \text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science} \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \]
\[ \text{Business Administration} \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.1 = 0.02 \]

From these proportions:
\[ \frac{0.24}{0.24 + 0.02} \approx 0.923 \]
\[ \frac{0.02}{0.24 + 0.02} \approx 0.077 \]

Therefore, the inferred probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.923,
  "business administration": 0.077
}
