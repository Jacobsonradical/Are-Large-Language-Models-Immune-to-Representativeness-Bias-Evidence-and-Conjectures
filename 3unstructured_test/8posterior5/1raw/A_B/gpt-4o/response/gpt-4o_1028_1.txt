To apply Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the following probabilities:

- \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in each of the given fields.
- \(P(E|H)\): The probability of observing the evidence (E) given that Adam is enrolled in the field.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of observing the evidence (E) given that Adam is not enrolled in the field.

Then, we can use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \(P(E)\) is constant for all hypotheses, we can ignore it for comparing relative probabilities between hypotheses.

Let's consider the fields individually based on the given personality sketch:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \(P(H)\): This is somewhat likely considering graduate fields generally have some balance. Let's estimate it at 0.1.
   - \(P(E|H)\): Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, this probability is high. Let's say 0.9.
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability that someone with Adam's traits being in another field (other than agriculture and vet science) might be lower due to his specific interests. Let's say 0.3.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - \(P(H)\): This is plausible, as business is a common graduate field. Let's estimate it at 0.15.
   - \(P(E|H)\): Given Adam's traits, especially his deep love for animals and nature, this is fairly unlikely. Let's estimate it at 0.2.
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\): Similar field exclusions apply here, but the likelihood is broader. Let's estimate it at 0.5.

Using Bayes' rule and approximating effectively:

### Probabilistic Approximations:

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.09 \]

**Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \cdot 0.15 = 0.03 \]

### Normalizing (optional):

To find actual probabilities, we should normalize these values so they sum to 1. However, since the request is for relative values, we can compare directly.

Overall calculation:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.09,
  "business administration": 0.03
}
```

Thus, based on Adam's personality sketch, it appears more likely that Adam was enrolled in **agricultural and veterinary science** rather than **business administration**.
