To answer this question, we'll use Bayes' Rule to calculate the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field (H) given his personality sketch (E). The formula for Bayes' Rule is: 

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to estimate the following values for each field:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being in that field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in that field.
4. \( P(E) \): The total probability of the personality sketch.

For simplicity, instead of computing exact values, we'll provide reasonable estimates that will help in forming a comparative understanding.

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)** (Prior): Business administration is a common field, so let's assume P(H) = 0.2.
2. **P(E|H)**: Given that E describes Adam as having a strong empathy, deep love for animals, and interest in nature, which are not highly associated with business administration, we'll estimate this probability lower. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.1.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: To reflect the general population of non-business administration fields, we'll assume P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 (since there are many fields where Adam's traits might be a better fit).
4. **P(E)**: A general normalization constant. Let's set it as a constant and focus on the relative comparison, meaning we need not explicitly compute this.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)** (Prior): Less common than business administration but quite fitting for Adam's interests. We'll assign a higher prior probability. Let's assume P(H) = 0.1.
2. **P(E|H)**: This field matches very closely with Adam's described personality traits. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.7.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Probabilities diverging towards fields less fitting. Letâ€™s assume again P(E|\neg H) = 0.3.
4. **P(E)**: Again, a general normalization constant.

For simplicity of calculation, we'll use relative terms and focus on the comparison between the fields:

### Business Administration Calculation

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.02}{P(E)} \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science Calculation

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.07}{P(E)} \]

When comparing these relative probabilities:

### Comparative Probabilities

- Business Administration: \(\frac{0.02}{P(E)}\)
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \(\frac{0.07}{P(E)}\)

In a proportional sense:

{
  "business administration":  \(\frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.07} = 0.22 \approx 0.2\),
  "agricultural and veterinary science":  \(\frac{0.07}{0.02 + 0.07} = 0.78 \approx 0.8\)
}

Thus, the final probabilities become:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```
