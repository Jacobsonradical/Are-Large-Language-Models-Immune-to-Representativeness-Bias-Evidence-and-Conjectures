To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the following values:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field (business administration or agricultural and veterinary science).
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in that field.
4. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \).

First, let's write down Bayes' rule for our purposes:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We approximate \( P(E) \) using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Given that \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) \).

### Business Administration

1. \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration. Let's assume a typical graduate student has an equal chance of being in a variety of fields, and assign a value of 0.1 (for simplicity).

2. \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): The probability that a student in business administration has Adam's personality traits. Given his traits (curiosity about nature, empathy for animals, etc.), this is likely low. Let's estimate it as 0.05.

3. \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \): The probability that a student not in business administration has Adam's personality traits. Since there are fields more related to his traits, let’s assign a value of 0.6.

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.05 \cdot 0.1 + 0.6 \cdot 0.9 = 0.005 + 0.54 = 0.545 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{0.545} \approx 0.009 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Similarly, let's assume this field has a low but slightly higher probability due to his traits, and assign a value of 0.1.

2. \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \): The probability that a student in agricultural and veterinary science has Adam's personality traits. This is very high due to his love for nature and animals. Let's estimate it as 0.7.

3. \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \): The probability that a student not in agricultural and veterinary science has Adam's personality traits. This would be high, as other related fields may also fit. Let’s assign a value of 0.3.

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.7 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9 = 0.07 + 0.27 = 0.34 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.34} \approx 0.206 \]

The approximate posterior probabilities:
