Sure, let's break down the process step by step for each field.

### 1. Business Administration

#### a. Prior Probability \( P(H) \)
\[ P(H)_{\text{business administration}}: \]
Considering the prevalence of business administration as a graduate field of study, let's assume a moderate prior probability. For illustration:
\[ P(H)_{\text{business administration}} = 0.2 \]

#### b. Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)
\( P(E|H)_{\text{business administration}}: \)
The personality sketch of Adam (curiosity about nature and plants, quiet, empathy, love for animals) seems less aligned with a typical business administration profile. Let’s assume a lower likelihood.
\[ P(E|H)_{\text{business administration}} = 0.1 \]

#### c. Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)
\( P(E|\neg H)_{\text{business administration}}: \)
Given that there are many other fields that align better with Adam's traits, it’s likely he is not in business administration. 
\[ P(E|\neg H)_{\text{business administration}} = 0.8 \]

#### d. Posterior Probability Using Bayes' Rule
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Substitute the values:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.8 \cdot 0.8} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.64} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} = \frac{0.02}{0.66} \approx 0.0303 \]

### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

#### a. Prior Probability \( P(H) \)
\[ P(H)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}: \]
Although this field is less common than business administration, Adam's traits strongly align with it, so let’s assume a higher prior probability.
\[ P(H)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} = 0.1 \]

#### b. Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)
\( P(E|H)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}: \)
For this, the personality sketch is very compatible with a student in agricultural and veterinary science.
\[ P(E|H)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} = 0.8 \]

#### c. Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)
\( P(E|\neg H)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}: \)
Given Adam’s specific traits, it is less likely they would align with many other fields.
\[ P(E|\neg H)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} = 0.3 \]

#### d. Posterior Probability Using Bayes' Rule
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Substitute the values:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.27} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \approx 0.2286 \]

### Final Answer:
