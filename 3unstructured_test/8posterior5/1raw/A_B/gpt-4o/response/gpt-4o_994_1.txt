To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in either of these fields using Bayes' theorem, we need to calculate and compare the posteriors \( P(H|E) \).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's denote:
- \( H_1 \): Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( H_2 \): Adam was enrolled in business administration.

We need to calculate the following probabilities for each field:
1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability that Adam fits the personality sketch given he was enrolled in each field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability that Adam fits the personality sketch given he was not enrolled in each field.

For simplicity, we'll assume \( P(E) \) to be normalized out as it is the same for both hypotheses.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **\( P(H_1) \)**: The prior probability assuming that any graduate student has an equal probability of being in any field. Let's assume the availability or interest in agricultural and veterinary science among graduate fields is moderately common, so \( P(H_1) = 0.1 \).
2. **\( P(E|H_1) \)**: Given his interests align well with agricultural and veterinary science (plants, animals, nature), we'll say \( P(E|H_1) = 0.9 \).
3. **\( P(E|\neg H_1) \)**: This would be the average probability of fitting this personality sketch given any other field. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H_1) = 0.01 \) due to the rather specific nature of his interests aligning closely with this field.

\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) \) is common and can be normalized out, thus focusing on the numerator:
\[ P(H_1|E) \propto 0.09 \]

### Business Administration

1. **\( P(H_2) \)**: Assuming it's a relatively common field among graduate students, let's set \( P(H_2) = 0.2 \).
2. **\( P(E|H_2) \)**: The personality sketch doesn't strongly align with typical business administration traits, so let's set \( P(E|H_2) = 0.01 \).
3. **\( P(E|\neg H_2) \)**: This is similar to estimates above, given any other field. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_2) = 0.01 \).

\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.01 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]
Again, focusing on the numerator:
\[ P(H_2|E) \propto 0.002 \]

### Results

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.09,
  "business administration": 0.002
}

From these calculations, Adam is far more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch (warm heart, empathy, love for animals, etc.) than in business administration.
