Sure, let's break down the problem and determine the values for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
    - \( P(H_{\text{agri}}) \): The prior probability. Let's assume the distribution of graduate students enrolled in various fields. For simplicity, assume a somewhat even distribution but possibly favoring fields more related to Adam's interests. Let's say \( P(H_{\text{agri}}) = 0.1 \).
    - \( P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality given that he is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given his appreciation for nature, animals, and plants, this is high. Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) = 0.8 \).
    - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agri}}) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality if he is not enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Let's estimate this at a lower value since the personality sketch strongly aligns with this field. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agri}}) = 0.2 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agri}})}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{agri}})P(H_{\text{agri}}) + P(E| \neg H_{\text{agri}})(1 - P(H_{\text{agri}})) \), 
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) = 0.08 + 0.18 = 0.26 \]

Now, \( P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) \):
\[ P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.26} \approx 0.3077 \]

2. **Business Administration**
    - \( P(H_{\text{business}}) \): Again, assuming an even distribution, estimate at \( P(H_{\text{business}}) = 0.1 \).
    - \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality given that he is in Business Administration. Given the description, this probability is lower. Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) = 0.1 \).
    - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}}) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality if he is not in Business Administration. Let's assume it's higher, as his traits don't strongly align with this field. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}}) = 0.4 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}})}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{business}})P(H_{\text{business}}) + P(E| \neg H_{\text{business}})(1 - P(H_{\text{business}})) \),
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.1) + (0.4 \cdot 0.9) = 0.01 + 0.36 = 0.37 \]

Now, \( P(H_{\text{business}}|E) \):
\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.37} \approx 0.027 \]

Therefore, our values can be expressed as:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.3077",
  "business administration": "0.027"
}
