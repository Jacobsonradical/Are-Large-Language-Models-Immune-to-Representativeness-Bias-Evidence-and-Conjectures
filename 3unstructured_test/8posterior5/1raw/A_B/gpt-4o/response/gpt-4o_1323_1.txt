To apply Bayes' Theorem for computing the probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch, we'll use the relevant probabilities. These probabilities are somewhat subjective and can vary depending on the source of the statistical information used. Here is a rough estimation based on general knowledge:

1. **Likelihood of Enrolling in Each Field (P(H))**
   - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field is relatively niche but highly relevant to Adam's interests. Let's assume a prior probability of 0.05 for this because far fewer students enroll in this field compared to more general fields.
   - **Business Administration**: This field is very popular, so the prior probability is higher, let's say 0.20, as many students pursue an MBA or related graduate programs.

2. **Likelihood of the Personality Sketch Given the Field (P(E|H))**
   - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's characteristics, this field seems highly compatible. Let's assume P(E|H) is 0.80 because his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and corresponding empathy align well with this field.
   - **Business Administration**: While some of Adam's traits could be beneficial in business (like high intelligence and understanding of hard work), they seem less aligned compared to Veterinary Science. Let's assume P(E|H) is 0.20 for Business Administration.

3. **Likelihood of the Personality Sketch Given Not the Field (P(E|\neg H))**
   - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Assuming P(E|\neg H) can be reasonably lower, since not all other fields would align well with Adam's personality, let's assume 0.30.
   - **Business Administration**: As this field is quite general, we could assume P(E|\neg H) is higher, say 0.50, as many fields could passably fit Adam's qualities.

Now, we use Bayes' Rule to compute \(P(H|E)\):

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} 
\]

Where \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

Now let's calculate:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[
P(E) = (0.80 \times 0.05) + (0.30 \times 0.95) = 0.04 + 0.285 = 0.325
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.05}{0.325} = \frac{0.04}{0.325} \approx 0.123
\]

### Business Administration:

\[
P(E) = (0.20 \times 0.20) + (0.50 \times 0.80) = 0.04 + 0.40 = 0.44
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.20 \times 0.20}{0.44} = \frac{0.04}{0.44} \approx 0.091
\]

So, based on the given calculations:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.123,
  "business administration": 0.091
}
