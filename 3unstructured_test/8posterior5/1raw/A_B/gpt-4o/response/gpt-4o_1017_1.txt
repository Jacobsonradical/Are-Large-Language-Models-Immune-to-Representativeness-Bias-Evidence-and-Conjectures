To compute \( P(H|E) \), the probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field given the personality sketch, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To simplify, we'll estimate the probabilities as follows:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in that specific field.

Since the probability P(E) remains the same across different fields and we are comparing relative probabilities, we can simplify our task by focusing on \(P(E|H) \cdot P(H)\).

### Business Administration

- **P(H)**: Business Administration is a common graduate field, let's estimate it as 0.2.
- **P(E|H)**: Given that Adam has a strong empathy, warm heart, and intelligence, it is possible, but less likely compared to agricultural and veterinary sciences. Let's estimate it as 0.1.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of having the same personality traits in a non-business administration field might be comparatively slightly higher, given a wide variety of other fields. Let's estimate it as 0.3.
- **P(E|H) \cdot P(H)**: 0.1 * 0.2 = 0.02

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)**: Agricultural and Veterinary Science is less common than Business Administration but directly aligns with Adam's love for nature, animals, and appreciation for hard work. Let's estimate it as 0.05.
- **P(E|H)**: Given his curiosity about nature and plants, along with his empathy and love for animals, this field strongly aligns with Adam's personality sketch. Let's estimate it as 0.7.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of having the same personality traits in a non-agricultural and veterinary science field is lower due to the specificity of Adam's interests. Let's estimate it as 0.2.
- **P(E|H) \cdot P(H)**: 0.7 * 0.05 = 0.035

Now we can compare these products to get a relative sense of the probabilities \(P(H|E)\) .

### Comparison

Relative to the initial product estimates:

- **Business Administration**: 0.02
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: 0.035

Thus, the relative likelihood of Adam being in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is higher based on the given personality sketch.
