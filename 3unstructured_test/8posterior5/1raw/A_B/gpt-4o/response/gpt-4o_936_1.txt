To solve this, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For the sake of simplicity, let's assume we have prior probabilities \(P(H)\), conditional probabilities \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E|\neg H)\). We make educated guesses based on the given personality sketch of Adam.

### Business Administration
**P(H):**
Business Administration is a common field of study, so let's assume a moderate prior probability. We'll set \(P(H)\) to 0.2.

**P(E|H):**
Adam's personality and interests (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy) don't strongly align with typical traits emphasizing a business administration student. Thus, we'll assume a lower conditional probability. We'll set \(P(E|H)\) to 0.1.

**P(E|\neg H):**
Given Adam's traits, we might expect a higher probability for fields more aligned with his interests, so \(P(E| \neg H)\) should be substantial. We'll set \(P(E| \neg H)\) to 0.7.

Using this data,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.02}{P(E)} \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
**P(H):**
Given Adam's interests and traits, this field is a good fit. Thus, we'll assign a higher prior probability. We'll set \(P(H)\) to 0.4.

**P(E|H):**
Adam's personality aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science, so we'll set \(P(E|H)\) to a high value. We'll set it to 0.8.

**P(E|\neg H):**
If Adam isn't in agricultural/veterinary science, we revisit the general population probability, again assuming fields such as biology, environmental science, etc. We'll assume \(P(E| \neg H)\) to be 0.3.

Using this data,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.4}{P(E)} = \frac{0.32}{P(E)} \]

To normalize and compute actual probabilities, we need to consider \(P(E)\), but since the values are relative, we can infer the likelihood directly:

Given:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]

For business administration:
\[ P(E)_{\text{business}} = 0.1 \times 0.2 + 0.7 \times 0.8 = 0.02 + 0.56 = 0.58 \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(E)_{\text{agri}} = 0.8 \times 0.4 + 0.3 \times 0.6 = 0.32 + 0.18 = 0.5 \]

Thus, relative probabilities:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{business}} = \frac{0.02}{0.58} \approx 0.034 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agri}} = \frac{0.32}{0.5} = 0.64 \]

So, the relative probabilities are:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.034,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.64
}
```
