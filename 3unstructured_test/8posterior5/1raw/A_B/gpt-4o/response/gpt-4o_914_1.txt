To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis: 

1. Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science (\(H_1\)).
2. Adam was enrolled in business administration (\(H_2\)).

Given the personality sketch \(E\), we need to estimate the probabilities \(P(H_1)\), \(P(E|H_1)\), \(P(E|\neg H_1)\), \(P(H_2)\), \(P(E|H_2)\), and \(P(E|\neg H_2)\).

### Initial Probabilities (\( P(H) \))

Without specific enrollment data, we'll assume that the prior probability \( P(H) \) for each field is equal, but adjusted for the fields considered. 

Let's assume there are 10 major fields of study, giving each an initial probability of \(\frac{1}{10} = 0.1\). But since the question's total probability doesn't need to add up to 1, we can consider these raw scores.

### Likelihoods (\( P(E|H) \))

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's personality traits like a genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, it's highly likely he's enrolled in this field.

\[ P(E|H_{\text{ag/science}}) \approx 0.9 \]

- **Business Administration**: Adam's personality traits like a love for nature and animals, strong empathy, and interest in solving puzzles don't strongly align with business administration. 

\[ P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \approx 0.2 \]

### Complementary Likelihoods (\( P(E|\neg H) \))

- **Not Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: When Adam is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, the likelihood of the traits still being present is lower compared to when he is.

\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{ag/science}}) \approx 0.3 \]

- **Not Business Administration**: When Adam is not enrolled in business administration, traits like empathy, and love for animals and nature are still quite common among other fields. 

\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}}) \approx 0.7 \]

### Applying Bayesâ€™ Rule:

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[ P(H_{\text{ag/science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{ag/science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ag/science}})}{P(E)} \]

For Business Administration:

\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}})}{P(E)} \]

### Total Probability of Evidence \(P(E)\):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{ag/science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ag/science}}) + P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{ag/science}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{ag/science}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{business}}) \]

Given:

\[ P(H_{\text{ag/science}}) \approx 0.1 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business}}) \approx 0.1 \]

Since \(P(H_{\text{ag/science}}) + P(\neg H_{\text{ag/science}}) = 1\), we can simplify:

\[ P(\neg H_{\text{ag/science}}) = 0.9 \]

And similarly:

\[ P(\neg H_{\text{business}}) = 0.9 \]

Substituting all:

\[ P(E) = 0.9 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9 + 0.7 \cdot 0.9 \]

\[ P(E) = 0.09 + 0.02 + 0.27 + 0.63 = 1.01 \]

### Bayes Rule Computation:

\[ P(H_{\text{ag/science}}|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{1.01} \approx 0.089 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{1.01} \approx 0.019 \]

### Final Results:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.089,
  "business administration": 0.019
}
```

This estimation process shows that Adam is more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science based on his traits and characteristics.
