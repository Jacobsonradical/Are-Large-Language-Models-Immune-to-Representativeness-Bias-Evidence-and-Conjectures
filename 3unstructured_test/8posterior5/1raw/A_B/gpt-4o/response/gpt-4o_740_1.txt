To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Rule, we need to evaluate the following components:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis.

Bayes' Rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields and acts as a normalizing constant, we can compare the relative values of \( P(H|E) \) by focusing on the numerator \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

### Business administration

- \( P(H) \): Moderately probable as business administration is a common field, but not particularly aligned with Adam's stated interests. Let's estimate \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Adam's personality sketch does not strongly align with traits typically needed in business administration, such as an interest in economics, management, or entrepreneurship. So, let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): There are many other fields Adam might belong to that fit his profile, so let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.9 \).

### Agricultural and veterinary science

- \( P(H) \): Less common than business administration but more aligned with Adam's interests. Let's estimate \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Adam's personality sketch fits well with someone in agricultural and veterinary science, given his curiosity about nature and love of animals. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): A lower likelihood since not many other fields align as well with Adam's profile. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

Now, calculate relative \( P(H|E) \) values for both fields (neglecting \( P(E) \) since itâ€™s constant):

\[
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H)
\]

For business administration:
\[
P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02
\]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[
P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08
\]

### Normalizing

We can normalize these values to get probabilities that sum to 1 within the context of these two options:

\[
\text{Total} = 0.02 + 0.08 = 0.1
\]

\[
P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.1} = 0.2
\]

\[
P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.1} = 0.8
\]

We now present the answers in the required format:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

Note that these values are relative probabilities, and other fields could change the exact probabilities if included.
