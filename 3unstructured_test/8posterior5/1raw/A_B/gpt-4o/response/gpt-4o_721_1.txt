To determine the probabilities, we'll start by estimating the prior probabilities P(H) for each hypothesis based on general trends, then estimate the conditional probabilities P(E|H) and P(E|¬H) based on the personality sketch of Adam. Finally, we'll use Bayes' rule to determine P(H|E).

Given that Adam has a strong interest in nature, plants, puzzles, animals, and abstract concepts, it seems much more aligned with agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. 

1. **P(H): Initial Probabilities**
   - P(H) for business administration: Let's assume around 0.2, considering it is a common field.
   - P(H) for agricultural and veterinary science: Let's assume around 0.1, reflecting that it's a less common field compared to business administration.

2. **P(E|H): Likelihood of E given H**
   - P(E|H) for business administration: Given Adam's traits, it seems less likely. Let's set it at 0.05.
   - P(E|H) for agricultural and veterinary science: This seems very likely for Adam. Let's set it at 0.8.

3. **P(E|¬H): Likelihood of E given not H**
   In each case, we need to consider the likelihood of Adam having these characteristics if he's not in the respective field.
   - P(E|¬H) for business administration: Given Adam's characteristics align poorly with business administration, let's assume this likelihood to be about 0.1.
   - P(E|¬H) for agricultural and veterinary science: Given the alignment with this field, but since he might have chosen another science field, let's set it at 0.4.

Now, using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where,
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

### Business Administration
1. **Calculate P(E) for business administration:**
\[ P(E) = (0.05 \cdot 0.2) + (0.1 \cdot 0.8) = 0.01 + 0.08 = 0.09 \]

2. **Calculate P(H|E) for business administration:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.2}{0.09} \approx 0.111 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **Calculate P(E) for agricultural and veterinary science:**
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.4 \cdot 0.9) = 0.08 + 0.36 = 0.44 \]

2. **Calculate P(H|E) for agricultural and veterinary science:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.44} \approx 0.182 \]

Thus, using the provided estimates and calculations, we get:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.111,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.182
}
