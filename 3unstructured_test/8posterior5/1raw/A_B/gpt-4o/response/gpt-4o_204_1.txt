To determine the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in a particular graduate field based on the provided personality sketch, we'll apply Bayes' rule. Here's a structured approach:

1. **P(H)**: the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the specific field.
2. **P(E|H)**: the probability of observing the evidence (personality sketch) given that Adam is enrolled in the specific field.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: the probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is not enrolled in the specific field.
4. Apply Bayes' rule to get P(H|E): the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in the specific field given the evidence.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H):** Let's assume the baseline probability of a graduate student being enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is relatively low compared to other fields (e.g., 0.05).

- **P(E|H):** Given Adam's personality traits — strong curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work — it's very likely that these traits align closely with someone enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science (e.g., 0.8).

- **P(E|¬H):** For someone not enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, these traits would not be as strongly related but still possible in other fields that involve nature, animals, or dedication (e.g., 0.2).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|¬H) \times P(¬H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.8 \times 0.05 + 0.2 \times 0.95} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.19} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.174 \]

### Business Administration

- **P(H):** Let's assume the baseline probability of a graduate student being enrolled in Business Administration is higher compared to Agricultural and Veterinary Science (e.g., 0.2).

- **P(E|H):** Adam's personality traits seem less aligned with someone pursuing Business Administration, which generally focuses more on economics, management, and finance, rather than nature or animals (e.g., 0.1).

- **P(E|¬H):** For someone not enrolled in Business Administration, these traits might be more common across other fields (e.g., 0.2).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|¬H) \times P(¬H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.1 \times 0.2 + 0.2 \times 0.8} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.16} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.18} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.111 \]

Here are the final estimates of P(H|E) for each field:
