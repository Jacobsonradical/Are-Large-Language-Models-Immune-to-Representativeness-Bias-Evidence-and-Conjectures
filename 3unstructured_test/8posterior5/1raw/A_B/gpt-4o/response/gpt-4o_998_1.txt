To calculate the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being in different fields based on his personality sketch \( E \), we will use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's define:

1. \( P(H) \) as the prior probability that Adam is in a particular field.
2. \( P(E|H) \) as the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is in a particular field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) as the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not in a particular field.
4. \( P(E) \) as the overall probability of observing the personality sketch.

For this exercise, we will assume values for the prior probabilities and the likelihoods based on general knowledge about the fields and the personality sketch provided. We do not have exact numbers, so we will use estimates.

Assumptions and estimates:
- Prior probabilities for the fields are unknown, but for simplicity, we can assume that \( P(H) \) is roughly the same across fields of graduate study.
- The personality sketch fits particularly well with agricultural and veterinary science due to Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy. Therefore, \( P(E|H_{agricultural}) \) can be assumed to be higher than \( P(E|H_{business}) \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) would be calculated based on the field distribution and typical characteristics of people in those fields.

Here's a sample calculation with assumed values:

**Business Administration**:
- \( P(H_{business}) \approx 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H_{business}) \approx 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{business}) \approx 0.05 \)

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
- \( P(H_{agricultural}) \approx 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H_{agricultural}) \approx 0.7 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{agricultural}) \approx 0.05 \)

First, calculate \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E \cap H_{business}) + P(E \cap \neg H_{business}) \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{business}) P(H_{business}) + P(E|\neg H_{business}) P(\neg H_{business}) \]
\[ P(E) \approx (0.1 \times 0.1) + (0.05 \times 0.9) \approx 0.01 + 0.045 = 0.055 \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:

\[ P(E) = P(E \cap H_{agricultural}) + P(E \cap \neg H_{agricultural}) \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{agricultural}) P(H_{agricultural}) + P(E|\neg H_{agricultural}) P(\neg H_{agricultural}) \]
\[ P(E) \approx (0.7 \times 0.1) + (0.05 \times 0.9) \approx 0.07 + 0.045 = 0.115 \]


Now use Bayes' Rule to calculate \( P(H|E) \):

**Business Administration**:
\[ P(H_{business}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{business}) P(H_{business})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{business}|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \times 0.1}{0.055} \approx 0.018 \]

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H_{agricultural}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{agricultural}) P(H_{agricultural})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{agricultural}|E) \approx \frac{0.7 \times 0.1}{0.115} \approx 0.609 \]

So the final probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.018,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.609
}
```
