To judge the probabilities and compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the following:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch given enrollment in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch given enrollment in any field except the specified one.
4. \( P(E) \): The total probability of the personality sketch, which can be computed using the law of total probability.

However, for simplicity, we assume \( P(E|\neg H) \) here reflects the likelihood across a general spectrum of fields not specified.

Now let's estimate these probabilities for both fields.

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - We assume that business administration is one of many possible graduate fields. Let's estimate \( P(H) \approx 0.10 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Considering Adam's personality sketch (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, etc.), it seems less likely to fit the profile of a typical business administration student. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.01 \).

3. **Probability \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - This is the probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in business administration. Given Adam's personality, many other fields might be a better fit. Let's assume this could be relatively higher, say \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.20 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Assuming agricultural and veterinary science is also one of many possible fields of study. Let's estimate \( P(H) \approx 0.05 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Adam's personality sketch strongly fits with agricultural and veterinary science. His love for animals, nature, and empathy supports this. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.60 \).

3. **Probability \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Still assuming the higher general probability due to multiple fitting fields, letâ€™s use \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.20 \).

### Using Bayes' Rule

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)} \]

#### For Business Administration

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01 \times 0.10}{0.01 \times 0.10 + 0.20 \times 0.90} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.001}{0.001 + 0.18} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.001}{0.181} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0055 \]

#### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.60 \times 0.05}{0.60 \times 0.05 + 0.20 \times 0.95} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.19} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.22} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.136 \]
