To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field, let's break it down using some reasonable assumptions based on Adam's personality sketch \( E \) and the general likelihood of enrollment in each field.

### Field: Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that any given graduate student is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Let's assume this value is moderately low in the general context of graduate studies overall, say \( 0.1 \).
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy, this value should be quite high. Let's assume \( 0.7 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Considering the match between his traits and Agricultural and Veterinary Science, this probability should be lower. Let's assume \( 0.2 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \)
\[ P(E) = 0.7 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9 = 0.07 + 0.18 = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.25} = \frac{0.07}{0.25} = 0.28 \]

### Field: Business Administration
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that any given graduate student is in Business Administration. Business Administration is quite a common field, so let's assume this value is higher, say \( 0.2 \).
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in Business Administration. Based on his traits, this value should be lower, given the mismatch. Let's assume \( 0.1 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in Business Administration. Since his traits significantly differ from the typical traits associated with business administration, let's assume this value to be moderate. Assume \( 0.21 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.21 \cdot 0.8 = 0.02 + 0.168 = 0.188 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.188} = \frac{0.02}{0.188} \approx 0.106 \]

Hence, the values are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.28,
  "business administration": 0.106
}
```
