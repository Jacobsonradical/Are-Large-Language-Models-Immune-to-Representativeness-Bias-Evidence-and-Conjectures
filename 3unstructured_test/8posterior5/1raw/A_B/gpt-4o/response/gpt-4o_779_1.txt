To compute \( P(H|E) \), we need to use Bayes' Rule, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We are given:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the evidence given the hypothesis is false.
- \( P(E) \): The total probability of the evidence, which is a normalizing constant derived from \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(H) \).

Since we don't have all the numbers explicitly, let's make reasonable estimates based on the given personality sketch and the fields.

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- **P(H)**: The prior probability \( P(H_{AVS}) \). Considering that agricultural and veterinary science isn't the most common graduate field but matches his interests reasonably well, let's assume \( P(H_{AVS}) = 0.1 \).
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of the evidence given the hypothesis. Adam's interests and personality align very well with agricultural and veterinary science, so \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \approx 0.9 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of the evidence given he is not in this field. This will be lower because not all fields nurture the same alignment with his personality. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) = 0.2 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ 
P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)} 
\]

\[ 
P(E) = P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) + P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \cdot P(\neg H_{AVS}) 
\]

Let's calculate \( P(E) \):

\[ 
P(E) = 0.9 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9 = 0.09 + 0.18 = 0.27 
\]

Now calculate \( P(H_{AVS}|E) \):

\[ 
P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{0.27} \approx 0.333 
\]

### For Business Administration:
- **P(H)**: The prior probability \( P(H_{BA}) \). Business administration is a common graduate field, but it does not align as well with Adam's interests and personality. Let's assume \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.05 \).
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of the evidence given the hypothesis. Adam's personality seems less aligned with business administration, so \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.3 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of the evidence given he is not in this field. Again, it would be lower but more common. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.25 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ 
P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} 
\]

Using the same \( P(E) \) calculation:

\[ 
P(E) = 0.3 \cdot 0.05 + 0.25 \cdot 0.95 = 0.015 + 0.2375 = 0.2525 
\]

Now calculate \( P(H_{BA}|E) \):

\[ 
P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.05}{0.2525} \approx 0.059 
\]

### Final Result:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.333,
  "business administration": 0.059
}
```
These values represent our best estimates of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field given the provided personality sketch and using reasonable assumptions.
