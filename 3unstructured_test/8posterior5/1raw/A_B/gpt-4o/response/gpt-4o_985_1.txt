Let's first establish values for \( P(H) \) (the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field), \( P(E|H) \) (the probability of Adam's personality traits given he was enrolled in each field), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) (the probability of Adam's personality traits given he was not enrolled in each field). Note that these values are subjective estimates based on the provided personality sketch.

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Let's assume a general prior value, such as 0.1 (10% of graduate students might be in business administration).
2. **P(E|H)**: This is the likelihood of Adam having his described traits if he were enrolled in business administration. Given Adam's deep interest in nature, animals, and puzzles, this seems less likely. Let's estimate this at 0.05.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: This is the likelihood of Adam having his traits if he were not enrolled in business administration. Since this includes a wider range of fields, let’s assume it to be reasonably high, say 0.3.

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assuming \( P(E) \) is constant for normalization (since we're comparing relative probabilities):

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.05 \cdot 0.1 = 0.005 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's also assume a general prior value, such as 0.1.
2. **P(E|H)**: This is the likelihood of Adam having his traits if he were enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Considering his interests align well with this field, let's estimate this at 0.8.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: This remains the likelihood of Adam having his traits if he were not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Assuming a variety of other fields, let’s assume this to be 0.3 as well.

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]

Combining these values:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.005,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08
}
```

These values indicate that, based on Adam's personality sketch, it is significantly more likely that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration.
