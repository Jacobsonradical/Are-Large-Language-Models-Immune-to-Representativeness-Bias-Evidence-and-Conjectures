First, we need to apply Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \). Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:

- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given the personality sketch E.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in the specific field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the specific field.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of the personality sketch E.

We do not have exact values, but we can make reasonable assumptions to gauge relative probabilities. 

Let's denote:
- \( P(H_{\text{business}}) \) as the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \) as the probability of Adam's personality sketch given he was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(H_{\text{agricultural}}) \) as the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural}}) \) as the probability of Adam's personality sketch given he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

### Business Administration

- \( P(H_{\text{business}}) \):
  Given the variety of graduate fields, we can assume that the prior probability of any specific field might be low but not extremely so.
  Let's assume \( P(H_{\text{business}}) = 0.1 \).

- \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \):
  Given Adam's personality sketch (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy), it doesn't strongly align with common traits associated with business administration.
  Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) = 0.05 \).

- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}}) \):
  The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in business administration is higher, as it might suit a variety of other fields better.
  Let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}}) = 0.15 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- \( P(H_{\text{agricultural}}) \):
  This field seems to align more closely with Adam's personality sketch. Let’s assume a higher prior probability here.
  Let's assume \( P(H_{\text{agricultural}}) = 0.2 \).

- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural}}) \):
  Adam’s traits strongly support enrollment in agricultural and veterinary science.
  Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural}}) = 0.8 \).

- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural}}) \):
  The probability of Adam’s personality sketch given he is not in agricultural and veterinary science is lower.
  Let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural}}) = 0.1 \).

### Calculate P(H|E)

Using Bayes' Rule:

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{business}}) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.05 \times 0.1 + 0.15 \times 0.9 = 0.005 + 0.135 = 0.14 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.1}{0.14} \approx 0.0357 \]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agricultural}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H_{\text{agricultural}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{agricultural}}) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.8 \times 0.2 + 0.1 \times 0.8 = 0.16 + 0.08 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.2}{0.24} \approx 0.6667 \]

Therefore, our final results are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0357,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6667
}
```
