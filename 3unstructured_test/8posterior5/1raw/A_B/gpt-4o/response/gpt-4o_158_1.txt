To compute the likelihoods \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in business administration and agricultural and veterinary science, we will use Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's denote the hypotheses:
- \( H_{BA} \): Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( H_{AVS} \): Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

For each hypothesis, we'll assess:
- \( P(H_{BA}) \) and \( P(H_{AVS}) \): Prior probabilities of Adam being in these fields.
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \) and \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \): Likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given each field.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \) and \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \): Likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given he is not in the respective field.
- \( P(E) \): Marginal probability of observing Adam's traits.

### Prior Probabilities (\( P(H) \))
Given that we are only provided with two possible fields and there being other graduate fields, we assume a reasonable prior. Typically, business administration programs are more common than agricultural and veterinary science programs, but we need to focus on Adam's personality sketch to adjust these priors.

Since Adam has a deep love for nature, animals, and an understanding of hard work, it's more likely that he is in agricultural and veterinary science than business administration.

Let's assume the following priors:
- \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(H_{AVS}) = 0.3 \)

### Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \))
Adam's traits are more consistent with characteristics needed in agricultural and veterinary science rather than business administration.

- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \):
  - Business administration students can have empathy and high intelligence, but these traits are less directly related to the field compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
  - Let's assign \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.1 \).

- \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \):
  - Agricultural and veterinary science aligns well with Adam's traits (love for nature, animals, empathy, appreciation for hard work).
  - Let's assign \( P(E|H_{AVS}) = 0.8 \).

### Likelihood of Personality Sketch Given Not in the Field (\( P(E|\neg H) \))
For background probability \( P(E|\neg H) \):
- \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \): Probability of exhibiting personality traits consistent with Adam if not in business administration.
  - Given that Adamâ€™s traits more naturally align with fields like agricultural science, \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.7 \).

- \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \): Probability of exhibiting personality traits consistent with Adam if not in agricultural and veterinary science.
  - This would be lower than \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \), representing diversity of other fields.
  - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) = 0.4 \).

### Applying Bayes' Rule
Now we compute the posterior probabilities:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is a constant normalized over all hypotheses. For simplicity, we compare the products directly (since \( P(E) \) would cancel out across probabilities):

Normalizing across two fields for simplicity:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})} \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})} \]

Given values:
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|H_{AVS}) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(H_{AVS}) = 0.3 \)

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.8 \cdot 0.3} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.24} = \frac{0.02}{0.26} \approx 0.077 \]

\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.3}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.8 \cdot 0.3} = \frac{0.24}{0.02 + 0.24} = \frac{0.24}{0.26} \approx 0.923 \]

Summarizing:

{
  "business administration": 0.077,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.923
