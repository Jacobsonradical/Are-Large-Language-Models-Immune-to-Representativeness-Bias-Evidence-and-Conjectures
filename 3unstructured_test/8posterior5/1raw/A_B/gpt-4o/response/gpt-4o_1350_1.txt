To compute the probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for the fields "business administration" and "agricultural and veterinary science", we need to use Bayes' rule. Let’s break down the key components for each field:

1. \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in this field.
2. \(P(E|H)\): The probability that Adam’s personality sketch \(E\) is characteristic of someone in this field.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability that Adam’s personality sketch \(E\) is characteristic of someone not in this field.

We use Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we are only comparing two fields and do not have exact numerical prior probabilities, I will assign plausible estimates based on context and reasoning. Let’s assume:

1. The prior probability \(P(H)\) is equal for simplicity, considering these two fields only.
2. We estimate \(P(E|H)\) based on how well the personality traits fit the field characteristics.
3. For \(P(E|\neg H)\), we consider how well the personality traits fit any other unspecified fields.

**Business Administration:**

- \(P(H)\): Let's assume this to be 0.5 for our purposes.
- \(P(E|H)\): Lower, as Adam's personality traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals) don't particularly align with business administration. Estimate 0.2.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): Could be a bit higher, as it covers all other fields. Estimate 0.3.

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} = \frac{0.2 \times 0.5}{P(E)} \]

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

- \(P(H)\): Similarly, assume this to be 0.5.
- \(P(E|H)\): Much higher, as Adam’s personality traits fit well with this field. Estimate 0.8.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): Could be lower, as fewer other fields would align so well. Estimate 0.3.

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{P(E)} \]

Although we don’t know \(P(E)\) exactly, we can still assess the relative probabilities. Given these insights:

\[ \boxed{
  \text{
    {
      "business administration": \(\frac{0.2 \times 0.5}{0.2 \times 0.5 + 0.8 \times 0.5}\),
      "agricultural and veterinary science": \(\frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.2 \times 0.5 + 0.8 \times 0.5}\)
    }
  }
} \]

Solving these:

- Business Administration: \(\frac{0.1}{0.1 + 0.4} = \frac{0.1}{0.5} = 0.2\)
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \(\frac{0.4}{0.1 + 0.4} = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8\)

Therefore, the probabilities are:

\[ \boxed{
  \{
    "business administration": 0.2,
    "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
  \}
} \]
