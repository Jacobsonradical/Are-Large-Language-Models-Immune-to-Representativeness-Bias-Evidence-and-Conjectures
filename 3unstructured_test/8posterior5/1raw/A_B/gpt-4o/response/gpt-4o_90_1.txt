Let's break down the problem and compute the probabilities.

Firstly, we need to assess the following probabilities for each field:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in each field.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in each field.

Then, we'll use Bayes' Rule to compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

**Note:** Instead of calculating \(P(E)\), we can use a simplified version of Bayes' Rule as we only need to compare relative probabilities:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

### For business administration:
1. **P(H) (business administration)**: Business administration is a common graduate field, so let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \) (20%).
2. **P(E|H) (business administration)**: The personality traits described (e.g., curiosity about nature, love for animals) are less common among business administration students, but not impossible. Let's assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \) (10%).
3. **P(E|¬H) (business administration)**: Given the overall characteristics of graduate students, \( P(E|¬H) \) could be higher since these traits are more aligned with other fields such as agricultural sciences. Let's assume \( P(E|¬H) \approx 0.3 \) (30%).

\[ P(H|E)_{business administration} \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

### For agricultural and veterinary science:
1. **P(H) (agricultural and veterinary science)**: Given the description, this field is more likely, but still not the only possibility. Let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \) (10%).
2. **P(E|H) (agricultural and veterinary science)**: The personality traits fit well with agricultural and veterinary science students. Let's assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.7 \) (70%).
3. **P(E|¬H) (agricultural and veterinary science)**: The probability of finding such traits in students not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary sciences could be lower. Let's assume \( P(E|¬H) \approx 0.2 \) (20%).

\[ P(H|E)_{agricultural and veterinary science} \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.7 \cdot 0.1 = 0.07 \]

### Normalizing the Probabilities:
To get the final probabilities, we should normalize them:

Total proportional probability = \( 0.02 + 0.07 = 0.09 \).

\[
P(H|E)_{business administration} = \frac{0.02}{0.09} \approx 0.22
\]
\[
P(H|E)_{agricultural and veterinary science} = \frac{0.07}{0.09} \approx 0.78
\]

Therefore, the final probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.22,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.78
}
```
