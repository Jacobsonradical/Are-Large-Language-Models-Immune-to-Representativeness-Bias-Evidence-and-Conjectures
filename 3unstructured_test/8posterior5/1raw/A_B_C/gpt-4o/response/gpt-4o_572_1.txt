To apply Bayes' theorem, let's use the following notation:
- \( H \): Adam was enrolled in a specified field (like business administration, agricultural and veterinary science, or computer science).
- \( E \): Personality sketch of Adam.
- \( \neg H \): Adam was not enrolled in the specified field.

Bayes' theorem is: 

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) if Adam was in the field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the personality sketch: 
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For simplicity, let's estimate the probabilities qualitatively.

### For Business Administration:
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):** Let's consider that graduate students are distributed among various fields, giving Business Administration a moderate prior probability of around 0.2.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** The likelihood of Adam’s personality sketch fitting Business Administration may be low, as his described traits do not strongly align with typical business administration characteristics like interest in economics, management, or finance. Let's assign a \( P(E|H) \) of 0.1.
3. **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):** The likelihood of observing Adam’s personality sketch if he was not in Business Administration, considering he could be in any other field, would be relatively higher because his traits are more aligned with scientific or empathetic fields. Let's estimate this as 0.3.

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):** A reasonable prior given the numerous fields might be 0.15.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** Adam’s personality aligns well with Agricultural and Veterinary Science due to his interest in nature, animals, and empathy. Let's assign \( P(E|H) \) a higher value, say 0.6.
3. **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):** If Adam was not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, he could be in another field, so this would also be relatively high given his alignment with science. Let’s give this \( P(E|\neg H) \) a value of 0.4.

### For Computer Science:
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):** Given the popularity of the field, we can assign a moderate prior of 0.2.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** While he enjoys puzzles and has high intelligence, other traits such as love for nature and animals do not strongly align. So, the \( P(E|H) \) is moderate at around 0.3.
3. **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):** Adam could easily be in another field given his traits, so \( P(E|\neg H) \) could be moderately high, say 0.35.

Now, we compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' theorem.

### Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) \approx (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) = 0.02 + 0.24 = 0.26 \]
\[ \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.26} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.26} \approx 0.077 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) \approx (0.6 \cdot 0.15) + (0.4 \cdot 0.85) = 0.09 + 0.34 = 0.43 \]
\[ \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.15}{0.43} \approx \frac{0.09}{0.43} \approx 0.209 \]

### Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) \approx (0.3 \cdot 0.2) + (0.35 \cdot 0.8) = 0.06 + 0.28 = 0.34 \]
\[ \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.34} \approx \frac{0.06}{0.34} \approx 0.176 \]

Hence, the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) would be:

  "business administration": 0.077,
