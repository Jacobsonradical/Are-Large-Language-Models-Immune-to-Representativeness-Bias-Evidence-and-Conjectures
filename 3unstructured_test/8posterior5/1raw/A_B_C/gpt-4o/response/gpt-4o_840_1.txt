Sure, let's go through the fields and evaluate the probabilities accordingly. 

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: Probability Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science without any additional information. Given this is a less common field compared to something like Computer Science, I'll estimate this probability to be lower.
- **P(E|H)**: Given that Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and a deep love for animals, the personality sketch strongly supports this field. Therefore, this would be high.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that Adam's personality sketch would match someone not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given the specificity of his interests, this would be lower.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given these estimates, I would suggest the following configuration:
\[ P(H) = 0.10 \]
\[ P(E|H) = 0.90 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.30 \]

### Computer Science
- **P(H)**: Probability Adam was enrolled in Computer Science. This field is more common, especially among high intelligence individuals and those who solve puzzles.
- **P(E|H)**: Given his good understanding of abstract concepts and enjoyment of solving puzzles, there is some support, but not as strong as for Agricultural Sciences.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: There are many ways someone in Computer Science could have different interests, so this would be lower.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given these estimates, I would suggest the following configuration:
\[ P(H) = 0.25 \]
\[ P(E|H) = 0.40 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.50 \]

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: Probability Adam was enrolled in Business Administration. Given his interests, this is less likely.
- **P(E|H)**: The personality sketch does not strongly support Business Administration, so this would be lower.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Most people in Business might not have the same profile, so this would be higher.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given these estimates, I would suggest the following configuration:
\[ P(H) = 0.15 \]
\[ P(E|H) = 0.30 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.60 \]

Given these analyses, we get:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.25,
  "computer science": 0.10,
  "business administration": 0.05
}
```

These values are calculated as estimates based on the Bayesian framework presented. In a real scenario, the exact priors (P(H)) and conditional probabilities (P(E|H) and P(E|\neg H)) would need more precise data.
