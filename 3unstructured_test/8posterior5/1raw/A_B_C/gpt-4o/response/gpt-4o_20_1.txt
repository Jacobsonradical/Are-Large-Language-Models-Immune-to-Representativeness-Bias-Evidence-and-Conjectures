To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need some assumptions and estimates for the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood of the evidence under the complement hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H) \). Given the personality sketch of Adam and the fields listed, we can make some educated guesses:

1. **Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \):**
   - It's reasonable to assume that the prior probabilities of being enrolled in any of these fields are roughly balanced, given the variety of graduate programs available.
   - However, fields like business administration might have a higher prior compared to specialized fields like agricultural and veterinary science.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   - Based on the personality sketch, Adam's traits seem to match closely with agricultural and veterinary science due to his love for nature, plants, and animals. This suggests a higher likelihood for this field.
   - Computer science might be a moderate match, given that Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has strong intelligence, but it doesn't directly align with his empathy and love for nature.
   - Business administration seems like the least likely, given that Adam's personality traits do not particularly align with business-centric traits.

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   - This represents the likelihood of the evidence if Adam were not in the specific field. Given that the total should not add up to one, we will approximate based on the other possible fields.
   - The value is somewhat dependent on the overlap between Adam's traits and typical traits of students in various fields.

Let's assign tentative values and compute using Bayes' Rule \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \):

```json
{
  "computer science": {
    "P(H)": 0.2,
    "P(E|H)": 0.5,
    "P(E|¬H)": 0.2
  },
  "agricultural and veterinary science": {
    "P(H)": 0.1,
    "P(E|H)": 0.9,
    "P(E|¬H)": 0.3
  },
  "business administration": {
    "P(H)": 0.3,
    "P(E|H)": 0.1,
    "P(E|¬H)": 0.4
  }
}
```

Using these values:

1. **Computer Science:**
   \[
   P(H|E)_{cs} = \frac{P(E|H_{cs})P(H_{cs})}{P(E|H_{cs})P(H_{cs}) + P(E|\neg H_{cs})(1-P(H_{cs}))}
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{0.5 \times 0.2}{0.5 \times 0.2 + 0.2 \times 0.8} \approx \frac{0.1}{0.1 + 0.16} = \frac{0.1}{0.26} \approx 0.3846
   \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   \[
   P(H|E)_{avs} = \frac{P(E|H_{avs})P(H_{avs})}{P(E|H_{avs})P(H_{avs}) + P(E|\neg H_{avs})(1-P(H_{avs}))}
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{0.9 \times 0.1}{0.9 \times 0.1 + 0.3 \times 0.9} \approx \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.27} = \frac{0.09}{0.36} = 0.25
   \]

3. **Business Administration:**
   \[
   P(H|E)_{ba} = \frac{P(E|H_{ba})P(H_{ba})}{P(E|H_{ba})P(H_{ba}) + P(E|\neg H_{ba})(1-P(H_{ba}))}
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{0.1 \times 0.3}{0.1 \times 0.3 + 0.4 \times 0.7} \approx \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.28} = \frac{0.03}{0.31} \approx 0.0968
   \]

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3846,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.25,
  "business administration": 0.0968
}
