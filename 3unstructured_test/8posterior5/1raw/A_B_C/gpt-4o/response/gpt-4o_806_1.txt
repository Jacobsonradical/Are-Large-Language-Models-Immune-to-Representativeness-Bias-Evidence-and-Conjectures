Let's begin by breaking down the individual probabilities needed for Bayes' theorem, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For each field, we need to estimate the relevant probabilities:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam would have the given personality sketch if he were enrolled in that field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that Adam would have the given personality sketch if he were not enrolled in that field.
4. **P(E)**: The overall probability of the personality sketch, which can be computed from the above probabilities.

We will use reasonable assumptions to estimate these probabilities based on typical graduate student distributions in the U.S. and how well they align with the provided personality sketch:

### Computer Science

1. **P(H) for computer science**: 
   Assume roughly 20% of graduate students might be in this field.
   \( P(H) \approx 0.20 \)

2. **P(E|H)**: 
   Adam's traits don't perfectly align with the stereotypical computer science student profile, but we can't rule it out entirely. Let's say it's moderately likely.
   \( P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \)

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: 
   For fields other than computer science, this personality profile could also occur. Let's assume that 80% of the time, he's not in computer science.
   \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.8 \)

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H) for agricultural and veterinary science**: 
   Let's assume this field has fewer students, say 5%.
   \( P(H) \approx 0.05 \)

2. **P(E|H)**: 
   Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals strongly suggests this field. This makes it highly likely that his personality fits well here.
   \( P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \)

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: 
   If he’s not in this field, the personality is less likely, given the specific interests. Let's keep it low.
   \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \)

### Business Administration

1. **P(H) for business administration**: 
   Assume about 15% of graduate students are in this field.
   \( P(H) \approx 0.15 \)

2. **P(E|H)**: 
   Business administration doesn't strongly correlate with the given traits, although it’s not implausible.
   \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \)

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: 
   If Adam is not in business administration, the personality scenario would be more likely by default.
   \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.9 \)

Using the given estimates:

### Bayes' Rule Calculation

We need to normalize and calculate individual values. But looking at the rough estimates, we’ll provide calculated probabilities based on human intuition:

#### Computer Science

\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(E|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(E|\neg CS) \cdot P(\neg CS)} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.20}{(0.2 \cdot 0.20) + (0.8 \cdot 0.80)} \approx 0.05 \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

\[ P(\text{Ag and Vet Sci}|E) = \frac{P(E|Ag and Vet Sci) \cdot P(Ag and Vet Sci)}{P(E|Ag and Vet Sci) \cdot P(Ag and Vet Sci) + P(E|\neg Ag and Vet Sci) \cdot P(\neg Ag and Vet Sci)} \]
\[ P(\text{Ag and Vet Sci}|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{(0.9 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95)} \approx 0.194 \]

#### Business Administration

\[ P(\text{Bus Admin}|E) = \frac{P(E|Bus Admin) \cdot P(Bus Admin)}{P(E|Bus Admin) \cdot P(Bus Admin) + P(E|\neg Bus Admin) \cdot P(\neg Bus Admin)} \]
\[ P(\text{Bus Admin}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{(0.1 \cdot 0.15) + (0.9 \cdot 0.85)} \approx 0.019 \]

Based on these calculations, we present our answers:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.194,
  "business administration": 0.019
}
