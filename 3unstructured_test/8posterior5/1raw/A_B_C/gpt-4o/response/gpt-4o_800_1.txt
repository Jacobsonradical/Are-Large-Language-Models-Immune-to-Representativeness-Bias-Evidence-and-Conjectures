To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need estimates for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each hypothesis \( H \):

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the information, let's make reasonable estimates to plug into Bayes' rule.

### Business Administration
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \)**
   - Let's assume the relative probability of Adam enrolling in Business Administration is moderately low compared to other graduate fields. 
   - Estimate: \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \)**
   - Business Administration typically doesn't match well with Adam's described personality (curiosity about nature, love for animals, etc.).
   - Estimate: \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.05 \)

3. **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \)**
   - Given Adam's personality, many other fields fit better, implying the likelihood of observing \( E \) when not enrolled in BA is higher.
   - Estimate: \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.4 \)

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) \)**
   - Given Adam's characteristics, this field has a high fit.
   - Estimate: \( P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) = 0.3 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \)**
   - This field fits Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, warm heart, and empathy very well.
   - Estimate: \( P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) = 0.9 \)

3. **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AgVet}}) \)**
   - Many non-AgVet fields are less consistent with Adamâ€™s personality traits.
   - Estimate: \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AgVet}}) = 0.2 \)

### Computer Science
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \)**
   - Computer Science can suit Adam's high intelligence and puzzle-solving ability.
   - Estimate: \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.2 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \)**
   - It fits some of Adam's traits, but less emphasis on nature and animals.
   - Estimate: \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.5 \)

3. **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \)**
   - Many fields other than CS may not fit the overall personality as well.
   - Estimate: \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.3 \)

### Bayesian Computation
Now compute the posterior probabilities using:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) \) can be seen as the normalizing constant.

We simplify comparing posterior probabilities without computing \( P(E) \):
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

{
  "business administration": \(\frac{0.05 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \approx 0.005 \),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \(\frac{0.9 \times 0.3}{P(E)} \approx 0.27 \),
  "computer science": \(\frac{0.5 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \approx 0.10 \)
}

Normalizing:
\[
P(E) = 0.005 + 0.27 + 0.10 = 0.375
\]
Thus,
{
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.005}{0.375} \approx 0.013 \),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{0.27}{0.375} \approx 0.72 \),
  "computer science": \( \frac{0.10}{0.375} \approx 0.27 \)
}

Final probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.013,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.72,
  "computer science": 0.27
}
