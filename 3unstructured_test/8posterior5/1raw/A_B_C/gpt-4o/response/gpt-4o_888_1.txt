To estimate \( P(H|E) \) for each graduate field (Computer Science, Business Administration, Agricultural and Veterinary Science), we can use Bayes' rule, which is defined as:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Given the probabilities:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing E given H.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing E given that H is not true. 

We'll make educated guesses based on the personality sketch of Adam. We'll assume generic base rates for the priors unless specific information is provided:

1. Computer Science (CS):
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \): Computer science is a common field, so we give it a moderate prior probability.
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \): The likelihood that someone with interests in nature, animals, and puzzles would fit into CS is moderate but not particularly high.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \): This could be relatively high since many people with such characteristics are found in various other fields.

2. Business Administration (BA):
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.25 \): Business administration is also quite common but perhaps less attractive to someone with a love for animals and puzzles.
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.05 \): The likelihood of someone with Adam's personality sketch fitting into Business Administration is relatively low.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \): This value could be relatively high since many people with such characteristics are found in various other fields.

3. Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS):
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.15 \): This field is more specialized and less widespread than the others, so we assign a lower prior probability.
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \): High likelihood since Adam's personality sketch aligns very well with this field.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \): This value could be relatively high since many people with such characteristics are found in various other fields.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

Now computing for each field:

1. For Computer Science:
\[
P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.3 + 0.5 \cdot 0.7 = 0.03 + 0.35 = 0.38
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.3}{0.38} = \frac{0.03}{0.38} \approx 0.079
\]

2. For Business Administration:
\[
P(E) = 0.05 \cdot 0.25 + 0.5 \cdot 0.75 = 0.0125 + 0.375 = 0.3875
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.25}{0.3875} = \frac{0.0125}{0.3875} \approx 0.032
\]

3. For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[
P(E) = 0.9 \cdot 0.15 + 0.5 \cdot 0.85 = 0.135 + 0.425 = 0.56
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.15}{0.56} = \frac{0.135}{0.56} \approx 0.241
\]

Simplified results in JSON format:

```

These values are estimates based on the provided probabilities and personality sketch.
