Let's denote the fields of study as follows:

- \( H_{BA} \): Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( H_{AVS} \): Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( H_{CS} \): Adam was enrolled in computer science.

Let's also denote:
- \( P(H_{BA}) \) = prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(H_{AVS}) \) = prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(H_{CS}) \) = prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \) = probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \) = probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) = probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.

We also need:
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) = probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in the specified field.

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we do not have exact numerical values, we make qualitative judgments for each field based on the given personality sketch.

**Business Administration:**
- \( P(H_{BA}) \) = A relatively moderate value since business administration is a common field.
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \) = Low to moderate. The sketch does not heavily align with typical attributes of a business administration student.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \) = Higher than \( P(E|H_{BA}) \), due to more alignment with other fields.

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- \( P(H_{AVS}) \) = Moderate to low. Not as common as other fields, but plausible.
- \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \) = High given Adam's love of nature, plants, and animals.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \) = Lower, since the sketch strongly aligns with characteristics typical in this field.

**Computer Science:**
- \( P(H_{CS}) \) = Moderate to high. Very common field with high enrollment rates.
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) = Moderate. His interest in puzzles and high intelligence aligns, but nature-related traits are less common.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \) = Higher than \( P(E|H_{CS}) \), due to a broader applicability of his traits in other fields.

Now, applying these qualitative judgements numerically could look like this:
1. Let's assume initial hypotheses prior probabilities \( P(H_{BA}) \), \( P(H_{AVS}) \), and \( P(H_{CS}) \) are equal (without prior information).
2. We assign reasonable approximations based on the qualitative assessments.

Let's use values:
- \( P(H_{BA}) \approx 0.2 \)
- \( P(H_{AVS}) \approx 0.1 \)
- \( P(H_{CS}) \approx 0.2 \)

For observation probabilities:
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \approx 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \approx 0.8 \)
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \approx 0.5 \)

For \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \) given averages across multiple fields.

Using Bayes' Rule:
- For business administration (\( BA \)):
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{0.4} = 0.15 \]

- For agricultural and veterinary science (\( AVS \)):
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.4} = 0.2 \]

- For computer science (\( CS \)):
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.5 \times 0.2}{0.4} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": 0.15,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.25
}
