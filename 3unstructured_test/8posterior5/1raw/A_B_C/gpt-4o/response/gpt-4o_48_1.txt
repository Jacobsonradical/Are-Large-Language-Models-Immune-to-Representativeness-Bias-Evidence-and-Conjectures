To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' rule, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of evidence \( E \).

For this exercise, we will estimate the following values:

1. **Prior probability \( P(H) \)**: This represents our initial assumption about the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in each field without any additional information. Since we lack specific data, a reasonable assumption for each field being equally likely is \( \frac{1}{3} \) (since we are only given three fields and we assume they are equally probable initially).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This represents the probability of observing evidence \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in a particular field \( H \).

3. **Complementary Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is the probability of observing evidence \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in the field \( H \). This can be trickier and involves judgment based on the nature of the field versus the personality sketch provided.

Given the personality sketch of Adam (E):

- High curiosity about nature and plants
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts
- Strong empathy and love for animals
- Deep appreciation for hard work and dedication

Let's now estimate the likelihoods and then compute the posterior probabilities:

### Computer Science
- \( P(E|H) \): Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, making it somewhat likely he could be in computer science, but his strong empathy and love for nature and animals make it less typical.
  - Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) for computer science as 0.2.

### Business Administration
- \( P(E|H) \): This is less likely given Adam's personality profile. His love for nature, animals, and empathy does not strongly align with business administration.
  - Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) for business administration as 0.1.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(E|H) \): This perfectly aligns with his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy.
  - Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science as 0.7.

Assuming prior probabilities \( P(H) = \frac{1}{3} \):

To calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{CS})P(H_{CS}) + P(E|H_{BA})P(H_{BA}) + P(E|H_{AVS})P(H_{AVS}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \times \frac{1}{3}) + (0.1 \times \frac{1}{3}) + (0.7 \times \frac{1}{3}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.067) + (0.033) + (0.233) = 0.333 \]

Now calculate posterior probabilities using Bayes' rule:

### Computer Science
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.2 \times \frac{1}{3}}{0.333} = \frac{0.067}{0.333} \approx 0.2 \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1 \times \frac{1}{3}}{0.333} = \frac{0.033}{0.333} \approx 0.1 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.7 \times \frac{1}{3}}{0.333} = \frac{0.233}{0.333} \approx 0.7 \]

Final result:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values indicate the posterior likelihood of Adam being enrolled in each respective field given his personality sketch.
