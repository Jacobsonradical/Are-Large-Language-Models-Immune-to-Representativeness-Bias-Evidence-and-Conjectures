To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, we want to find the probability that Adam was enrolled in each field given his personality sketch \( E \).

Bayes' theorem is stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to make plausible estimates for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

### Business Administration

1. **P(H):** The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in business administration. This could be a moderately common field, so let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

2. **P(E|H):** The likelihood of Adam's personality given he is in business administration. Given the personality characteristics (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy), it seems less likely, so let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood of Adam’s personality given he is not in business administration. Given the traits, these could fit other fields better, so let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for all calculations, we'll normalize it later.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H):** The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This is less common but aligns closely with Adam’s interests, so let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).

2. **P(E|H):** The likelihood of Adam's personality given he is in agricultural and veterinary science. This fits very well, so let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood of Adam’s personality given he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Given the traits, they could fit other fields but less likely than this one directly; so let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} \]

### Computer Science

1. **P(H):** The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in computer science. This is quite common, so let's assume \( P(H) = 0.3 \).

2. **P(E|H):** The likelihood of Adam's personality given he is in computer science. Solving puzzles fits, but love for nature and animals less so; let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood of Adam’s personality given he is not in computer science. Given the traits, they could fit other fields better, so let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.25 \).

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \]

### Normalization

To find \( P(E) \), which is the same in all cases, we'll normalize all \( P(H|E) \) such that their sum is 1. However, for simplicity, we’ll compare relative values first.

Let's execute the calculations without normalizing, then normalize the results.

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.9 \cdot 0.05 = 0.045 \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.3 = 0.06 \]

Now, normalize these values:
Sum = \(0.02 + 0.045 + 0.06 = 0.125\)

\[
P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} = \frac{0.02}{0.125} \approx 0.16
\]
\[
P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} = \frac{0.045}{0.125} \approx 0.36
\]
\[
P(H|E)_{\text{computer science}} = \frac{0.06}{0.125} \approx 0.48
\]

Therefore, the normalized probabilities are as follows:

{
  "business administration": 0.16,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.36,
  "computer science": 0.48
}
