To apply Bayes' rule for each field, we need to estimate the probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) first for each field. Here, \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the given field, \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in the field, and \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in the field. Finally, we'll compute \( P(H|E) \), the posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in the field given the personality sketch.

Let's first set some reasonable assumptions for these probabilities based on the personality sketch and knowledge about the fields.

### Assumptions:
1. **Prior Probabilities (P(H))**: 
   - Graduate students in the U.S are more commonly found in business and computer science fields than in agricultural and veterinary science. Letâ€™s assume:
     - \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.25 \)
     - \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.25 \)
     - \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.05 \)
     - \( P(\text{other fields}) = 0.45 \)
 
2. **Likelihoods (P(E|H))**: 
   - Adam's personality sketch indicates a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, which suggests a higher likelihood if Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science. For computer science, he's intelligent and likes solving puzzles, which could fit. Business administration seems less likely given the lack of business-related qualities.
     - \( P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.05 \)
     - \( P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.25 \)
     - \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.9 \)
     - \( P(E|\text{other fields}) = 0.2 \)

3. **Complement Likelihood (P(E|\neg H))**: 
   - This is derived from the sum probabilities across fields other than the hypothesis field and their likelihoods.
     - \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) \)
     - \( P(E|\neg H (\text{business administration})) \approx \left(\frac{0.25 \times 0.25 + 0.05 \times 0.9 + 0.45 \times 0.2}{0.75}\right) = \left(\frac{0.1775}{0.75}\right) \approx 0.2367 \)
     - \( P(E|\neg H (\text{computer science})) \approx \left(\frac{0.25 \times 0.05 + 0.05 \times 0.9 + 0.45 \times 0.2}{0.75}\right) = \left(\frac{0.1425}{0.75}\right) \approx 0.19 \)
     - \( P(E|\neg H (\text{agricultural and veterinary science})) \approx \left(\frac{0.25 \times 0.05 + 0.25 \times 0.25 + 0.45 \times 0.2}{0.95}\right) = \left(\frac{0.165}{0.95}\right) \approx 0.1737 \)

### Calculations using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

1. **Business Administration:**
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.25}{0.05 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2367 \cdot 0.75} = \frac{0.0125}{0.0125 + 0.177525} \approx 0.065 \]

2. **Computer Science:**
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.25 \cdot 0.25}{0.25 \cdot 0.25 + 0.19 \cdot 0.75} = \frac{0.0625}{0.0625 + 0.1425} \approx 0.305 \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.9 \cdot 0.05 + 0.1737 \cdot 0.95} = \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.165} \approx 0.214 \]

### Final Results:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.065,
  "computer science": 0.305,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.214
}
```
