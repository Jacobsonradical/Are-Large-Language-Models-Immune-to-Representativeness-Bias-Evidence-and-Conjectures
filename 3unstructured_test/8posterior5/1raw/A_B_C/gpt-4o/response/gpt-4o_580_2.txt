To compute \( P(H|E) \), the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific graduate field given his personality sketch, we need to apply Bayes' rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll need to estimate the following probabilities for each field:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability that Adam's personality sketch matches if he was in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability that Adam's personality sketch matches if he was not in that field.

Let's make reasonable estimations based on the given personality sketch and field characteristics:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)**: The probability Adam was in this field. Given his strong love for nature, animals, and high empathy, let's assume it's reasonably likely.
- **P(E|H)**: Very high, due to his fitting characteristics for this field.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Medium to low, because his characteristics might still occur across various fields, though less pronounced.

### Computer Science

- **P(H)**: The probability Adam was in this field. Given his intelligence and abstract thinking, it might be somewhat likely.
- **P(E|H)**: Moderate, as some characteristics align (quiet, puzzles, intelligent).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Medium, as these traits could exist in other fields too.

### Business Administration

- **P(H)**: The probability Adam was in this field. Given his lack of direct business-oriented traits, we might assume it's less likely.
- **P(E|H)**: Low to moderate, not all traits fit perfectly.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Medium to high, as his characteristics are somewhat general.

Let's assign some rough numbers for these probabilities to perform the calculation:

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) = 0.2 \) (Reasonably likely)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \) (Very fitting)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \)

#### Computer Science
- \( P(H) = 0.3 \) (Likely due to abstract thinking and intelligence)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.6 \) (Moderately fitting)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \)

#### Business Administration
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (Less likely given traits)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \) (Less fitting)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \)

We'll need to compute \( P(E) \) as:

\[ 
P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agri}}) + P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})
\]

\[ 
P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.2) + (0.6 \cdot 0.3) + (0.3 \cdot 0.15) = 0.18 + 0.18 + 0.045 = 0.405 
\]

Now, plugging into Bayes' rule:

- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.2}{0.405} \approx 0.444
\]

- For Computer Science:

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.3}{0.405} \approx 0.444
\]

- For Business Administration:

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.15}{0.405} \approx 0.111
\]

The final result in the required format:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.444,
  "computer science": 0.444,
  "business administration": 0.111
}
```
