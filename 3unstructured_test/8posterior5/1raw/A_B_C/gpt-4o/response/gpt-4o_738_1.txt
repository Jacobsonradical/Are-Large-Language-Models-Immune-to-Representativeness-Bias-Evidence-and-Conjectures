To calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we will use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in the particular field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in the particular field.

For simplicity, let's assume \( P(H) \) is the same for all fields and denote it as \( P(H) \approx 0.33 \) for simplicity (since there are many fields and it could be any one of them). This simplification isn't entirely accurate but will help illustrate the calculations.

Next, let's assign reasonable probabilities for \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \) based on how well Adam's personality sketch (E) matches each field.

### Computer Science
- \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \): Adam is highly intelligent and enjoys solving puzzles, which suits computer science. However, there's no specific mention of an interest in technology.
  - Assume \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.6 \)

- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{computer science}}) \): Since there’s not a strong bias for Adam liking plants and nature in computer science.
  - Assume \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.3 \)

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): Adam’s curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align well with this field.
  - Assume \( P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) \approx 0.9 \)

- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): High curiosity about nature and love for animals is less expected.
  - Assume \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agri}}) \approx 0.2 \)

### Business Administration
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \): Not much in the sketch aligns with business administration directly, and Adam's interests lie more in nature and animals.
  - Assume \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \approx 0.2 \)

- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business administration}}) \): Like the “other fields,” still fits less well.
  - Assume \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}}) \approx 0.8 \)

Finally, we will calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field using the values:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Firstly, let's calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agri}}) + P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}}) \]

Substituting values:
\[ P(E) = 0.6 \cdot 0.33 + 0.9 \cdot 0.33 + 0.2 \cdot 0.33 \approx 0.198 + 0.297 + 0.066 = 0.561 \]

Now compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

1. **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.33}{0.561} \approx 0.353 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.33}{0.561} \approx 0.529 \]

3. **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.33}{0.561} \approx 0.118 \]

So, the final probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.353,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.529,
  "business administration": 0.118
}
```
