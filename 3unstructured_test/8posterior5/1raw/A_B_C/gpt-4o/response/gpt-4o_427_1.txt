To compute the values using Bayes' rule, we need an understanding of the following terms:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \), given that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \), given that Adam was not enrolled in the specific field.
4. **P(H|E)**: The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field, given his personality sketch.

Although these values are subjective and largely depend on our assumptions, we can make reasoned estimates based on Adam's personality sketch.

1. **P(H)**:
   - Graduate students are widely distributed among different fields. Because there is no specific prior information that increases the likelihood of one field over another, we will assume equal priors.
   - P(business administration) = 0.33 (assuming 3 fields equally likely for simplicity)
   - P(agricultural and veterinary science) = 0.33
   - P(computer science) = 0.33

2. **P(E|H)**: Likelihood of Adam's personality traits given the specific field.
   - Adam's traits such as a genuine curiosity about nature, a love for animals, and a warm heart with strong empathy are more aligned with Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
   - Given this, we'll estimate:
     - P(E|business administration) = 0.1 (not typically associated with nature and animals)
     - P(E|agricultural and veterinary science) = 0.7 (high likelihood given his traits)
     - P(E|computer science) = 0.2 (some aspects may fit, such as intelligence and solving puzzles)

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Likelihood of Adam's personality given he is not in the specific field. This will be the average of the likelihoods of the other fields.
   - P(E|\neg business administration): Average of the other two fields.
     - = (P(E|agricultural and veterinary science) + P(E|computer science))/2
     - = (0.7 + 0.2) / 2 = 0.45
   - P(E|\neg agricultural and veterinary science): Average of the other two fields.
     - = (P(E|business administration) + P(E|computer science))/2
     - = (0.1 + 0.2) / 2 = 0.15
   - P(E|\neg computer science): Average of the other two fields.
     - = (P(E|business administration) + P(E|agricultural and veterinary science))/2
     - = (0.1 + 0.7) / 2 = 0.4

Using Bayes' rule to calculate P(H|E):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

1. Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.33}{(0.1 \cdot 0.33) + (0.45 \cdot 0.67)} \approx \frac{0.033}{0.033 + 0.3015} \approx \frac{0.033}{0.3345} \approx 0.0987 \]

2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.33}{(0.7 \cdot 0.33) + (0.15 \cdot 0.67)} \approx \frac{0.231}{0.231 + 0.1005} \approx \frac{0.231}{0.3315} \approx 0.6966 \]

3. Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.33}{(0.2 \cdot 0.33) + (0.4 \cdot 0.67)} \approx \frac{0.066}{0.066 + 0.268} \approx \frac{0.066}{0.334} \approx 0.1976 \]

So, the probability estimates are:

{
  "business administration": 0.0987,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6966,
  "computer science": 0.1976
}
