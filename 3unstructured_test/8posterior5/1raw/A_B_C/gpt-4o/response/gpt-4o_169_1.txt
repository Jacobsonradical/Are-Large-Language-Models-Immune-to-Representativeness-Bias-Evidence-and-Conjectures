We'll start by evaluating the probabilities for each field based on the given personality sketch (E) of Adam. 

We'll need to consider:

1. **P(H):** The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field.
2. **P(E|H):** The likelihood of observing the personality sketch E if Adam is in the given field.
3. **P(E|¬H):** The likelihood of observing the personality sketch E if Adam is not in the given field.

Then, we can use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

While P(E), the overall probability of observing the personality sketch, is not directly given, we can normalize our results at the end if necessary.

### Business Administration:
- **P(H):** Business Administration is a common field of study, so a moderate prior, say 0.2.
- **P(E|H):** The likelihood of being curious about nature and loving animals isn't particularly high for Business Administration. Let's say 0.1.
- **P(E|¬H):** Given that there are many other fields, let's assign this a moderate probability, say 0.5.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- **P(H):** This is less common than Business Administration but fits Adam’s characteristics. Let's assign it 0.1.
- **P(E|H):** The personality sketch strongly aligns with this field. Let's assign 0.9.
- **P(E|¬H):** Given the strong fit for the field, P(E|¬H) should be lower relative to P(E|H). Let's say 0.3.

### Computer Science:
- **P(H):** Computer Science is another common field, so let's assign a moderate prior, say 0.2.
- **P(E|H):** The interest in puzzles and high intelligence fit well with this field, but the love for animals and nature may not fit as much. Let's say 0.4.
- **P(E|¬H):** Considering the diverse array of graduate studies, let's assign 0.5.

Now we calculate the posterior probabilities using Bayes' rule:

For **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

For **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

We don't have P(E), so we'll normalize the results for the sum of probabilities:

Let \(k = \frac{1}{P(E)}\), and calculate:

\[ \text{Business Administration:} \quad k \cdot 0.02 \]
\[ \text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science:} \quad k \cdot 0.09 \]
\[ \text{Computer Science:} \quad k \cdot 0.08 \]

Normalize:
Sum \( = k(0.02 + 0.09 + 0.08) = k \cdot 0.19 \)
So,
\[ k = \frac{1}{0.19} = 5.26 \]

Thus,

\[ \text{Business Administration:} \quad 0.02 \cdot 5.26 \approx 0.11 \]
\[ \text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science:} \quad 0.09 \cdot 5.26 \approx 0.47 \]
\[ \text{Computer Science:} \quad 0.08 \cdot 5.26 \approx 0.42 \]

Final result:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.11,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.47,
  "computer science": 0.42
}
