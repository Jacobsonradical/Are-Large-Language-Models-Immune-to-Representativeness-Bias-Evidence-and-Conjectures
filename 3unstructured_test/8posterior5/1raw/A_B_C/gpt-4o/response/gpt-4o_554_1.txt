To use Bayes' theorem to compute the probabilities, we'll need to estimate a few values:

- P(H): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field (before considering personality sketch E).
- P(E|H): The likelihood of observing the given personality sketch E if Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
- P(E|\neg H): The likelihood of observing the given personality sketch E if Adam is not enrolled in that specific field.
- P(E): The total probability of observing personality sketch E across all fields, but we won't need to explicitly calculate this since we are more interested in comparing the relative values.

Bayes' rule is:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the specifics of Adam's personality sketch, we can make the following qualitative assessments:
- Adam enjoys nature, plants, animals, and has a strong curiosity about these subjects.
- He is described as intelligent and good at abstract concepts.
- Adam appreciates hard work and dedication, which could fit multiple fields, though some more strongly than others.

Based on these observations, we can make educated guesses about the values for P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|\neg H):

1. **Computer Science**:
   - P(H): The base rate for computer science, let's estimate it around 0.15 (given the popularity of the field among graduate students).
   - P(E|H): The probability of someone with Adam's profile being in computer science might be lower, as his interest in nature, plants, and animals isn't a strong fit for this field. Let's estimate P(E|H) to be 0.1.
   - P(E|\neg H): Assuming a not-focused interest in nature and animals outside of computer science fields, this might be reasonable to set around 0.3.
   
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - P(H): The base rate, let's estimate it around 0.05 (assuming it's less popular but relevant).
   - P(E|H): Given Adam's interests in nature, plants, animals, and empathy, this field seems like a strong fit. Let's estimate P(E|H) to be 0.8.
   - P(E|\neg H): Given these interests might not fit another field as well, let's estimate around 0.1.

3. **Business Administration**:
   - P(H): The base rate, let's estimate it around 0.2 (given the popularity of this field).
   - P(E|H): Considering Adam's likes and traits, this field might be a less accurate fit. Let's estimate P(E|H) to be 0.05.
   - P(E|\neg H): Assuming this less focused interest applies more broadly, let's set it around 0.3.

Then we compute P(H|E) for each field using Bayes' theorem. Normalizing for the sake of comparison among fields:

1. **Computer Science**:
   \[
   P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \times 0.15}{0.3} \approx 0.05
   \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[
   P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.1} \approx 0.4
   \]

3. **Business Administration**:
   \[
   P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.05 \times 0.2}{0.3} \approx 0.033
   \]

Actual values in practice would be more precise with harder data, but for this qualitative context, our approximations suggest:

{
  "computer science": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.033
}

These values indicate the highest posterior probability for Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science based on his personality sketch.
