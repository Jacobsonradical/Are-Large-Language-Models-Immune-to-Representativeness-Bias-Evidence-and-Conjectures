Given the personality sketch of Adam (E), we are to evaluate the likelihoods for each of the specified fields (H) and compute the posterior probabilities using Bayes' rule.

### Definitions:
- P(H): Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
- P(E|H): Probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in the specified field.
- P(E|¬H): Probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is NOT enrolled in the specified field.
- P(H|E): Posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in the specified field given his personality sketch.

### Estimates:
1. **Computer Science**
   - P(H): Let's assume a 10% (0.10) prior probability that Adam is in computer science.
   - P(E|H): Given the personality sketch, interests, and traits, the fit seems moderate. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.3.
   - P(E|¬H): Given that there are many other fields, I'd estimate P(E|¬H) = 0.1.
   - By Bayes' rule:
     - \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \)
     - \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \)
     - \( P(E) = 0.3 \times 0.1 + 0.1 \times 0.9 = 0.12 \)
     - \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.1}{0.12} = 0.25 \)

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - P(H): Let's assume a 5% (0.05) prior probability for this field.
   - P(E|H): The personality sketch fits very well, especially the love for nature and animals. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.8.
   - P(E|¬H): Given many other fields, let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.1.
   - By Bayes' rule:
     - \( P(E) = 0.8 \times 0.05 + 0.1 \times 0.95 = 0.135 \)
     - \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.135} = 0.30 \)

3. **Business Administration**
   - P(H): Let's assume a 15% (0.15) prior probability for this field.
   - P(E|H): The personality sketch doesn't seem to fit particularly well. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.1.
   - P(E|¬H): Given many other fields, let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.1.
   - By Bayes' rule:
     - \( P(E) = 0.1 \times 0.15 + 0.1 \times 0.85 = 0.1 \)
     - \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.15}{0.1} = 0.15 \)

### Results:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.25,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.30,
  "business administration": 0.15
}
```

These results reflect the subjective estimations based on the given personality sketch and the application of Bayes' rule.
