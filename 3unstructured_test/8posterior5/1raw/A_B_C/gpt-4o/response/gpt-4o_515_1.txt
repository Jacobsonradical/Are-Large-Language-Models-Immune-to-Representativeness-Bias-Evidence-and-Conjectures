To solve this problem, let's use Bayes' Rule, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.

Given this, let's consider each field individually.

### Business Administration
1. **Prior probability, \( P(H) \)**:
   - It is relatively common but not substantially high for individuals with Adam's personality to pursue this field. Let's assume a prior of 0.2.
  
2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Considering Adam's characteristics, such as his love for nature, empathy, and interest in animals, it's lower than average for a business administration student. Say, 0.05.

3. **Prior probability of not being in this field, \( P(\neg H) \)**:
   - If \( P(H) = 0.2 \), then \( P(\neg H) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 \).

4. **Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - Considering all other fields collectively, individuals who are not in business administration could have Adam’s personality sketch more frequently. Assume, 0.15.

### Computer Science
1. **Prior probability, \( P(H) \)**:
   - It is slightly more likely given his intelligence and interest in puzzles. Let's assume a prior of 0.25.
   
2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Many computer science students would fitting have some of Adam’s traits, such as a high intellect and an interest in solving puzzles, though not much related to nature. Say, 0.2.

3. **Prior probability of not being in this field, \( P(\neg H) \)**:
   - If \( P(H) = 0.25 \), then \( P(\neg H) = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75 \).

4. **Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - Among those not in computer science, the likelihood of having Adam’s personality sketch is probably similar to those in other fields not specified. Suppose, 0.1.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **Prior probability, \( P(H) \)**:
   - Adam's characteristics closely resonate with this field. Let's assume a prior of 0.1 (it is a less common field overall).
  
2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Given Adam’s traits, it is very plausible for someone with his personality profile to be in this field. Say, 0.7.

3. **Prior probability of not being in this field, \( P(\neg H) \)**:
   - If \( P(H) = 0.1 \), then \( P(\neg H) = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9 \).

4. **Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - For those not in this field, fewer people might have these specific traits. Assume, 0.07.

For normalization and comparison, we need also the overall probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch \( P(E) \), which can be calculated by:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) + P(E|H_3) \cdot P(H_3) + P(E|\neg H_1, \neg H_2, \neg H_3) \cdot P(\neg H_1, \neg H_2, \neg H_3) \]

where \( H_1, H_2, \) and \( H_3 \) are the hypotheses for the three fields respectively.

However, since we only compare relative probabilities, let's use normalized values. Assume that remaining fields and their combined probabilities cancel out, we can then directly compare the numerators of Bayes' formula.

Let's plug in:

1. **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.05 \times 0.2}{0.05 \times 0.2 + 0.2 \times 0.25 + 0.7 \times 0.1} \approx \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.05 + 0.07} \approx \frac{0.01}{0.13} \approx 0.077 \]

2. **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.2 \times 0.25}{0.05 \times 0.2 + 0.2 \times 0.25 + 0.7 \times 0.1} \approx \frac{0.05}{0.01 + 0.05 + 0.07} \approx \frac{0.05}{0.13} \approx 0.384 \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.7 \times 0.1}{0.05 \times 0.2 + 0.2 \times 0.25 + 0.7 \times 0.1} \approx \frac{0.07}{0.01 + 0.05 + 0.07} \approx \frac{0.07}{0.13} \approx 0.538 \]

Thus:

{
  "business administration": 0.077,
  "computer science": 0.384,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.538
