To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for different fields of study given the personality sketch of Adam using Bayes' Rule, we need to estimate the following probabilities for each hypothesis:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is in a particular field of study without any additional information.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the evidence (personality sketch) given that Adam is in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the evidence (personality sketch) given that Adam is not in that field.
4. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of the evidence (personality sketch).

By Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's evaluate these components for each field of study:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science (A&VS)

- **P(H)**: This depends on the baseline rate of students in this field. Suppose we consider it a relatively specialized field with lower enrollment compared to more general ones like business or computer science. Let's assume \( P(H \text{ (A&VS)}) = 0.05 \).
- **P(E|H)**: Given Adam’s traits (love for nature, plants, animals), this probability is quite high. Let's estimate \( P(E|H \text{ (A&VS)}) = 0.8 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Given that the positive traits aren't exclusive to A&VS, this will be moderately high but lower than \( P(E|H) \). Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H \text{ (A&VS)}) = 0.3 \).

Using these values, Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \times 0.05 = 0.04 \]

### Business Administration

- **P(H)**: Higher baseline rate due to popularity. Assume \( P(H \text{ (BA)}) = 0.3 \).
- **P(E|H)**: Not a direct match with Adam’s personality but plausible. Let’s estimate \( P(E|H \text{ (BA)}) = 0.2 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Moderately similar for the same reasons as above. Assume \( P(E|\neg H \text{ (BA)}) = 0.3 \).

Using these values, Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \times 0.3 = 0.06 \]

### Computer Science

- **P(H)**: Very popular field with significant interest from students. Assume \( P(H \text{ (CS)}) = 0.25 \).
- **P(E|H)**: High intelligence and interest in puzzles suggest good fit. Let’s estimate \( P(E|H \text{ (CS)}) = 0.4 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Similar considerations apply, still lower than \( P(E|H) \). Assume \( P(E|\neg H \text{ (CS)}) = 0.3 \).

Using these values, Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.4 \times 0.25 = 0.1 \]

Finally, we normalize these by dividing by the sum to get probabilities that sum to 1, but since we are not seeking normalization to total 1, we proceed with the scaled values.

### Summary

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.04,
  "business administration": 0.06,
  "computer science": 0.1
}

**Note**: These values are approximations, and actual probabilities would depend on more precise data.
