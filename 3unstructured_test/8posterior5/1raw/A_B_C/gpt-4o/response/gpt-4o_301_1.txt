Alright, let's start by breaking down each field with respect to the given personality sketch of Adam. We'll denote:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in that particular field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in that particular field.
- \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in that particular field given the personality sketch.

We will use Bayes' Rule: 

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we are comparing different fields, we don't need the exact value of \( P(E) \). We can assume it is a normalizing constant. Instead, we will focus on comparing the relative values of \( P(H|E) \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H):** Moderate, given that this field involves a love for nature and animals. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.3 \).
- **P(E|H):** High, because Adam's interests and personality traits closely align with this field. Let's set \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
- **P(E|\neg H):** Lower, since such a specific interest and empathy may not be as prevalent in a general population of other fields. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

Using these values:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \]

### Computer Science
- **P(H):** Moderate, as high intelligence and puzzle-solving capabilities are aligned with this field. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.3 \).
- **P(E|H):** Moderate to high, since solving puzzles is central, but empathy and love for animals are less relevant. Let's set \( P(E|H) = 0.5 \).
- **P(E|\neg H):** Similar to the prior assumption, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

Using these values:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.5 \cdot 0.3 = 0.15 \]

### Business Administration
- **P(H):** Lower, as the personality sketch doesn't strongly align with typical traits for this field. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
- **P(E|H):** Low to moderate, because empathy could be a positive trait, but the other interests are less relevant. Let's set \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).
- **P(E|\neg H):** Similar, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

Using these values:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.3 \cdot 0.2 = 0.06 \]

### Conclusion
Based on these calculations, we get the following approximate posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.24,
  "computer science": 0.15,
  "business administration": 0.06
}
```

These values indicate that, given Adam's personality sketch, he is most likely enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, followed by computer science, with business administration being the least likely.
