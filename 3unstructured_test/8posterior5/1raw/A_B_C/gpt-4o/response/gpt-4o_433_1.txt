We will approach the problem by providing reasonable estimates for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field and then use Bayes' Rule to compute \( P(H|E) \).

Bayes' Rule: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Note: It's difficult to provide precise numbers without more context, but we can make reasonable estimates for the purpose of this problem.

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \) - The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
  - Let's assume a 10% chance of enrollment in this popular field for a graduate student.
  - \( P(H) \approx 0.10 \)

- \( P(E|H) \) - The probability of having Adam's personality sketch given he is studying business administration.
  - Adam's traits do not strongly suggest a business administration field, which might be more common for people who are outgoing, strong leaders, or interested in corporate environments.
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.05 \)

- \( P(E|\neg H) \) - The probability of having this personality sketch given he is not in business administration.
  - Considering the large number of other possible fields, his traits seem moderately uncommon across many fields.
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.20 \)

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \) - The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
  - Let's assume a 5% chance because the field is specialized and not as common.
  - \( P(H) \approx 0.05 \)

- \( P(E|H) \) - The probability of having Adam's personality sketch given he is studying agricultural and veterinary science.
  - His love for animals and nature aligns well with this field.
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.60 \)

- \( P(E|\neg H) \) - The probability of having this personality sketch given he is not in agricultural and veterinary science.
  - His traits seem moderately uncommon across many fields, particularly those unrelated to nature and animals.
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.20 \)

### Computer Science
- \( P(H) \) - The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
  - Assuming around 15% chance because it is a very popular field for graduates, especially with his intelligence and abstract reasoning skills.
  - \( P(H) \approx 0.15 \)

- \( P(E|H) \) - The probability of having Adam's personality sketch given he is studying computer science.
  - His intelligence and problem-solving skills align well, though love for nature and animals does not.
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.25 \)

- \( P(E|\neg H) \) - The probability of having this personality sketch given he is not in computer science.
  - Again, considering the overall distribution of traits, the probability is relatively higher than for a perfect fit.
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.20 \)

### Calculating \( P(H|E) \)

Given \( P(E) \approx 0.20 \) for simplicity,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
We'll substitute the values:

- Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.10}{0.20} = 0.025 \]

- Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.60 \cdot 0.05}{0.20} = 0.15 \]

- Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.25 \cdot 0.15}{0.20} = 0.1875 \]

### Final Response
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.025,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.15,
  "computer science": 0.1875
}
