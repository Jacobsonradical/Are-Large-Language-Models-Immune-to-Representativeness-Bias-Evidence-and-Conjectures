Sure, let's use Bayes' rule to compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the provided fields based on his personality sketch \( E \).

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll need to estimate the following probabilities for each field:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in that field.
4. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for all hypotheses, we focus on the values that vary.

Let's make some educated guesses based on Adam's characteristics:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
    - **\( P(H) \)**: This is less common among the general graduate fields but fairly relevant given Adam's love for nature and animals.
    - **\( P(E|H) \)**: High, as his interests align well with this field.
    - **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Lower, as fewer students in unrelated fields might have these interests.

2. **Business Administration**
    - **\( P(H) \)**: Relatively common among graduate fields.
    - **\( P(E|H) \)**: Low, as his personality sketch doesnâ€™t align well with typical business administration interests.
    - **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Slightly higher than for Agri/Vet, as more unrelated fields exist.

3. **Computer Science**
    - **\( P(H) \)**: Relatively common, given the prevalence of this field.
    - **\( P(E|H) \)**: Moderate, as his puzzle-solving skills are relevant, but other traits are less aligned.
    - **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Somewhat similar to Business Administration.

Now, let's assign some values and calculate:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) = 0.05 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)(1 - P(H)) = 0.7 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot (1 - 0.05) = 0.235 \)

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{0.235} = 0.149 \]

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.25 \)
- \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)(1 - P(H)) = 0.1 \cdot 0.3 + 0.25 \cdot (1 - 0.3) = 0.205 \)

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.3}{0.205} = 0.146 \]

### Computer Science
- \( P(H) = 0.25 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.25 \)
- \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)(1 - P(H)) = 0.5 \cdot 0.25 + 0.25 \cdot (1 - 0.25) = 0.3125 \)

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.25}{0.3125} = 0.4 \]

Here are the resulting probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.149,
  "business administration": 0.146,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

These values represent the conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of these fields given his personality sketch.
