To apply Bayes' rule to determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch, we need to estimate the following:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability that Adam's personality sketch aligns with the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability that Adam's personality sketch aligns with fields other than the specified field.
- \( P(E) \): The overall probability of Adam's personality sketch, which is a weighted sum of \( P(E|H) \) for all possible fields, but it will be treated as a normalizing constant here.

We will use Bayes' rule in the following form:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's fill in these values for each of the specified fields based on the provided personality sketch of Adam:

### Computer Science
#### Estimates:
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): Assume prior probability of 0.40 (high demand field).
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): Personal curiosity, puzzle solving, and high intelligence fit well. Let's assume 0.30.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \): Average degree of fit with remaining fields. Assume 0.20.

### Calculation:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.30 \cdot 0.40}{P(E)} \approx 0.12 / P(E) \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
#### Estimates:
- \( P(H_{\text{AV}}) \): Assume prior probability of 0.10.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{AV}}) \): Alignment with curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and love for animals. Assume 0.70.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AV}}) \): Assume 0.20.

### Calculation:
\[ P(H_{\text{AV}}|E) = \frac{0.70 \cdot 0.10}{P(E)} \approx 0.07 / P(E) \]

### Business Administration
#### Estimates:
- \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): Assume prior probability of 0.25.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): Moderate fit, strong understanding and appreciation for hard work. Assume 0.10.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \): Assume 0.20.

### Calculation:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.10 \cdot 0.25}{P(E)} \approx 0.025 / P(E) \]

### Normalization:
To find \( P(E) \), we sum the numerators:
\[ P(E) \approx 0.12 + 0.07 + 0.025 = 0.215 \]

### Normalized Posterior Probabilities:
- Computer Science: \( \frac{0.12}{0.215} \approx 0.558 \)
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( \frac{0.07}{0.215} \approx 0.326 \)
- Business Administration: \( \frac{0.025}{0.215} \approx 0.116 \)

Thus, our approximate probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": 0.558,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.326,
  "business administration": 0.116
