Let's start by analyzing Adam's personality traits and their relevance to each field. Then we'll calculate the probabilities for each.

Given:
- P(H) is the a priori probability that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- P(E|H) is the probability of observing the evidence E given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- P(E|\neg H) is the probability of observing the evidence E given that Adam is not enrolled in that field.
- P(H|E) is the posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in that field given the evidence E.
- We'll assume probability values for P(H) based on the number of graduate students in each field.

### Assumptions and Estimates
- The a priori probabilities (P(H)) are estimated based on the general popularity of the fields among graduate students.
- Normally, business administration is quite popular, so we'll assume P(H) for business is around 0.3.
- Agricultural and veterinary science is less commonly chosen, so P(H) might be around 0.2.
- Computer science is also popular, so we'll assume P(H) is about 0.3.

Now, let's focus on P(E|H) for each field based on Adam's personality sketch:

1. Business administration:
    - Adam has a love for nature, puzzles, animals, and empathy. These traits don't strongly align with business administration, which typically focuses more on management and finance.
    - P(E|H) for business administration is relatively low, maybe 0.2.

2. Agricultural and veterinary science:
    - Adam's curiosity about nature and love for animals fits very well. His empathy and understanding of hard work and dedication are also a good match.
    - P(E|H) for agricultural and veterinary science is quite high, maybe 0.7.

3. Computer science:
    - Adam's intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts are relevant for computer science. However, there is less alignment with his love for nature and animals.
    - P(E|H) for computer science might be moderate, around 0.4.

Lastly, P(E|\neg H):
- This represents the probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is not enrolled in the specific field. Since the majority of graduate fields do not strongly align with Adam's personality sketch, we'll assume this to be uniformly low, around 0.1 for simplicity.

### Bayes' Rule Calculation
Bayes' rule: P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)

We'll compute P(E) as follows for simplicity - considering:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|\neg H) * P(\neg H) \]

Given that there are other fields of study and focusing on these three:

1. Business administration:
\[ P(E|H_{business}) = 0.2 \]
\[ P(H_{business}) = 0.3 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H_{business}) = 0.1 \]

\[ P(E_{business}) = (0.2 * 0.3) + (0.1 * 0.7) = 0.06 + 0.07 = 0.13 \]
\[ P(H_{business}|E) = \frac{0.2 * 0.3}{0.13} \approx 0.4615 \]

2. Agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(E|H_{agri}) = 0.7 \]
\[ P(H_{agri}) = 0.2 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H_{agri}) = 0.1 \]

\[ P(E_{agri}) = (0.7 * 0.2) + (0.1 * 0.8) = 0.14 + 0.08 = 0.22 \]
\[ P(H_{agri}|E) = \frac{0.7 * 0.2}{0.22} \approx 0.6364 \]

3. Computer science:
\[ P(E|H_{cs}) = 0.4 \]
\[ P(H_{cs}) = 0.3 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H_{cs}) = 0.1 \]

\[ P(E_{cs}) = (0.4 * 0.3) + (0.1 * 0.7) = 0.12 + 0.07 = 0.19 \]
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{0.4 * 0.3}{0.19} \approx 0.6316 \]

### Results
Using Bayes' rule, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.4615,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6364,
  "computer science": 0.6316
}
