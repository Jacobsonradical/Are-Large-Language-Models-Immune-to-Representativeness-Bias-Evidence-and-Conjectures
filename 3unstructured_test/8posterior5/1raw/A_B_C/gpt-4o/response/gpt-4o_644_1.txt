To determine the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields, we use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, we'll assume the following (without actual data, these values are hypothetical but reasoned based on the personality sketch and general trends):

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in that field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in that field.
4. **P(E)**: The marginal likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch.

Given the personality sketch, we can make some informed estimates:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
* **P(H)**: Moderate — This is a plausible field given Adam's interests.
* **P(E|H)**: High — Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align well with this field.
* **P(E|\neg H)**: Lower — These traits are less likely to be found if Adam is not in this field.

### Business Administration
* **P(H)**: Moderate to Low — Less likely given Adam's interests.
* **P(E|H)**: Low — Adam's personality traits do not strongly align with this field.
* **P(E|\neg H)**: Higher — It is more likely that someone with Adam's traits would be in a different field.

### Computer Science
* **P(H)**: Moderate — This is a common graduate field, and intelligence and abstract thinking are relevant.
* **P(E|H)**: Moderate — Quiet disposition and problem-solving fit, but strong empathy and love for animals are less relevant.
* **P(E|\neg H)**: Higher — These traits might be more strongly associated with another field.

#### Hypothetical Values
Assume the following prior probabilities for illustration purposes:
* **P(H_agri)**: 0.3
* **P(H_busi)**: 0.2
* **P(H_comp)**: 0.5 (Reflecting higher enrollment rates typically seen in this field)

Assume the following likelihoods:
* **P(E|H_agri)**: 0.9
* **P(E|H_busi)**: 0.3
* **P(E|H_comp)**: 0.6

Assume the following complementary likelihoods:
* **P(E|\neg H_agri)**: 0.2
* **P(E|\neg H_busi)**: 0.7
* **P(E|\neg H_comp)**: 0.5

Calculating \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_agri)P(H_agri) + P(E|H_busi)P(H_busi) + P(E|H_comp)P(H_comp) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.3) + (0.3 \cdot 0.2) + (0.6 \cdot 0.5) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.27 + 0.06 + 0.3 = 0.63 \]

Now applying Bayes' rule:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E)_agri = \frac{P(E|H_agri) \cdot P(H_agri)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_agri = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.3}{0.63} \]
\[ P(H|E)_agri = \frac{0.27}{0.63} \approx 0.4286 \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E)_busi = \frac{P(E|H_busi) \cdot P(H_busi)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_busi = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.63} \]
\[ P(H|E)_busi = \frac{0.06}{0.63} \approx 0.0952 \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E)_comp = \frac{P(E|H_comp) \cdot P(H_comp)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_comp = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.5}{0.63} \]
\[ P(H|E)_comp = \frac{0.3}{0.63} \approx 0.4762 \]
