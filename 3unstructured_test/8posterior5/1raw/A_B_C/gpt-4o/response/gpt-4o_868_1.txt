To apply Bayes' rule and compute \(P(H|E)\), we need to follow these steps:

1. Assign prior probabilities \(P(H)\) for each hypothesis (H).
2. Estimate the likelihood \(P(E|H)\), the probability of observing E given H.
3. Estimate the likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\), the probability of observing E given not-H.
4. Use Bayes' rule: \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \)
   \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \)

Here are the values and computations:

### Hypothesis: Business Administration
1. **Prior Probability (P(H))**: Let's assume approximately 10% of graduate students are in business administration.
   \( P(H) = 0.10 \)

2. **Likelihood (P(E|H))**: Given Adam's personality sketch, it seems unlikely for someone with a strong interest in nature, animals, and deep empathy to enroll in business administration. We'll assign a low probability.
   \( P(E|H) = 0.02 \)

3. **Likelihood (P(E|\neg H))**: It's more likely to meet this personality in other fields rather than business administration, so let's assume a medium probability.
   \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \)

### Hypothesis: Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **Prior Probability (P(H))**: Let's assume approximately 5% of graduate students are in this field.
   \( P(H) = 0.05 \)

2. **Likelihood (P(E|H))**: Adam's personality aligns very well with this field.
   \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \)

3. **Likelihood (P(E|\neg H))**: This personality is less common among students not in this field.
   \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.05 \)

### Hypothesis: Computer Science
1. **Prior Probability (P(H))**: Let's assume approximately 15% of graduate students are in computer science.
   \( P(H) = 0.15 \)

2. **Likelihood (P(E|H))**: Adam's high intelligence and interest in puzzles fit computer science well. However, his empathy and love for animals are less common in this field.
   \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \)

3. **Likelihood (P(E|\neg H))**: Similar likelihood as above since the personality sketch doesn't strongly fit or oppose other fields, let's say medium probability.
   \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \)

Let's apply Bayes rule for each hypothesis:

For Business Administration:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)}
         = \frac{0.02 \times 0.10}{(0.02 \times 0.10) + (0.1 \times 0.90)}
         = \frac{0.002}{0.002 + 0.09}
         = \frac{0.002}{0.092}
         = 0.0217
\]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)}
         = \frac{0.9 \times 0.05}{(0.9 \times 0.05) + (0.05 \times 0.95)}
         = \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.0475}
         = \frac{0.045}{0.0925}
         = 0.486
\]

For Computer Science:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)}
         = \frac{0.2 \times 0.15}{(0.2 \times 0.15) + (0.1 \times 0.85)}
         = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.085}
         = \frac{0.03}{0.115}
         = 0.261
\]

So the final probabilities are:

\[
{
  "business administration": 0.0217,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.486,
  "computer science": 0.261
}
\]
