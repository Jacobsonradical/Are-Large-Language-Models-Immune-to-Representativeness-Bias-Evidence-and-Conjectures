Sure, let's analyze the probabilities for each field based on Adam's personality sketch and the given conditions.

1. **Business Administration:**
   - **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration. This could be considered fairly low based on the sketch since there's no direct indication that Adam has an interest or skills that align closely with typical business-related traits.
   - **P(E|H):** The probability of observing E given that H is true. Adam's personality does not strongly align with typical business traits, making this also fairly low.
   - **P(E|¬H):** The probability of observing E given that H is not true. Considering there are many fields that Adam’s traits fit better, this value would be relatively high.

Thus, \( P(H|E) \) for Business Administration would be low.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science. This is moderated by the fact that Computer Science is a common field.
   - **P(E|H):** Adam is good at understanding abstract concepts and enjoys solving puzzles, which are strong indicators for Computer Science.
   - **P(E|¬H):** Since there are other fields like mathematics or engineering where these traits are also useful, this value would still be relatively high.

Thus, \( P(H|E) \) for Computer Science would be moderate to high.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. For a graduate student, this field is less common compared to Computer Science or Business Administration.
   - **P(E|H):** Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, a deep love for animals, and a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication, making this high for this field.
   - **P(E|¬H):** The probability of observing E given that H is not true. Many of Adam’s traits are specifically suited to this field, so this would be relatively low compared to other fields.

Thus, \( P(H|E) \) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science would be high.

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we need to compare relative probabilities rather than exact computation, the proportional comparisons are as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values are based on the analysis that Adam's personality sketch is less likely to fit Business Administration, somewhat likely for Computer Science, and most likely for Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
