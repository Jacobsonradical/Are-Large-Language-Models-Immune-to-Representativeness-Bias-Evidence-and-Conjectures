Firstly, we need to evaluate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field.

1. **Business Administration**:
    - \( P(H) \): This is the prior probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is enrolled in business administration. Graduate schools often have a large number of business students, so let's estimate this as 0.2.
    - \( P(E|H) \): This is the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is a business administration student. Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, and puzzles, it seems less likely he'll be in this field. Let's denote this as 0.05.
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): This is the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch if he's not a business administration student. Given that Adam seems more suited to other fields, we can set this higher. Lets denote this as 0.3.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - \( P(H) \): This is the prior probability that a randomly chosen grad student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This is typically less common than fields like business, so let's estimate this as 0.05.
    - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's characteristics align well with this field (curiosity about nature, love for animals). So let's approximate this as 0.7.
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): This would be the likelihood of his personality traits existing if he were not in agricultural and veterinary science. Given he could potentially fit other fields as well, we'll set this to 0.3.

3. **Computer Science**:
    - \( P(H) \): This is the prior probability that a randomly chosen grad student is in computer science. Given its popularity, let's estimate this as 0.25.
    - \( P(E|H) \): His intelligence and affinity for solving puzzles would fit well here, but his other traits donâ€™t necessarily correspond. Let's say this is 0.3.
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): As his personality traits seem quite specific, let's estimate this at 0.3.

To compute \( P(H|E) \), which is the posterior probability that Adam is in each field given his personality sketch, we will use Bayes' Rule:  
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Since \( P(E) \) is the same across all hypotheses, we'll compare the numerators \( P(E|H)P(H) \) for simplification.

Calculations:
1. **Business Administration**:
   - Numerator: \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.05 \cdot 0.2 = 0.01 \)

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Numerator: \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.7 \cdot 0.05 = 0.035 \)

3. **Computer Science**:
   - Numerator: \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.3 \cdot 0.25 = 0.075 \)

To normalize these numbers into probabilities:
\[P(E) \approx 0.01 + 0.035 + 0.075 = 0.12\]

So,
1. **Business Administration**:
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.12} \approx 0.083 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.035}{0.12} \approx 0.292 \]

3. **Computer Science**:
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.075}{0.12} \approx 0.625 \]

Given these calculations:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.083,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.292,
  "computer science": 0.625
}
