To compute the probabilities \(P(H|E)\) through Bayes' rule, I'll use the general formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here is a step-by-step process for each field:

1. Prior probability \(P(H)\): The general likelihood of Adam being enrolled in that field.
2. Likelihood \(P(E|H)\): The probability of Adam having the described personality sketch given that he is in that field.
3. Complement likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of Adam having the described personality sketch given that he is not in that field, considering all other fields.
4. Posterior probability \(P(H|E)\): The probability of Adam being enrolled in that field given the personality description.

For simplicity, let's assume \(P(E)\) is the same across different fields, and we'll focus on relative likelihoods rather than precise calculations.

### Computer Science
- \(P(H)\): Computer science is a popular field, so let's say moderate likelihood \(\approx 0.3\).
- \(P(E|H)\): Some aspects fit well (solving puzzles, high intelligence, abstract concepts) but not others (love for animals, nature). Let's say moderate-high likelihood \(\approx 0.5\).
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): Aggregate all other fields, adjusting for likelihood. Given Adam's fit in other fields, let's assume moderately low likelihood \(\approx 0.3\).

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.5 \times 0.3}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.15 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \(P(H)\): Less popular than some other fields, moderate likelihood \(\approx 0.1\).
- \(P(E|H)\): Fits very well with curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and warm heart. High likelihood \(\approx 0.9\).
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): Less likely relative to overall likelihood. Low-moderate likelihood \(\approx 0.2\).

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.9 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.09 \]

### Business Administration
- \(P(H)\): Popular field, high prior likelihood \(\approx 0.3\).
- \(P(E|H)\): Generally, less fit (not focus on empathy, nature, animals). Low likelihood \(\approx 0.1\).
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): Moderately low likelihood relative to this specific mismatch. Low-moderate likelihood \(\approx 0.2\).

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \times 0.3}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.03 \]

Considering the evidence and estimations above, we get:

\[ P(H|E) \]

- Computer Science: Proportional to 0.15
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Proportional to 0.09
- Business Administration: Proportional to 0.03

So, normalized, we have:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These are rough estimates based on the fitting characteristics seen within Adam's personality sketch and typical field attributes.
