To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of H being true (Adam being enrolled in that field).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing E given H (the personality sketch given Adam was enrolled in that field).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing E given that Adam was not enrolled in H.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing E.

Because we're interested in comparing the probabilities for different fields, we'll examine these values relatively rather than absolutely. The prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field can be assumed based on general knowledge about graduate students' enrollment in various fields.

### Estimations

#### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): Moderate, as it is a specialized but not uncommon field.
- \( P(E|H) \): High, since Adam's interest in nature, plants, and empathy for animals matches this field well.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Low, since Adam's personality sketch strongly suggests characteristics aligning with this field.

#### 2. Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): High, as it's a very common field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Low, Adam's personality sketch does not align much with typical business administration traits.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Moderate, since many other fields do not fit Adam's sketch, but there are plenty of business administration students.

#### 3. Computer Science
- \( P(H) \): High, as it is another very common field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Moderate, Adam's ability to solve puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns somewhat with computer science, but not perfectly.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Moderate to high, as the traits Adam exhibits could be seen in many other fields, and not specifically computer science.

Now letâ€™s compute approximate \( P(H|E) \) for each field. We won't need to know the exact values of \( P(E) \) (overall probability of observing E), as it will be the same for each field, allowing us to compare relative values.

### Computations

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    \[
    P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H)
    \]
   Since \( P(E|H) \) is high and \( P(H) \) is moderate,
   \[
   P(H|E) \approx 0.8
   \]

2. **Business Administration**:
    \[
    P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H)
    \]
   Since \( P(E|H) \) is low and \( P(H) \) is high,
   \[
   P(H|E) \approx 0.1
   \]

3. **Computer Science**:
    \[
    P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H)
    \]
   Since \( P(E|H) \) is moderate and \( P(H) \) is high,
   \[
   P(H|E) \approx 0.4
   \]

Therefore, the estimated relative probabilities \( P(H|E) \):
