To compute the probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam having the personality sketch given he is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of Adam having the personality sketch given he is not enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of Adam having the personality sketch.

Given the personality sketch, we can make some educated estimations:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - **P(H):** Let's assume the probability of a student being enrolled in computer science is 0.2 (20%), considering the popularity of the field.
   - **P(E|H):** Given Adam's personality, he could fit in computer science due to his high intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles. Let's assume this is 0.3 (30%).
   - **P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood of Adam having the personality traits he has if he is not in computer science could be 0.05 (5%).
   
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - **P(H):** Let's assume the probability of a student being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is 0.1 (10%).
   - **P(E|H):** Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, warm heart, empathy, and love for animals, this field seems like a strong fit. Let's assume this is 0.6 (60%).
   - **P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood of Adam having the personality traits he has if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science could be 0.05 (5%).
   
3. **Business Administration:**
   - **P(H):** Let's assume the probability of a student being enrolled in business administration is 0.15 (15%).
   - **P(E|H):** Given the personality data, Adam doesn't seem to fit well into business administration, which often values different personality traits. Let's assume this is 0.05 (5%).
   - **P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood of Adam having the personality traits he has if he is not in business administration could be 0.05 (5%).

For Bayes' Rule, we also need \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}}) + P(E|H_{\text{ag}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ag}}) + P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ba}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{\text{cs}})) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{ag}}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{\text{ag}})) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{ba}}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{\text{ba}})) \]

However, given that itâ€™s too complex to calculate in full detail without more information on other fields, we simplify the calculation by estimating \( P(E) = 0.2 \) as a moderate general likelihood.

Calculations:

1. **Computer Science:**
\[ P(H|E): \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.2} = 0.3 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(H|E): \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.1}{0.2} = 0.3 \]

3. **Business Administration:**
\[ P(H|E): \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.15}{0.2} = 0.0375 \]

Thus, the resulting probabilities are as follows:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.0375
}
