To apply Bayes' rule and calculate the probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the fields given his personality sketch, we need:

1. P(H), the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each particular field.
2. P(E|H), the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in a specific field.
3. P(E|\neg H), the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in the specific field.

### Assumptions:

- Let's assume some rough priors, P(H), for the likelihood of enrolling in these fields based on general popularity:
  - Business administration: P(H) = 0.25
  - Computer science: P(H) = 0.35
  - Agricultural and veterinary science: P(H) = 0.10

- Define P(E|H), the likelihood of Adam’s personality sketch given he is in a specific field:
  - Business administration: P(E|H) = 0.1 (His interests and personality don’t strongly align with this field)
  - Computer science: P(E|H) = 0.2 (Interest in puzzles and abstract thinking align, but love for nature and animals is a mismatch)
  - Agricultural and veterinary science: P(E|H) = 0.8 (Strong alignment with interests in nature, animals, and understanding for work and dedication)

- Define P(E|\neg H), the likelihood of Adam’s personality sketch given he is not in a specific field:
  - Business administration: P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 (Because the field is diverse, and it is less indicative)
  - Computer science: P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 (His personality could reasonably appear in various other disciplines)
  - Agricultural and veterinary science: P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 (More rare and specific personality sketch)

### Calculations using Bayes' Rule

Bayes' rule: 

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we're considering three fields, we need to compute the normalizing constant \( P(E) \), but we can proportionate them based on unnormalized probabilities given that \( \sum P(H|E) = 1 \).

### Business Administration
\[ P(H) = 0.25 \]
\[ P(E|H) = 0.1 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(H) = 0.35 \]
\[ P(E|H) = 0.2 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H) = 0.10 \]
\[ P(E|H) = 0.8 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \]

Since exact normalization is cumbersome, the comparison of non-normalized probabilities is useful.

\[ P(H|E \text{ for Business}) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.1 \times 0.25 + 0.2 \times 0.35 + 0.8 \times 0.1} \approx 0.07 \]
\[ P(H|E \text{ for Comp. Sci.}) = \frac{ 0.2 \cdot 0.35}{0.1 \times 0.25 + 0.2 \times 0.35 + 0.8 \times 0.1} \approx 0.12 \]
\[ P(H|E \text{ for Agri. Sci.}) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.1 \times 0.25 + 0.2 \times 0.35 + 0.8 \times 0.1} \approx 0.53 \]

Therefore the normalizing constant can be taken into proportions.

{
  "business administration": 0.07 / (0.07+0.12+0.53) ≈ 0.093,
  "computer science": 0.12 / (0.07+0.12+0.53) ≈ 0.160,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.53 / (0.07+0.12+0.53) ≈ 0.707
}

Thus, the posterior probabilities are:

{
  "business administration":  0.093,
  "computer science":  0.160,
  "agricultural and veterinary science":  0.707
}
