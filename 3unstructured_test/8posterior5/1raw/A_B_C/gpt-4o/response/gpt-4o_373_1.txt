To compute \( P(H|E) \) through Bayes' rule, we need to use the following formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where:
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of hypothesis \(H\),
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of evidence \(E\) given hypothesis \(H\),
- \(P(E)\) is the total probability of the evidence \(E\),
- \(P(E|\neg H)\) is the probability of evidence \(E\) given that hypothesis \(H\) is not true.

Now, let's consider each field one by one:

1. **Computer Science**

   - **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**: Computer Science is a popular field of study, but not predominant for someone with Adam's described interests. Let's assign it a moderate probability, say \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
   
   - **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: The personality sketch describes interests and traits that are not particularly aligned with typical Computer Science students, though it is possible for a Computer Science student to have these traits. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).
   
   - **Probability \(P(E|\neg H)\)**: This is a bit more challenging, but given that Adam's interests and personality might be more common in fields other than Computer Science, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \).
   
   Using these values:
   \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.3 \cdot 0.2 = 0.06 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

   - **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and his love for animals, this field seems quite likely. Let's assign it a higher probability, say \( P(H) = 0.4 \).
   
   - **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: The likelihood of the evidence given this field is very high. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).
   
   - **Probability \(P(E|\neg H)\)**: For students not in this field, these traits are somewhat less likely. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).
   
   Using these values:
   \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.9 \cdot 0.4 = 0.36 \]

3. **Business Administration**

   - **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**: Business Administration is fairly common, but the described personality traits are not strongly aligned with this field. Let's assign it a moderate probability, say \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
   
   - **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: The likelihood of the evidence being from someone in Business Administration is moderate, say \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \).
   
   - **Probability \(P(E|\neg H)\)**: For students not in this field, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \).
   
   Using these values:
   \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.4 \cdot 0.2 = 0.08 \]

Now we normalize these values to get a more interpretable result:
\[
\begin{align*}
P(H|E)_{\text{total}} & = 0.06 + 0.36 + 0.08 = 0.5 \\
P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} & = \frac{0.06}{0.5} = 0.12 \\
P(H|E)_{\text{A&VS}} & = \frac{0.36}{0.5} = 0.72 \\
P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} & = \frac{0.08}{0.5} = 0.16 \\
\end{align*}
\]

Thus, we get the following probabilities:
\[
{
  "computer science": "0.12",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.72",
  "business administration": "0.16"
}
\]
