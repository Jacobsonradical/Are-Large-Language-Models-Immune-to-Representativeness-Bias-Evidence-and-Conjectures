To evaluate the likelihood \(P(H|E)\), we apply Bayes' Rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Without loss of generality, let's denote:

- \( P(H) \) as the prior probability of enrolling in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \) as the probability of Adam having the described personality given his enrollment in the specified field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) as the probability of Adam having the described personality given that he is not enrolled in the specified field.

Because computing \(P(E)\) accurately is challenging without extensive data, we'll use a simplified approach for comparison by assuming \(P(E)\) remains constant across hypotheses.

Let's make reasoned judgments for the provided fields:

1. **Business Administration**:
    - \( P(H) \) is the prior probability Adam enrolled in Business Administration. Given the typical proportions of graduate students, we can estimate this to be moderate (0.15).
    - \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood that Adam, as described, would be in Business Administration. Given his curiosity about nature, animals, empathy, and love of puzzles (traits not highly correlated with business administration), this value might be relatively low (0.1).
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \) would be an estimation covering all other fields, thus moderate (0.2).
    - By Bayes' Rule: 
        \( P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \).

2. **Computer Science**:
    - \( P(H) \) is the probability he enrolled in Computer Science. This is relatively high since computer science is a popular field among graduate students (0.2).
    - \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood that his traits fit into computer science. Given his love for puzzles and high intelligence, this value is relatively high (0.7).
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \), covering all other fields, remains moderate (0.2).
    - By Bayes' Rule: 
        \( P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \).

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - \( P(H) \) is the prior likelihood of enrolling in Agricultural and Veterinary Science (estimate 0.05).
    - \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood that his described personality matches these fields. Given his love for animals and nature, this value is relatively high (0.8).
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \), covering all other fields, remains moderate (0.2).
    - By Bayes' Rule: 
        \( P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} \).

Based on these intuitive estimates and using Bayes' rule in a comparative manner, we obtain:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.2
}
```

Note: These values are approximations meant to stay consistent within reasoning and limited given data. Adjustments and a more precise calculation would typically require more detailed statistics on graduate fields and matching personalities.
