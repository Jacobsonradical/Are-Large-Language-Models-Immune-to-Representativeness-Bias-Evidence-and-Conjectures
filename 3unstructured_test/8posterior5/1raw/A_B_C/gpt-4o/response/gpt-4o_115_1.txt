Firstly, we need to estimate the values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each of the fields: computer science, business administration, and agricultural and veterinary science.

1. **Base Rate Probability (\( P(H) \))**:  
These are prior probabilities which can be subjective if exact data aren't provided. However, broadly speaking:
   - \( P(\text{computer science}) \): Around 20% (CS is a common field, especially in the U.S.)
   - \( P(\text{business administration}) \): Around 10% (MBA programs are popular but not as common as CS)
   - \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \): Around 5% (less common than CS or business)

2. **Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \)):**
   - \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \): Given Adam's intelligence and puzzle-solving skills, this could be moderately high. However, his interest in nature and animals doesn't align well with typical CS students.
     - Let's estimate: 0.3
   
   - \( P(E|\text{business administration}) \): Business administration typically doesn't align well with Adam's personality traits. While empathy may be beneficial in management, the strong scientific inclination doesn’t quite fit.
     - Let's estimate: 0.1
     
   - \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \): This aligns very well with Adam’s deep love for nature, animals, and plants along with appreciation for hard work.
     - Let's estimate: 0.8

3. **Complement Likelihoods (\( P(E|\neg H) \)):**
   - This could be taken as the average similarity of E's traits to those in fields outside the given hypotheses.
     - Let's estimate: 0.25 for all fields because it is an average likelihood.

Now we use Bayes' theorem to compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) \) can be derived from the marginal likelihood:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
Given our estimates:
- \( P(E)_{\text{computer science}} = 0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.25 \cdot 0.8 = 0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.25 \cdot 0.8 = 0.06 + 0.2 = 0.26 \)
- \( P(E)_{\text{business administration}} = 0.1 \cdot 0.1 + 0.25 \cdot 0.9 = 0.01 + 0.225 = 0.235 \)
- \( P(E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.25 \cdot 0.95 = 0.04 + 0.2375 = 0.2775 \)

Finally, plug into Bayes' theorem:
- \( P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.26} = \frac{0.06}{0.26} \approx 0.23 \)
- \( P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.235} = \frac{0.01}{0.235} \approx 0.043 \)
- \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.2775} = \frac{0.04}{0.2775} \approx 0.144 \)

So our final responses are:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.23,
  "business administration": 0.043,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.144
}
```

Note, these are rough estimates as we used some average values and subjective assessments. Further statistical data could refine these probabilities.
