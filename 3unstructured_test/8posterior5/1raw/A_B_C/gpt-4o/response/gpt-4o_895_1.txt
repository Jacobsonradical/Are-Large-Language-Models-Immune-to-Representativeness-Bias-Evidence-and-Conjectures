To determine the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in each field given his personality sketch, we'll use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( H \) is the hypothesis that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
- \( E \) is the evidence, which is Adam's personality sketch.

For each field, we'll need to estimate:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability that Adam's personality fits the profile of a student in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability that Adam's personality fits the profile of a student not in that field.

Finally, we'll need to normalize our calculations with the total probability of the evidence \( P(E) \), which can be derived from considering all fields combined. However, for this exercise, we'll focus on the relative comparisons rather than absolute values.

1. **Business Administration**
   - \( P(H_{BA}) \): Graduate students in business administration are quite common, but Adam's profile does not strongly suggest business interests.
   - \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): Adam is empathetic, intelligent, and good with abstract concepts, which may suit business fields, though it doesn't strongly favor it.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \): Because Adam's personality fits very well with other fields (especially those involving nature and animals), this value will be higher.

2. **Computer Science**
   - \( P(H_{CS}) \): Computer science is a popular field for graduate students.
   - \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): While Adam's intelligence and love for solving puzzles fit computer science, his strong connection to nature and animals does not.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \): Adam's personality fits more naturally with non-computer-science fields.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - \( P(H_{AVS}) \): This is a less common, though still substantial, graduate field of study.
   - \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \): Adam's deep love for nature, animals, and empathy highly aligns with this field.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \): Adam's personality fits poorly with fields unrelated to nature and animals.

Given these rough evaluations, let's assign some probabilities:

\[ \begin{align*}
\text{P}(H_{BA}) & \approx 0.10 \\
\text{P}(H_{CS}) & \approx 0.30 \\
\text{P}(H_{AVS}) & \approx 0.05 \\
\end{align*} \]

And for the likelihoods:

\[ \begin{align*}
\text{P}(E|H_{BA}) & \approx 0.2 \\
\text{P}(E|H_{CS}) & \approx 0.3 \\
\text{P}(E|H_{AVS}) & \approx 0.9 \\
\text{P}(E|\neg H_{BA}) & \approx 0.6 \\
\text{P}(E|\neg H_{CS}) & \approx 0.7 \\
\text{P}(E|\neg H_{AVS}) & \approx 0.4 \\
\end{align*} \]

Approximations for posterior \( P(H|E) \):

\[ \begin{align*}
\text{P}(H_{BA}|E) & = \frac{\text{P}(E|H_{BA}) \cdot \text{P}(H_{BA})}{\text{P}(E)} \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{\text{P}(E)} = 0.02/\text{P}(E) \\
\text{P}(H_{CS}|E) & = \frac{\text{P}(E|H_{CS}) \cdot \text{P}(H_{CS})}{\text{P}(E)} \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.3}{\text{P}(E)} = 0.09/\text{P}(E) \\
\text{P}(H_{AVS}|E) & = \frac{\text{P}(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot \text{P}(H_{AVS})}{\text{P}(E)} \approx \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{\text{P}(E)} = 0.045/\text{P}(E) \\
\end{align*} \]

Thus, our relative comparison yields:

\[ \begin{align*}
\text{P}(H_{BA}|E) & \approx 0.2 \\
\text{P}(H_{CS}|E) & \approx 0.4 \\
\text{P}(H_{AVS}|E) & \approx 0.9 \\
\end{align*} \]

Therefore, we get the following:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.9
}
```
