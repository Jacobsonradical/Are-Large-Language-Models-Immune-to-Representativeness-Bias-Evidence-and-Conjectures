To calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need the following information:

- \( P(H) \): Prior probability of Adam being in the given field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Probability of the observed personality sketch given that Adam is in the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of the observed personality sketch given that Adam is not in the field.

Given that we do not have specific statistical data, I will make reasonable assumptions based on typical characteristics and interests in each field.

### Business Administration

- **P(H)**: Graduate students in business administration are quite common. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \) (or 20%).
- **P(E|H)**: A genuine curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, empathy, and love for animals are not typically associated with business administration. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \) (or 10%).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Given that all fields except business administration are considered, and assuming there's a moderate probability he fits the personality sketch in other areas, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \) (or 30%).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.3} \approx 0.067 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)**: Graduate students in agricultural and veterinary science are less common than in business administration, but the field is directly related to Adam's interests. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \) (or 10%).
- **P(E|H)**: His traits strongly suggest alignment with this field. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \) (or 70%).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Considering the remaining fields that fit less well with the sketch, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \) (or 30%).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.3} \approx 0.233 \]

### Computer Science

- **P(H)**: Graduate students in computer science are also quite common. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.25 \) (or 25%).
- **P(E|H)**: While Adam's intelligence and puzzle-solving skills align with computer science, his empathy and love for nature and animals are less tightly aligned. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \) (or 30%).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: For fields outside computer science, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \) (or 30%).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \approx 0.25 \]

### Final Values

Here are the posterior probabilities for each field given Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.067,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.233,
  "computer science": 0.25
}
```

These values reflect my assumptions and the calculations based on those assumptions.
