To determine the probability \( P(H|E) \) â€” the probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the specified fields \emph{given} his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' rule. Here's the relevant formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in field \( H \) given his personality sketch \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is in field \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in field \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the personality sketch \( E \), which we don't need to directly compute since we are comparing relative probabilities here.

For simplicity, let's assume generic prior probabilities \( P(H) \) reflecting common enrollment rates in these fields among graduate students:

- \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.4 \)
- \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.4 \)

Given the personality sketch \( E \), let's estimate the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) based on how well the personality traits align with each field:

- \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \): High curiosity about nature and love for animals align well with this field. Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication are also relevant.
  - Likelihood estimate: 0.9.

- \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \): High intelligence, puzzle-solving ability, and understanding of abstract concepts align well with this field. However, the strong empathy and love for animals are less directly relevant.
  - Likelihood estimate: 0.6.

- \( P(E|\text{business administration}) \): Appreciation for hard work and strong empathy align well, but curiosity about nature, love for animals, and puzzle-solving are less relevant.
  - Likelihood estimate: 0.3.

Now we calculate the posterior probabilities:

1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

2. Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.4}{P(E)} \]

3. Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.4}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for all terms in a relative comparison, we can ignore it and compare the numerators directly. Normalize them for clarity:

\[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) \propto 0.9 \cdot 0.2 = 0.18 \]
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) \propto 0.6 \cdot 0.4 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) \propto 0.3 \cdot 0.4 = 0.12 \]

To normalize these probabilities:

\[ \text{Sum} = 0.18 + 0.24 + 0.12 = 0.54 \]
\[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) = \frac{0.18}{0.54} \approx 0.33 \]
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.24}{0.54} \approx 0.44 \]
\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.54} \approx 0.22 \]

Thus, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.33,
  "computer science": 0.44,
  "business administration": 0.22
}
