To answer this question, we'll need to make some educated estimates about the various probabilities. Given the personality sketch of Adam and our hypotheses about his potential fields of study, we can use Bayes' rule:

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)}\]

P(H) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a certain field.
P(E|H) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in a certain field.
P(E|\neg H) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in that field.

Let's provide some reasoned estimates:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Based on Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, this field seems highly likely.
   - P(H) might be around 0.2 (given that there are many possible fields of study, but his interests align well with this one)
   - P(E|H) could be estimated at 0.8 (because Adam's traits fit well with this field)
   - P(E|\neg H) could be around 0.1 (most other fields of study would not align as perfectly with his description)

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which fits this field.
   - P(H) might be around 0.2 (given the popularity of computer science among graduate students)
   - P(E|H) could be 0.5 (his personality fits, but his love for nature and animals doesn't directly align)
   - P(E|\neg H) might be about 0.2 (computer science is a popular field but less aligned with all his traits)

3. **Business Administration**:
   - This field does not particularly align with his interests in nature, animals, and solving puzzles.
   - P(H) might be around 0.1 (business is common but not as fitting)
   - P(E|H) could be 0.2 (some intelligent and empathetic people fit this field, but not the nature aspect)
   - P(E|\neg H) could be around 0.3 (other fields might fit his personality better than business administration)

We need to estimate P(E), but we can treat it as a normalizing constant. Therefore, we can calculate P(H|E) as follows for proportionality:

\[
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \times P(H)
\]

So, let's compute:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[
   P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.2 = 0.16
   \]

2. **Computer Science**:
   \[
   P(H|E) \propto 0.5 \times 0.2 = 0.1
   \]

3. **Business Administration**:
   \[
   P(H|E) \propto 0.2 \times 0.1 = 0.02
   \]

Now, let's normalize these probabilities for proportionality:

Sum = \( 0.16 + 0.1 + 0.02 = 0.28 \)

Normalize:
\[
P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) = \frac{0.16}{0.28} \approx 0.57
\]
\[
P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.28} \approx 0.36
\]
\[
P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.28} \approx 0.07
\]

Here's the final answer in the required format:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.57,
  "computer science": 0.36,
  "business administration": 0.07
}
