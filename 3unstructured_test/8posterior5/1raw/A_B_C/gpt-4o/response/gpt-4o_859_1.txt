To compute the probabilities, we need to use Bayes' rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence given that the hypothesis is not true.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

Since \( P(E) \) can be estimated using the law of total probability, and we are more focused on comparing the relative values, we can simplify it for comparison as:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

We will evaluate each term qualitatively and assign them values:

1. **Computer Science**
   - \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam is studying Computer Science. Let's consider that Computer Science is a popular field, so we may assign it a moderate prior.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's characteristics (curiosity, intelligence) fit reasonably well with a Computer Science profile but less so compared to other fields.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The evidence could plausibly be found in many other fields, not just Computer Science, so this might be high.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam is studying Agricultural and Veterinary Science. This is less common than Computer Science but still plausible given his love for nature and animals.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The evidence strongly matches the characteristics expected from someone in this field.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Itâ€™s less likely that we'd see such evidence in students from unrelated fields.

3. **Business Administration**
   - \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam is studying Business Administration. This is also a common field, so we assign it a moderate prior.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The subject's warm heart and empathy can fit, but curiosity about nature and love for animals fit less with Business Administration.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Reasonably high, as many students in other fields can also show empathy and intelligence.

Let's assign the following values (these are rough and qualitative assignments):

- \( P(H) \) for all fields considered roughly equal for simplicity (though this may not be exact in the real world): \( 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Approximate it equally across fields for simplicity: \( 0.7 \)

Then:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{CS}})\cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|H_{\text{AVS}})\cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}}) + P(E|H_{\text{BA}})\cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) + \text{Other fields} \times P(\text{Other fields}) \]

### Computer Science:

- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(E) \approx 0.5 \times 0.1 + 1.0 \times 0.1 + 0.4 \times 0.1 + \ldots \approx 0.1 \)

So, 

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.5 \times 0.1 = 0.05 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

- \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) = 1.0 \)
- \( P(E) \approx 0.5 \times 0.1 + 1.0 \times 0.1 + 0.4 \times 0.1 + \ldots \approx 0.1 \)

So,

\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}}) = 1.0 \times 0.1 = 0.1 \]

### Business Administration:

- \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.4 \)
- \( P(E) \approx 0.5 \times 0.1 + 1.0 \times 0.1 + 0.4 \times 0.1 + \ldots \approx 0.1 \)

So,

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.4 \times 0.1 = 0.04 \]

Therefore, the relative probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.1,
  "business administration": 0.04
}
