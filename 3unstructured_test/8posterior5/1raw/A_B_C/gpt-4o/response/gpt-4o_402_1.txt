To solve this problem using Bayes' rule, let's break it down step by step for each field you mentioned:

1. **Business Administration**
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021. Given the generic distribution of graduate students, let's assume a low prior,
     \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

   - \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) if Adam was in business administration. Given that business administration typically doesn't emphasize nature, empathy towards animals, or curiosity about plants, let's assume a low probability,
     \( P(E|H) = 0.01 \).

   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) if Adam was not in business administration. Given the overall distribution and fitting interests, this may be relatively high, perhaps incorporating other similar fields, let's assume,
     \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

   Using Bayes' rule,
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} = \frac{0.01 \times 0.1}{0.01 \times 0.1 + 0.5 \times 0.9} = \frac{0.001}{0.001 + 0.45} = \frac{0.001}{0.451} \approx 0.0022
   \]

2. **Computer Science**
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Given the large number of students in this field, let's assume a moderate prior,
     \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

   - \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) if Adam was in computer science. An interest in puzzles and intelligence aligns somewhat with computer science, but the love for nature and animals might not be as common. Let’s assume,
     \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Similar to above,
     \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

   Using Bayes' rule,
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.1 \times 0.2 + 0.5 \times 0.8} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.4} = \frac{0.02}{0.42} \approx 0.0476
   \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This field is less common, so
     \( P(H) = 0.05 \).

   - \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) if Adam was in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his strong empathy, love for animals, and interest in plants, this fits closely, so let’s assume,
     \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).

   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Similar to above,
     \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

   Using Bayes' rule,
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} = \frac{0.9 \times 0.05}{0.9 \times 0.05 + 0.5 \times 0.95} = \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.475} = \frac{0.045}{0.52} \approx 0.0865
   \]

Combining these, we get:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0022,
  "computer science": 0.0476,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.0865
}
```
