Sure, let's go through each of the fields one by one.

### 1. Computer Science

#### Assessing probabilities:
- P(H): Prior probability of Adam being in computer science.
  - Computer science is a popular field, but without additional information, we will assume a moderate prior. 
  - Rough estimate: P(H) = 0.2

- P(E|H): Probability of E given that Adam is in computer science.
  - Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy do not directly align well with the stereotypical traits of a computer science student. However, high intelligence and problem-solving skills do align.
  - Rough estimate: P(E|H) = 0.3

- P(E|\neg H): Probability of E given that Adam is not in computer science.
  - These traits align more closely with fields such as agricultural and veterinary science, therefore moderately lower.
  - Rough estimate: P(E|\neg H) = 0.8

#### Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) = \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.3 \times 0.2) + (0.8 \times 0.8) = 0.06 + 0.64 = 0.7 \]

Hence:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{0.7} \approx 0.086 \]

### 2. Business Administration

#### Assessing probabilities:
- P(H): Prior probability of Adam being in business administration.
  - Another fairly common field but less likely for someone with Adam's traits.
  - Rough estimate: P(H) = 0.1

- P(E|H): Probability of E given that Adam is in business administration.
  - Traits such as empathy and dedication might fit but curiosity about nature and love for animals are less typical.
  - Rough estimate: P(E|H) = 0.2

- P(E|\neg H): Probability of E given that Adam is not in business administration.
  - Given his personality, other fields like veterinary science make more sense.
  - Rough estimate: P(E|\neg H) = 0.8

#### Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \times 0.1) + (0.8 \times 0.9) = 0.02 + 0.72 = 0.74 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{0.74} \approx 0.027 \]

### 3. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

#### Assessing probabilities:
- P(H): Prior probability of Adam being in agricultural and veterinary science.
  - A relatively less common but fitting field for Adam.
  - Rough estimate: P(H) = 0.05

- P(E|H): Probability of E given that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science.
  - Adam's love for nature and animals, empathy, and dedication align well.
  - Rough estimate: P(E|H) = 0.9

- P(E|\neg H): Probability of E given that Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science.
  - Less likely but still possible, estimated lower.
  - Rough estimate: P(E|\neg H) = 0.3

#### Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(E) = (0.9 \times 0.05) + (0.3 \times 0.95) = 0.045 + 0.285 = 0.33 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.05}{0.33} \approx 0.136 \]

So, the final results for P(H|E) for each field are:
