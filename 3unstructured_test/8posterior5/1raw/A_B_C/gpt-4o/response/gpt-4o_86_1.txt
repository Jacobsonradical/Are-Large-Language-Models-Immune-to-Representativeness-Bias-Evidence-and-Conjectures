Sure, let's use Bayes' rule to compute the probability of Adam being enrolled in each of the given fields of study based on the provided personality sketch. Bayes' rule is as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field. \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in that field. \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not enrolled in that field. Finally, \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.

Since \( P(E) \) is common across all hypotheses, we can ignore it for the relative comparison. Therefore, we can use:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Now let's proceed with the assumptions and calculations. We'll use qualitative reasoning to assign plausible probabilities.

For **Computer Science**:
- \( P(H) \): Computer Science is a common field, so let's assign a moderate prior, say \( P(H) \approx 0.15 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): While computer scientists may have high intelligence and enjoy solving puzzles, they are usually not specifically noted for an interest in nature, plants, and animals. So let’s assign a lower likelihood, perhaps \( P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Reasonably higher, given many other fields could align with this personality, let’s say \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.8 \).

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
- \( P(H) \): This is a less common field than computer science, so let's assign a lower prior, say \( P(H) \approx 0.05 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Strongly matches Adam’s interest in nature, plants, and animals. Thus, we assign a much higher likelihood, perhaps \( P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Lower, as fewer fields perfectly match the sketch, let’s say \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \).

For **Business Administration**:
- \( P(H) \): Business Administration is a common field, so let’s assign a moderate prior, perhaps \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Business students are typically not characterized by interests strongly aligned with nature, puzzle-solving, and animals. So let’s assign a lower likelihood, say \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Higher, given the alignment of the sketch with other fields, let’s set \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.9 \).

Using the relative comparison based on \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \):

- For Computer Science: \( P(H|E) \propto 0.2 \times 0.15 = 0.03 \)
- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( P(H|E) \propto 0.9 \times 0.05 = 0.045 \)
- For Business Administration: \( P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.1 = 0.01 \)

Normalizing these values to get the approximate probabilities:

- Total \( \propto 0.03 + 0.045 + 0.01 = 0.085 \)

Relative probabilities:

- Computer Science: \( \frac{0.03}{0.085} \approx 0.35 \)
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( \frac{0.045}{0.085} \approx 0.53 \)
- Business Administration: \( \frac{0.01}{0.085} \approx 0.12 \)

Therefore, the computed probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": "0.35",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.53",
  "business administration": "0.12"
