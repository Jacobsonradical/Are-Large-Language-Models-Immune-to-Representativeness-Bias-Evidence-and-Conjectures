We'll use Bayes' rule to find the probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch of Adam \( E \).

Bayes' rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of the evidence \( E \) given the negation of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence \( E \), which can be derived from the law of total probability.

Since the probabilities provided will be subjective and not based on empirical data, we will make educated guesses for illustrative purposes.

Let's evaluate the fields:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - \( P(H) \): It's relatively uncommon but not rare for graduate students. Let's estimate it at 0.1.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, it's very high. Let's estimate it at 0.8.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Without this specific field, the probability is lower but not zero. Let's estimate it at 0.2.

2. **Computer Science**
   - \( P(H) \): Computer Science is a very common field. Let's estimate it at 0.3.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's love for puzzles and abstract concepts, it’s reasonably high. Let's estimate it at 0.5.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Without this specific field, the probability that Adam fits the personality sketch remains. Let's estimate it at 0.3.

3. **Business Administration**
   - \( P(H) \): Business Administration is also quite common for graduate students. Let's estimate it at 0.3.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's personality sketch, it’s less likely that Business Administration fits as well. Let's estimate it at 0.2.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Without this specific field, the probability will be the same as the baseline. Let's estimate it at 0.3.

Next, calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
For simplicity, let \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) \).

Now let's calculate the final probabilities for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - \( P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) = 0.08 + 0.18 = 0.26 \)
   - \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.26} \approx 0.3077 \)

2. **Computer Science**
   - \( P(E) = (0.5 \cdot 0.3) + (0.3 \cdot 0.7) = 0.15 + 0.21 = 0.36 \)
   - \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.3}{0.36} \approx 0.4167 \)

3. **Business Administration**
   - \( P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.3) + (0.3 \cdot 0.7) = 0.06 + 0.21 = 0.27 \)
   - \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{0.27} \approx 0.2222 \)

So the estimated probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3077,
  "computer science": 0.4167,
  "business administration": 0.2222
