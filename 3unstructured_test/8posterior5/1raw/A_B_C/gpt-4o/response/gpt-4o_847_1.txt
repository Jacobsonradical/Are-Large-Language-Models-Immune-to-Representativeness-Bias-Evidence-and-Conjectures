To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we first need to calculate \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each hypothesis. Bayes' Rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant that can be ignored when comparing relative probabilities. We just need the proportional values, which allows us to compare the different fields.

Let's set some rough estimates for these probabilities:

1. **Computer Science**:
    - \( P(H) \): Let's assume a moderate prior, given that computer science is a popular field.
      \( P(H) = 0.2 \)
    - \( P(E|H) \): The description of Adam does not strongly suggest a relationship with computer science, though his intelligence and abstract thinking might suggest some alignment.
      \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \)
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): If Adam is not a computer science student, given the multitude of other fields, the probability of finding his traits is moderate.
      \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \)

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - \( P(H) \): Let's assume a lower prior compared to computer science but still significant.
      \( P(H) = 0.1 \)
    - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science.
      \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \)
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): If Adam is not in this field, the probability of his traits fitting other fields is lower but possible.
      \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \)

3. **Business Administration**:
    - \( P(H) \): Given that business administration is a common field, assume a moderate prior.
      \( P(H) = 0.2 \)
    - \( P(E|H) \): The traits described do not particularly align with business administration.
      \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \)
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): If Adam is not in this field, traits aligning with other fields is more probable.
      \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.7 \)

Now, using Bayes' Rule without normalization, we compute:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Relative probabilities:

1. **Computer Science**:
    \[
    P(H|E) \propto 0.3 \times 0.2 = 0.06
    \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    \[
    P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08
    \]

3. **Business Administration**:
    \[
    P(H|E) \propto 0.2 \times 0.2 = 0.04
    \]

To make them more interpretable, let's find a relative scale. We have unnormalized probabilities \( 0.06, 0.08, \) and \( 0.04 \).

Normalized (summing to 1 for better interpretation):
- Total = 0.06 + 0.08 + 0.04 = 0.18

Normalized probabilities:

1. **Computer Science**: \( \frac{0.06}{0.18} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.33 \)
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: \( \frac{0.08}{0.18} \approx 0.44 \)
3. **Business Administration**: \( \frac{0.04}{0.18} \approx 0.22 \)

Thus, the relative probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": 0.33,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.44,
  "business administration": 0.22
