Let's start by estimating the probabilities for each field:

1. **Business Administration**

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration is relatively low because his personality sketch doesn't particularly fit the typical characteristics of someone in that field. Let's estimate it at 0.1.
- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's characteristics given that he is in business administration is also low. Let's set this to 0.2 because business administration students typically are more focused on leadership, management, and financial skills than on nature and animals.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's characteristics given that he is not in business administration is relatively high because his traits fit other fields better. Let's estimate this at 0.8.

Applying Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(H) \cdot P(E|H)}{P(E)} \]
We need to use the normalization constant \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(H) \cdot P(E|H) + P(\neg H) \cdot P(E|\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.9 \cdot 0.8 = 0.02 + 0.72 = 0.74 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.74} = \frac{0.02}{0.74} \approx 0.027 \]

2. **Computer Science**

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science is somewhat moderate. Let's set this to 0.3 because computer science often involves problem-solving and abstract thinking, which Adam is good at.
- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's characteristics given that he is in computer science is moderate. Let's set this to 0.5 as some computer science students may also have broad interests and empathy, but it’s not overwhelmingly typical.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's characteristics given that he is not in computer science is relatively high. Let's estimate this at 0.7 because his interests align well with multiple other fields.
\[ P(E) = 0.3 \cdot 0.5 + 0.7 \cdot 0.7 = 0.15 + 0.49 = 0.64 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.5}{0.64} = \frac{0.15}{0.64} \approx 0.234 \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is relatively high given his interests. Let's set this to 0.4.
- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's characteristics given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science is very high. Let's set this to 0.9 because his traits align very well with this field.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's characteristics given that he is not in agricultural and veterinary science is relatively lower than the previous cases. Let’s set this at 0.5 because there's a notable contrast to other fields.
\[ P(E) = 0.4 \cdot 0.9 + 0.6 \cdot 0.5 = 0.36 + 0.3 = 0.66 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.9}{0.66} = \frac{0.36}{0.66} \approx 0.545 \]

Based on the above calculations, we have:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.027,
  "computer science": 0.234,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.545
}
