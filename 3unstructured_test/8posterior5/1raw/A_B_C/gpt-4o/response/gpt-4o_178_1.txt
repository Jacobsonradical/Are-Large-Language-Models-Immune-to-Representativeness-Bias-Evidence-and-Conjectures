To solve this, let's break down each step carefully. First, we need to judge \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field. We will then use Bayes' Rule to compute \( P(H|E) \).

### Given Information:
- \( E \): Personality sketch of Adam
- \( H \): Hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in a specific field (we'll evaluate for computer science, business administration, agricultural and veterinary science)
- \( \neg H \): Adam was not enrolled in that specific field

### Steps:
1. **Prior Probability (\( P(H) \))**:
   - This represents the general likelihood of any random graduate student being enrolled in a given field.
   - For simplicity, let’s assume a rough distribution:
     - \( P(H)_{\text{computer science}} = 0.2 \)
     - \( P(H)_{\text{business administration}} = 0.2 \)
     - \( P(H)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} = 0.1 \)
   - Note: These values are rough approximations. Adjust if more specific data is available.

2. **Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \))**:
   - This represents the probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given Adam is in a certain field.
   - Based on the sketch, Adam is likely to be in a field where curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and intelligence in abstract concepts are valued.
     - For computer science: High intelligence and problem-solving skills fit. \(P(E|H) \approx 0.3\)
     - For business administration: Less emphasis on nature and animal love, empathy can be valued. \(P(E|H) \approx 0.1\)
     - For agricultural and veterinary science: Strong alignment with nature curiosity, animal love, empathy, and dedication. \(P(E|H) \approx 0.7\)

3. **Marginal Likelihood (\( P(E|\neg H) \))**:
   - This is the probability of the sketch \( E \) given Adam is not in the specific field, which involves summing up the contributions from all other fields.
   - Let’s assume an average case for simplicity and uniform distribution:
     - \(P(E|\neg \text{computer science}) \approx 0.15\)
     - \(P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) \approx 0.3\)
     - \(P(E|\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.2\)

4. **Apply Bayes' Rule**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))}
   \]

### Calculation:
1. **Computer Science**:
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{0.3 \times 0.2 + 0.15 \times 0.8} = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.12} = \frac{0.06}{0.18} \approx 0.333
   \]

2. **Business Administration**:
   \[
   P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.1 \times 0.2 + 0.3 \times 0.8} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.24} = \frac{0.02}{0.26} \approx 0.077
   \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[
   P(\text{AgVet}|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.1}{0.7 \times 0.1 + 0.2 \times 0.9} = \frac{0.07}{0.07 + 0.18} = \frac{0.07}{0.25} \approx 0.28
   \]

### Results:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.333,
  "business administration": 0.077,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.28
}
```
This gives us the probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each of the specified fields based on the given personality sketch.
