To calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Here, \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each specific field, \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is in that field, and \( P(E|\neg H) \) represents the probability of the personality sketch given that he is not in that field. Given the information provided, let's assess these probabilities intuitively:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - \( P(H) \): This field is somewhat related to Adam's interests in nature, plants, and animals, so let's assign moderate prior probability.
   - \( P(E|H) \): High, since Adam's personality aligns well with this field.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Moderate, as there are other fields he might fit into but not as perfectly.

2. **Business Administration**
   - \( P(H) \): Lower prior probability since Adam's personality sketch does not strongly align with typical characteristics associated with business fields.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Low, because business administration doesn't match well with his interests and characteristics.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Moderate to high, since many other fields could match better.

3. **Computer Science**
   - \( P(H) \): Moderate prior probability, as Adam has high intelligence and likes solving puzzles, but no direct indication of computer science interests.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Moderate, his problem-solving skills and intelligence can apply here, but there's no direct indication of interest in technology or computing.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Moderate, as multiple other fields might match well too.

Based on these evaluations, we can use Bayes' rule to find \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(H) \cdot P(E|H). \]

Given these qualitative assessments, we assign these values:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.20
}
```

These values indicate that Adam is most likely enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, less likely in Computer Science, and least likely in Business Administration.
