To determine the probabilities \( P(H|E) \), we need to apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing E given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing E given that Adam is not enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of observing E in general.

For simplicity, let's assume \( P(H) \) for each field is relatively uniform, acknowledging that these figures would usually be informed by specific data from the graduate program admissions.

Now let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) based on the fit of Adam's traits with each field:

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): The prior likelihood of a student enrolling in Business Administration is moderately high, let's assume it at 0.2.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability that Adam, with his described traits, is found in Business Administration. Traits like love for nature and animals, empathy, and puzzle-solving do not strongly fit, so we might assign a lower value, like 0.1.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) for Business Administration is higher, say 0.3, because other fields might match Adam better. This would indicate that it’s less surprising to find someone like Adam outside Business Administration.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): Given Adam's interests, the prior likelihood in Agricultural and Veterinary Science should be higher. Let's assume it at 0.1.
- \( P(E|H) \): Given his traits (love for nature, empathy for animals, etc.), there's a high fit, so we can set this to something high like 0.8.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood for Agricultural and Veterinary Science if Adam isn’t in it could be lower, about 0.3.

### Computer Science
- \( P(H) \): The baseline likelihood for Computer Science can be moderate. Let’s assume it at 0.2.
- \( P(E|H) \): Even though Adam is intelligent and good at abstract concepts (which could fit Computer Science), some of his other traits aren’t a direct match (like empathy and nature). Set this at 0.3.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given that Adam’s traits are somewhat non-CS as well, this could be higher, again about 0.3.

Using these estimates, let's calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, assume \( P(E) \) is relatively uniform and focus on relative comparisons.

### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.3 \cdot 0.2 = 0.06 \]

Normalizing these values so we compare within this set of fields (not a complete normalization with other fields), we get:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

These values indicate the relative likelihood among these fields that Adam is enrolled in based on the given personality sketch E.
