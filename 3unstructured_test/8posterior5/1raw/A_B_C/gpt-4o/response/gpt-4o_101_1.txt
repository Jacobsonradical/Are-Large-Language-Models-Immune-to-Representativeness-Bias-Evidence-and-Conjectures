To compute the probability \(P(H|E)\) that Adam was enrolled in each field given his personality sketch (E), we apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here's an approach to estimating these probabilities based on the provided sketch and relevant priors:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - **P(H) (Prior Probability):** Moderate, as computer science is a common graduate field.
   - **P(E|H):** Low to moderate, since Adam's interests and personality traits match only loosely (interest in abstract concepts fits).
   - **P(E|\neg H):** Moderate to high, many other fields might fit his profile better.

2. **Business Administration:**
   - **P(H) (Prior Probability):** Moderate, as business administration is also a common graduate field.
   - **P(E|H):** Low, Adam's traits and interests (e.g. nature, warm heart, puzzles) don't closely align with typical business administration traits.
   - **P(E|\neg H):** High, since many other fields align more closely with his traits.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - **P(H) (Prior Probability):** Lower than some other fields, but relevant due to his love for nature and animals.
   - **P(E|H):** High, as Adamâ€™s personality traits (interest in nature, animals, empathy) align very well with this field.
   - **P(E|\neg H):** Lower, since other fields may not align as closely.

Using these qualitative estimates, we calculate:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Let's assign some plausible, simplified values (not exact but for illustrative purposes):

### Computer Science
- \(P(H) = 0.2\)
- \(P(E|H) = 0.3\)
- \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.7\)

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.3 = 0.06 \]

### Business Administration
- \(P(H) = 0.2\)
- \(P(E|H) = 0.1\)
- \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.9\)

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.1 = 0.02 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \(P(H) = 0.1\)
- \(P(E|H) = 0.8\)
- \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.2\)

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.8 = 0.08 \]

Since we only need to compare these values relatively to estimate \(P(H|E)\):

{
  "computer science": 0.06,
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08
