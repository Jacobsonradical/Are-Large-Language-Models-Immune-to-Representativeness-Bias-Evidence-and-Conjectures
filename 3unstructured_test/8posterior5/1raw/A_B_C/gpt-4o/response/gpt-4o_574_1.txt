Let's start by defining some key terms to help us calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in the specific field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in the specific field.
- \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in the specific field given the personality sketch \( E \).

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Since \( P(E) \) is constant across fields when computing relative probabilities, we can focus on \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

### Analysis for Each Field

#### 1. Computer Science
- **\( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \)**: Let's assume the base rate of students enrolling in computer science is relatively high, so we might set this prior at **0.3**.
- **\( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \)**: Quietness, solving puzzles, and high intelligence align with typical traits for computer science students, but nature and animal empathy are less relevant. Let's estimate this at **0.2**.
- **\( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \)**: This is the probability of the personality sketch given non-computer science enrollment. It could be more common in other fields that focus on nature, empathy, or animals. Let's assume this is higher at **0.7**.

Using the rough estimates:
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) \propto 0.2 \times 0.3 = 0.06 \]

#### 2. Business Administration
- **\( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \)**: The base rate for business administration might be lower in general for someone with Adam's described traits. Let's set this at **0.2**.
- **\( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \)**: Adam’s traits don't match typical business administration profiles. Let's estimate this at **0.1**.
- **\( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \)**: It is likely higher for fields outside business administration. Let's assume this is **0.6**.

Using the rough estimates:
\[ P(\text{BA}|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02 \]

#### 3. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **\( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \)**: The base rate here might be lower than computer science but relevant given Adam’s traits. Let’s set this at **0.1**.
- **\( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \)**: High match due to his love for nature, plants, and animals as well as his warm heart and empathy. Let’s estimate this at **0.8**.
- **\( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \)**: Lower since these traits might not align as well with most other fields. Let's assume this is **0.5**.

Using the rough estimates:
\[ P(\text{AVS}|E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \]

### Normalizing the Values
To compare relative probabilities:
\[ \begin{aligned}
  \text{CS:} & \quad 0.06 \\
	\text{BA:} & \quad 0.02 \\
  \text{AVS:} & \quad 0.08 \\
\end{aligned} \]

The sum is \( 0.06 + 0.02 + 0.08 = 0.16 \), so we scale each:

\[ P(\text{CS}|E) \approx \frac{0.06}{0.16} = 0.375 \]
\[ P(\text{BA}|E) \approx \frac{0.02}{0.16} = 0.125 \]
\[ P(\text{AVS}|E) \approx \frac{0.08}{0.16} = 0.5 \]
