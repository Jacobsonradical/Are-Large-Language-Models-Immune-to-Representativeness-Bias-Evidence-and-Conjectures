To compute P(H|E) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need prior probabilities (P(H)), the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis (P(E|H)), and the likelihood of the evidence given that the hypothesis is false (P(E|¬H)).

Here's how to structure the calculation:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, P(E) (the total probability of the evidence) can be complex to calculate exactly without knowing the probabilities of other fields. Instead, we'll focus on comparing the relative values.

Let's assign some rough estimates for the probabilities step-by-step:

1. **Prior probabilities (P(H)):**
   - These are rough guesses based on the popularity of the fields in graduate studies.
   ```
   P(business administration) = 0.3
   P(agricultural and veterinary science) = 0.1
   P(computer science) = 0.3
   ```

2. **Likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis (P(E|H)):**
   - These estimate how well Adam's description fits the typical characteristics of students in each field.
   ```
   P(E | business administration) = 0.1 (low, because Adam's traits don't strongly suggest business administration)
   P(E | agricultural and veterinary science) = 0.6 (high, aligns with Adam's love for nature and animals)
   P(E | computer science) = 0.4 (moderate, problem-solving skills and intelligence fit well, but no strong nature interest)
   ```

3. **Likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis is false (P(E|¬H)):**
   - These are rough approximations based on average graduate students not in these specific fields.
   ```
   P(E | ¬business administration) = 0.4 (general traits among various other fields)
   P(E | ¬agricultural and veterinary science) = 0.2 (fewer fields fit his nature interests)
   P(E | ¬computer science) = 0.4 (many fields have people who are intelligent and good at problem-solving)
   ```

4. **Compute P(H|E):**
   - Using Bayes' rule for each field.
   ```
   P(business administration | E) ∝ P(E | business administration) * P(business administration) 
                                 ≈ 0.1 * 0.3 = 0.03
   ```

   ```
   P(agricultural and veterinary science | E) ∝ P(E | agricultural and veterinary science) * P(agricultural and veterinary science)
                                              ≈ 0.6 * 0.1 = 0.06
   ```

   ```
   P(computer science | E) ∝ P(E | computer science) * P(computer science)
                           ≈ 0.4 * 0.3 = 0.12
   ```

These proportions are relative. To normalize them, we'll make it simple by scaling them so they sum up to the ratio:
```
Total = 0.03 + 0.06 + 0.12 = 0.21

P(business administration | E) ≈ 0.03 / 0.21 ≈ 0.143
P(agricultural and veterinary science | E) ≈ 0.06 / 0.21 ≈ 0.286
P(computer science | E) ≈ 0.12 / 0.21 ≈ 0.571
```
Now, let's provide the formatted answer:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.143,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.286,
  "computer science": 0.571
}
```
