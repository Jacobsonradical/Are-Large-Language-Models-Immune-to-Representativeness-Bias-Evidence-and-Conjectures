To calculate the probability of Adam being enrolled in each field given his personality sketch, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem is expressed as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability of hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence \( E \).

Since we are comparing across three fields, we will estimate relative values for each of the terms involved.

1. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): There are generally many graduate students in computer science, so let's assume a relatively high prior (say 0.2).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's interest in puzzles and high intelligence, but less direct link to nature, let's assume a medium likelihood (say 0.3).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Relatively medium, there's a diverse population in grad studies (and puzzles/intelligence can fit elsewhere too) (say 0.6).

   Bayes formula for computer science can be:
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

2. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): Many students in business, but Adam's profile suggests less alignment with typical business skills/interests (say 0.1).
   - \( P(E|H) \): His interests (nature, empathy, animals) are less common in business school, so low (say 0.1).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Students with Adam's traits more likely outside business administration (say 0.8).

   Bayes formula for business administration can be:
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Fewer students compared to CS/business, but highly aligned with Adam’s profile (say 0.08).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's sketch fits well, so high likelihood (say 0.9).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Less likely because his specific traits (curiosity, empathy, love for animals) align strongly (say 0.3).

   Bayes formula for agricultural and veterinary science can be:
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.08}{P(E)} \]

Since we're using relative proportions, we needn't strictly resolve \( P(E) \), as it normalizes the relative values. Let’s assemble the conditional probabilities:

\[
\text{computer science}: \; P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = 0.06/P(E)
\]
\[
\text{business administration}: \; P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = 0.01/P(E)
\]
\[
\text{agricultural and veterinary science}: \; P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.08}{P(E)} = 0.072/P(E)
\]

Since \(P(E)\) is common and can be factored out when normalizing, we compare:

- Computer science: 0.06
- Business administration: 0.01
- Agricultural and veterinary science: 0.072

Normalizing these:

{
  "computer science": 0.06 / (0.06 + 0.01 + 0.072) ≈ 0.38,
  "business administration": 0.01 / (0.06 + 0.01 + 0.072) ≈ 0.06,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.072 / (0.06 + 0.01 + 0.072) ≈ 0.56
}

Here's our comparative answers:

{
  "computer science": 0.38,
  "business administration": 0.06,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.56
}
