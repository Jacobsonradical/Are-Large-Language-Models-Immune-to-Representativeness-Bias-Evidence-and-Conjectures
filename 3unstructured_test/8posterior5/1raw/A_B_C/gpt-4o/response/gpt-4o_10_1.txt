To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each of the fields using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate \( P(H) \) (the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field), \( P(E|H) \) (the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in that field), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) (the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in that field).

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, we can assume that \( P(E) \) is constant across fields and focus on estimating the relative values of \( P(H|E) \).

### Given Estimates:
- **Curiosity about nature**: relevant for agricultural and veterinary science.
- **Solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts**: relevant for computer science and less so for business administration.
- **Warm heart, empathy, love for animals**: highly relevant for agricultural and veterinary science.
- **High intelligence**: relevant for all three fields.
- **Appreciation for hard work and dedication**: relevant for all three fields.

### Assumptions:
1. **P(H)**:
   - Computer Science: likely common among graduate students.
   - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: less common but still present.
   - Business Administration: also common among graduate students.

2. **P(E|H)**:
   - Computer Science: moderate (interests in solving puzzles and abstract thinking).
   - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: high (strong alignment with nature, animals, empathy).
   - Business Administration: low to moderate (intelligence and hard work are relevant but less so the other traits).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**:
   - Relatively equal across fields to simplify (let's assume P(E|Â¬H) = 0.4).

### Estimations:

- **Computer Science**:
  - \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \)
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.5 \)
  
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  - \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \)
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \)
  
- **Business Administration**:
  - \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \)
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \)

Now, compute \( P(H|E) \):

- **Computer Science**:
  \[
  P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.3}{0.4} = \frac{0.15}{0.4} \approx 0.375
  \]

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  \[
  P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.4} = \frac{0.08}{0.4} = 0.2
  \]

- **Business Administration**:
  \[
  P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.3}{0.4} = \frac{0.09}{0.4} \approx 0.225
  \]

### Final Answers:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.375,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.225
}
