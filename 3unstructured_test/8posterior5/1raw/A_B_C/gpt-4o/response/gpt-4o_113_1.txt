To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of Adam being in each field given his personality sketch. Bayes' theorem is formulated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence, and it can be determined by summing all \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for all hypotheses.

However, for simplicity, we'll compare the relative likelihoods because evaluating the exact prior probabilities without specific data can be arbitrary. We will use relative likelihoods based on the available information.

Here are our initial judgments for each field based on the sketch:
- **Computer Science:**
  - \( P(H) \): Let's assign a moderate prior probability since many students in the U.S. study computer science.
  - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence fits somewhat well, but the empathy and love for animals is less aligned.
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Relatively lower compared to \( P(E|H) \) since computer science students may not all share Adam's specific interests.

- **Business Administration:**
  - \( P(H) \): Another common field, so we assign a moderate prior probability.
  - \( P(E|H) \): Less fitting compared to computer science; business administration may not align as well with his love for animals and nature.
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Higher since many business students might not share Adam's profile.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
  - \( P(H) \): Likely lower in general compared to computer science but fits Adamâ€™s interests well.
  - \( P(E|H) \): Very high, as this field aligns perfectly with his love for nature, animals, and empathy.
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Much lower because other fields less likely exhibit this specific passion set.

Now, we will compute relative probabilities assuming \( P(E) \) normalizes the results to comparisons between fields:

{ 
  "computer science": \( P(H) = 0.3 \), \( P(E|H) = 0.6 \),
  "business administration": \( P(H) = 0.3 \), \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( P(H) = 0.1 \), \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \)
}

Compute relative \( P(H|E) \):

- **Computer Science:** 
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.3 \cdot 0.6 = 0.18 \]

- **Business Administration:**
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.3 \cdot 0.2 = 0.06 \]

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.9 = 0.09 \]

Now normalize these values so that their sum totals to 1 relative to these fields:

\[ Total = 0.18 + 0.06 + 0.09 = 0.33 \]

Finally:

{ 
  "computer science": \(\frac{0.18}{0.33} \approx 0.545 \),
  "business administration": \(\frac{0.06}{0.33} \approx 0.182 \),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \(\frac{0.09}{0.33} \approx 0.273 \)
}

Thus, the computed chances are:

{
  "computer science": 0.545,
  "business administration": 0.182,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.273
}
