To calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need the following components for each hypothesis \( H \):

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in the field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in the field.

Finally, we will use Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we only need to compare the relative probabilities and we don't calculate \( P(E) \) exactly, we assess the relative scores for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \), then use these to form an intuition for the relative \( P(H|E) \).

Here's the assessment:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science. Given the general popularity of computer science, let's set this to 0.3.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam has an appreciation for hard work, intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts, which fits well with computer science. Assume a value of 0.5.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): For those not in computer science but fitting Adam's personality profile, assume an average value of 0.2.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.3}{0.2} \approx 0.75 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This field is less common than computer science but relevant to Adam's love for nature and animals. Assign a value of 0.15.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Due to the strong alignment with his love for nature, empathy for animals, and hard work, let's set this to 0.7.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): For those not in this field but with similar personality traits, assume a lower value of 0.1.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.15}{0.1} \approx 1.05 \]

3. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration. Given it's a popular field for graduate students, assume a value of 0.25.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's profile doesn't directly align with typical business administration traits (less focus on empathy/nature). Assume a value of 0.2.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): For non-business students fitting Adam's profile, assume a value of 0.3.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \approx 0.167 \]

Hence, the relative probabilities are approximated as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.75,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 1.05,
  "business administration": 0.167
}
```
