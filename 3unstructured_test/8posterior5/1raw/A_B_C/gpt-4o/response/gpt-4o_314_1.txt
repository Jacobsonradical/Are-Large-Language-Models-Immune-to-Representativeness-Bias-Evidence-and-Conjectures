To estimate the values for \( P(H), P(E|H), \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field and then compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to make some educated assumptions. Let's make these estimations based on Adam's personality sketch.

### Computer Science:
- **P(H)**: Let's assume the base rate of graduate students in computer science is about 0.2 (20%).
- **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's curiosity, high intelligence, and good understanding of abstract concepts, he could be well-suited for computer science. However, traits like empathy, warm heart, and love for nature suggest he might be less inclined. Let's say \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Given how specific Adam’s traits are, we might say most students who are not in computer science but share Adam’s traits might be about 0.6 (60% likelihood). \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \).

### Business Administration:
- **P(H)**: Let's assume the base rate of graduate students in business administration is about 0.1 (10%).
- **P(E|H)**: Adam's traits such as empathy and understanding of hard work might contribute positively. However, interests in nature and animals are less aligned. Let's say \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Similar to the non-CS field distribution, those with Adam's traits but not in business admin might be about 0.7. \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.7 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- **P(H)**: Let's assume the base rate of students in agricultural and veterinary science is about 0.05 (5%).
- **P(E|H)**: Adam’s empathy, love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work are perfectly aligned. Let's say \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Considering people not in this field but having Adam’s traits could be about 0.5 (50% likelihood). \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

Now we apply Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

For each hypothesis:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

### Computer Science:
\[
P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.2 + 0.6 \cdot 0.8 = 0.04 + 0.48 = 0.52
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.52} = \frac{0.04}{0.52} \approx 0.077
\]

### Business Administration:
\[
P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.1 + 0.7 \cdot 0.9 = 0.01 + 0.63 = 0.64
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.64} = \frac{0.01}{0.64} \approx 0.0156
\]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[
P(E) = 0.9 \cdot 0.05 + 0.5 \cdot 0.95 = 0.045 + 0.475 = 0.52
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.52} = \frac{0.045}{0.52} \approx 0.0865
\]

Thus, we can summarize the probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.077,
  "business administration": 0.0156,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.0865
}
```
