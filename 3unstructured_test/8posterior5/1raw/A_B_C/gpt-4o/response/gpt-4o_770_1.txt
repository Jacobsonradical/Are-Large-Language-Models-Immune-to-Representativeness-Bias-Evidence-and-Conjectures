To apply Bayes' Theorem and calculate the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study based on the given personality sketch E, we need to evaluate the initial probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the complementary likelihoods \( P(E|\neg H) \). Here's how we can approach it:

1. **Priori probability, \( P(H) \)**: This is the initial probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field without any further information. Let’s assume equal initial probabilities for simplicity, as there is no prior information provided about the distribution of his likelihood to be in any of these fields:
   - \( P(H_{cs}) = P(H_{avs}) = P(H_{ba}) \approx \frac{1}{N} \), where \( N \) is the total number of possible fields.

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam’s personality traits, we can evaluate how likely it is that he fits into each field.
   - For **computer science**: Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts fit well with the field of computer science. However, the strong empathy and love for nature/animals don't align perfectly.
   - For **agricultural and veterinary science**: Adam’s genuine curiosity about nature, love for plants, animals, and empathy aligns very well with this field.
   - For **business administration**: Some traits like high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts align somewhat, but love for animals and curiosity about nature don’t fit strongly.

3. **Complementary likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is more complex and involves evaluating the likelihood of E given Adam is not in the specified field. It captures the probability of having those traits across all other fields, which is tricky but let’s assume it’s relatively constant since we lack specific distribution data for these traits across all fields.

4. Compute posterior probability, \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes’ Rule:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]

Given the complexity and some simplifying assumptions:
\[
P(E) = P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs}) + P(E|H_{avs}) \cdot P(H_{avs}) + P(E|H_{ba}) \cdot P(H_{ba}) + ...
\]

Let's assign reasonable estimates to help derive the final probabilities. 

* Let’s assume:
  * Initial probabilities \( P(H_{cs}) = P(H_{avs}) = P(H_{ba}) = 0.1\) for illustration (assuming 10 possible fields in total).
  * Updated likelihood based on traits: \( P(E|H_{cs}) = 0.4 \); \( P(E|H_{avs}) = 0.8 \); \( P(E|H_{ba}) = 0.2 \).
  * Given the complementary likelihood across other fields \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \).

Using Bayes’ theorem roughly without exact division:

{
  "computer science": \( \frac{0.4*0.1}{0.5} \approx 0.08 \),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{0.8*0.1}{0.5} \approx 0.16 \),
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.2*0.1}{0.5} \approx 0.04 \)
}

Given values are illustrative, rounding for normalization would yield:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.25,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.125
}
```
