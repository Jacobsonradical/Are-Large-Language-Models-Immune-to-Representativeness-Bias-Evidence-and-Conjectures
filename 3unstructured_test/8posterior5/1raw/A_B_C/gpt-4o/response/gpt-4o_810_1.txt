To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to identify and calculate the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). Here's how we can reason through each field for Adam:

1. **Business Administration**
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
3. **Computer Science**

### Business Administration

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that any random graduate student is studying business administration. Let's assume this to be moderate, say 0.2.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in business administration. His curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy don't fit the common profile for a business student, so this is likely low, say 0.1.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in business administration. Since his traits align more with other fields, this would be relatively high, say 0.9.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Since \( P(E) \) is the same for all hypotheses, it cancels out in comparative calculations:
\[ P(H|E)_{business} \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that any graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. Assume this to be moderate, around 0.15.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adamâ€™s personality sketch given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science. This fits Adam well, so we might rate it high, say 0.8.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality if he is not in this field. Given his traits do fit well, this might be moderate, say 0.4.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \times 0.15 = 0.12 \]

### Computer Science

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of any graduate student being in computer science. This is likely high, say 0.3, due to popularity.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in computer science. Some traits align (problem-solving and high intelligence), so moderate, say 0.5.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality if he is not in computer science, around 0.5.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.5 \times 0.3 = 0.15 \]

### Summary

Here are the computed posterior probabilities normalized:

\[ P_{total} = 0.02 + 0.12 + 0.15 = 0.29 \]

Normalized values:
\[ P(H|E)_{business} = \frac{0.02}{0.29} \approx 0.07 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{agriculture} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.41 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{computer} = \frac{0.15}{0.29} \approx 0.52 \]

Thus, the probabilities in the desired format are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.07,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.41,
  "computer science": 0.52
}
