To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in a given field of study based on the personality sketch provided, we can use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given the field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch.

Since \( P(E) \) is constant for all fields and we are comparing relative probabilities, we can primarily focus on \( P(H) \) and \( P(E|H) \).

### Assuming Values
1. **Prior probabilities \( P(H) \)**: These reflect how common each field is among all graduate students. Let's assume:
   - Computer Science: 0.25 (25%)
   - Business Administration: 0.2 (20%)
   - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.1 (10%)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: These reflect how well the personality sketch fits with a typical student in each field.
   - Computer Science: Given Adam's high intelligence, abstract thinking, and puzzle-solving skills, but less focus on nature and animals, \( P(E|H) \) might be 0.5.
   - Business Administration: Given warm heart and empathy, but less relevance to the curiosity about nature and animals, \( P(E|H) \) might be 0.3.
   - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Given the strong fit with the curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy, \( P(E|H) \) might be 0.9.

### Calculation Using Bayes' Rule

We need to calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \):

\[
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H)P(H)
\]

### Relative Probabilities
- For Computer Science:
  \[
  P(H|E)_{CS} \propto 0.5 \times 0.25 = 0.125
  \]

- For Business Administration:
  \[
  P(H|E)_{BA} \propto 0.3 \times 0.2 = 0.06
  \]

- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
  \[
  P(H|E)_{AV} \propto 0.9 \times 0.1 = 0.09
  \]

### Normalize (optional, but correcting for comparison):
We'll provide values relative to these proportions.

\[
\text{Total} = 0.125 + 0.06 + 0.09 = 0.275
\]

\{
  "computer science": \( \frac{0.125}{0.275} \approx 0.454 \),
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.06}{0.275} \approx 0.218 \),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{0.09}{0.275} \approx 0.327 \)
\}

### Summary
The probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field, given the personality sketch are approximately:

\{
  "computer science": 0.454,
  "business administration": 0.218,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.327
\}
