Sure, let's use Bayes' rule to estimate the probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields based on his personality sketch E.

Bayes' Rule is stated as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) * P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, for this problem, the exact values of the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) are not given and are instead estimated based on the provided personality sketch and reasonable assumptions.

For each given field:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): Probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration.
     (Assume a general prior, e.g., 0.1)
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): Probability of having E given that Adam was in Business Administration.
     (Given his personality, interest in nature, animals, and puzzles, this seems less likely, e.g., 0.01)
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \): Probability of having E given that Adam was not in Business Administration.
     (Since E fits better with other fields, this value might not be much higher than above. Assume, e.g., 0.05)

2. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): Probability that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science.
     (Assume a general prior, e.g., 0.1)
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): Probability of having E given that Adam was in Computer Science.
     (Given his intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts, this seems somewhat likely, e.g., 0.3)
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \): Probability of having E given that Adam was not in Computer Science.
     (Assuming his personality fits more the other field better. Assume, e.g., 0.2)

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \): Probability that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
     (Assume a general prior, e.g., 0.05)
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \): Probability of having E given that Adam was in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
     (Given his love for animals, nature, and empathy, this is highly likely, e.g., 0.7)
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \): Probability of having E given that Adam was not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
     (Assume this is likely but not overwhelmingly so compared to other fields, e.g., 0.2)

Combining these:

- For Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.01 \cdot 0.1}{0.01 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.1 + 0.7 \cdot 0.05} \approx \frac{0.001}{0.001 + 0.03 + 0.035} \approx \frac{0.001}{0.066} \approx 0.015 \]

- For Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.01 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.1 + 0.7 \cdot 0.05} \approx \frac{0.03}{0.001 + 0.03 + 0.035} \approx \frac{0.03}{0.066} \approx 0.45 \]

- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{0.01 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.1 + 0.7 \cdot 0.05} \approx \frac{0.035}{0.001 + 0.03 + 0.035} \approx \frac{0.035}{0.066} \approx 0.53 \]

Given the calculations above and understanding there might be precision nuances, the approximate probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.015,
  "computer science": 0.45,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.53
}
