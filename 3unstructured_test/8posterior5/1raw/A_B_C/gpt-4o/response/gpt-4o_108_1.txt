To compute P(H|E) for each field using Bayes' rule, we first need to judge the prior probabilities P(H) (the probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field), the likelihoods P(E|H) (the probability that the personality sketch E is true given that Adam is enrolled in that field), and P(E|¬H) (the probability that the personality sketch E is true given that Adam is not enrolled in that field). Then we use these to calculate the posterior probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since the total probability P(E) (the marginal probability of having the personality sketch E) is the same for all fields, we can normalize later and compare the relative values.

Let's judge P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|¬H) for each field and compute P(H|E):

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: This is a common field for someone who loves nature and animals. Let's assume P(H) = 0.2
- **P(E|H)**: Given the sketch emphasizes a love for nature and animals, there's a high likelihood he fits this field. So let's assume P(E|H) = 0.9
- **P(E|¬H)**: There are other fields that fit his personality, but let's assume this is quite specific to Agricultural and Veterinary Science. So P(E|¬H) = 0.3

\[ P(H|E)_{agricultural and veterinary science} \propto \frac{0.9 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: This is not as aligned with his interests. Let's assume P(H) = 0.1
- **P(E|H)**: Given the subject's traits, the likelihood is lower. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.2
- **P(E|¬H)**: There are many other fields more aligned with his interests. Let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.5

\[ P(H|E)_{business administration} \propto \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \]

### Computer Science
- **P(H)**: Has become a popular field. Let's assume P(H) = 0.15
- **P(E|H)**: Quiet boys who enjoy solving puzzles and have high intelligence often fit in CS. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.5
- **P(E|¬H)**: There are other fields he might fit better. Let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.4

\[ P(H|E)_{computer science} \propto \frac{0.5 \times 0.15}{P(E)} \]

Now we compute the unnormalized probabilities:

\[
\begin{align*}
P(H|E)_{agricultural and veterinary science} & \propto 0.9 \times 0.2 = 0.18 \\
P(H|E)_{business administration} & \propto 0.2 \times 0.1 = 0.02 \\
P(H|E)_{computer science} & \propto 0.5 \times 0.15 = 0.075 \\
\end{align*}
\]

Next, we normalize these probabilities to make them sum to 1, although we do not need to for our purposes as we want to compare them in a relative manner:

Total sum = 0.18 + 0.02 + 0.075 = 0.275

Thus, the normalized probabilities are:

\[
\begin{align*}
P(H|E)_{agricultural and veterinary science} & = \frac{0.18}{0.275} \approx 0.6545 \\
P(H|E)_{business administration} & = \frac{0.02}{0.275} \approx 0.0727 \\
P(H|E)_{computer science} & = \frac{0.075}{0.275} \approx 0.2727 \\
\end{align*}
\]

Therefore, the answers are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6545,
  "business administration": 0.0727,
  "computer science": 0.2727
}
