Sure, let's go through the process step by step.

Bayes' Rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in field \( H \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence given he is in field \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the evidence, which can be found by summing the weighted probabilities of observing the evidence across all possible fields.

For the given fields, let's assume the following prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field based on general distribution among graduate fields (you could adjust these values based on more accurate data if available):
- Computer Science: 0.3
- Business Administration: 0.3
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.1
- Other fields: 0.3

Now we estimate \( P(E|H) \), the likelihood of observing E given each field:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Although intelligence and problem-solving skills are important and aligned, the specific interest in nature, plants, and animals doesn't align as strongly with computer science.
   - Therefore, \( P(E|H)_{cs} \approx 0.2 \)

2. **Business Administration**:
   - While empathy and understanding hard work can be important, the specific strong love for nature and animals is less relevant.
   - Therefore, \( P(E|H)_{ba} \approx 0.1 \)

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - This aligns very closely with appreciation for nature, animals, plants, empathy, and hard work.
   - Therefore, \( P(E|H)_avs \approx 0.7 \)

Finally, let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H)) \), the probability of observing E given that Adam is not in a specific field. This involves averaging over all other fields. It's complex and ideally, we'd weigh it based on true distribution, but we'll simplify:
- \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.15 \) (average likelihood across unspecified other fields.)

Given our priors and likelihoods, here's how we'll compute \( P(H|E) \):

1. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H|E)_{cs} \approx \frac{P(E|H)_{cs} \cdot P(H)_{cs}}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{0.2 \cdot 0.3 + 0.1 \cdot 0.3 + 0.7 \cdot 0.1 + 0.5 \cdot 0.3} = \frac{0.06}{0.27} \approx 0.22 \)

2. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H|E)_{ba} \approx \frac{P(E|H)_{ba} \cdot P(H)_{ba}}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.3}{0.2 \cdot 0.3 + 0.1 \cdot 0.3 + 0.7 \cdot 0.1 + 0.5 \cdot 0.3} = \frac{0.03}{0.27} \approx 0.11 \)

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H|E)_{avs} \approx \frac{P(E|H)_{avs} \cdot P(H)_{avs}}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.2 \cdot 0.3 + 0.1 \cdot 0.3 + 0.7 \cdot 0.1 + 0.5 \cdot 0.3} = \frac{0.07}{0.27} \approx 0.26 \)
