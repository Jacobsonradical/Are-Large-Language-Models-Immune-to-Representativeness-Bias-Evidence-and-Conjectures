To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the mentioned fields, we need to use Bayes' Rule:

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

Where:
- \(P(H|E)\) is the probability of the hypothesis \(H\) given evidence \(E\).
- \(P(E|H)\) is the probability of evidence \(E\) given hypothesis \(H\).
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of hypothesis \(H\).
- \(P(E)\) is the total probability of evidence \(E\).

Below are the essential values and calculations:

1. **Business Administration**

    - Prior Probability, \(P(\text{business administration})\): Let's assume a moderate prior probability, say 0.2.
    - Likelihood, \(P(E|\text{business administration})\): Evidence \(E\) seems less aligned with business administration. Let's estimate a low value, say 0.1.
    - Likelihood, \(P(E|\neg \text{business administration})\): Higher than 0.1 because Adam's personality and interests are less aligned with business administration. Let's estimate 0.9 for the combined other fields.

    Using Bayes Rule:
    \[
    P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)}
    \]
    For normalization, \(P(E)\) can be approximated but isn't necessary for relative comparisons.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

    - Prior Probability, \(P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})\): Let's assume a moderate probability, say 0.2.
    - Likelihood, \(P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science})\): This aligns well with Adam's interests in nature and animals. Let's estimate 0.6.
    - Likelihood, \(P(E|\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science})\): Lower than 0.6 without the alignment in nature and animals. Let's estimate 0.4 for the combined other fields.

    Using Bayes Rule:
    \[
    P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)}
    \]

3. **Computer Science**

    - Prior Probability, \(P(\text{computer science})\): Let's assume a moderate probability, say 0.2.
    - Likelihood, \(P(E|\text{computer science})\): Evidence \(E\) somewhat aligns with problem-solving and abstract concepts. Let's estimate 0.4.
    - Likelihood, \(P(E|\neg \text{computer science})\): Higher than 0.4 given that other fields are less aligned or moderately aligned. Let's estimate 0.6 for the combined other fields.

    Using Bayes Rule:
    \[
    P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)}
    \]

Calculation of normalized probabilities gives us:

\[
\begin{aligned}
  &P(E) \text{â€¢Normalization Factor} = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.6 \cdot 0.2) + (0.4 \cdot 0.2) \\
  &= 0.02 + 0.12 + 0.08 = 0.22
\end{aligned}
\]

So:

\[
\begin{aligned}
  &P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.22} \approx 0.09 \\
  &P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.22} \approx 0.55 \\
  &P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.22} \approx 0.36 \\
\end{aligned}
\]

Therefore, the results are as follows:

{
  "business administration": "0.09",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.55",
  "computer science": "0.36"
}
