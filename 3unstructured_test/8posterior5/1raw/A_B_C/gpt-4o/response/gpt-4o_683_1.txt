To approach the problem, we will break down the process of judging P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|\neg H) for each field before computing P(H|E) using Bayes' rule. Note that P(H) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field, P(E|H) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in that field, and P(E|\neg H) is the likelihood of observing his personality sketch if he is not in that field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that any given student is in agricultural and veterinary science. Since this field is less common among all possible fields for graduate students, it would have a relatively low prior compared to more common fields like computer science or business administration.
   - P(H): 0.1

2. **P(E|H)**: Since Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, enjoys solving puzzles, loves animals, and has a strong appreciation for hard work (common in agricultural and veterinary science), this likelihood will be high.
   - P(E|H): 0.7

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's traits if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. While some traits match other fields, the combination of traits is most aligned with this field, making this value lower.
   - P(E|\neg H): 0.2

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.1}{0.7 \times 0.1 + 0.2 \times 0.9} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.07}{0.07 + 0.18} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.28 \]

### Computer Science

1. **P(H)**: This is the prior probability for computer science. Given its popularity as a discipline, this prior might be higher than for agricultural and veterinary science.
   - P(H): 0.3

2. **P(E|H)**: Adam's intellectual and puzzle-solving traits fit computer science, but his other traits related to nature and animals are less aligned. This ends up being a moderate likelihood.
   - P(E|H): 0.4

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch if he is not in computer science.
   - P(E|\neg H): 0.3

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.3}{0.4 \times 0.3 + 0.3 \times 0.7} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.21} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.36 \]

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability for business administration. It’s a common field, so this prior will also be moderate.
   - P(H): 0.2

2. **P(E|H)**: Adam’s traits do not align as strongly with business administration (focus on profit, leadership, finance) minus the hard work trait.
   - P(E|H): 0.2

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam’s personality sketch if he is not in business administration.
   - P(E|\neg H): 0.4

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.2}{0.2 \times 0.2 + 0.4 \times 0.8} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.32} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.11 \]
