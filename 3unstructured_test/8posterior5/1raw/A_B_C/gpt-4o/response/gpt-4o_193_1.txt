Given the personality sketch of Adam, we can analyze the likelihood of him being enrolled in each of the suggested fields based on the provided data. 

### Assumptions:

- We don't have prior detailed statistics for graduate enrollment across all fields, but we can make educated estimates based on typical profiles.
- We'll assume Adam's characteristics align more naturally with disciplines that involve understanding nature, animals, and abstract concepts.

### Hypotheses:
- **H1**: Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- **H2**: Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- **H3**: Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

### Available Information and Estimates:

- **P(H1)**: Probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- **P(H2)**: Probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- **P(H3)**: Probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

- **P(E|H1)**: Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was enrolled in computer science.
- **P(E|H2)**: Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was enrolled in business administration.
- **P(E|H3)**: Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

- **P(E|¬H1)**: Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was NOT enrolled in computer science.
- **P(E|¬H2)**: Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was NOT enrolled in business administration.
- **P(E|¬H3)**: Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was NOT enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

### Judgments:
1. **P(H1):** Let's assume a typical distribution where computer science is a popular choice but may not align best with Adam’s characteristics like love for nature and animals. So let's assign it a modest prior. P(H1) = 0.2

2. **P(H2):** Business administration generally attracts individuals with interests in management, leadership, and less in nature and animals. P(H2) = 0.1

3. **P(H3):** Agricultural and veterinary science aligns strongly with Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals. P(H3) = 0.4

### Likelihoods:
1. **P(E|H1):** Given the introverted, empathetic, and nature-loving profile, this is less typical for computer science students. P(E|H1) = 0.2

2. **P(E|H2):** Adam’s warmth and love for animals do not strongly align with stereotypical business administration traits. P(E|H2) = 0.1

3. **P(E|H3):** Adam’s characteristics fit well with an agricultural/veterinary science profile. P(E|H3) = 0.8

### Complementary Likelihoods:
1. **P(E|¬H1)**: Given it's not computer science, but fits in the range of other fields. Let’s assume P(E|¬H1) = 0.6

2. **P(E|¬H2)**: Given it's not business, aligning more with other humanities or sciences. Let’s assume P(E|¬H2) = 0.7

3. **P(E|¬H3)**: Given it's not agricultural and veterinary sciences, less probable among other humanities. Let’s assume P(E|¬H3) = 0.3

### Apply Bayes' Rule:
1. **P(H1|E)** = [ P(E|H1) * P(H1) ] / P(E)
2. **P(H2|E)** = [ P(E|H2) * P(H2) ] / P(E)
3. **P(H3|E)** = [ P(E|H3) * P(H3) ] / P(E)

Since we are comparing relative probabilities, we can ignore the factor P(E) which cancels out.

### Calculation:
1. **P(H1|E)** ≈ [0.2 * 0.2] / 0.6 = 0.0667
2. **P(H2|E)** ≈ [0.1 * 0.1] / 0.7 = 0.0143
3. **P(H3|E)** ≈ [0.8 * 0.4] / 0.3 = 1.0667

### Normalization:
To normalize these probabilities such that they add up to 1:

```Normalization constant = (0.0667 + 0.0143 + 1.0667)```

```Sum = 1.1477```

1. **P(H1|E)** ≈ 0.0667 / 1.1477 ≈ 0.0581
2. **P(H2|E)** ≈ 0.0143 / 1.1477 ≈ 0.0125
3. **P(H3|E)** ≈ 1.0667 / 1.1477 ≈ 0.9294

### Final Probabilities:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.0581,
  "business administration": 0.0125,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.9294
}
