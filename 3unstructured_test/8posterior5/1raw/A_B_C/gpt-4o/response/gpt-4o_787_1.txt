To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, we will use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is common for all fields and will normalize the probabilities, we can focus on relative calculations of \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(H) \).

**General assumptions:**

- \( P(H) \) represents the prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in a specific field. These priors might reflect general enrollment rates in those fields.
- \( P(E|H) \) indicates how well the personality sketch fits within that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) denotes the likelihood of the personality sketch given any other field.

### Business Administration

#### Assumptions:
- \( P(H_{BA}) \): Let's assume roughly 20% of graduate students are enrolled in business administration programs.
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): The personality traits in \( E \) do not strongly align with typical business administration students, so this might be low.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \): This would be covered by the likelihood of the sketch over other fields which seem to fit better.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

#### Assumptions:
- \( P(H_{AV}) \): Let's assume roughly 10% of graduate students are in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H_{AV}) \): The personality sketch of enthusiasm for nature and animals fits well here.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{AV}) \): The personality sketch over all other fields not matching as well.

### Computer Science

#### Assumptions:
- \( P(H_{CS}) \): Let's assume roughly 15% of graduate students are in computer science programs.
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): The personality sketch indicating high intelligence and interest in solving puzzles may fit reasonably well.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \): The personality sketch over other fields, which generally doesn't match as well outside specified traits.

### Calculation of Values

- Prior Predictions:
  - Business Administration: \( P(H_{BA}) \approx 0.2 \)
  - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( P(H_{AV}) \approx 0.1 \)
  - Computer Science: \( P(H_{CS}) \approx 0.15 \)

- Likelihood of Personality Sketch:
  - \( P(E|H_{BA}) \approx 0.1 \)
  - \( P(E|H_{AV}) \approx 0.8 \)
  - \( P(E|H_{CS}) \approx 0.5 \)

By Bayes' rule:

### Business Administration

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

\[ P(H_{AV}|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \]

### Computer Science

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \approx \frac{0.5 \times 0.15}{P(E)} \]

Since we are dealing with relative probabilities, we do not need to calculate \( P(E) \).

Relative probabilities can be outlined as (normalized roughly for comparison):

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,  // relatively low fit
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08,  // higher fit due to alignment with personality traits
  "computer science": 0.075  // moderate fit due to intelligence and puzzle interests
}
```

For final normalized values (precision adjusted for clarity):

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.06,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.34,
  "computer science": 0.32
}
```
