First, let’s identify the key components for Bayes' theorem for this problem. We need \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field. Then, we can use Bayes’ Rule to compute \( P(H|E) \).

Given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1)**
- **Business Administration (H2)**
- **Computer Science (H3)**

### Assumptions

1. **Base rates \( P(H) \):**
   - \( P(H1) \): Assuming a moderate number of graduate students enroll in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
   - \( P(H2) \): Assuming a high number of students enroll in Business Administration because it's a popular field.
   - \( P(H3) \): Assuming a high number of students enroll in Computer Science due to its popularity.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   - \( P(E|H1) \): Higher likelihood given Adam's description.
   - \( P(E|H2) \): Lower likelihood given Adam does not have a strong business-oriented description.
   - \( P(E|H3) \): Moderate likelihood given Adam’s intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts, but only partial alignment with his strong empathy for animals and nature.

3. **Complement likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   - This represents the likelihood of Adam’s description among students not in the specified field. This would generally be lower for fields not aligning well with Adam's traits.

### Estimations

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \)
   - \( P(E|H_1) = 0.8 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H_1) = 0.2 \)

   Using Bayes’ Rule:
   \[
   P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E|\neg H_1) \cdot (1 - P(H_1))}
   \]
   \[
   P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85} = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.17} \approx 0.414
   \]

2. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H_2) = 0.4 \)
   - \( P(E|H_2) = 0.1 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H_2) = 0.5 \)

   Using Bayes’ Rule:
   \[
   P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) + P(E|\neg H_2) \cdot (1 - P(H_2))}
   \]
   \[
   P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.4}{0.1 \cdot 0.4 + 0.5 \cdot 0.6} = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.3} \approx 0.118
   \]

3. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(H_3) = 0.3 \)
   - \( P(E|H_3) = 0.3 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H_3) = 0.4 \)

   Using Bayes’ Rule:
   \[
   P(H_3|E) = \frac{P(E|H_3) \cdot P(H_3)}{P(E|H_3) \cdot P(H_3) + P(E|\neg H_3) \cdot (1 - P(H_3))}
   \]
   \[
   P(H_3|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.3}{0.3 \cdot 0.3 + 0.4 \cdot 0.7} = \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.28} \approx 0.243
   \]
