Sure, I'll calculate the probabilities using some reasonable assumptions based on the information given.

First, let's outline the probabilities:
- P(H): the initial probability of Adam being enrolled in a certain field without any further information.
- P(E|H): the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in a certain field.
- P(E|\neg H): the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is NOT enrolled in a certain field.
- P(H|E): the probability of Adam being enrolled in a certain field given his personality sketch E, which can be computed using Bayes' Rule.

Bayes' Rule is:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since P(E) is common to all fields, we can use:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Let's assume the prior P(H) for simplicity as equal for all fields among many possible graduate programs:
\[ P(H) = \frac{1}{N} \]
where N is the number of possible fields of graduate study. 

Given Adam's interests and qualities, we'll assume different values for P(E|H):

For **business administration**:
- P(E|H): Low - Adam's traits suggest a strong inclination towards nature, animals, and abstract concepts rather than management.
- P(E|\neg H): Assuming average because business administration is broader and people from various backgrounds can be present.

For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
- P(E|H): High - Adam's qualities match closely with someone likely to be in this field.
- P(E|\neg H): Average - As many people who are not in this field do not share such specialized traits.

For **computer science**:
- P(E|H): Moderate - Adam enjoys solving puzzles, which aligns with computer science, but other traits make it a less strong match.
- P(E|\neg H): Assuming average.

Let's assume:
- N = 50 graduate fields in total for simplicity.
- P(H) = \(\frac{1}{50}\) for any individual field.

Using the given qualitative assessments to provide reasonable numerical values:
- Business Administration: \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \)
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \)
- Computer Science: \( P(E|H) \approx 0.5 \)

Now, relative probabilities using Bayes' Rule approximation:
- P(H) is the same for all fields, so we only need to compare relative \( P(E|H) \).

Finally, estimating \( P(H|E) \):

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1 * \(\frac{1}{50}\) (Relative value: 0.1),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8 * \(\frac{1}{50}\) (Relative value: 0.8),
  "computer science": 0.5 * \(\frac{1}{50}\) (Relative value: 0.5)
}
```
Normalizing these values to provide numbers between 0 and 1 (sum does not need to be 1):

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.25
}
```

This gives us a clear proportional estimate based on the provided information and assumptions.
