Given the personality sketch of Adam and the various fields of specialization, we will first estimate the probabilities P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|¬H) for each field. Then, we will use Bayes' theorem to compute P(H|E).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: Probability that Adam was enrolled in this field. This is generally low, but considering Adam's interest in nature and plants, let's set P(H) at 0.1.
- **P(E|H)**: Given that Adam is in this field, the probability of him having a personality sketch E is high due to his love for nature and animals. Let’s set P(E|H) at 0.8.
- **P(E|¬H)**: Given that Adam is not in this field, the probability of him having this personality is significantly lower. Let's set P(E|¬H) at 0.2.

Using Bayes’ theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.18} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.3077 \]

### Computer Science
- **P(H)**: Given that computer science is a popular field, let's roughly estimate it at a base rate of 0.2.
- **P(E|H)**: Given that Adam is good at solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, this probability should be relatively high. Let's set P(E|H) at 0.5.
- **P(E|¬H)**: Even if not in computer science, Adam's traits could still be fairly common in other fields. Let’s set this at 0.3.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.5 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.1 + 0.24} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.34} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.2941 \]

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: This is another popular field, so let’s assume a base rate of 0.2.
- **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's traits, the probability is lower due to lack of business-related traits. Let’s set P(E|H) at 0.2.
- **P(E|¬H)**: A similar approach to the others. Let’s set P(E|¬H) at 0.3.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.2 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.24} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.28} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.1429 \]

Here is the final result:
