To compute the probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to assess \(P(H)\), \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E|\neg H)\).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \(P(H)\): Let's assume a relatively high initial probability considering his interest in nature, plants, and animals. For the sake of simplicity, let's assign this a value of 0.3.
- \(P(E|H)\): Given Adam's personality traits and interests, it seems highly likely that he would be found in this field. We can set this probability at 0.8.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The likelihood of him having these traits without being in this field is moderate. Let's set this at 0.2.

Now, using Bayes' rule:
\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}\]

Plugging in the values:
\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.3}{0.8 \cdot 0.3 + 0.2 \cdot 0.7} = \frac{0.24}{0.24 + 0.14} = \frac{0.24}{0.38} \approx 0.63\]

### Business Administration
- \(P(H)\): This field seems less likely based on the personality traits provided. Let's set this at 0.1.
- \(P(E|H)\): Given his love for animals, nature, and empathy, it doesn't strongly align with business administration. Let's set this at 0.2.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The likelihood of having these traits without being in business touches on a somewhat broad range. Let's set this at 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.27} = \frac{0.02}{0.29} \approx 0.069\]

### Computer Science
- \(P(H)\): Considering his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, computer science is plausible. Let’s set this at 0.2.
- \(P(E|H)\): His empathy and love for nature could be less aligned, but his enjoyment of puzzles fits well. Let’s set \(P(E|H)\) at 0.5.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): A moderate probability that he has these traits without being in computer science. Let's set this at 0.25.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.5 \cdot 0.2 + 0.25 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.1}{0.1 + 0.2} = \frac{0.1}{0.3} \approx 0.33\]

### Summary
Thus, after applying Bayes' rule:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.63,
  "business administration": 0.069,
  "computer science": 0.33
}
```

These probabilities reflect how strongly Adam's personality matches each academic field based on the given context and assumptions.
