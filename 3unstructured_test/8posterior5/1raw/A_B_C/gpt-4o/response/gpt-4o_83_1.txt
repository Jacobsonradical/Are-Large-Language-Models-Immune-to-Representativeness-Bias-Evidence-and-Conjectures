To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in each specific field given the personality sketch \( E \), we will use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, we assume we don't know the exact priors and likelihoods for each hypothesis and instead make reasonable estimations.

### Business Administration

- **P(H\_BA)**: The probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration. Business majors are common, let's assume \( P(H\_BA) = 0.2 \).
- **P(E|H\_BA)**: The characteristics like empathy, understanding abstract concepts might fit a business admin student, but traits like love for nature and animals are less relevant. Let's assume \( P(E|H\_BA) = 0.1 \).
- **P(E|\neg H\_BA)**: The probability of the personality sketch given that he's not studying business administration. This would be higher than \( P(E|H\_BA) \), let's assume \( P(E|\neg H\_BA) = 0.3 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H\_AVS)**: The likelihood that Adam is in this field. Given his love for nature and animals, this field is quite relevant. Assume \( P(H\_AVS) = 0.1 \).
- **P(E|H\_AVS)**: The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is in agricultural or veterinary science should be quite high because the traits align well with this field. Let's assume \( P(E|H\_AVS) = 0.8 \).
- **P(E|\neg H\_AVS)**: The probability of the personality sketch given that he's not studying in this field would be lower as the traits are more aligned. We'll estimate \( P(E|\neg H\_AVS) = 0.2 \).

### Computer Science

- **P(H\_CS)**: The probability that Adam is in computer science. Computer science is fairly common as well, perhaps more so. Assume \( P(H\_CS) = 0.3 \).
- **P(E|H\_CS)**: The problem-solving skills and high intelligence fit quite well, but the traits regarding nature and animals are less relevant. Assume \( P(E|H\_CS) = 0.3 \).
- **P(E|\neg H\_CS)**: The probability of the personality sketch given that he's not in computer science. Assume \( P(E|\neg H\_CS) = 0.4 \).

To simplify further calculations, assume \( P(E) \), the overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \), remains constant and doesn't need exact computation.

### Using Bayes' Rule to Calculate \( P(H|E) \):

1. Business Administration:
\[ P(H\_BA|E) = \frac{P(E|H\_BA) \cdot P(H\_BA)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.02}{P(E)} \]

2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H\_AVS|E) = \frac{P(E|H\_AVS) \cdot P(H\_AVS)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.08}{P(E)} \]

3. Computer Science:
\[ P(H\_CS|E) = \frac{P(E|H\_CS) \cdot P(H\_CS)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} = \frac{0.09}{P(E)} \]

Summarizing the normalized posterior probabilities:

{
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.08 + 0.09} \approx 0.105 \),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{0.08}{0.02 + 0.08 + 0.09} \approx 0.421 \),
  "computer science": \( \frac{0.09}{0.02 + 0.08 + 0.09} \approx 0.474 \)
}

Note: While the problem does not request normalization for total sum to 1, this shows that computer science and agricultural/veterinary science align better with the personality sketch, with computer science having a slight edge.
