To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to estimate the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihoods \( P(E|\neg H) \). After that, we can use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for all fields being compared, it serves as a normalizing constant and we don't need its exact value to compare relative probabilities.

Let's make reasonable estimates for our given fields. We'll estimate the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field based on the commonality of these fields among graduate students, and the likelihoods based on how well Adam's personality and interests align with each field.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): This is a specialized field, not as common as business administration or computer science. Let's estimate \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy align very well with this field. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch occurring given he is not in this field could be lower, as it's less aligned with other fields (but not impossible). Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \).

2. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H) \): This is a very common field among graduate students. Let's estimate \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's personality does not strongly align with typical business interests, which may focus more on management and economics. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch occurring given he is not in business administration should be higher, as it fits better with other fields. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \).

3. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): This field is also quite common among graduate students. Let's estimate \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's interest in puzzles and understanding abstract concepts fits well with computer science. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.7 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Similar to the previous cases, as his profile partially fits with computer science but also with other fields. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \).

Now, let's compute \( P(H|E) \):

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.09 \]

For business administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.3 = 0.03 \]

For computer science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.7 \cdot 0.3 = 0.21 \]

Finally, we normalize these values by dividing by their sum to ensure they add up to 1:
\[ \text{Total} = 0.09 + 0.03 + 0.21 = 0.33 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{normalized}} = \frac{P(H|E)}{\text{Total}} \]

However, the question explicitly states our total does not need to add up to 1, as there are other graduate fields of specialization. Therefore, we report the unnormalized values:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.09,
  "business administration": 0.03,
  "computer science": 0.21
}
```

These values give a comparative likelihood of Adam being enrolled in each field given his personality sketch.
