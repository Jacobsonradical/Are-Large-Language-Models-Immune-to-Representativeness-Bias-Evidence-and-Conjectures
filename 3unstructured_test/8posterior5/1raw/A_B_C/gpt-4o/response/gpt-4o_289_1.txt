To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to first estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \):

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam has the personality traits described given that he was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that Adam has the personality traits described given that he was NOT enrolled in that field.

We will use Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant to ensure that the probabilities sum to 1. However, since we are only comparing relative probabilities within a limited set of fields, \( P(E) \) will not influence the relative values.

For simplicity, let's assume the following:

### Estimated Probabilities:
1. **Computer Science**
    - \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \) (moderate number of students in this field)
    - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \) (solving puzzles and high intelligence match well, but nature and animals less so)
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.1 \) (outside the field, the described traits might be less common)

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
    - \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \) (fewer students in this specialized field)
    - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.7 \) (nature, animals, empathy, and dedication strongly match)
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \) (traits are somewhat common outside of this field)

3. **Business Administration**
    - \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \) (moderate number of students in this field)
    - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \) (abstract thinking could match somewhat, but nature and empathy less likely)
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \) (traits are more common outside this field, but not a strong match)

### Calculations for \( P(H|E) \):

#### Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \times 0.3}{P(E)} \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \]

#### Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.3}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant, the relative probabilities in comparison will give us:

### Results:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.06 / P(E),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.07 / P(E),
  "business administration": 0.03 / P(E)
}
```

If we normalize the values for comparison:

### Normalized Results:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.35,
  "business administration": 0.15
}
```

Thus, the highest relative probability is that Adam was most likely enrolled in "agricultural and veterinary science," followed by "computer science," and the least likely is "business administration."
