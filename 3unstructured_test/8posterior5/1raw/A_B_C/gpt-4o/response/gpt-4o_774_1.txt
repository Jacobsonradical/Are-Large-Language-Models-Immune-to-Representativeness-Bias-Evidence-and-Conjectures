To compute the probability of Adam being enrolled in each field given his personality traits, we can use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \(P(E)\) is the same for all fields and doesn't change our relative probabilities, we only need to compute the numerator for each field, which is \(P(E|H) \cdot P(H)\). In other words, we care about the product of the following two:

1. \(P(H)\): The prior probability that a randomly selected graduate student is enrolled in the field.
2. \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood that someone enrolled in that field has Adam's traits.

We do not have exact values, so educated assumptions need to be made. Let's look at each field:

**Computer Science:**
- \(P(H)_{\text{CS}}\): There's a high number of students in this field, so let's assume \(P(H) = 0.2\).
- \(P(E|H)_{\text{CS}}\): While high intelligence and problem-solving skills fit, other traits like a love for nature and animals are less common. So, let's assume \(P(E|H) = 0.2\).
- Given these:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \cdot 0.2 = 0.04 \]

**Business Administration:**
- \(P(H)_{\text{BA}}\): Moderately common field, assume \(P(H) = 0.15\).
- \(P(E|H)_{\text{BA}}\): Traits like empathy could fit, but others (nature and animals) are less typical. Let's assume \(P(E|H) = 0.1\).
- Given these:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.15 = 0.015 \]

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- \(P(H)_{\text{AVS}}\): Less common field, assume \(P(H) = 0.05\).
- \(P(E|H)_{\text{AVS}}\): Very high match due to love for nature/animals. Let's assume \(P(E|H) = 0.8\).
- Given these:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{AVS}} \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04 \]

Now let's put these calculations together in the prescribed format:

{
  "computer science": 0.04,
  "business administration": 0.015,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.04
}

Note: While both Computer Science and Agricultural & Veterinary Science have equal computed values, this approach considers representativeness based on prior assumptions. Actual priors and field prevalence can affect these values.
