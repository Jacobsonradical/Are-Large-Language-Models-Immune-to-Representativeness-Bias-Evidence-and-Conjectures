To solve the problem, we need to use Bayes' Rule, which can be expressed as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of H.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of E given H.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of E.
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of H given E.

Since we are calculating for different hypotheses (fields of study), we'll estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field.

### Field: Business Administration
1. **Prior (P(H))**: Let's assume the probability that a student is studying Business Administration is relatively common. Hence, \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \) = 0.10.
2. **Likelihood (P(E|H))**: Given the personality sketch, it doesn't strongly align with typical traits of a typical Business Administration student. Hence, \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \) = 0.05.
3. **Complement Likelihood (P(E|\neg H))**: This is the probability of the sketch being relevant given the student is not in Business Administration. Assume, given the general nature of the description, \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \) = 0.25.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \]
We assume \( P(E) \) to be a generic constant to normalize at the end for ranking.
So:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \approx \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.10}{0.25} = 0.02 \]

### Field: Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **Prior (P(H))**: Assume this field is less common overall, so \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \) = 0.05.
2. **Likelihood (P(E|H))**: The personality aligns well with this field. Hence, \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \) = 0.60.
3. **Complement Likelihood (P(E|\neg H))**: Assume \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \) = 0.25.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) \approx \frac{0.60 \cdot 0.05}{0.25} = 0.12 \]

### Field: Computer Science
1. **Prior (P(H))**: Assume Computer Science is very common, thus \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \) = 0.20.
2. **Likelihood (P(E|H))**: Traits like high intelligence and enjoyment of puzzles are quite indicative, so \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \) = 0.50.
3. **Complement Likelihood (P(E|\neg H))**: Assume \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \) = 0.25.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx \frac{0.50 \cdot 0.20}{0.25} = 0.40 \]

Now representing these:

{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.12,
  "computer science": 0.40
}
