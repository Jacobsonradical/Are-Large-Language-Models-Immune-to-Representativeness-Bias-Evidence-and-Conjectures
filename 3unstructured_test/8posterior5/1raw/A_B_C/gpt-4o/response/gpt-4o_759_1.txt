To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), the prior probability \( P(H) \), and the likelihood of the evidence under the negation of each hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence, which can be computed as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Given that we don't have exact numbers for these probabilities, we can provide estimates based on the information provided in the personality sketch of Adam.

### Estimations

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**\
\( H = \) Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science
   - \( P(H) \): Prior probability: Estimate as 0.05, considering the range of potential fields.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood of the evidence given this hypothesis: High, as Adam has a strong interest in nature, animals, and an appreciation for hard work. Estimate as 0.7.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likelihood of the evidence given not this hypothesis: Lower than \( P(E|H) \), estimate as 0.2.

2. **Computer Science**\
\( H = \) Adam was enrolled in computer science
   - \( P(H) \): Prior probability: Estimate as 0.2, given the popularity of the field.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood of the evidence given this hypothesis: Moderate, as Adam's intelligence and abstract thinking is a fit, but not his love for nature and animals. Estimate as 0.3.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likelihood of the evidence given not this hypothesis: Estimate as 0.25.

3. **Business Administration**\
\( H = \) Adam was enrolled in business administration
   - \( P(H) \): Prior probability: Estimate as 0.1, considering the range of potential fields.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood of the evidence given this hypothesis: Low, as his personality does not strongly align with typical traits needed in business administration. Estimate as 0.1.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likelihood of the evidence given not this hypothesis: Estimate as 0.25.

### Calculations

To perform the calculations, we assume the prior probabilities for \(\neg H\) in each case are distributed among the other fields proportionally. For simplicity, we focus on few estimates:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   \[
   P(E) = (0.7 \times 0.05) + (0.2 \times 0.95) = 0.035 + 0.19 = 0.225
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.05}{0.225} = \frac{0.035}{0.225} \approx 0.156
   \]

2. **Computer Science**
   \[
   P(E) = (0.3 \times 0.2) + (0.25 \times 0.8) = 0.06 + 0.2 = 0.26
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{0.26} = \frac{0.06}{0.26} \approx 0.231
   \]

3. **Business Administration**
   \[
   P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.1) + (0.25 \times 0.9) = 0.01 + 0.225 = 0.235
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.1}{0.235} = \frac{0.01}{0.235} \approx 0.043
   \]
