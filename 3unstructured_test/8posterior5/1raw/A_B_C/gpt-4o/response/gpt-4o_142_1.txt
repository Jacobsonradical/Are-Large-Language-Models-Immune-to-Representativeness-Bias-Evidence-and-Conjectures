To calculate the probability for each field using Bayes' Rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the complement likelihoods \( P(E|\neg H) \). 

For simplicity, I'll assume some reasonable values for these probabilities based on general knowledge about the fields:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(H_{CS}) \): The prior probability that a random graduate student is in computer science. Given the high number of students in this field, let's say 0.3.
   - \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): The likelihood of Adam’s personality traits given that he is in computer science. Since Adam seems more suited to natural sciences, we'll rate this low, say 0.1.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \): The likelihood of Adam’s personality traits given that he is not in computer science. Given the broader pool of all other fields, this could be 0.9.

Using Bayes’ Rule: 
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) = P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{CS})) \)

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H_{AV}) \): The prior probability that a graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. This field is less common, say 0.1.
   - \( P(E|H_{AV}) \): Likelihood of Adam’s personality traits given that he is in this field. Highly likely, say 0.8.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{AV}) \): The likelihood of Adam’s personality traits given he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Perhaps 0.4.

Using Bayes’ Rule: 
\[ P(H_{AV}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AV}) \cdot P(H_{AV})}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) = P(E|H_{AV}) \cdot P(H_{AV}) + P(E|\neg H_{AV}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{AV})) \)

3. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H_{BA}) \): The prior probability a random graduate student is in business administration. Pretty common, let's say 0.2.
   - \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): The likelihood of Adam’s personality traits given he is in business administration. Unlikely, say 0.2.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \): The likelihood of Adam’s personality traits given he is not in business administration. Assume 0.8.

Using Bayes’ Rule: 
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) = P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{BA})) \)

Now, for approximate values of posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \):

1. **Computer Science:**
\[ P(E) = 0.1 \times 0.3 + 0.9 \times 0.7 = 0.03 + 0.63 = 0.66 \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.3}{0.66} \approx 0.045 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \times 0.1 + 0.4 \times 0.9 = 0.08 + 0.36 = 0.44 \]
\[ P(H_{AV}|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.44} \approx 0.182 \]

3. **Business Administration:**
\[ P(E) = 0.2 \times 0.2 + 0.8 \times 0.8 = 0.04 + 0.64 = 0.68 \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.2}{0.68} \approx 0.059 \]

So, the approximate results are as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.045,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.182,
  "business administration": 0.059
}
