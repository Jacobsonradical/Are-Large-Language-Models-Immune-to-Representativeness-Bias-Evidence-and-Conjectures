Let's break down the information to estimate the conditional probabilities. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(H|E)\) is the probability that Adam is in a specific field given his personality traits.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the probability of the personality traits given he is in that field.
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of Adam being in that field.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\) is the probability of the personality traits given he is not in that field.

We'll hypothesize prior probabilities \(P(H)\) based on the general popularity of these fields among graduate students in the U.S.

### Estimates:
1. **Computer Science**:
    - \(P(H)\): Let's say approximately 20% of graduate students are in computer science programs.
    - \(P(E|H)\): Adam's traits (quiet, enjoys puzzles, high intelligence) reasonably fit someone in computer science. We'll estimate this at 0.5.
    - \(P(E|\neg H)\): For fields other than computer science, the personality traits are less specific but not uncommon. Let's estimate this at 0.2.

2. **Business Administration**:
    - \(P(H)\): Let's say around 15% of graduate students are in business administration programs.
    - \(P(E|H)\): Adam's traits (curious about nature, quiet, love for animals) are less typical for business administration students. Let's estimate this at 0.2.
    - \(P(E|\neg H)\): Similar to above, but we'll adjust a little lower, say 0.25.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - \(P(H)\): Let's say around 10% of graduate students are in agricultural and veterinary science programs.
    - \(P(E|H)\): Adam's traits fit well with this field (interest in nature, plants, love for animals). We'll estimate this at 0.7.
    - \(P(E|\neg H)\): For other fields, these traits are less common. Letâ€™s estimate this at 0.15.

### Calculations:
#### Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \approx 0.5 \cdot 0.2 = 0.1 \]

#### Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \approx 0.2 \cdot 0.15 = 0.03 \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \approx 0.7 \cdot 0.1 = 0.07 \]

After computing these values, let's normalize them to get a clearer sense of relative probabilities:

### Normalized Probabilities:
Total = 0.1 + 0.03 + 0.07 = 0.2

\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.2} = 0.5 \]
\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.2} = 0.15 \]
\[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) = \frac{0.07}{0.2} = 0.35 \]
