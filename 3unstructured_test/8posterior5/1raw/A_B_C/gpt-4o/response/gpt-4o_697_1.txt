Sure! Let's apply Bayesian inference to estimate the probabilities of Adam being in each given field of graduate study based on the provided personality sketch. 

First, we'll define the following:

- \( E \): Personality sketch of Adam.
- \( H \): Hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.

We need to calculate \( P(H|E) \), the posterior probability of Adam being in each field given the personality sketch.

According to Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the evidence, the overall likelihood of observing the personality sketch, which we can simplify in relation to the fields provided.

**Estimations:**

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - **\( P(H) \)**: Assume a moderate baseline probability, say \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
   - **\( P(E|H) \)**: High, since the personality fits this field well (curiosity about nature, plants, love for animals), say \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
   - **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Assume a moderate value, as it's less likely but still possible \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

2. **Business Administration:**
   - **\( P(H) \)**: Assume a lower baseline probability, say \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
   - **\( P(E|H) \)**: Low, since the personality does not align well with business administration (if we assume qualities like curiosity about nature and love for animals are not typical), say \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
   - **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Higher than the likelihood within this field, say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

3. **Computer Science:**
   - **\( P(H) \)**: Assume a moderate baseline probability, say \( P(H) = 0.6 \) (reflecting its popularity and the intelligence/abstract thinking fit).
   - **\( P(E|H) \)**: Moderate, as intelligence and solving puzzles fit closely, but less so with the nature and animals aspects, say \( P(E|H) = 0.5 \).
   - **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Assume a lower value, say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

**Calculation of Posterior Probabilities (\( P(H|E) \)):**

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{\sum P(E|H_i) \cdot P(H_i)} \]

However, as we're not given all fields, we'll for simplicity adjust the denominator by an approximate scale factor.

**Results:**
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.53,
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.45
}
```

Note: These values are based on simplifying assumptions for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). In an actual detailed Bayesian analysis, we'd use more finely tuned priors and likelihoods based on more comprehensive data from graduate field distributions and personality alignments.
