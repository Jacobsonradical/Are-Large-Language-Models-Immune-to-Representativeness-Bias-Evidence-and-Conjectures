To address this question, let's first break down the information and calculate the required probabilities using Bayes' rule. The formula for Bayes' rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For all three fields, we make some reasonable assumptions about the probabilities:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that a student is enrolled in a specific field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability that the personality sketch E would be true if a student is enrolled in that specific field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that the personality sketch E would be true if a student is not enrolled in that specific field.

**Assumptions:**

- **P(E)**: The overall probability of obtaining the personality sketch E. This is usually computed as \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \)

- **Computer Science:**
  - P(H): Let's assume that the probability that any graduate student is in computer science is 0.2
  - P(E|H): Given our description of Adam, it's less likely though possible for someone in computer science to have such a profile. Let's assume this is 0.2
  - P(E|\neg H): This would be the prevalence of such a profile outside computer science. Probably higher; let's guess 0.5

- Business Administration:
  - P(H): Assume 0.15 as the baseline prevalence.
  - P(E|H): Business students might occasionally fit this description. Let's assume 0.2
  - P(E|\neg H): Again, 0.5

- Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
  - P(H): Assume 0.1 as this is likely less common.
  - P(E|H): Highly likely given the profile description. Let's say 0.7
  - P(E|\neg H): Again, 0.5

We can now estimate \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

To keep calculations simple, we'll estimate \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) \) and use averages when necessary:

1. **Computer Science**:
\[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.8 = 0.04 + 0.4 = 0.44 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.44} = \frac{0.04}{0.44} \approx 0.09 \]

2. **Business Administration**:
\[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.15 + 0.5 \cdot 0.85 = 0.03 + 0.425 = 0.455 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{0.455} = \frac{0.03}{0.455} \approx 0.066 \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(E) = 0.7 \cdot 0.1 + 0.5 \cdot 0.9 = 0.07 + 0.45 = 0.52 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.52} = \frac{0.07}{0.52} \approx 0.135 \]

**Final Results in Required Format:**

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.09,
  "business administration": 0.066,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.135
}
```

Note: These numbers are based on hypothetical probabilities and assumptions. More precise values would require actual statistical data.
