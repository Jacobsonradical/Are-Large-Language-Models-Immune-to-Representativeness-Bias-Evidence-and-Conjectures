To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis \( H \) (the field of study) given the evidence \( E \) (the personality sketch of Adam), we need to use Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

where \( P(E) \) can be computed using the law of total probability:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H_{1}) \cdot P(H_{1}) + P(E|H_{2}) \cdot P(H_{2}) + P(E|H_{3}) \cdot P(H_{3}) + \ldots
\]

For each hypothesis, let's denote:
- \( P(H) \) as the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) as the likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is enrolled in that particular field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) as the likelihood of observing Adam's traits given that he is not enrolled in that field.

While exact probabilities can be subjective without specific data, we can make informed estimates based on the personality sketch provided. Let's make the following educated guesses:

### Priors: \( P(H) \)
- The priors for each field could be based on the general distribution of graduate students in those fields.
  - Business Administration might have a higher prior due to popularity.
  - Agricultural and Veterinary Science might have a lower prior due to specialization.
  - Computer Science might have a moderately high prior due to demand in the tech industry.

Assumed Priors:
- \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.2 \)

### Likelihoods: \( P(E|H) \)
- Given Adam's characteristics:
  - For Business Administration:
    - Traits fit moderately well but not exceptionally. Puzzles and abstract concepts are not as aligned.
  - For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
    - Traits fit very well (nature, empathy, animals).
  - For Computer Science:
    - Traits fit reasonably well (puzzles, abstract concepts).

Assumed Likelihoods:
- \( P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.4 \)

### Evidence: \( P(E) \)
- Let's compute \( P(E) \):
\[
P(E) = P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) + P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) + P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.15 + 0.4 \cdot 0.2 = 0.04 + 0.075 + 0.08 = 0.195
\]

### Posterior: \( P(H|E) \)
Let's compute each posterior accordingly.

#### Business Administration:
\[
P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.195} \approx 0.205
\]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[
P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.15}{0.195} \approx 0.385
\]

#### Computer Science:
\[
P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.195} \approx 0.410
\]

Given these calculations, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.205,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.385,
  "computer science": 0.410
}
```
