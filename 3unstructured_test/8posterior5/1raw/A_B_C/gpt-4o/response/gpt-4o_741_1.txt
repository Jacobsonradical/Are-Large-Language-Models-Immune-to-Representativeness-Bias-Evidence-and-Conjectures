To use Bayes' theorem to compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field (denoted as \( P(H|E) \)), let's firstly assign plausible values to \( P(H) \) (the prior probability of Adam being in the specific field), \( P(E|H) \) (the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is in the specific field), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) (the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not in the specific field).

Here are the assumptions for each field, based on the personality sketch provided:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H) \) (prior): The a priori probability might be reasonably higher than many fields since Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and animals.
   - \( P(E|H) \) (likelihood): Given that Adam is in this field, the likelihood of the personality traits matching is high.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \) (alternative likelihood): The likelihood of the traits matching if Adam is in any other field could be lower since the traits are quite aligned with this field.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(H) \) (prior): The a priori probability might be reasonably high due to the prevalence of this field and his interest in solving puzzles.
   - \( P(E|H) \) (likelihood): Given that Adam is in this field, the likelihood of the personality traits matching is moderate (intelligence and abstract concepts, but lacks a direct link to nature and animals).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \) (alternative likelihood): The likelihood of the traits matching if Adam is in any other field could be similar.

3. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H) \) (prior): The a priori probability might be lower compared to others due to lack of specific personality match.
   - \( P(E|H) \) (likelihood): Traits like empathy are sought after in business administration, but the overall match is weaker.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \) (alternative likelihood): The likelihood of the traits matching if Adam is in any other field is higher than zero but less specific.

Now we need to compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since computing \( P(E) \) involves an overall integration/sum of all hypotheses, let's assume it as a normalization constant \( K \).

Here are the plausible values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \):

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H) = 0.3 \) (higher prior)
   - \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \) (high likelihood)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \) (lower alternative likelihood)

2. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(H) = 0.25 \) (moderate prior)
   - \( P(E|H) = 0.6 \) (moderate likelihood)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.35 \) (similar likelihood)

3. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (lower prior)
   - \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \) (low likelihood)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \) (moderate alternative likelihood)

We can now apply Bayes' rule for each:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.3}{K} = \frac{0.24}{K} \]

2. **Computer Science:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.25}{K} = \frac{0.15}{K} \]

3. **Business Administration:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.15}{K} = \frac{0.045}{K} \]

Assuming \( K \) normalizes sum to 1:

\[ K = 0.24 + 0.15 + 0.045 = 0.435 \]

Therefore, the normalized posteriors are:

\[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) = \frac{0.24}{0.435} \approx 0.552 \]
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.15}{0.435} \approx 0.345 \]
\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.435} \approx 0.103 \]

So, summarizing:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.552,
  "computer science": 0.345,
  "business administration": 0.103
