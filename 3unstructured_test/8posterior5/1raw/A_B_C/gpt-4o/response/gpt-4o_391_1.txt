To compute \( P(H|E) \), we will use Bayes' rule which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is common across all fields we are comparing, our comparisons are based on the numerator \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \). 

For each field, we need to make educated estimates for:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of someone being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch given someone is in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch given someone is not in that field.

We will then use these estimates to calculate \( P(H|E) \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- \( P(H) \): Let's assume the general probability that a graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science is \( 0.05 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's personality sketch (love for nature, plants, animals), he fits extremely well in this field. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) = \( 0.9 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): For fields other than agricultural and veterinary science, Adam's traits might not fit as well. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) \) = \( 0.2 \).

### Business Administration

- \( P(H) \): Let's assume the probability that a graduate student is in business administration is \( 0.15 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Adam's traits do not specifically align with business administration. Let's say this is moderately unlikely, \( P(E|H) \) = \( 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Traits needed for business administration are different from those provided in the sketch, so let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) \) = \( 0.4 \).

### Computer Science

- \( P(H) \): Assume the probability that a graduate student is in computer science is \( 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which are relevant to computer science. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) = \( 0.6 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): While not a perfect fit, his personality might moderately fit areas outside CS, letâ€™s assume \( P(E|\neg H) \) = \( 0.3 \).

Using these estimates and Bayes' rule:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{Ag & Vet Sci}} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} = \frac{0.045}{P(E)} \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{Business Administration}} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} = \frac{0.015}{P(E)} \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{Computer Science}} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.12}{P(E)} \]

Now we will simplify \( \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \) without calculating \( P(E) \):

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{0.045}{P(E)} \approx 0.45 \),
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.015}{P(E)} \approx 0.15 \),
  "computer science": \( \frac{0.12}{P(E)} \approx 0.30 \)
}

These proportions show that Adam is most likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, followed by computer science, and least likely in business administration, based on the given personality sketch.
