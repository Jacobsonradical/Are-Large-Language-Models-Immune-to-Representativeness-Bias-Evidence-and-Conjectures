To determine the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and conditional probabilities \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Although we don't have exact statistical data, we can make reasoned estimates based on typical characteristics and involvement in these fields.

Assumptions:
- We assume the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) would naturally be higher for more popular graduate programs and lower for niche ones.
- Adam’s personality sketch (curiosity about nature, love of animals, and appreciation for hard work) aligns particularly well with Agricultural and Veterinary Science, somewhat with Computer Science due to his intelligence and problem-solving, but less so with Business Administration.

Given these assumptions, here are rough estimates:

### Business Administration
- \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \) (prior probability): Relatively high as Business Administration is a common field.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): Likely moderate to low, as the personality sketch doesn't align strongly with Business Administration traits.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \): Higher, as several other fields might fit the personality sketch better.

### Estimations:
- \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.8 \)

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \]

### Computer Science
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): Relatively high due to the popularity of the field.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): Moderate, given his intelligence and problem-solving skills align but not perfectly.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \): Moderate to high as there are multiple other fields where Adam’s traits may fit well. 

### Estimations:
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.7 \)

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \): Lower due to it being a less common field.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \): Very high, as his traits align very well with this field.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \): Lower, as fewer fields fit his personality sketch this strongly.

### Estimations:
- \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.8 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.2 \)

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) P(H_{\text{AVS}})}{P(E)} \]

Bringing it all together:
We don't have \( P(E) \), but we can denote our estimations relative to each other. Given that \( P(E) \) will be the same for all fields, it will cancel out when comparing relative probabilities.

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.15,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4
}
```

These are normalized values relative to each other based on our assumptions and estimations. The highest likelihood is for Agricultural and Veterinary Science based on the given personality sketch.
