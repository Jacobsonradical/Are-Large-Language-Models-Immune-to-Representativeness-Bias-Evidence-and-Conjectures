Let's start by stating Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we are comparing the likelihoods of multiple fields given the personality sketch, we can ignore the normalization factor \(P(E)\) because it is the same for all fields. Therefore, we can focus on comparing \(P(E|H) \cdot P(H)\) for each field to estimate \(P(H|E)\).

Let's assign values based on the personality sketch provided. 

1. **Business Administration**
    - \(P(H)\): Assume a relatively high probability because Business Administration is a common field of study.
    - \(P(E|H)\): The personality traits (love for nature and animals, solving puzzles, strong empathy) don't particularly align with typical traits necessary for Business Administration.
    - \(P(E|\neg H)\): Higher, considering other fields may align better with the personality traits.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
    - \(P(H)\): Assume moderate probability as it is less common than Business Administration.
    - \(P(E|H)\): The personality traits strongly align with this field, making it a good match.
    - \(P(E|\neg H)\): Lower, as this personality sketch fits well within the Agricultural and Veterinary Science profile.

3. **Computer Science**
    - \(P(H)\): Moderate to high probability because it is a common and broad field.
    - \(P(E|H)\): The interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence align well, but the love for nature and animals is less typical.
    - \(P(E|\neg H)\): Moderate, as other fields might equally match the less technical interests.

Given these subjective assessments, let's assign some numerical values for better approximation:

1. **Business Administration**
    - \(P(H) = 0.25\)
    - \(P(E|H) = 0.1\)
    - \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.3\)

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
    - \(P(H) = 0.15\)
    - \(P(E|H) = 0.8\)
    - \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.1\)

3. **Computer Science**
    - \(P(H) = 0.30\)
    - \(P(E|H) = 0.4\)
    - \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.2\)

We compute:

1. **Business Administration**
    \[
    P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \approx 0.083
    \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
    \[
    P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.1} \approx 1.2
    \]

3. **Computer Science**
    \[
    P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.30}{0.2} \approx 0.6
    \]

Now, normalize them relatively:

\[
\text{Total sum} = 0.083 + 1.2 + 0.6 \approx 1.883
\]

Therefore, we normalize:

\[
\text{Business Administration} = \frac{0.083}{1.883} \approx 0.044
\]
\[
\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science} = \frac{1.2}{1.883} \approx 0.637
\]
\[
\text{Computer Science} = \frac{0.6}{1.883} \approx 0.319
\]

Final results:

{
  "business administration": 0.044,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.637,
  "computer science": 0.319
