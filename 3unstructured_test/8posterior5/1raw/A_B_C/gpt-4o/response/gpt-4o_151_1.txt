Firstly, let's define the terms used in Bayes' Theorem:

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field. Without specific prior information, we  assume these probabilities are initially equal for each field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in that specific field.
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in that specific field given the personality sketch \( E \).

Using Bayes' Theorem, the formula is: \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \). For multiple hypotheses, we use the normalization factor to ensure the probabilities add up to 1 across all considered hypotheses.

### Estimations:
- **Computer Science**:
  - \( P(H) = \frac{1}{3} \)
  - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, this is less likely for a computer science student, possibly around 0.1.
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Excluding computer science and averaging out across other disciplines, which seems more fitting for Adam's personality, let's set it at about 0.4.
  - Calculation: \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times \frac{1}{3}}{P(E)} \)

- **Business Administration**:
  - \( P(H) = \frac{1}{3} \)
  - \( P(E|H) \): This field is also less likely given Adam's interests and personality, possibly around 0.05.
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Similar to the previous, around 0.4.
  - Calculation: \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \times \frac{1}{3}}{P(E)} \)

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  - \( P(H) = \frac{1}{3} \)
  - \( P(E|H) \): This field aligns well with Adam's interests and personality. Let's assume a higher probability, around 0.8.
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Remaining consistent with prior estimations at 0.4.
  - Calculation: \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times \frac{1}{3}}{P(E)} \)

### Normalized Calculations:
To find the normalization factor \( P(E) \), we sum up all numerators:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{cs}})P(H_{\text{cs}}) + P(E|H_{\text{ba}})P(H_{\text{ba}}) + P(E|H_{\text{avs}})P(H_{\text{avs}})
\]

\[
P(E) = 0.1 \times \frac{1}{3} + 0.05 \times \frac{1}{3} + 0.8 \times \frac{1}{3}
\]

Adding these fractions:

\[
P(E) = \frac{0.1}{3} + \frac{0.05}{3} + \frac{0.8}{3} = \frac{0.95}{3} = 0.3167
\]

Finally, calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each:

- Computer Science: \( P(H|E_{\text{cs}}) = \frac{0.1 \times \frac{1}{3}}{0.3167} \approx \frac{0.0333}{0.3167} \approx 0.105 \)
- Business Administration: \( P(H|E_{\text{ba}}) = \frac{0.05 \times \frac{1}{3}}{0.3167} \approx \frac{0.0167}{0.3167} \approx 0.053 \)
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( P(H|E_{\text{avs}}) = \frac{0.8 \times \frac{1}{3}}{0.3167} \approx \frac{0.2667}{0.3167} \approx 0.842 \)
