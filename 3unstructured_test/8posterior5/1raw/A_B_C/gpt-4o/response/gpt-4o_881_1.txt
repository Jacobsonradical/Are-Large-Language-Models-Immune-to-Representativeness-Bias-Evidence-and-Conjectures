We will use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \), the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalization constant common to all hypotheses, it will not affect the relative probabilities, so we will only compute \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for each field and then normalize to get \( P(H|E) \).

Let's assume the following (subjective) priors and likelihoods:

### Hypothesis 1: Business Administration
- **P(H)**: Probability that Adam is in Business Administration.
  - Graduate programs are quite diverse, but assuming Business Administration (MBA and related) is relatively common, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
- **P(E|H)**: Probability of the personality sketch given Business Administration.
  - The traits described (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, etc.) are less likely in Business Administration, where the focus is typically more on leadership, management, and economics. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability of the personality sketch given NOT in Business Administration.
  - This includes all other fields, so to simplify, we assume it to be a midway point, \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

Therefore:
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

### Hypothesis 2: Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: Probability that Adam is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
  - This field is less common but more closely aligned with the personality sketch. Assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
- **P(E|H)**: Probability of the personality sketch given Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
  - Traits like empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature are highly consistent. Assume \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability of the personality sketch given NOT in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
  - Assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

Therefore:
\[ P(H|E)_{Agri} \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.09 \]

### Hypothesis 3: Computer Science
- **P(H)**: Probability that Adam is in Computer Science.
  - Computer Science is a popular field. Assuming \( P(H) = 0.3 \).
- **P(E|H)**: Probability of the personality sketch given Computer Science.
  - The traits of puzzle-solving, high intelligence, and abstract thinking somewhat align, but the strong empathy and love for animals are less consistent. Assume \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability of the personality sketch given NOT in Computer Science.
  - Assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

Therefore:
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.3 \cdot 0.3 = 0.09 \]

Now we normalize these probabilities:

Sum = \( 0.02 + 0.09 + 0.09 = 0.2 \)

So,

\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.02}{0.2} = 0.1 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{Agri} = \frac{0.09}{0.2} = 0.45 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.09}{0.2} = 0.45 \]

Thus, the final result in the required format is:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.45,
  "computer science": 0.45
}
```
