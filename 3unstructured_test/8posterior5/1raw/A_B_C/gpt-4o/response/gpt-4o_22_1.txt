To compute the desired probabilities, I'll follow the Bayesian rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of being enrolled in a particular field.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of the evidence given that the hypothesis is true.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\) is the likelihood of the evidence given that the hypothesis is false.
- \(P(E)\) is the overall probability of the evidence.

However, instead of directly calculating \( P(H|E) \), I’ll provide a qualitative assessment for each scenario:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): Estimate around 0.05 (as it's relatively less common compared to other fields, but reasonable given the context).
- \( P(E|H) \): High, given Adam's appreciation for nature, plants, and animals, which aligns well with this field. Let's set this to 0.8.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Lower, as his attributes are somewhat less likely in other fields. Estimate 0.3.

Computing:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04 \]

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): Higher, say around 0.15, as it’s a more common graduate field but not strongly related to Adam's interests.
- \( P(E|H) \): Lower, given his specific interests in nature and empathy, though some aspects (like intelligence and understanding hard work) could fit. Set this to 0.2.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Standard, since his traits are somewhat generic. Estimate 0.4.

Computing:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \cdot 0.15 = 0.03 \]

### Computer Science
- \( P(H) \): Moderate, around 0.1, given the popularity of the field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Higher, given his intelligence and puzzle-solving skills, which are well-suited for computer science. Set this to 0.7.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Higher as well, due to the general nature of his traits. Estimate 0.5.

Computing:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.7 \cdot 0.1 = 0.07 \]

Now we normalize these values to sum to 1:

\[ \text{Sum} = 0.04 + 0.03 + 0.07 = 0.14 \]

Normalized:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.04 / 0.14 ≈ 0.286,
  "business administration": 0.03 / 0.14 ≈ 0.214,
  "computer science": 0.07 / 0.14 ≈ 0.5
}

Thus, after normalization, the results are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.286,
  "business administration": 0.214,
  "computer science": 0.5
}

This process provides an illustrative assessment of how likely Adam could be enrolled in each of these fields based on his personality sketch.
