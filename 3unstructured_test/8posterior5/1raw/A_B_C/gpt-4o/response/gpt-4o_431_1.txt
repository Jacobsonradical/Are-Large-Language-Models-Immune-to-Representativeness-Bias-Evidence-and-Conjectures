To evaluate the probabilities, we need to use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same across all fields for comparison, we'll focus on the relative quantities of \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) to determine the likelihoods.

Let's denote the key probabilities based on Adam's personality sketch:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **P(H)**: Likelihood that a graduate student is enrolled in this field. For simplicity, we'll assume a moderate probability since it encompasses Adam's interest in nature and animals.
   - **P(E|H)**: High. Adam’s traits (love for nature, animals, empathy) strongly align with this field.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: Low. These traits are less likely in other fields.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - **P(H)**: Likelihood that a graduate student is enrolled in this field. It's a popular field, so we'll assume a relatively high prior.
   - **P(E|H)**: Moderate to low. While abstract thinking aligns, Adam's empathy, and love for nature and animals do not strongly align with the typical motivations for studying computer science.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: Moderate. Traits like intelligence and abstract thinking can be found elsewhere.

3. **Business Administration**:
   - **P(H)**: Likelihood that a graduate student is enrolled in this field. It's also a common field, so we'll assume a relatively moderate prior.
   - **P(E|H)**: Low. Adam’s traits do not strongly align with the typical profile of a business administration student.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: Low. These traits are less typical for business administration.

### Probability Assessment

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \) (since moderate likelihood)
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \) (traits strongly align)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \) (traits less likely in other fields)

   Therefore, using Bayes' rule approximation:
   \[
   P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.3}{0.9 \cdot 0.3 + (1 - 0.3) \cdot 0.2} \approx \frac{0.27}{0.27 + 0.14} \approx \frac{0.27}{0.41} \approx 0.66
   \]

2. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.4 \) (high likelihood due to popularity)
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.4 \) (traits moderately align)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \) (traits somewhat common elsewhere)

   Therefore,
   \[
   P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.4}{0.4 \cdot 0.4 + (1 - 0.4) \cdot 0.3} \approx \frac{0.16}{0.16 + 0.18} \approx \frac{0.16}{0.34} \approx 0.47
   \]

3. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \) (moderate likelihood)
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \) (traits poorly align)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \) (traits can be common elsewhere)

   Therefore,
   \[
   P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{0.2 \cdot 0.3 + (1 - 0.3) \cdot 0.3} \approx \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.21} \approx \frac{0.06}{0.27} \approx 0.22
   \]
