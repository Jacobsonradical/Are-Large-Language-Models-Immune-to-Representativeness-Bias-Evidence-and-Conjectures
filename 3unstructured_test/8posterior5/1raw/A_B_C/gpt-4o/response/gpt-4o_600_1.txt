Sure, let's use Bayes' rule \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \) to estimate the probabilities. Here we'll focus on making plausible estimations for the given fields.

### Initial Estimated Probabilities

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
    - **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that a randomly selected graduate student is in this field. Let’s assume \(0.05\) (since it's a less common graduate field).
    - **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given he is in this field. Given his interest in nature, animals, and empathy: \(0.8\).
    - **P(E|\neg H)**: Given he is not in this field, let’s assume \(0.2\) for comparability with broader fields.

2. **Business Administration**
    - **P(H)**: Let's assume \(0.15\) as a typical graduate concentration.
    - **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam’s sketch if he is in business admin. Given his empathy and intelligence, but less about plants and animals: \(0.2\).
    - **P(E|\neg H)**: Given he is not in business admin, this remains: \(0.4\).

3. **Computer Science**
    - **P(H)**: Let's assume \(0.2\) given its commonality.
    - **P(E|H)**: Given interest in puzzles and abstract concepts fits well, but less about nature empathy: \(0.5\).
    - **P(E|\neg H)**: Given not in computer science: \(0.3\).

### Calculating Posteriors Using Bayes' Rule

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)}
   \]

2. **Business Administration**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)}
   \]

3. **Computer Science**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)}
   \]

Since \(P(E)\) is a normalizing constant and same for all calculations, relative comparison is more straightforward. Considering similar scaling effects:

\[
P(H|E)_{agsci} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} = 0.04/P(E)
\]
\[
P(H|E)_{bus} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} = 0.03/P(E)
\]
\[
P(H|E)_{cs} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = 0.1/P(E)
\]

If we normalize these values:

1. \[
   P(H|E)_{agsci} \approx \frac{0.04}{0.17} \approx 0.24
   \]

2. \[
   P(H|E)_{bus} \approx \frac{0.03}{0.17} \approx 0.18
   \]

3. \[
   P(H|E)_{cs} \approx \frac{0.1}{0.17} \approx 0.58
   \]

Finally, the computed probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.24,
  "business administration": 0.18,
  "computer science": 0.58
}
