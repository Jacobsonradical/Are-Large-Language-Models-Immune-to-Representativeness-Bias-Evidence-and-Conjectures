To estimate the probability of Adam being enrolled in different fields based on his personality sketch (E), we can apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, given that the marginal probability \( P(E) \) is the same for all hypotheses, we can use a simplified form for relative comparison:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Let's break down the estimations for each field and compute these relative probabilities.

1. **Business Administration:**
   
   - \( P(H) \): This can be assumed to be relatively high due to a large number of students in such programs.
   - \( P(E|H) \): This is likely to be low because Adam's personality traits (strong empathy, love for animals, interest in nature) do not fit well with typical traits for a business administration student.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likely to be higher than \( P(E|H) \) due to fields that better match Adam's described personality.

2. **Computer Science:**

   - \( P(H) \): This can be assumed to be moderately high, reflecting the popularity of the field.
   - \( P(E|H) \): This might be moderate since computer science requires high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts, but the love for nature and animals is less common.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likely higher than \( P(E|H) \) given fields with closer alignment to Adam's interests in nature and animals.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

   - \( P(H) \): This is likely proportional to the number of students in the field, typically lower than computer science or business administration.
   - \( P(E|H) \): This is very high because Adam's traits fit very well with this field (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Lower compared to \( P(E|H) \) as this field strongly aligns with Adam's personality.

By assigning rough estimations, we can then compare these:

# Assigning rough values:
- \( P(H) \) for Business Administration: 0.3
- \( P(H) \) for Computer Science: 0.2
- \( P(H) \) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.1

- \( P(E|H) \) for Business Administration: 0.05
- \( P(E|H) \) for Computer Science: 0.2
- \( P(E|H) \) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.8

Using Bayes:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Let's compute:

- Business Administration:
  \[ P(H|E) \propto 0.05 \cdot 0.3 = 0.015 \]

- Computer Science:
  \[ P(H|E) \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.2 = 0.04 \]

- Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
  \[ P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]

Normalizing these for comparison (scaling such that the sums could sum to 1 for consistency):

Total = 0.015 + 0.04 + 0.08 = 0.135

{
  "business administration": 0.015 / 0.135 ≈ 0.111,
  "computer science": 0.04 / 0.135 ≈ 0.296,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08 / 0.135 ≈ 0.593
}

Thus, the relative probabilities (scaled) are:

{
  "business administration": 0.111,
  "computer science": 0.296,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.593
}

These numerical values are just an estimation and not definitive but illustrate the relative likelihood given the personality traits described for Adam.
