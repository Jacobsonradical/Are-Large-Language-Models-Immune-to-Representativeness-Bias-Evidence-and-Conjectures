To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood of the evidence given that Adam is not in the field \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Bayes' rule states:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
where \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \).

First, let's assign a prior \( P(H) \) for each field based on general knowledge and intuition about the distribution of graduate studies in the U.S.:

- Business administration: Graduate business programs are quite common.
- Computer science: Also a common field, especially growing in the data-driven and tech-oriented society.
- Agricultural and veterinary science: Less common compared to the other two fields.

Next, assess the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for each field based on Adam's personality sketch:

1. **Business administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): Let's assume 0.2 as a starting estimation.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Moderately unlikely. The personality sketch doesn't strongly align with typical business administration traits.
   - \( P(E|H) \) estimate: 0.1.

2. **Computer science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Let's assume 0.3 because computer science is quite prevalent.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Likely. Adam's intelligence, problem-solving skills, and curiosity fit well within this field.
   - \( P(E|H) \) estimate: 0.5.

3. **Agricultural and veterinary science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Let's assume 0.1, which is lower due to its relatively lower enrollment.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Highly likely. Strong alignment with Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and warm empathy.
   - \( P(E|H) \) estimate: 0.8.

Now \( P(E|\neg H) \) will be the weighted average probability across all the fields not mentioned:
\[
P(E|\neg H) = \sum_{i \neq H} P(E|H_i)P(H_i)
\]
Using the complementary probabilities and simplifying, we can then estimate:

1. **Business administration**:
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): We're not given explicit estimates for other fields, but let's assume it to be moderately likely given Adam's traits don't strongly exclude many fields.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \) estimate: 0.3.

2. **Computer science**:
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Slightly less, since CS aligns well.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \) estimate: 0.2.

3. **Agricultural and veterinary science**:
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Moderately likely since Adam's traits fit well here.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \) estimate: 0.3.

Now, applying Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
Where \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \)

\[
\begin{align*}
P(E)_{business\ admin} = & (0.1 \times 0.2) + (0.3 \times 0.8) \\
                        = & 0.02 + 0.24 = 0.26 \\
P(H|E)_{business\ admin} = & \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.26} \approx 0.077 \\
\end{align*}
\]

\[
\begin{align*}
P(E)_{computer\ science} = & (0.5 \times 0.3) + (0.2 \times 0.7) \\
                          = & 0.15 + 0.14 = 0.29 \\
P(H|E)_{computer\ science} = & \frac{0.5 \times 0.3}{0.29} \approx 0.517 \\
\end{align*}
\]

\[
\begin{align*}
P(E)_{agricultural\ \&\ veterinary\ science} = & (0.8 \times 0.1) + (0.3 \times 0.9) \\
                                              = & 0.08 + 0.27 = 0.35 \\
P(H|E)_{agricultural\ \&\ veterinary\ science} = & \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.35} \approx 0.229 \\
\end{align*}
\]

Final results:

\[
{
  "business administration": 0.077,
  "computer science": 0.517,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.229
}
\]

These results suggest that computer science is the most probable field of study for Adam given the personality sketch, followed by agricultural and veterinary science.
