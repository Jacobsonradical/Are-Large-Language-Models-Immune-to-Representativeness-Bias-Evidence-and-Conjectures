To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of Adam having the personality traits described (E) given that he is in a particular field (H).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in a particular field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of Adam having those personality traits regardless of the field (constant for all fields so it can be normalized out in the final comparison).

### Assumptions:
1. \( P(H) \) is not explicitly provided, so we'll assume equal priors across the fields unless there's obvious evidence pointing otherwise.
2. We will assign reasonable estimates to \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \) based on the given personality sketch and typical attributes of those fields.

### Estimates:
Let's assume the following estimates for the computations:

- \( P(H) \):
  - Business Administration: 0.2
  - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.2
  - Computer Science: 0.2
  The remaining 0.4 could be attributed to other possible graduate fields.

- \( P(E|H) \):
  - Business Administration: 0.3 (Adam’s traits like empathy and understanding of dedication could fit, but a genuine curiosity about nature and love for animals might not be strongly relevant.)
  - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.7 (Adam’s traits fit closely, especially his curiosity about nature and love for animals.)
  - Computer Science: 0.5 (His intelligence and problem-solving skills align well, but his empathy and love for nature might be less common.)

Since \( P(E) \) is constant, we can drop it for comparative purposes.

### Computing \( P(H|E) \):

- **Business Administration:**
  \[
  P(H|E)_{\text{Business Administration}} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx 0.3 \cdot 0.2 = 0.06
  \]

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
  \[
  P(H|E)_{\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx 0.7 \cdot 0.2 = 0.14
  \]

- **Computer Science:**
  \[
  P(H|E)_{\text{Computer Science}} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx 0.5 \cdot 0.2 = 0.10
  \]

### Final Result:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.06,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.14,
  "computer science": 0.10
}
```

These values are proportional. If we were to normalize them (sum to 1), the exact values might change, but the ranking and relative strengths will remain the same.
