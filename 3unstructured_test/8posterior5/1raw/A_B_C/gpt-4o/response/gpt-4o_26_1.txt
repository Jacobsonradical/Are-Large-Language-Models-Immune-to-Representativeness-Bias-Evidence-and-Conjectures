Sure, let's start by estimating the probabilities for each field:

**1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- \(\mathbf{P(H)}\): The prior probability that a given graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This is relatively low compared to fields like computer science or business, so let's assume \( \mathbf{P(H)} = 0.05 \).
- \(\mathbf{P(E|H)}\): The probability of E given H, that Adam's personality and interests align with this field. Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation of hard work, this probability is quite high. Assume \( \mathbf{P(E|H)} = 0.8 \).
- \(\mathbf{P(E|\neg H)}\): The probability of E given not H, that Adam's interests would be described this way if he were in a different field. Since his attributes are quite aligned with this specific field, this will be lower. Let's assume \( \mathbf{P(E|\neg H)} = 0.2 \).

Using Bayes rule:
\[ \mathbf{P(H|E)} = \frac{\mathbf{P(E|H)} \cdot \mathbf{P(H)}}{\mathbf{P(E)}} \]
Assuming principles scale linearly and \( \mathbf{P(E)} \approx \mathbf{P(E|H)} \cdot \mathbf{P(H)} + \mathbf{P(E|\neg H)} \cdot (1 - \mathbf{P(H)}) \),
\[ \mathbf{P(E)} \approx 0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.95 = 0.04 + 0.19 = 0.23 \]
\[ \mathbf{P(H|E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.23} = \frac{0.04}{0.23} \approx 0.174 \]

**2. Computer Science:**
- \(\mathbf{P(H)}\): The prior probability a graduate student is in computer science, which is relatively high. Assume \( \mathbf{P(H)} = 0.3 \).
- \(\mathbf{P(E|H)}\): The probability of E given H. Given Adamâ€™s interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence, we can assign a fair chance to this but it's not as strongly aligned as agricultural science. Assume \( \mathbf{P(E|H)} = 0.5 \).
- \(\mathbf{P(E|\neg H)}\): The likelihood of E if Adam weren't in computer science. Assume \( \mathbf{P(E|\neg H)} = 0.3 \).

Using Bayes rule:
\[ \mathbf{P(E)} \approx 0.5 \cdot 0.3 + 0.3 \cdot 0.7 = 0.15 + 0.21 = 0.36 \]
\[ \mathbf{P(H|E)} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.3}{0.36} = \frac{0.15}{0.36} \approx 0.417 \]

**3. Business Administration:**
- \(\mathbf{P(H)}\): The prior probability a graduate student is in business administration, which is moderate. Assume \( \mathbf{P(H)} = 0.2 \).
- \(\mathbf{P(E|H)}\): Considering Adam's traits, there is not much alignment here. Assume \( \mathbf{P(E|H)} = 0.2 \).
- \(\mathbf{P(E|\neg H)}\): The general likelihood given E not being in Business. Assume \( \mathbf{P(E|\neg H)} = 0.4 \).

Using Bayes rule:
\[ \mathbf{P(E)} \approx 0.2 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8 = 0.04 + 0.32 = 0.36 \]
\[ \mathbf{P(H|E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.36} = \frac{0.04}{0.36} \approx 0.111 \]
