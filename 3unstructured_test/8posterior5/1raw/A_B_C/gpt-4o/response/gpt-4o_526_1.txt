Let's break this down by estimating the required probabilities for each field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. This field aligns well with Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals. However, the exact prior probability can be difficult to quantify without more context about the typical distribution of graduate students across fields. Let's estimate it to be moderate at **0.15**.
- **P(E|H)**: Probability of Adam having his characteristics given that he is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. This is likely to be high due to the strong match with his interests in nature and animals. We'll estimate this at **0.9**.
- **P(E|¬H)**: Probability of Adam having his characteristics given that he is enrolled in other fields. This would be lower because his traits are specifically aligned with Agricultural and Veterinary Science. We'll estimate this at **0.3**.

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in Business Administration. This field does not align strongly with Adam’s personality traits. Let's estimate this as relatively low at **0.05**.
- **P(E|H)**: Probability of Adam having his characteristics given that he is enrolled in Business Administration. Since his traits don’t strongly align, this will be low. We'll estimate this at **0.2**.
- **P(E|¬H)**: Probability of Adam having his characteristics given that he is enrolled in other fields. This may be similar to the prior probability of traits appearing randomly across other fields, approximately **0.4**.

### Computer Science
- **P(H)**: Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in Computer Science. This field requires high intelligence and an ability to understand abstract concepts, compatible with Adam’s traits. Let's estimate this at **0.3**.
- **P(E|H)**: Probability of Adam having his characteristics given that he is enrolled in Computer Science. The alignment with intelligence and puzzle-solving supports this, so we'll estimate this at **0.6**.
- **P(E|¬H)**: Probability of Adam having his characteristics given that he is enrolled in other fields. This would be moderate as his traits are not highly specific to Computer Science. We'll estimate this at **0.4**.

### Applying Bayes' Rule
Bayes' rule states that \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \), where \( P(E) \) can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

For simplicity, let's assume these three fields cover the main options for Adam.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)} \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(E) = (0.9 \times 0.15) + (0.3 \times 0.85) = 0.135 + 0.255 = 0.39 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.15}{0.39} = \frac{0.135}{0.39} \approx 0.346 \]

#### Business Administration:
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \times 0.05) + (0.4 \times 0.95) = 0.01 + 0.38 = 0.39 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.05}{0.39} = \frac{0.01}{0.39} \approx 0.026 \]

#### Computer Science:
\[ P(E) = (0.6 \times 0.3) + (0.4 \times 0.7) = 0.18 + 0.28 = 0.46 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.3}{0.46} = \frac{0.18}{0.46} \approx 0.391 \]
