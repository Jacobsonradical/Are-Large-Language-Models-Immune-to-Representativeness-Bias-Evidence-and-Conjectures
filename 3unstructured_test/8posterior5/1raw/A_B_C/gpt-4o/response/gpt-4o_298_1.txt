To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each of the fields, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the hypothesized field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence given the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence given Adam is not in the field.
- \( P(E) \) denotes the total probability of observing the evidence. 

We assume \( P(E) \) is constant for simplicity since we're comparing fields.

Hypothesis 1: Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): Since Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and a love for animals, the prior probability might be reasonably high. Let's assume this is \( 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's traits, the likelihood of observing the evidence if he is in this field seems very high. Let's assume this is \( 0.9 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): If Adam were not in this field, but still matched the evidence, might be lower. Let's assume this is \( 0.1 \).

Hypothesis 2: Computer Science
- \( P(H) \): Given that Adam is good at solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, the prior probability could be fairly moderate. Let's assume this is \( 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's traits related to intelligence and puzzle-solving, the likelihood if he is in this field is moderate. Let's assume this is \( 0.6 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): If Adam were not in this field, but still matched the evidence, it might be moderate. Let's assume this is \( 0.4 \).

Hypothesis 3: Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): The evidence does not strongly suggest a leaning towards business activities, so the prior probability might be lower. Let's assume this is \( 0.05 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): If he is in this field, the likelihood is lower given the personality sketch provided. Let's assume this is \( 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): If Adam is not in this field, but still has the traits described, might be moderate. Let's assume this is \( 0.5 \).

Calculate for each hypothesis:

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 \times 0.2}{P(E)} = 0.18 / P(E) \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.6 \times 0.1}{P(E)} = 0.06 / P(E) \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \times 0.05}{P(E)} = 0.01 / P(E) \]

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.18,
  "computer science": 0.06,
  "business administration": 0.01
}

Note that \( P(E) \) is the same for all hypotheses and does not need to be explicitly calculated for comparative purposes.
