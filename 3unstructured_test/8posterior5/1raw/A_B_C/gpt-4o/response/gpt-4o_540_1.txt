Let's denote:

- H₁: Hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science
- H₂: Hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science
- H₃: Hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in business administration

Given:

- E is the personality sketch of Adam.
- P(H) is the prior probability.
- P(E|H) is the likelihood.
- P(E|\neg H) is the likelihood of observing E if not enrolled in the specific field.

### Prior Probabilities (P(H))
These probabilities reflect the general likelihood of being in each field as a graduate student. For simplicity, we might use general proportions or make educated guesses based on common enrollment statistics:

- P(H₁) (agricultural and veterinary science): 0.1
- P(H₂) (computer science): 0.4
- P(H₃) (business administration): 0.3

### Likelihoods (P(E|H))
Based on the personality sketch, we can estimate how well the field matches Adam's characteristics.

- P(E|H₁): Adam’s love for nature, animals, and empathy strongly fit this field. Let's set this high.
  - P(E|H₁) ≈ 0.9
- P(E|H₂): Adam’s intelligence and abstract thinking align well with this field, but lack of direct interest in technology might lower the fit.
  - P(E|H₂) ≈ 0.6
- P(E|H₃): While intelligence and understanding of hard work align well, the direct interest in plants and animals does not align strongly with business.
  - P(E|H₃) ≈ 0.3

### Complement Likelihoods (P(E|¬H))
These are the probabilities of observing the personality sketch if Adam was not in that particular field, which we assume to be quite general.

- P(E|¬H₁) ≈ 0.4 (since some characteristics like empathy and intelligence are common)
- P(E|¬H₂) ≈ 0.6 (as interest in nature and animals somewhat contrasts with computer science)
- P(E|¬H₃) ≈ 0.7 (better alignment outside business administration, given direct nature and animal interest)

### Bayes Rule Application
Bayes' rule is defined as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) \) can be approximated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H₁)P(H₁) + P(E|H₂)P(H₂) + P(E|H₃)P(H₃) + ... \]

However, since we're focusing on the relative probabilities, we can skip the calculation of the total probability:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

### Combining Terms:

- Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
  \[ P(H₁|E) \approx \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{0.9 \cdot 0.1 + 0.6 \cdot 0.4 + 0.3 \cdot 0.3} \approx \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.24 + 0.09} \approx \frac{0.09}{0.42} \approx 0.214 \]

- Computer Science:
  \[ P(H₂|E) \approx \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.4}{0.9 \cdot 0.1 + 0.6 \cdot 0.4 + 0.3 \cdot 0.3} \approx \frac{0.24}{0.09 + 0.24 + 0.09} \approx \frac{0.24}{0.42} \approx 0.571 \]

- Business Administration:
  \[ P(H₃|E) \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.3}{0.9 \cdot 0.1 + 0.6 \cdot 0.4 + 0.3 \cdot 0.3} \approx \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.24 + 0.09} \approx \frac{0.09}{0.42} \approx 0.214 \]

Thus, the computed probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.214,
  "computer science": 0.571,
  "business administration": 0.214
}
