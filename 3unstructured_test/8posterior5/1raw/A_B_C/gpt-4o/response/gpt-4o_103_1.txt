To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Rule, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Estimate the Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This is the probability that Adam is enrolled in this field before considering the personality sketch.
2. **Estimate the Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in this particular field.
3. **Estimate the Complementary Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in this particular field.

We then use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we are only comparing relative probabilities, we do not need to compute \( P(E) \) explicitly. We will consider the relative values of \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

### Assumptions:
- For simplicity, assume equal priors \( P(H) \) for each field. Therefore, each prior \( P(H) \) is estimated tentatively as \( \frac{1}{3} \).
- Estimate \( P(E|H) \) by how well the personality traits match the field.
- Assume \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the aggregate likelihood of observing the personality sketch given not being in the specific field; for simplification, we will approximate this distribution uniformly across fields.

### Calculations:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - \( P(H) \approx \frac{1}{3}\)
   - Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy align well.
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \)
   - Assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \) because some traits can be found in other fields too.

2. **Computer Science**
   - \( P(H) \approx \frac{1}{3}\)
   - Intelligence and puzzle-solving are a good match, but less on nature and empathy.
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.4 \)
   - Assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.7 \) because the traits are somewhat less specific to computer science.

3. **Business Administration**
   - \( P(H) \approx \frac{1}{3}\)
   - Appreciation for hard work might align, but empathy and nature appreciation are less specific.
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \)
   - Assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.8 \) as thereâ€™s less alignment.

### Bayes Rule Application:

Given the computed likelihoods and priors:

- For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.9 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 0.3 \]

- For **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 0.133 \]

- For **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 0.066 \]

Putting together the relative probabilities:
