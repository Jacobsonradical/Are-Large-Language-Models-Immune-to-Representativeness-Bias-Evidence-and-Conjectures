Let's start the calculations using Bayes' rule.

Bayes' rule is as follows:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field, \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is in that field, and \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch.

For simplicity, let's assume an equal prior probability \( P(H) \) for each field. There could be various graduate fields Adam could be enrolled in, but we will focus only on the three given.

Let's assume that each field has an initial (prior) probability of 1/10 (0.1) as a rough estimate, though real prior probabilities may differ. 

### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): 0.1 (initial assumption)
- \( P(E|H) \): High, given the attributes (curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy which fits well with such fields). Let's estimate this as 0.9.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Represents how commonly the personality sketch fits someone not in this field. Assuming 9 other fields, we average this as low, 0.1.

### 2. Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): 0.1 (initial assumption)
- \( P(E|H) \): Low, given the mismatch between personality traits like curiosity about nature and empathy with typical business attributes. Let's estimate this as 0.1.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Represents how commonly the personality sketch fits someone not in this field. It can thus be higher compared to the fit. Let’s estimate it as 0.2.

### 3. Computer Science
- \( P(H) \): 0.1 (initial assumption)
- \( P(E|H) \): Moderate, considering intelligence and abstract thinking fits, but other traits might not. Let’s estimate 0.5.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Average fit for non-computer science fields. Let’s assume 0.1.

We assume \( P(E) \) is consistent across the fields in the short term.

### Calculations:
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E)_{agriculture} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{0.9 \cdot 0.1 + 0.1 \cdot 0.1 + 0.5 \cdot 0.1} = \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.01 + 0.05} = \frac{0.09}{0.15} \approx 0.60 \]

2. **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E)_{business} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.9 \cdot 0.1 + 0.1 \cdot 0.1 + 0.5 \cdot 0.1} = \frac{0.01}{0.09 + 0.01 + 0.05} = \frac{0.01}{0.15} \approx 0.067 \]

3. **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E)_{computer science} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.1}{0.9 \cdot 0.1 + 0.1 \cdot 0.1 + 0.5 \cdot 0.1} = \frac{0.05}{0.09 + 0.01 + 0.05} = \frac{0.05}{0.15} \approx 0.33 \]
