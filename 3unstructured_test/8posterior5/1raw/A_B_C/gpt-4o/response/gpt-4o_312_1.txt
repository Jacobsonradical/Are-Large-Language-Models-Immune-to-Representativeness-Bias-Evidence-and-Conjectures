To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we'll need to estimate the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \), using Bayes' Rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

We don't have explicit values, but we can make reasonable qualitative estimates based on the information provided:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - **Prior \( P(H) \)**: This is the proportion of graduate students likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, which might be relatively low compared to some other fields.
    - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, the likelihood that he fits this field is high.
    - **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is the probability of having his traits if he wasn't in this field, which might be lower since his interests align well with this field.
  
2. **Business Administration**:
    - **Prior \( P(H) \)**: This might have a moderately high prior, as many graduate students choose business administration.
    - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Given his traits, the likelihood of him being in business administration is probably lower, as his interests do not align strongly with business activities.
    - **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Since his traits do not fit well with business administration, \( P(E|\neg H) \) would be relatively higher.
  
3. **Computer Science**:
    - **Prior \( P(H) \)**: This is also a popular field, so the prior might be moderate to high.
    - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: While his high intelligence and puzzle-solving skills fit this field, his other interests in nature and animals do not. So, the likelihood is moderate.
    - **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of having his traits even if he wasn't in this field is also moderate.

Assuming \( P(H) \) is approximately equal for simplicity (this is often around 0.05-0.15 for each specific field in a large university), let's qualitatively estimate the values:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7 (assuming higher \( P(E|H) \) relative to \( P(E|\neg H) \)),
  "business administration": 0.1 (assuming lower \( P(E|H) \) relative to \( P(E|\neg H) \)),
  "computer science": 0.5 (assuming moderate \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \))
