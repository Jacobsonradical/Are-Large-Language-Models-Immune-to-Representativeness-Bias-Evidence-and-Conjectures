To calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we start with the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the normalizing constant (total probability of the evidence).

For simplicity, let's assume the following approximations for prior probabilities \( P(H) \) based on typical graduate enrollment distributions in the U.S.:

- Business administration (usually a large enrollment) \( P(H) = 0.25 \)
- Agricultural and veterinary science (typically smaller enrollment) \( P(H) = 0.10 \)
- Computer science (moderately large enrollment) \( P(H) = 0.20 \)

Next, we need to estimate \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \):
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of Adam's personality sketch being consistent with enrollment in the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the complement for the evidence across all other fields.

Given the personality sketch:
- Strong appreciation for nature and animals suggests high \( P(E|H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science.
- Business administration might be less likely given the focus on nature and animals.
- Computer science could be plausible given the intelligence and abstract thinking but less so given the love for nature and animals.

\[
\begin{aligned}
P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) &= 0.1 \\
P(E|\neg H_{\text{business administration}}) &= 0.2 \\
\\
P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) &= 0.9 \\
P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) &= 0.1 \\
\\
P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) &= 0.3 \\
P(E|\neg H_{\text{computer science}}) &= 0.2 \\
\end{aligned}
\]

Now applying Bayes' Rule:

\[
\begin{aligned}
P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) &= \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}})}{P(E)} \\
&= \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{P(E)} = \frac{0.025}{P(E)} \\
\\
P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) &= \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})}{P(E)} \\
&= \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.10}{P(E)} = \frac{0.09}{P(E)} \\
\\
P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) &= \frac{P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}})}{P(E)} \\
&= \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.20}{P(E)} = \frac{0.06}{P(E)} \\
\end{aligned}
\]

To get these into a normalized form, we find the total probability \( P(E) \), which is the sum of the probabilities across all hypotheses:

\[
P(E) = 0.025 + 0.09 + 0.06 = 0.175
\]

Therefore:

\[
\begin{aligned}
P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) &= \frac{0.025}{0.175} \approx 0.143 \\
P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) &= \frac{0.09}{0.175} \approx 0.514 \\
P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) &= \frac{0.06}{0.175} \approx 0.343 \\
\end{aligned}
\]
