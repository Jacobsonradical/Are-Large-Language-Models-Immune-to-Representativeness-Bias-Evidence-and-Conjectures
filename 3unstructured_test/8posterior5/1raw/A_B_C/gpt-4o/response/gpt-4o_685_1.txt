To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the following probabilities:
1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch given the field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in the field.

Bayes' Rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we are interested in comparative values rather than absolute probabilities, we don't need to calculate the exact value of \( P(E) \). Instead, we can focus on \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for each field individually and compare them.

### Estimations

1. **Computer Science**
   - \( P(H) \): Moderate, many graduate students are in computer science.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Low, the personality sketch focuses more on nature, animals, and empathy, which are not typically highlighted in a computer science profile.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Higher because people outside of computer science might match this profile better.
  
   Estimated values:
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \)
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \)
   
2. **Business Administration**
   - \( P(H) \): Moderate, many graduate students are in business administration.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Low, the personality traits listed do not strongly align with the typical traits associated with business administration.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Higher because people outside of business administration might match this profile better.
   
   Estimated values:
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \)
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \)
   
3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - \( P(H) \): Lower than computer science due to lower enrollment numbers overall.
   - \( P(E|H) \): High, this field strongly aligns with Adam's interests in nature, plants, animals, and empathy.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Lower because this profile is quite fitting for this specific field.
   
   Estimated values:
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \)
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.7 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \)

### Calculation of \( P(H|E) \)

Using the simplified comparison approach:

1. **Computer Science:**
   \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \cdot 0.3 = 0.06 \]

2. **Business Administration:**
   \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.7 \cdot 0.1 = 0.07 \]

### Final Probabilities

Based on the proportional values:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.06,
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.07
}
```

These values indicate the comparative likelihood of Adam being in each field based on the provided personality sketch. Agricultural and veterinary science stands out due to its alignment with Adam's interests and traits.
