Sure, let's go through each estimate step by step.

First, let's denote our terms clearly:
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the probability that Adam has the personality traits described given that he is enrolled in that field.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\) is the probability that Adam has the personality traits described given that he is not enrolled in that field.
- \(P(H|E)\) is the posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in the field given his personality traits.

We don't have the exact numbers, but we can make relative estimates based on typical characteristics associated with each field.

### Business Administration

- \(P(H)\): Let's assume the general prior for any specific field is around 0.1 (since there are many fields and we do not have specific data).
- \(P(E|H)\): In business administration, the traits described (empathy, love for animals, appreciation for hard work, etc.) are less common but not impossible. Let's assign this a relatively low probability, say 0.2.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): Given that Adam could be in many other fields that may value empathy and problem solving more, let's estimate this at 0.4.

Using Bayes' rule,
\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} 
\]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- \(P(H)\): Same prior probability of 0.1.
- \(P(E|H)\): These traits are very fitting for this field. Let's say 0.8.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): This is likely lower because other fields may not match as well with these traits. Let's say 0.3.

Applying Bayes' rule would give us a relatively higher probability.

### Computer Science

- \(P(H)\): Same prior of 0.1.
- \(P(E|H)\): Traits like love for solving puzzles and high intelligence fit well, but traits like empathy and a deep love for animals are less relevant. We could estimate this at 0.4.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): Estimated similarly to the business administration case at 0.4 because many other fields might not value these traits as strongly either.

Summarizing our estimates, we can list them as follows:

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \text{business administration: } \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \\
& \text{agricultural and veterinary science: } \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \\
& \text{computer science: } \frac{0.4 \times 0.1}{P(E)}
\end{aligned}
\]

Though we don't have the exact \(P(E)\), the relative posterior probabilities will help us determine the likelihood. Normalizing these, we get

\[
\text{business administration: } \approx 0.05
\]

\[
\text{agricultural and veterinary science: } \approx 0.27
\]

\[
\text{computer science: } \approx 0.11
\]

So, the relative probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.27,
  "computer science": 0.11
}
```
