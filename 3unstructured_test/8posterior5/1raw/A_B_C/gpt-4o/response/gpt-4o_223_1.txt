To estimate \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need the following quantities:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he was in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he was *not* in that field.

Given that exact probabilistic data is not specified, we will make qualitative estimates based on typical characteristics of students in these fields.

### Business Administration

- \( P(H) \): Business administration is a common field for graduate students, but it might be less likely compared to the more specialized field of agricultural and veterinary science for someone with Adam's personality traits. Assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
  
- \( P(E|H) \): Adam's traits of empathy, love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work do not strongly align with typical business administration students. Assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
  
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The overall probability of Adam having these traits regardless of field might be higher. Given the range of possible personalities across all other fields, assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

### Computer Science

- \( P(H) \): Computer science is also very common among graduate students. Assume \( P(H) = 0.3 \).
  
- \( P(E|H) \): Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which aligns with computer science, but his empathy and love of animals are less typical for the field. Assume \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).
  
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): As above, assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- \( P(H) \): This field is less common but perfectly aligns with Adam's traits. Assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
  
- \( P(E|H) \): Strongly aligns with Adam's personality, including his love for animals and curiosity about nature. Assume \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).
  
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Again, assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1-P(H)) \]

For simplicity, assume \( P(E) \) across all fields is constant enough to compare ratios directly. By proportion:

### Business Administration

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02 \]

### Computer Science

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \times 0.3 = 0.06 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.9 \times 0.1 = 0.09 \]

Finally, normalizing these proportions (i.e., dividing each by the sum of all three to ensure the probabilities sum to 1):

\[ \text{Sum of proportions} = 0.02 + 0.06 + 0.09 = 0.17 \]

### Final Probabilities

- Business Administration: \( \frac{0.02}{0.17} \approx 0.118 \)
- Computer Science: \( \frac{0.06}{0.17} \approx 0.353 \)
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( \frac{0.09}{0.17} \approx 0.529 \)

Remember, these are rough estimates based on available information, should add up to approximately 1 when applicable fields are considered.
