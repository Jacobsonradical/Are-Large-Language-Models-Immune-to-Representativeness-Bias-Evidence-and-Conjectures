To apply Bayes' Rule effectively, we'll follow these steps for each hypothesis (H):

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field.
   - To keep it general and assume no specific bias, we'll assign equal priors to each of the graduate fields.
   - P(H) for each field (computer science, business administration, agricultural and veterinary science) = 1/3.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the evidence (Adam's personality sketch) given that he is in the specific field.
   - For computer science, while intelligence and understanding abstract concepts fit, the rest might fit less perfectly.
   - For business administration, empathy and a warm heart could fit, but other traits might fit less well.
   - For agricultural and veterinary science, curiosity about nature, love for animals, warm heart, and empathy fit extremely well.

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is not in the specific field.
   - We average the traits fitting the two other fields. To simplify, let's take it as an average of how well the personality fits the other two fields.

4. **P(H|E)**: The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field given the personality sketch. We compute this using Bayes Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1) + P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2) + P(E|H3) \cdot P(H3) \]

Here are rough estimations for the values of P(E|H) and P(E|¬H):

- **computer science**:
  - P(E|H): Traits fitting CS are moderately matched. Let's say 0.4.
  - P(E|¬H): Average of fitting to business administration and agricultural/veterinary science. Let's say 0.7 (as it loosely matches).
- **business administration**:
  - P(E|H): Traits fitting BA are slightly moderate. Let's say 0.3.
  - P(E|¬H): Average of fitting to computer science and agricultural/veterinary science. Let's say 0.7 (as it loosely matches).
- **agricultural and veterinary science**:
  - P(E|H): Fits traits very well. Let's say 0.9.
  - P(E|¬H): Average of fitting CS and BA. Let's say 0.3.

Now, let's calculate P(H|E) for each field using simplified Bayes’ Rule.

For simplicity, assuming P(H) is equal across fields:
- P(computer science|E) ≈ (0.4 * (1/3)) / ((0.4 * (1/3)) + (0.3 * (1/3)) + (0.9 * (1/3)))
- P(business administration|E) ≈ (0.3 * (1/3)) / ((0.4 * (1/3)) + (0.3 * (1/3)) + (0.9 * (1/3)))
- P(agricultural and veterinary science|E) ≈ (0.9 * (1/3)) / ((0.4 * (1/3)) + (0.3 * (1/3)) + (0.9 * (1/3)))

Simplifying:
- Total probability P(E) = ((0.4 + 0.3 + 0.9) / 3) = 0.5333

Then:
- P(computer science|E) ≈ (0.4 / 3) / 0.5333 ≈ 0.25
- P(business administration|E) ≈ (0.3 / 3) / 0.5333 ≈ 0.1875
- P(agricultural and veterinary science|E) ≈ (0.9 / 3) / 0.5333 ≈ 0.5625

Thus, under our simplified calculations:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.25,
  "business administration": 0.1875,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5625
}
```
