To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in each field given the personality sketch \(E\), we can use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll estimate the probabilities for the hypotheses:

1. Agricultural and veterinary science (\(H_1\))
2. Business administration (\(H_2\))
3. Computer science (\(H_3\))

Let's define the terms:
- \(P(H_i)\): Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the \(i\)-th field.
- \(P(E|H_i)\): Likelihood of the personality sketch \(E\) given the field \(H_i\).
- \(P(E|\neg H_i)\): Likelihood of the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam was enrolled in a field other than \(H_i\).

We can make some reasonable assumptions based on Adam's personality sketch.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \(P(H)\): Assume there's a relatively moderate probability. Let's set this as \(0.2\).
- \(P(E|H)\): Given Adam's curiosity, love for nature, plants, and animals, the probability is quite high. Let's say \(0.8\).
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): Considering these traits are not very common in other fields but may be present in a few, we can set it as \(0.3\) for fields unrelated to nature.

\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{0.8 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.16}{0.16 + 0.24} = \frac{0.16}{0.4} = 0.4 \]

### Business Administration
- \(P(H)\): Assume a low probability because his traits don't strongly align with business administration. Let's set this as \(0.1\).
- \(P(E|H)\): Given Adam's personality, the probability is low. Let's set it as \(0.1\).
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): Likelihood of the personality sketch being associated with other fields is moderate. Let's set it as \(0.5\).

\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.1 \cdot 0.1 + 0.5 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.45} = \frac{0.01}{0.46} \approx 0.0217 \]

### Computer Science
- \(P(H)\): Assume a moderate probability. Let's set this as \(0.3\).
- \(P(E|H)\): Given Adam's intelligence and puzzle-solving skills, the probability is moderate. Set it as \(0.5\).
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): Let's assume a moderate likelihood. Set it as \(0.5\).

\[ P(H_3|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.3}{0.5 \cdot 0.3 + 0.5 \cdot 0.7} = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.35} = \frac{0.15}{0.5} = 0.3 \]

Based on these calculations, we can estimate:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.0217,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
