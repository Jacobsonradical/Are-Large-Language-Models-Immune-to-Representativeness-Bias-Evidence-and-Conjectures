Certainly! To evaluate \( P(H|E) \), we need to assess \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Here's how we can do it for each field:

1. **Business Administration:**
    - \( P(H) \): The general probability that a graduate student is studying business administration.
    - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that someone studying business administration matches Adam’s personality sketch.
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that someone not studying business administration matches Adam’s personality sketch.

2. **Computer Science:**
    - \( P(H) \): The general probability that a graduate student is studying computer science.
    - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that someone studying computer science matches Adam’s personality sketch.
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that someone not studying computer science matches Adam’s personality sketch.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
    - \( P(H) \): The general probability that a graduate student is studying agricultural and veterinary science.
    - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that someone studying agricultural and veterinary science matches Adam’s personality sketch.
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that someone not studying agricultural and veterinary science matches Adam’s personality sketch.

Now let's estimate these values:

### Business Administration:
- \( P(H) \): Assume around 1/10 (0.1) given the variety of fields.
- \( P(E|H) \): Low, because Adam's personality suggests a deep connection with nature and less overlap with typical business profiles, let's say 0.05.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Higher as his interests could match more closely to other fields, let's assume 0.2.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

### Computer Science:
- \( P(H) \): Assume around 1/8 (0.125) given the popularity of the field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Moderate, because his intelligence and puzzle-solving skill align with some aspects of computer science, let’s say 0.4.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Moderate in other fields too, let's assume 0.3.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- \( P(H) \): Given his personality, it might be a less common but highly fitting field, let’s assume 1/20 (0.05).
- \( P(E|H) \): High, because of the alignment with his interests in nature, plants, and animals, let's say 0.8.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Lower in other fields, let’s assume 0.2.

Now, assuming :
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

### Calculations:

#### Business Administration:
\[ P(E)_{ba} = 0.05 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9 = 0.005 + 0.18 = 0.185 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{ba} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{0.185} = \frac{0.005}{0.185} \approx 0.027 \]

#### Computer Science:
\[ P(E)_{cs} = 0.4 \cdot 0.125 + 0.3 \cdot 0.875 = 0.05 + 0.2625 = 0.3125 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{cs} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.125}{0.3125} = \frac{0.05}{0.3125} \approx 0.16 \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(E)_{ag} = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.95 = 0.04 + 0.19 = 0.23 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{ag} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.23} = \frac{0.04}{0.23} \approx 0.174 \]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately:

{
  "business administration": 0.027,
  "computer science": 0.16,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.174
}

Keep in mind these are rough estimates and the actual values may vary based on more precise data and context.
