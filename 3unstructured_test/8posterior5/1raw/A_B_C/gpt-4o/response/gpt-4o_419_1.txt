To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (i.e., Adam being enrolled in a particular field), \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis, and \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of the evidence given other fields, while \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

Given there are multiple fields of specialization, \( P(E) \) can be calculated as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{CS}})P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|H_{\text{AVS}})P(H_{\text{AVS}}) + P(E|H_{\text{BA}})P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}} \wedge \neg H_{\text{AVS}} \wedge \neg H_{\text{BA}})P(\neg H_{\text{CS}} \wedge \neg H_{\text{AVS}} \wedge \neg H_{\text{BA}}) \]

Let's assume some realistic prior probabilities based on general enrollment statistics for graduate students in the U.S.:

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.2 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.15 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.25 \]

And let's assume for other fields \( P(\neg H_{\text{CS}} \wedge \neg H_{\text{AVS}} \wedge \neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.4 \).

Now let's assess \( P(E|H) \):

**Computer Science (CS):**
Given the evidence E, the likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \):
  - High intelligence good at understanding abstract concepts matches this field.
  - Solving puzzles fits well with computer science mentality.
But:
  - Deep love for animals and curiosity about nature are less relevant.

Let's assume:
\[ P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.4 \]

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS):**
Given the evidence E, the likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \):
  - Curiosity about nature and plants fits perfectly.
  - Deep love for animals matches very well.
  - Strong empathy and warm heart are important for veterinary science.

Let's assume:
\[ P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.8 \]

**Business Administration (BA):**
Given the evidence E, the likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \):
  - High intelligence applies broadly.
  - Empathy and warm heart can be useful in BA.
But:
  - Deep love for animals and curiosity about nature are less relevant.

Let's assume:
\[ P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.3 \]

**Other fields (OF):** 
These fields are a mixture of all other disciplines:
  - Likelihoods are less specific.
Let's assume:
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}} \wedge \neg H_{\text{AVS}} \wedge \neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.2 \]

Calculate \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = 0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.3 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.4 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.12 + 0.075 + 0.08 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.355 \]

Now use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.355} = \frac{0.08}{0.355} \approx 0.225 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.355} = \frac{0.12}{0.355} \approx 0.338 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.25}{0.355} = \frac{0.075}{0.355} \approx 0.211 \]

Thus, the results are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.225,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.338,
  "business administration": 0.211
}
