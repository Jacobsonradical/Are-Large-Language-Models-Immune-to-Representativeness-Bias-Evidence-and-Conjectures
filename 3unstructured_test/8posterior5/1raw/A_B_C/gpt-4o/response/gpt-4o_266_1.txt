Let's start by assigning values to \( P(H) \) (the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field), \( P(E|H) \) (the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he was in that field), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) (the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he was not in that field). For simplicity, we'll normalize these probabilities later to obtain the posterior probabilities using Bayes' rule.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) \): Considering the number of graduate fields, let's assume a moderately high prior probability that he might be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. We'll use a value of 0.3.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \): Adam's traits (love for nature and animals, empathy) strongly align with this field. We'll estimate this as 0.8.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AgVet}}) \): Given the general population of graduate students who do not match Adamâ€™s profile precisely, we'll use 0.2 for this. 

2. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): The number of graduate students in computer science is generally high. We'll use a prior probability of 0.4.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): His traits (quiet, solving puzzles, high intelligence) are somewhat conducive to computer science but not as strongly as AgVet. We'll estimate this as 0.6.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \): With other fields being quite varied and not all fitting his personality as well as CS, use 0.35.

3. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): Given its popularity and broad applicability, use a value similar to CS but a bit lower. We'll go with 0.2.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): His empathy and understanding could fit but the connection to nature/plants/animals isn't as strong. Estimate as 0.3.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \): Reflecting the mismatch of his profile for other random fields, use 0.4.

Now, using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since \( P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) + P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) P(H_{\text{BA}}) + \ldots \), we can reason comparatively (since the denominators will cancel out when normalized).

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{AgVet}} \propto 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} \propto 0.6 \times 0.4 = 0.24 \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} \propto 0.3 \times 0.2 = 0.06 \]

Sum up these products (not normalized):
\[ 0.24 + 0.24 + 0.06 = 0.54 \]

Now we normalize:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{AgVet}} = \frac{0.24}{0.54} = 0.444 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} = \frac{0.24}{0.54} = 0.444 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} = \frac{0.06}{0.54} = 0.111 \]

So the results are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.444,
  "computer science": 0.444,
  "business administration": 0.111
}
