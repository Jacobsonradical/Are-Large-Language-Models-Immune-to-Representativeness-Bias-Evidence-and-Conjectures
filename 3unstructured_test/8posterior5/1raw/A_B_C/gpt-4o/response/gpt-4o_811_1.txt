To solve this problem using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the probabilities \(P(H)\), \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E|\neg H)\) for each field:

### Definitions
- \( P(H) \): Probability of being enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Probability of the personality sketch \(E\) given enrollment in the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of the personality sketch \(E\) given not enrolled in the field.
- \( P(H|E) \): Probability of being enrolled in the field given the personality sketch \(E\) (calculated via Bayes' rule).

Based on the personality sketch \(E\), let's estimate these probabilities for each field:

### 1. Business Administration
- **\( P(H) \)**: Moderate, since many students choose business administration, let's say 0.1.
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: Low, as the personality traits do not particularly align with typical business administration profiles, maybe 0.05.
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Assume it reflects an average graduate student who is not in business administration, say 0.5.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{0.05 \cdot 0.1 + 0.5 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.45} = \frac{0.005}{0.455} \approx 0.011 \]

### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **\( P(H) \)**: Low to moderate, as it's less common, say 0.05.
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: High, since the subject's traits align well with this field, maybe 0.8.
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Assume it is average for someone not in this field, say 0.4.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.4 \cdot 0.95} = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.38} = \frac{0.04}{0.42} \approx 0.095 \]

### 3. Computer Science
- **\( P(H) \)**: Moderate to high, as computer science is a popular choice, let's say 0.1.
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: Moderate to high, as the subject's intelligence and love for puzzles align with computer science, maybe 0.5.
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Assume it reflects an average graduate student who is not in computer science, say 0.5.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.1}{0.5 \cdot 0.1 + 0.5 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.05}{0.05 + 0.45} = \frac{0.05}{0.50} = 0.1 \]

Here is the result:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.011,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.095,
  "computer science": 0.1
}
```
