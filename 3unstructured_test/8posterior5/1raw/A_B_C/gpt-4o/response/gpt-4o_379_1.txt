To apply Bayes' Rule, we need to estimate the probabilities \(P(H)\), \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E|\neg H)\) for each field. Here are the estimations for each field based on Adam's personality sketch:

### Computer Science
- **P(H):** We estimate the prior probability \(P(H)\) of a graduate student being enrolled in computer science. Given the large number of enrollments in this field relative to other fields, we assume \(P(H) = 0.3\).
- **P(E|H):** Given Adam's personality sketch and his traits of high intelligence and interest in solving puzzles, there's a reasonable match, but less alignment with his warm heart and deep love for animals. Thus, \(P(E|H) = 0.2\).
- **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is not enrolled in computer science could be estimated as the average complement of \(P(E|H)\) across all other fields. Since he might fit better in a more aligned field like agricultural and veterinary science, we can estimate \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.8\).

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \]

### Business Administration
- **P(H):** Estimate the prior probability \(P(H)\) of being in business administration as relatively moderate but not as high as technical fieldsâ€”in this context, \(P(H) = 0.2\).
- **P(E|H):** Adam's personality traits do not directly align with typical business administration profiles, which often focus on leadership, strategic thinking, and less on empathy and nature. Thus, \(P(E|H) = 0.1\).
- **P(E|\neg H):** Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he's not in business administration could also be set at \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.8\).

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H):** The probability of a graduate student being enrolled in this field could be lower given the specialization, so we'll assume \(P(H) = 0.1\).
- **P(E|H):** Adam's traits of strong empathy, love for animals, appreciation for hard work and dedication, and curiosity about nature align closely, so we assume \(P(E|H) = 0.7\).
- **P(E|\neg H):** The complement given that he is not in agricultural and veterinary science and fits less similar fields on average can be estimated as \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.3\).

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

Since \(P(E)\) is the same for all fields, it cancels out in relative comparisons. Based on these calculations, the normalized values are:

{
  "computer science": \( \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{0.2 \cdot 0.3 + 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.7 \cdot 0.1} \approx 0.23 \),
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.2 \cdot 0.3 + 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.7 \cdot 0.1} \approx 0.08 \),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.2 \cdot 0.3 + 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.7 \cdot 0.1} \approx 0.54 \)
}

Note: The actual values may differ slightly depending on precise estimates for each conditional probability. This is a simplified and illustrative calculation.
