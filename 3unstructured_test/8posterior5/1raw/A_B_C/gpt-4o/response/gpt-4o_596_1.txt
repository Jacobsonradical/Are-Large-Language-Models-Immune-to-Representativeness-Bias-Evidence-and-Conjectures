To solve this problem using Bayes' Rule, we first need to define our terms clearly:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam having the described personality sketch given he is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam having the described personality sketch given he is not enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field given his personality sketch.

Bayes' Rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for all hypotheses and we are only interested in comparing relative probabilities, it is enough to compute the numerator \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for each hypothesis and then normalize these values to sum to 1.

### Analysis for each field:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): Assume this is a moderately common field (say 0.2).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The personality traits are less aligned with what we generally associate with business administration (creative problem solving, genuine curiosity about nature, empathy, etc.). This might be low, say 0.1.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Similar personality traits might be more typical in other fields, so let's assume 0.8.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Assume this is a bit more common in general (say 0.25).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Some of the traits align well (solving puzzles, high intelligence), but others (e.g., empathy) are not particularly indicative. Let's estimate this as 0.6.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Similar reasoning as above, so let's say 0.5.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Assume this is less common (say 0.1).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The personality traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals) match very well with this field. Let's estimate this as 0.9.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): There could be overlapping traits in other fields, so assume 0.3.

### Computing \( P(H|E) \):

First, compute the unnormalized posterior probabilities:

1. **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

2. **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.6 \cdot 0.25 = 0.15 \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.09 \]

Now normalize these values to sum to 1:

Sum of unnormalized values:
\[ 0.02 + 0.15 + 0.09 = 0.26 \]

Normalized posterior probabilities:

1. **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.26} \approx 0.077 \]

2. **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.15}{0.26} \approx 0.577 \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.26} \approx 0.346 \]

Thus, the results are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.077,
  "computer science": 0.577,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.346
}
```

Note that these values are relative and based on the provided estimates; actual probabilities could vary with more precise information.
