To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know three things: \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Here, H represents the hypothesis of the specific field of study (computer science, agricultural and veterinary science, business administration) and E represents the information given in the personality sketch of Adam. 

Let us evaluate the probabilities for each of the fields based on the given information:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is a computer science student. Computer science is a common field, so let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam has the given personality sketch given that he is a computer science student. Adam's traits (curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals) are less commonly associated with computer science, so let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that Adam has these traits given that he is not a computer science student. Given that these traits might better match other fields, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science. This field is less common than computer science, so let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam has the given personality sketch given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science. This field aligns well with Adam's love for nature and animals. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that Adam has these traits given that he is not in this field. Given that these traits might better match this field compared to others, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

3. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is in business administration. This field is also common, so let's assume \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam has the given personality sketch given that he is in business administration. Business administration is less likely to align with his love for nature and animals, so let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.05 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that Adam has these traits given that he is not in business administration. Given that these traits might better match other fields, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \).

These values give us the inputs to Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To find \( P(E) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

We calculate each posterior probability separately, focusing on each hypothesis.

### Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{(0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.5 \cdot 0.8)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.4} = \frac{0.02}{0.42} \approx 0.048 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{(0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.3 \cdot 0.95)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.285} = \frac{0.04}{0.325} \approx 0.123 \]

### Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.15}{(0.05 \cdot 0.15) + (0.6 \cdot 0.85)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.0075}{0.0075 + 0.51} = \frac{0.0075}{0.5175} \approx 0.0145 \]

Thus, the results in the required format are:

{
  "computer science": "0.048",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.123",
  "business administration": "0.0145"
