To analyze the problem using Bayesian reasoning, we need to break down the given probabilities for each field of study.

1. **Prior Probability (P(H))**: This is the initial probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields of study. Since we lack explicit prior statistics, we'll assume that these fields are equally likely. Given three fields, this means the prior probability for each would be:

\[ P(H) = \frac{1}{3} = 0.333 \]

2. **Likelihood (P(E|H))**: This is the probability that Adam's characteristics (E) would be observed if he were studying in a particular field, H. Based on the personality sketch of Adam and common attributes associated with fields, we can deduce the following:

   - **Computer Science**: It is somewhat likely as problem-solving ability and high intelligence fit, but love for animals and nature is not strongly aligned.
     \[ P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.2 \]

   - **Business Administration**: Less likely since the characteristics don't strongly match the typical traits associated with this field.
     \[ P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.1 \]

   - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Highly likely given Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature and plants.
     \[ P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.7 \]

3. **Marginal Likelihood (P(E|\neg H))**: This is the probability of observing Adam's characteristics if he did not enroll in the specific field. This can be reasonably estimated by considering the relevance of his traits to other fields not listed, which generally would be lower compared to the specifically analyzed field.

Now we can compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.2 \cdot 0.333 + 0.1 \cdot 0.333 + 0.7 \cdot 0.333 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.2 \cdot 0.333 + 0.1 \cdot 0.333 + 0.7 \cdot 0.333 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.0666 + 0.0333 + 0.2331 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.333 \]

Now substitute P(E) back into Bayes' Rule:

- For **Computer Science**:
  \[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.333}{0.333} = 0.2 \]

- For **Business Administration**:
  \[ P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{BA}) \cdot P(\text{BA})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.333}{0.333} = 0.1 \]

- For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  \[ P(\text{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{AVS}) \cdot P(\text{AVS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.333}{0.333} = 0.7 \]

Here is the final result:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
