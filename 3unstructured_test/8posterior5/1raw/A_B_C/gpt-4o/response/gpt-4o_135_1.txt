To calculate the posterior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field given his personality sketch, we'll need to estimate the following probabilities:
1. P(H): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field.
2. P(E|H): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in a specific field.
3. P(E|\neg H): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not in a specific field.
4. P(E): The overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch, which can be derived from P(E|H) and P(E|\neg H).

Using Bayes' rule for calculating P(H|E):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To simplify, we’ll use some reasonable assumptions about these probabilities without going into detailed statistical data collection. We can assume the following:

- P(H): Prior probability based on rough assumptions of the popularity of these majors among graduate students.
- P(E|H): Our subjective probability based on how well Adam’s personality fits the field.
- P(E|\neg H): Our subjective probability based on how less likely Adam's personality fits other fields.

Let's assume:
1. Agricultural and veterinary science: 
   - P(H) ≈ 0.10
   - P(E|H) ≈ 0.80 (highly likely given his traits)
   - P(E|\neg H) ≈ 0.20 (since he's less likely to fit in many other fields)

2. Computer Science:
   - P(H) ≈ 0.30
   - P(E|H) ≈ 0.30 (possible, but not a perfect match)
   - P(E|\neg H) ≈ 0.50 (fairly generic personality traits could fit multiple fields)

3. Business Administration:
   - P(H) ≈ 0.30
   - P(E|H) ≈ 0.10 (unlikely given his traits)
   - P(E|\neg H) ≈ 0.60 (traits not well fitting for business administration)

Let's calculate each posterior probability.

**Agricultural and veterinary science:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that P(E) is the sum of P(E|H)P(H) for all hypotheses and P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
Assuming we have only three hypotheses:
\[ 
P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.10) + (0.30 \cdot 0.30) + (0.10 \cdot 0.30) = 0.08 + 0.09 + 0.03 = 0.20 
\]
So, 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.10}{0.20} = 0.40 \]

**Computer Science:**
\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{0.30 \cdot 0.30}{0.20} = 0.45 
\]

**Business Administration:**
\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{0.10 \cdot 0.30}{0.20} = 0.15 
\]

Hence, the posterior probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.40,
  "computer science": 0.45,
  "business administration": 0.15
}
