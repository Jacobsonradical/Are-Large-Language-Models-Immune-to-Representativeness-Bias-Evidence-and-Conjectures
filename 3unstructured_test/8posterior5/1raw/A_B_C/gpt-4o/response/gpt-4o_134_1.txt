Let's apply Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field given Adam's personality sketch \( E \).

Bayes' rule formula is:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of each field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence, calculated as \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

We'll estimate the prior probabilities and likelihoods based on typical characteristics associated with each field as per Adam's personality sketch.

### Assumptions:

#### Prior Probabilities:
- **Business Administration (\( P(H) \))**: Generally a popular field but less aligned with Adam’s specific interests.
  - \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.2 \)
- **Computer Science (\( P(H) \))**: Another popular field, growing over recent years but only moderately aligns with Adam’s interest in abstract thinking and problem solving.
  - \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.3 \)
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (\( P(H) \))**: Less popular but strongly aligns with Adam’s interest in nature, animals, and empathy.
  - \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.1 \)

#### Likelihoods:

Based on the description:
- **Business Administration (\( P(E|H) \))**: Low likelihood as the personality sketch does not align well with typical traits required.
  - \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.1 \)
- **Computer Science (\( P(E|H) \))**: Moderate likelihood due to interest in puzzles and abstract concepts.
  - \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.4 \)
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (\( P(E|H) \))**: High likelihood due to strong alignment with nature, plants, and animals.
  - \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.7 \)

#### \( P(E|\neg H) \):

Assuming remaining probabilities in all other fields:
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.3 \)

We'll start computing \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{business administration}}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.8 = 0.02 + 0.4 = 0.42 \]

Similarly,
\[ P(E) = 0.4 \cdot 0.3 + 0.5 \cdot 0.7 = 0.12 + 0.35 = 0.47 \]

Similarly,
\[ P(E) = 0.7 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9 = 0.07 + 0.27 = 0.34 \]

Both should yield approximately close results,
Assuming average of commonly discerning results:

\[ P(E) = 0.45 \]

Putting everything together, we can now find:

\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})}{P(E)} \]

### Values:

We use 0.45 for P(E),

- **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.45} \approx 0.044 \]

- **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{0.45} \approx 0.267 \]

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.45} \approx 0.156 \]
