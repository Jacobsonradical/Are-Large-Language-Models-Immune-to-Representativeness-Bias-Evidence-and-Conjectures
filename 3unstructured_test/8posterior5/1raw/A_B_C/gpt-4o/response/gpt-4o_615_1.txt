Let's break this down step by step for each field.

**1. Business Administration:**

- **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration. Given that there are many different fields of graduate study, let's assume the prior P(H) for business administration is moderate. This might be a bit arbitrary, but let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

- **P(E|H):** The likelihood of observing E (Adam’s personality sketch) given that he is enrolled in business administration. Adam’s traits do not seem particularly aligned with business administration (e.g., love for animals, curiosity about nature). Hence, \( P(E|H) \) might be relatively low. Let’s assume \( P(E|H) = 0.05 \).

- **P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood of observing E given that Adam is not enrolled in business administration. This would depend on how likely these traits are in other fields. Given the traits, \( P(E|\neg H) \) could be relatively high assuming fields like agricultural science align better. Let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \):

\[ P(E) = 0.05 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9 = 0.05 + 0.27 = 0.32 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{0.32} = \frac{0.005}{0.32} \approx 0.0156 \]


**2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

- **P(H):** Assuming this is less common than fields like business administration, let’s assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).

- **P(E|H):** The likelihood of observing E, given that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, is quite high. Let’s assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

- **P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood of observing E given that Adam is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given that there are many other fields, \( P(E|\neg H) \) would potentially be lower. Let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.25 \).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.25 \cdot 0.95 = 0.04 + 0.2375 = 0.2775 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.2775} = \frac{0.04}{0.2775} \approx 0.1442 \]


**3. Computer Science:**

- **P(H):** Given the popularity of computer science, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

- **P(E|H):** The likelihood of observing E (Adam’s curiosity, intelligence, love for puzzles) could be moderately fitting for computer science. Let’s assume \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).

- **P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood of observing E given that Adam is not in computer science would also be relatively high given there are other fitting fields. Let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8 = 0.06 + 0.24 = 0.3 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.3} = \frac{0.06}{0.3} = 0.2 \]
