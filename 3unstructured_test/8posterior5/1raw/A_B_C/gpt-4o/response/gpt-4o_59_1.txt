To solve this problem using Bayes' Rule, we need to calculate the probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch \( E \). Bayes' Rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field given the personality sketch \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E) \) is the evidence, or the total probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) across all fields.

In order to solve this, let's make reasonable assumptions based on typical stereotypes and available data regarding these fields.

### Computer Science:
#### Assumptions
- \( P(H) \): Assume a moderate probability of Adam being a computer science graduate (**0.3**).
- \( P(E|H) \): Computer science students are generally intelligent and good at solving puzzles but may be less likely to have a strong understanding and appreciation of hard work in nature and animals. Assign a moderate probability (**0.2**).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): This value is the complement probability, considering the average likelihood of the personality sketch in other fields (**0.4**).

### Business Administration:
#### Assumptions
- \( P(H) \): Assign a lower probability since business students may be less likely to fit the entire personality sketch provided (**0.1**).
- \( P(E|H) \): Business students are less likely to have a deep interest in nature and animals. Hence a lower likelihood (**0.1**).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): This value is the complement probability, again considering the average likelihood in other fields (**0.4**).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
#### Assumptions
- \( P(H) \): Assign a higher probability since this field directly aligns with Adam's interests in nature, plants, and animals (**0.6**).
- \( P(E|H) \): Given that the personality sketch almost perfectly aligns with someone studying agriculture or veterinary science, assign a high probability (**0.9**).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Complement probability, considering the average likelihood in other fields (**0.4**).

### Calculation:
We can ignore the \( P(E) \) term because it will be the same for all hypotheses and will normalize the results anyway. Thus, we only need to compute the numerators \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

#### Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \times 0.3 = 0.06 \]

#### Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \times 0.1 = 0.01 \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.9 \times 0.6 = 0.54 \]

### Normalization:
To make these values into proper probabilities, we need to normalize them:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{\text{Sum of all numerators}} \]

Sum of all numerators:
\[ 0.06 + 0.01 + 0.54 = 0.61 \]

So,
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{computer science}} = \frac{0.06}{0.61} \approx 0.098 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} = \frac{0.01}{0.61} \approx 0.016 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} = \frac{0.54}{0.61} \approx 0.886 \]

### Final Probabilities:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.098,
  "business administration": 0.016,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.886
}
```

These values reflect the probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field given the personality sketch provided.
