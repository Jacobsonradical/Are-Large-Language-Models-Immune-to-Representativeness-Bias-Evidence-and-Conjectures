Sure, let's break down the probabilities step by step.

1. **Business Administration**
   - P(H): This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration.
   - P(E|H): This is the probability that Adam has the traits described in E given that he is enrolled in Business Administration.
   - P(E|\neg H): This is the probability that Adam has the traits described in E given that he is not enrolled in Business Administration.

Given that Adam has a strong empathy, deep love for animals, appreciation for hard work, and curiosity about nature, these traits do not strongly align with a typical profile for Business Administration. So we'll assign some estimates:
   - P(H) ≈ 0.1
   - P(E|H) ≈ 0.05
   - P(E|\neg H) ≈ 0.2

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{0.05 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.18} \]
\[ P(H|E) ≈ 0.027 \]

2. **Computer Science**
   - P(H): This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science.
   - P(E|H): This is the probability that Adam has the traits described in E given that he is enrolled in Computer Science.
   - P(E|\neg H): This is the probability that Adam has the traits described in E given that he is not enrolled in Computer Science.

Adam's strong intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts fit well with a Computer Science profile; however, his deep love for animals and nature might not fit as well. So we'll assign some estimates:
   - P(H) ≈ 0.3
   - P(E|H) ≈ 0.2
   - P(E|\neg H) ≈ 0.2

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{0.2 \cdot 0.3 + 0.2 \cdot 0.7} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.14} \]
\[ P(H|E) ≈ 0.3 \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - P(H): This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
   - P(E|H): This is the probability that Adam has the traits described in E given that he is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
   - P(E|\neg H): This is the probability that Adam has the traits described in E given that he is not enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, his deep love for animals, and his empathy strongly fit with this field. So we'll assign some estimates:
   - P(H) ≈ 0.2
   - P(E|H) ≈ 0.5
   - P(E|\neg H) ≈ 0.2

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.5 \cdot 0.2 + 0.2 \cdot 0.8} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.1 + 0.16} \]
\[ P(H|E) ≈ 0.385 \]

Combining these calculations, we get the following results:

{
  "business administration": 0.027,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.385
}
