To solve the problem using Bayes' rule, we'll need to estimate the relevant probabilities.

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**: The likelihood that a typical student in the U.S. is enrolled in a particular field of study.
2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in a particular field.
3. **Alternative Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in a particular field. This can be roughly estimated by considering other possible fields and how well they match Adam's personality sketch.

We use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \(P(E)\) is constant across all hypotheses, we can compare the numerators \(P(E|H) \cdot P(H)\) directly across different fields.

Let's estimate the values below:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**: Assume a relatively low prior since not many students are in agricultural and veterinary science.
2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: High—Adam’s love for nature, plants, and animals aligns well.
3. **Alternative Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)**: Lower—few other fields would align as well.

### Business Administration
1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**: Common field, so a higher prior compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: Low—Business administration does not align as well with Adam's interests in nature, animals, and puzzles.
3. **Alternative Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)**: Higher—Many fields might better fit his sketch than business administration.

### Computer Science
1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**: High—computer science is a popular field.
2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: Medium—Problem-solving and understanding abstract concepts fit, but love for nature and animals does not align as well.
3. **Alternative Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)**: Medium to high—several other fields may fit better.

Let's assign some estimated values:

### Estimates
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - P(H): 0.05
   - P(E|H): 0.70
   - P(E|\neg H): 0.30

2. **Business Administration**:
   - P(H): 0.20
   - P(E|H): 0.10
   - P(E|\neg H): 0.50

3. **Computer Science**:
   - P(H): 0.40
   - P(E|H): 0.40
   - P(E|\neg H): 0.60

Using Bayes' rule:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.70 \cdot 0.05}{0.70 \cdot 0.05 + (1-0.05) \cdot 0.30} \approx \frac{0.035}{0.035 + 0.285} \approx 0.11 \]

2. **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.10 \cdot 0.20}{0.10 \cdot 0.20 + (1-0.20) \cdot 0.50} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.40} \approx 0.047 \]

3. **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.40 \cdot 0.40}{0.40 \cdot 0.40 + (1-0.40) \cdot 0.60} \approx \frac{0.16}{0.16 + 0.36} \approx 0.308 \]

Resulting in:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.11,
  "business administration": 0.047,
  "computer science": 0.308
}
