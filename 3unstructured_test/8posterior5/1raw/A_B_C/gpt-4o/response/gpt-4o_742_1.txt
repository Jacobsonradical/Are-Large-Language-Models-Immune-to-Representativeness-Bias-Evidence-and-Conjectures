To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam is enrolled in each of these fields given the personality sketch \( E \), we need to make some assumptions about prior probabilities \( P(H) \), conditional probabilities \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Let's make the following educated assumptions:

1. **Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)**
   - The probability of someone being enrolled in any specific field among all graduate fields is relatively low, but it varies depending on the field’s popularity.
   - Let \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \approx 0.1 \) (business is a common field).
   - Let \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) \approx 0.1 \) (computer science is also a common field).
   - Let \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \approx 0.05 \) (probably less common).

2. **Conditional Probabilities \( P(E|H) \)**
   - Given the personality sketch, Adam seems highly suited for agricultural and veterinary science, moderately suited for computer science, and less suited for business administration. 
   - Let's assume:
     - \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \approx 0.1 \)
     - \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \approx 0.3 \)
     - \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \approx 0.8 \)

3. **Complementary Probabilities \( P(E|\neg H) \)**
   - We’ll assume these probabilities are roughly the same as the average likelihood of someone in a different field having Adam’s traits, which seems moderate.
   - Let's assume:
     - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business administration}}) \approx 0.3 \)
     - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{computer science}}) \approx 0.3 \)
     - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \approx 0.3 \)

Now, using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is difficult to determine without additional data, we focus on the relative probabilities:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) P(H) \]

Calculations:
1. **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} \propto 0.1 \times 0.1 = 0.01 \]

2. **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{computer science}} \propto 0.3 \times 0.1 = 0.03 \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} \propto 0.8 \times 0.05 = 0.04 \]

Normalization (optional normalization for more clarity):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{business administration}})P(H_{\text{business administration}}) + P(E|H_{\text{computer science}})P(H_{\text{computer science}}) + P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \]

\[
P(E) = 0.01 + 0.03 + 0.04 = 0.08
\]

So the probabilities would then be:
\[
P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} = \frac{0.01}{0.08} \approx 0.125
\]
\[
P(H|E)_{\text{computer science}} = \frac{0.03}{0.08} \approx 0.375
\]
\[
P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} = \frac{0.04}{0.08} \approx 0.5
\]

Final Answer:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.125,
  "computer science": 0.375,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5
}
```

These values are relative probabilities and are intended to reflect how well Adam's personality sketch matches with likely candidates in each field.
