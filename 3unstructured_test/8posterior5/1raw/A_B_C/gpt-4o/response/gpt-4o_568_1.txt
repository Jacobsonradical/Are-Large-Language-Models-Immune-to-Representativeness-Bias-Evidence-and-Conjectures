Given Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's analyze the fields:

### Computer Science
\[
P(H): \text{The probability that Adam is enrolled in Computer Science} 
\]
Considering the general enrollment in various graduate fields, let's assume:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.2 \]

\[
P(E|H): \text{The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in Computer Science}
\]
Adam has a strong curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, and love for animals, which are less typical traits for typical Computer Science students.
\[ P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.1 \]

\[
P(E|\neg H): \text{The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not enrolled in Computer Science}
\]
This would be more common in fields like agricultural and veterinary science.
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.3 \]

### Business Administration
\[
P(H): \text{The probability that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration} 
\]
Considering the general enrollment in various graduate fields, let's assume:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.2 \]

\[
P(E|H): \text{The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in Business Administration}
\]
The qualities described seem less typical for Business Administration.
\[ P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.05 \]

\[
P(E|\neg H): \text{The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not enrolled in Business Administration}
\]
This would likely be higher in fields like agricultural and veterinary science.
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.25 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[
P(H): \text{The probability that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science} 
\]
Given Adam's interests and traits, let's assume:
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.3 \]

\[
P(E|H): \text{The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science}
\]
Adam's personality sketch directly aligns with typical traits in agricultural and veterinary science.
\[ P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.8 \]

\[
P(E|\neg H): \text{The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science}
\]
This would be lower since other fields are less likely to exhibit these traits.
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.2 \]

Now, let's assume \(P(E)\) is a normalization constant that can be ignored for the purpose of proportional comparison. We calculate \(P(H|E)\):

### Computer Science
\[
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02
\]

### Business Administration
\[
P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \propto 0.05 \cdot 0.2 = 0.01
\]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[
P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}})
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24
\]

Putting it all together:

\[
{
  "computer science": "0.02",
  "business administration": "0.01",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.24"
}
\]
