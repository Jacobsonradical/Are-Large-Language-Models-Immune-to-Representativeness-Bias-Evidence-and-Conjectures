To determine the probabilities, we will apply Bayes' rule, which is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Given the sketch and fields:

1. **agricultural and veterinary science**
   - \( P(H): \) Let's assume that about 5% of graduate students are in this field, so \( P(H) = 0.05 \).
   - \( P(E|H): \) Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy, this fits well. We'll assign \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H): \) Assuming personal traits like Adam's aren't common in non-related fields, we'll estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.95} \approx \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.19} \approx \frac{0.04}{0.23} \approx 0.174 \]

2. **business administration**
   - \( P(H): \) Let's estimate that about 20% of graduate students are in this field, so \( P(H) = 0.20 \).
   - \( P(E|H): \) Adam's traits don't strongly suggest business administration; we'll estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H): \) Since this probability is the complement information, \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \) seems reasonable.
 
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.20}{0.1 \cdot 0.20 + 0.3 \cdot 0.80} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.24} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.26} \approx 0.077 \]

3. **computer science**
   - \( P(H): \) Given the popularity of this field, let's assume 15% of graduate students are in computer science, so \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
   - \( P(E|H): \) Adam's affinity for puzzles and intelligence in abstract concepts fit well, so we'll estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.6 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H): \) Assuming these traits are not unique to computer science, we'll estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{computer science}} = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.15}{0.6 \cdot 0.15 + 0.3 \cdot 0.85} \approx \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.255} \approx \frac{0.09}{0.345} \approx 0.261 \]

Thus, the computed probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.174,
  "business administration": 0.077,
  "computer science": 0.261
}
