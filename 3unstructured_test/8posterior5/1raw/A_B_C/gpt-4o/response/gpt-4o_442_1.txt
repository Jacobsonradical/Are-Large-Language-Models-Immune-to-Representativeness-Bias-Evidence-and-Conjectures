To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to use Bayes' rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant and is the same across all hypotheses, we only need the relative values. We'll estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) based on the provided information.

1. **Computer Science**
    - \( P(H) \): Computer Science is a common field, but not directly aligned with Adam's interests in nature and animals. Let's assume \( 0.2 \).
    - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's personality sketch, it's less likely he would be in Computer Science compared to the other fields. Let's assume \( 0.1 \).
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of his personality sketch fits equally well in other fields that are not Computer Science. Let's assume \( 0.4 \) since his traits are quite specific.

    Using Bayes' rule:
    \[ P(H|E) \propto \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.4} = 0.05 \]

2. **Business Administration**
    - \( P(H) \): Business Administration is also a common field, but again not a perfect fit for Adam's interests. Let's assume \( 0.2 \).
    - \( P(E|H) \): His personality traits don't strongly align with Business Administration. Let's assume \( 0.1 \).
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Again, the probability of his personality traits fitting in other fields remains consistent. Let's assume \( 0.4 \).

    Using Bayes' rule:
    \[ P(H|E) \propto \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.4} = 0.05 \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
    - \( P(H) \): This field is less common than the other two but aligns well with Adam's interests and traits. Let's assume \( 0.1 \).
    - \( P(E|H) \): His genuine curiosity about nature, plants, animals, and empathy strongly align with this field. Let's assume \( 0.8 \).
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): This would be lower as his personality fits particularly well in this field. Let's assume \( 0.3 \).

    Using Bayes' rule:
    \[ P(H|E) \propto \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.3} = 0.267 \]

So, the probabilities might look like this:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.05,
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.267
}
```
