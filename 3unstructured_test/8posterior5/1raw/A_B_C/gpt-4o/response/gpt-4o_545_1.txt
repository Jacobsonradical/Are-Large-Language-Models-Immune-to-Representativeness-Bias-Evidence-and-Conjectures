To address this question, we will apply Bayes' theorem: 

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of Adam having the given personality sketch.

Given the personality sketch:
- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and loves animals - highly relevant to agricultural and veterinary science.
- Adam is good at understanding abstract concepts and solving puzzles - relevant to computer science.
- Empathy and appreciation for hard work could be relevant to fields like business administration, but not as strongly as the previous two.

Let’s make qualitative judgments to assign probabilities based on this information:

1. **Computer Science**
   - \( P(H)_{CS} \): Assume many graduate students in the U.S. could be in computer science, say 0.2.
   - \( P(E|H)_{CS} \): Adam’s traits like high intelligence and puzzle-solving could fit, say 0.3.
   - \( P(E|\neg H)_{CS} \): Since other fields can accommodate Adam’s traits too, let's say 0.7.
   - By Bayes' rule:
     \[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{0.3 \times 0.2 + 0.7 \times 0.8} = \frac{0.06}{0.62} \approx 0.097 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - \( P(H)_{AVS} \): Assume this field encompasses fewer students, say 0.05.
   - \( P(E|H)_{AVS} \): Adam fits this field very well due to his love for nature and animals, say 0.8.
   - \( P(E|\neg H)_{AVS} \): For other fields, these traits are less likely to be as concentrated, say 0.4.
   - By Bayes' rule:
     \[ P(H|E)_{AVS} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.8 \times 0.05 + 0.4 \times 0.95} = \frac{0.04}{0.415} \approx 0.096 \]

3. **Business Administration**
   - \( P(H)_{BA} \): Assume this is a common field, so say 0.1.
   - \( P(E|H)_{BA} \): Adam’s empathy and hard work appreciation fit reasonably, say 0.2.
   - \( P(E|\neg H)_{BA} \): Again, many fields could accommodate empathy and work dedication, say 0.7.
   - By Bayes' rule:
     \[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{0.2 \times 0.1 + 0.7 \times 0.9} = \frac{0.02}{0.65} \approx 0.031 \]

Therefore, based on these calculations:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.097,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.096,
  "business administration": 0.031
}
```
