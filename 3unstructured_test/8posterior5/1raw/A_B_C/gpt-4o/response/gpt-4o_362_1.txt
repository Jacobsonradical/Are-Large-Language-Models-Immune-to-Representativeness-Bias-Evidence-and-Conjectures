To apply Bayes' Theorem in this scenario, we need to calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch \( E \). Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) (the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch \( E \)) is constant for all hypotheses, we can compare relative probabilities without needing to compute it explicitly. Instead, we can focus on the proportionality:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

We would assess \( P(H) \) (the prior probability of each hypothesis \( H \)), \( P(E|H) \) (the likelihood of observing personality sketch \( E \) given \( H \)), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) (the likelihood of observing \( E \) given not \( H \)).

Letâ€™s go through each field:

### Business Administration
**P(H) (prior probability):** Modest (considering among all graduates, but less likely given Adam's interests)
**P(E|H) (likelihood of \( E \) given business administration):** Low (not strongly tied to nature, animals, empathy, or abstract concepts)
**P(E|\neg H) (likelihood of \( E \) given not business administration):** Higher (fits other fields better)

By Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given:
\[ P(E|H)_{BA} \cdot P(H)_{BA} \]
is low, resulting in a low \( P(H|E) \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
**P(H) (prior probability):** Moderate to high (considering the pool of all graduate fields)
**P(E|H) (likelihood of \( E \) given ag/vet science):** High (directly aligned with curiosity about nature, strong empathy, love for animals, appreciation for dedication and hard work)
**P(E|\neg H) (likelihood of \( E \) given not ag/vet science):** Lower (fewer fields likely to match well)

Thus:

\[ P(H|E)_{ag/vet} \propto P(E|H)_{ag/vet} \cdot P(H)_{ag/vet} \]

Given:
\[ P(E|H)_{ag/vet} \text{ is high, so } P(H|E) \text{ is high.} \]

### Computer Science
**P(H) (prior probability):** Moderate (considering the pool of all graduate fields)
**P(E|H) (likelihood of \( E \) given computer science):** Moderate (intelligence and understanding abstract concepts match, empathy and nature love is less relevant)
**P(E|\neg H) (likelihood of \( E \) given not computer science):** Higher (fits many other fields better beyond just CS)

Thus:

\[ P(H|E)_{CS} \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H)_{CS} \]

Given:
\[ P(E|H) \text{ variability and fit here provide a more moderate likelihood.} \]

Summing this up, here's a likely distribution of our posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,  // Low likelihood given background sketch
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.70,  // High likelihood matching interests
  "computer science": 0.25  // Moderate likelihood, with some fit to abstract concepts and intelligence
}
