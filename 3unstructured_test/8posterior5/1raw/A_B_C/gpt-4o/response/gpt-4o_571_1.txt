Alright, let's calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \).

To proceed, let’s make reasonable assumptions about these probabilities based on the sketch:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - **P(H)**: Assuming business administration is a common field, let’s set it relatively high, say 0.2.
   - **P(E|H)**: The personality traits of Adam don't strongly align with the typical skills expected in business administration. Let's assume this as 0.1.
   - **P(E|¬H)**: This would be a combination of Adam fitting into every field that's NOT business administration. Given our fields, let's assume this as 0.25.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **P(H)**: Not as common as business administration, but let's set it at 0.1.
   - **P(E|H)**: His traits strongly match this field. We can set this high, say 0.8.
   - **P(E|¬H)**: This needs to be adjusted across non-agricultural fields. Let's assume 0.2.

3. **Computer Science**:
   - **P(H)**: This is a common field, let's assume 0.15.
   - **P(E|H)**: His intelligence and interest in solving puzzles resonate with CS. Let's set it at 0.5.
   - **P(E|¬H)**: For fields excluding computer science. Perhaps, 0.3.

Lastly, compute P(E):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Since \(\neg H\) shapes many other fields, we can provide a general estimate for it.

Now compute each field:

1. **Business Administration:**
\[ P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.25 \cdot 0.8 = 0.02 + 0.2 = 0.22 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.22} = \frac{0.02}{0.22} = 0.0909 \approx 0.09 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9 = 0.08 + 0.18 = 0.26 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.26} = \frac{0.08}{0.26} = 0.3077 \approx 0.31 \]

3. **Computer Science:**
\[ P(E) = 0.5 \cdot 0.15 + 0.3 \cdot 0.85 = 0.075 + 0.255 = 0.33 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.15}{0.33} = \frac{0.075}{0.33} = 0.2273 \approx 0.23 \]

So, putting it all together:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.09,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.31,
  "computer science": 0.23
}
```

These are the computed probabilities for Adam being enrolled in each respective field given his personality sketch.
