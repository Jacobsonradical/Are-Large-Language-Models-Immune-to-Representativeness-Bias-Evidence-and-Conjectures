To calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we first need to consider the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood of observing the evidence regardless of the hypothesis \( P(E) \) which is derived from \( P(E|H) \) and the base rates of each field.

Bayes' Rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be considered as the sum of the total probability of the evidence across all hypotheses:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) + \ldots \]

Assuming equal prior probabilities for simplicity, \( P(H) \approx 0.33 \) for each field, given the three options provided. Here's how we might judge the likelihoods:

- **Business Administration**:
  - \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): This is likely lower because the characteristics described do not align strongly with typical personality traits for business administration.
  - \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \): This is higher because the characteristics are generally less aligned with business administration.

- **Computer Science**:
  - \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): This is somewhat higher due to Adam's high intelligence and enjoyment in solving puzzles, which aligns well with computer science.
  - \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \): This is lower compared to business administration.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  - \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \): This is very high because of Adam's love of nature, plants, and animals.
  - \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \): This is lower compared to the other hypotheses.

Now, by assigning rough estimates to these probabilities:

- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \approx 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \approx 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \approx 0.7 \)

Substituting these into Bayes' rule:

Given \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.33 \), \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.33 \), \( P(H_{AVS}) = 0.33 \):

\[ P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.33) + (0.3 \times 0.33) + (0.7 \times 0.33) = 0.033 + 0.099 + 0.231 = 0.363 \]

Now calculating \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.33}{0.363} \approx 0.091 \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.33}{0.363} \approx 0.272 \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.33}{0.363} \approx 0.636 \]

Therefore, our final probabilities using the given format:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.091,
  "computer science": 0.272,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.636
}
```
