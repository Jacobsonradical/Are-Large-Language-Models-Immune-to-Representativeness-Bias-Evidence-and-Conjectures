To solve this problem, let's apply Bayes' theorem. According to Bayes' theorem,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability of Adam being in a specific field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is in a specific field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch \( E \).

Here is an estimation of these probabilities based on the given personality sketch \( E \):

1. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is in business administration. This field is quite broad, and many students are in this field, so, a moderate prior probability might be reasonable.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the personality traits given enrollment in business administration. These traits don't strongly align with typical business administration traits but also aren't exclusive of them.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the personality traits given Adam is not in business administration.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is in computer science. This is a fairly common field, so a moderate prior probability seems reasonable.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the personality traits given enrollment in computer science. The high intelligence and problem-solving skills fit well with computer science traits.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the personality traits given Adam is not in computer science.
 
3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science. This is a more specialized field and hence may have a lower prior probability.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the personality traits given enrollment in agricultural and veterinary science. The curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals fit very well with this field.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the personality traits given Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science.

Now, let's assign approximate probabilities for each value:

1. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H) \): 0.2 (Moderate due to the commonality of the field)
   - \( P(E|H) \): 0.2 (These traits are not typically associated with Business Administration)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): 0.7 (High probability that someone not in Business Administration could still exhibit these traits)

\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]

2. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): 0.2 (Moderate due to the popularity of the field)
   - \( P(E|H) \): 0.5 (Traits like intelligence and problem-solving fit well here)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): 0.6 (High probability that someone not in Computer Science could fit these traits)

\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.5}{P(E)} \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): 0.1 (Less common compared to other fields)
   - \( P(E|H) \): 0.7 (These traits align very well with Agricultural and Veterinary Science)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): 0.3 (Lower probability that someone not in this field would fit these traits)

\[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.7}{P(E)} \]

Plugging these into the Bayes' formula:

Given that \( P(E) \) (the overall probability of \( E \)) can be normalized across the different fields, we can denote each result with approximate values:

\[ P(E) \approx 0.2 \]

So, calculating the posteriors:

1. Business Administration: 

\[ \frac{0.04}{0.2} = 0.2 \]
   
2. Computer Science: 

\[ \frac{0.1}{0.2} = 0.5 \]

3. Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 

\[ \frac{0.07}{0.2} = 0.35 \]

So the resulting probabilities will be:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.35
}
```

Note that these values are approximate and can vary depending on more precise priors and likelihood estimations.
