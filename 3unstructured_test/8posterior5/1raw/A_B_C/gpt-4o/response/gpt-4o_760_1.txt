Sure, I can provide a rough estimate for each field. Below is the reasoning and the probabilities.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- P(H): The prior probability of being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is relatively low compared to more common fields like business administration. Let's assume P(H) = 0.05.
- P(E|H): The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science is relatively high, as his love for nature, plants, and animals fits well with this field. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.8.
- P(E|¬H): The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science is lower, as these traits are less specific to other fields, but still somewhat likely for broad fields like biology. Let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.3.

Using Bayes' Rule, we calculate:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.3 \cdot 0.95} = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.285} = \frac{0.04}{0.325} \approx 0.123
\]

### Computer Science
- P(H): The prior probability of being enrolled in computer science is higher given the prevalence of this field. Let's assume P(H) = 0.2.
- P(E|H): The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is in computer science is moderate, as problem-solving and intelligence fit well, but the love for nature and animals less so. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.4.
- P(E|¬H): The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is not in computer science is the same as before. Let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.3.

Using Bayes' Rule, we calculate:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.24} = \frac{0.08}{0.32} = 0.25
\]

### Business Administration
- P(H): The prior probability of being enrolled in business administration is high given the popularity of this field. Let's assume P(H) = 0.3.
- P(E|H): The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is in business administration is relatively low, as traits like a love for nature and animals are not strongly associated with this field. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.2.
- P(E|¬H): The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is not in business administration stays consistent. Let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.3.

Using Bayes' Rule, we calculate:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{0.2 \cdot 0.3 + 0.3 \cdot 0.7} = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.21} = \frac{0.06}{0.27} \approx 0.222
\]

### Summary
Based on the computed values:

\[
\{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \approx 0.123,
  "computer science": 0.25,
  "business administration": \approx 0.222
\}
