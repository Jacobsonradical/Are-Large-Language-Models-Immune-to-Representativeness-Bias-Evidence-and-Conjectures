To answer this question, we'll use Bayes' Theorem, which is mathematically expressed as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability of Hypothesis H given Evidence E.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of Evidence E given Hypothesis H.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Hypothesis H.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of Evidence E.

We will estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field based on our knowledge and logical assumptions, and then compute \( P(H|E) \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: The probability that a graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume this is 0.05 (5%).
- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of the given personality sketch given the student is in this field. Since his love for nature, plants, and animals matches well, let's assume this is 0.9.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of the given personality sketch given the student is not in this field. This is much lower; let's assume this is 0.2.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} = \frac{0.045}{P(E)} \]

### Computer Science
- **P(H)**: The probability that a graduate student is enrolled in computer science. Let's assume this is 0.2 (20%).
- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of the given personality sketch given the student is in this field. Some aspects match (e.g., solving puzzles, high intelligence), but not as well as agricultural science. Let's assume this is 0.4.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of the given personality sketch given the student is not in this field. Let's assume this is 0.3.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.08}{P(E)} \]

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: The probability that a graduate student is enrolled in business administration. Let's assume this is 0.1 (10%).
- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of the given personality sketch given the student is in this field. The match is the weakest here. Let's assume this is 0.2.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of the given personality sketch given the student is not in this field. Let's assume this is 0.35.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.02}{P(E)} \]

Given these calculations, we can normalize these values by \( P(E) \) to determine their relative probabilities.

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{0.045}{P(E)} \approx 0.6 \) (normalized),
  "computer science": \( \frac{0.08}{P(E)} \approx 0.27 \) (normalized),
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.02}{P(E)} \approx 0.13 \) (normalized)
}

Thus:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.27,
  "business administration": 0.13
}

These values are approximate and reflect how well Adam's personality sketch fits with each field based on our assumptions.
