To calculate the probabilities, we need to apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \) being true.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( \neg H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of evidence \( E \).

However, since we do not have specific data, we will make educated assumptions based on the given personality sketch and relevant probabilities.

Let's assume the following priors (these represent the probability of Adam being in these specific fields, without any additional information):

- \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.2 \) 
- \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.5 \) (other fields not specified)

Next, let's estimate the likelihoods based on the given personality traits:

- \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \): While computer science does involve high intelligence and problem-solving, it is less directly related to a love for nature and animals. \(\approx 0.3\)
- \( P(E|\text{business administration}) \): This field is less correlated with empathy for animals and nature. \(\approx 0.1\)
- \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \): This field is highly relevant to Adam's traits, such as a love for nature and animals. \(\approx 0.8\)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Average likelihood for other unspecified fields combining both relevant and irrelevant ones. \(\approx 0.2\)

Finally, we compute \( P(H|E) \):

1. For computer science:
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) \text{ (marginal likelihood)} = P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) + ... \]
\[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.2) + (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.5) = 0.06 + 0.02 + 0.08 + 0.1 = 0.26 \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.26} \approx 0.23 \]

2. For business administration:
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.26} \approx 0.08 \]

3. For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.26} \approx 0.31 \]

So, the resulting probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.23,
  "business administration": 0.08,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.31
}
```
