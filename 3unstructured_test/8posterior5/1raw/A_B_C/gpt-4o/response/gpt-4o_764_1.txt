Let's go through the calculations step by step for each field using Bayes' rule \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \). Since we don't have the actual values for P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|¬H), we'll make reasonable estimations based on the provided personality sketch and general knowledge.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1)**
   - **P(H1)**: This is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his curiosity about nature and love for animals, we might assume a moderate probability. Let's set P(H1) = 0.2.
   - **P(E|H1)**: This is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in this field. His traits align very well with this field, so we estimate it to be high. Let's set P(E|H1) = 0.8.
   - **P(E|¬H1)**: This is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in this field. While the traits could be found in other fields, they are less common. Let's set P(E|¬H1) = 0.2.

2. **Business Administration (H2)**
   - **P(H2)**: This is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration. Given his personality, it seems less likely. Let's set P(H2) = 0.1.
   - **P(E|H2)**: This is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in this field. His warm heart and empathy might fit, but his curiosity about nature and animals doesn't align as well. Let's set P(E|H2) = 0.3.
   - **P(E|¬H2)**: This is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in this field. Just as above, let's set P(E|¬H2) = 0.5, as these traits could fit better in other fields.

3. **Computer Science (H3)**
   - **P(H3)**: This is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science. His intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with this field, so let's set P(H3) = 0.3.
   - **P(E|H3)**: This is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in this field. Although his love for nature and animals doesn't align closely, his intelligence and puzzle-solving do. Let's set P(E|H3) = 0.6.
   - **P(E|¬H3)**: This is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in this field. Let's set it to 0.4.

Now let's use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1)**
   \[
   P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1)P(H1)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.2}{P(E)}
   \]
   
2. **Business Administration (H2)**
   \[
   P(H2|E) = \frac{P(E|H2)P(H2)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \times 0.1}{P(E)}
   \]

3. **Computer Science (H3)**
   \[
   P(H3|E) = \frac{P(E|H3)P(H3)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.6 \times 0.3}{P(E)}
   \]

Since P(E) is a normalizing constant, we can denote it as:
\[
P(E) = P(E|H1)P(H1) + P(E|H2)P(H2) + P(E|H3)P(H3) + ... \text{ (Other fields)}
\]

For simplicity, we'll assume the sum of the probabilities for the fields we considered dominates:
\[
P(E) \approx (0.8 \times 0.2) + (0.3 \times 0.1) + (0.6 \times 0.3)
\]
\[
P(E) \approx 0.16 + 0.03 + 0.18 = 0.37
\]

Now, compute \( P(H|E) \):

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1)**
   \[
   P(H1|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \times 0.2}{0.37} \approx 0.43
   \]

2. **Business Administration (H2)**
   \[
   P(H2|E) \approx \frac{0.3 \times 0.1}{0.37} \approx 0.08
   \]

3. **Computer Science (H3)**
   \[
   P(H3|E) \approx \frac{0.6 \times 0.3}{0.37} \approx 0.49
   \]

Here's the final result:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.43,
  "business administration": 0.08,
  "computer science": 0.49
}
```
