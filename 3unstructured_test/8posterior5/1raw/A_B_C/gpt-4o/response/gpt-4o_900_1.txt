To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study given the evidence \( E \) (Adam's personality sketch), we'll use Bayes' theorem. The formula is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for all hypotheses, it acts as a normalizing constant, and we only need to compute the numerators.

Let's evaluate the probabilities for each field step-by-step.

1. **Business Administration**

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration. Let's assume this is relatively common among graduate fields. I'll set it at 0.2.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam’s personality and interests match someone in Business Administration. Given Adam's personality sketch emphasizing nature, animals, puzzles, and empathy, this seems less typical for Business Administration. I'll set this at 0.1.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch in any other field besides Business Administration. Given that Adam's characteristics fit well in fields that involve understanding nature and animals, this might be set around 0.3, since multiple other fields could match.

Using these:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \approx 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. This field is less common compared to Business Admin but aligns well with Adam's curiosity about nature and love for animals. I'll set it at 0.1.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam's interests and traits match someone in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. This likelihood is very high given the alignment with nature and animals. I'll set this at 0.8.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the attributes in any other field besides Agricultural and Veterinary Science. This might be lower since the personality is quite aligned with this field. I'll set this at 0.2.

Using these:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \approx 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \]

3. **Computer Science**

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Computer Science. This is a popular graduate field, so let's set this at 0.3.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam’s personality sketch matches someone in Computer Science. Given his skills with abstract concepts and puzzles, this is somewhat likely, but less directly aligned with nature and animals. I'll set this at 0.4.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch in any other field besides Computer Science. Given his love for nature and animals, this is somewhat higher elsewhere. I'll set this at 0.3.

Using these:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \approx 0.4 \times 0.3 = 0.12 \]

Finally, normalizing these values to get \( P(H|E) \):

- Business Administration: \( 0.02 \)
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( 0.08 \)
- Computer Science: \( 0.12 \)

{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08,
  "computer science": 0.12
}

Note: These values are proportional and not absolute. The total doesn't sum to 1 because these fields are parts of a broader set of possible graduate fields.
