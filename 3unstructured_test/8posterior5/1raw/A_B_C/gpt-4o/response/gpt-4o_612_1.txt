To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, you need to use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)}, \]

where:

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the sketch \( E \), which can be computed from all possible hypotheses.

Since we are focusing on relative values rather than exact ones, \( P(E) \) will be a normalizing constant that we can ignore for qualitative comparisons as long as we use proportional reasoning.

### Computer Science

- **\( P(H) \)**: Likely relatively high, given the popularity of the field.
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: Likely moderate. Though intelligence and solving puzzles are traits associated with computer science, love for animals and deep curiosity about nature are less directly related.
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This would be relatively lower because no specific traits favor exclusion.

### Business Administration

- **\( P(H) \)**: Moderately high, another popular field.
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: Likely low. The traits of empathy, quiet nature, and love for animals/nature are not particularly indicative of business administration.
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Whereas other fields may align with these traits, making this likelihood low.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **\( P(H) \)**: Likely moderate, less common than computer science or business administration.
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: Likely high, as the personality traits fit very well with curiosity about nature, animals, and appreciation for dedication and hard work.
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Moderately low because these traits strongly suggest a field that involves animal care or nature.

### Conclusion

When comparing qualitatively:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science** is likely to have the highest probability given Adam's personality sketch, since it closely matches his interests and traits.
2. **Computer Science** might follow due to his intelligence and love for puzzles but lacks a strong connection to nature and animals.
3. **Business Administration** seems least probable due to the mismatch with his described personality traits.

Note: These are qualitative estimates to show relative probabilities and would typically require greater numerical rigor and data for precise probabilities.
