To solve this, we'll use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of H (Adam being in that field).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing E given that H is true.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing E given that H is false.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing E.

We will assume equal priors (\( P(H) \)) for simplicity, as we don't have information to indicate otherwise. Typically in the absence of information, a uniform prior is used. Let's break down each field:

### Business Administration
1. **P(H):** The probability that a random graduate student is studying business administration. Let's assume a prior probability of 0.2.
2. **P(E|H):** Given Adam's personality sketch, the likelihood he is in business administration. This is lower because his interests lean more towards nature, animals, and abstract concepts, which are not typically associated with business administration. Let's assume a value of 0.1.
3. **P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in business administration. Assume this is higher because his interests are not typically found in business administration. Let's assume a value of 0.3.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H):** The probability that a random graduate student is studying agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume a prior probability of 0.2.
2. **P(E|H):** Given Adam's personality sketch, the likelihood he is in agricultural and veterinary science. This is much higher given his interests. Let's assume a value of 0.8.
3. **P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Assume this is lower because his interests align well with this field. Let's assume a value of 0.4.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

### Computer Science
1. **P(H):** The probability that a random graduate student is studying computer science. Let's assume a prior probability of 0.2.
2. **P(E|H):** Given Adam's personality sketch, the likelihood he is in computer science. This is moderate because of his intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, but lower than agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume a value of 0.5.
3. **P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in computer science. Assume this is moderate because his interests can somewhat align with this field. Let's assume a value of 0.4.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

Let's summarize the answers:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "computer science": 0.5
}

Please note, \( P(E) \) cancels out in the comparisons since it is the same for all fields under uniform priors we assumed. It is essential for exact evaluation but not for relative comparison here.
