To calculate the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\) for each field given Adam's personality sketch, we will use Bayes' Rule. Bayes' Rule is:

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

Where:
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of Adam being in that field.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the probability of observing Adam's personality given he is in that field.
- \(P(E)\) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality.

Since we are interested in comparing the fields, we can use relative probabilities, assuming \(P(E)\) is constant across fields. We will therefore focus on calculating the numerator \(P(E|H) \cdot P(H)\) for each field and then normalize.

### Hypotheses:
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (\(H_1\))**
2. **Computer Science (\(H_2\))**
3. **Business Administration (\(H_3\))**

### Assumptions:
We need to make reasonable assumptions about each field's prior and how well Adam's personality fits. 

1. \(P(E)\): We assume it's constant for normalization purposes.
2. \(P(H)\) for each field based on typical graduate enrolment:
   - Assume Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 5%
   - Assume Computer Science: 25%
   - Assume Business Administration: 20%
3. \(P(E|H)\): Judged based on the compatibility of Adam's traits with each field.

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science (\(H_1\)):
- Likely fits well given a love for nature, plants, and animals.
- High appreciation for hard work likely aligns with the field.
- Thus: \(P(E|H_1) = 0.7\)
- Assume \(P(H_1) = 0.05\)

\[P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) = 0.7 \cdot 0.05 = 0.035\]

#### Computer Science (\(H_2\)):
- Solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts fit well.
- However, other traits (nature, animals) may not be directly relevant.
- Thus: \(P(E|H_2) = 0.4\)
- Assume \(P(H_2) = 0.25\)

\[P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) = 0.4 \cdot 0.25 = 0.1\]

#### Business Administration (\(H_3\)):
- Hard work appreciation fits, but other traits might be less relevant.
- Thus: \(P(E|H_3) = 0.2\)
- Assume \(P(H_3) = 0.2\)

\[P(E|H_3) \cdot P(H_3) = 0.2 \cdot 0.2 = 0.04\]

### Normalization:
We normalize the values to ensure they sum to 1:

1. Sum of values: \(0.035 + 0.1 + 0.04 = 0.175\)

2. Posterior probabilities:
\[P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.035}{0.175} = 0.20\]
\[P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.175} = 0.57\]
\[P(H_3|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.175} = 0.23\]

### Final Answer:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.20,
  "computer science": 0.57,
  "business administration": 0.23
}
```

These probabilities reflect the relative fit of Adam's personality with each field based on the provided sketch and our assumptions regarding the typical profiles in these fields.
