To start with, let's denote the probabilities as follows:

- P(H): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in each field.
- P(E|H): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in that field.
- P(E|¬H): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in that field.
- P(H|E): The posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in a field given his personality sketch E, which we compute using Bayes' rule.

Let's assign some hypothetical values based on the information provided and general knowledge about graduate studies.

**Computer Science:**
- P(H): The prior probability of Adam being in computer science. Considering that computer science is a common and popular field, we might estimate this as slightly high, say 0.3.
- P(E|H): Considering that computer scientists can have a varied range of interests and Adam's personality sketch includes high intelligence and solving puzzles, let's estimate this moderate-high, say 0.4.
- P(E|¬H): Since the general population might not specifically portray these traits, let's estimate this lower, say 0.2.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|¬H) \times P(¬H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.4 \times 0.3) + (0.2 \times 0.7) = 0.12 + 0.14 = 0.26 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.3}{0.26} \approx 0.4615 \]

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- P(H): The prior probability for agricultural and veterinary science, which is a narrower field, might be lower, say 0.1.
- P(E|H): This estimate should be very high because Adam’s love for nature, plants, and animals aligns perfectly, say 0.7.
- P(E|¬H): General public probabilities might be moderate, say 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \times 0.1) + (0.3 \times 0.9) = 0.07 + 0.27 = 0.34 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.1}{0.34} \approx 0.2059 \]

**Business Administration:**
- P(H): The prior probability for business administration, it is a very common field, say 0.2.
- P(E|H): Personality traits overlap are moderate, so let’s estimate, say 0.2.
- P(E|¬H): Estimate based on general population overlap, let's use, say 0.25.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \times 0.2) + (0.25 \times 0.8) = 0.04 + 0.20 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.2}{0.24} = \frac{0.04}{0.24} \approx 0.1667 \]

Thus, according to the Bayes rule, the posterior probabilities work out like this:

{
  "computer science": 0.4615,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.2059,
  "business administration": 0.1667
}
