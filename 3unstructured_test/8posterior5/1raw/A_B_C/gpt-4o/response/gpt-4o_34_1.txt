To apply Bayes' rule properly, we need to estimate the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \), and then use them to compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \). Here's how it can be done:

### Business Administration
- **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Roughly speaking, let's say the chance of a randomly chosen graduate student being in Business Administration is 0.2 (20%).
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The given personality sketch doesn't match the typical profile for Business Administration, so let's assume it's quite low. For instance, a value of 0.05 seems reasonable.
- **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Since the personality doesn't match Business Administration but there are many other fields, let's set this as 0.70.

By Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Substitute values:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.2}{0.05 \cdot 0.2 + 0.70 \cdot 0.8} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.56} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.017 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Let's say the chance is moderately common, around 0.1 (10%).
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The personality sketch strongly matches Agricultural and Veterinary Science, so this could be very high, like 0.9.
- **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: For fields other than Agricultural and Veterinary Science, let's estimate 0.5.

By Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Substitute values:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{0.9 \cdot 0.1 + 0.5 \cdot 0.9} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.45} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.54} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.167 \]

### Computer Science
- **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Reasonable to assume it's quite common, around 0.3 (30%).
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The sketch is a moderately good fit, perhaps 0.4.
- **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: For fields other than Computer Science, let's estimate 0.6.

By Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Substitute values:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{0.4 \cdot 0.3 + 0.6 \cdot 0.7} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.42} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.54} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.222 \]

So, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.017,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.167,
  "computer science": 0.222
}
```
