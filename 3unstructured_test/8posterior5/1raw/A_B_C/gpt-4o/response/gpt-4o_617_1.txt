Sure, let's proceed step-by-step. 

The main idea is to use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \(H\) represents the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in a particular field, and \(E\) represents the evidence given by Adam's personality sketch.

Since we have to compute \(P(H|E)\) for each field without needing to make the probabilities add up to 1, let's focus on some reasonable qualitative assessments.

### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)**: We'll assume that a relatively small number of graduate students are in this field. Let's assign a plausible value.
  
  \[ P(H) \approx 0.1 \]

- **P(E|H)**: Adam’s interests align very well with this field. His love for nature, animals, plants, and empathy strongly suggest that he might be in this field.
  
  \[ P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \]

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that someone not in this field has these characteristics. Although Adam's traits can overlap with other fields to a degree, his strong alignment with nature and animals suggests this probability might be lower.
  
  \[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \]

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.9 \times 0.1 = 0.09 \]

### 2. Computer Science

- **P(H)**: Computer science is a popular field, so this probability is fairly high.
  
  \[ P(H) \approx 0.3 \]

- **P(E|H)**: Although Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, his other characteristics (love for animals and nature) are less aligned with typical computer science interests.
  
  \[ P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \]

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that someone not in computer science has these traits.
  
  \[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \]

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09 \]

### 3. Business Administration

- **P(H)**: Another common field, similar in popularity to computer science.
  
  \[ P(H) \approx 0.3 \]

- **P(E|H)**: While Adam's empathy and appreciation for hard work could fit business administration, his deep love for animals and nature doesn’t align as strongly with this field.
  
  \[ P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \]

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that someone not in business administration has these traits.
  
  \[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \]

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.2 \times 0.3 = 0.06 \]

Combining these, we have:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.09,
  "computer science": 0.09,
  "business administration": 0.06
}
```

These probabilities suggest that based on Adam's personality sketch, he is somewhat equally likely to be in agricultural and veterinary science or computer science, with business administration being slightly less probable.
