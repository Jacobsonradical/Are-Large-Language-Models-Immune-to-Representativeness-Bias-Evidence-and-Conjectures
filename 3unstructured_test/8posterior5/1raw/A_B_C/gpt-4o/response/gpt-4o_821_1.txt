To solve this problem using Bayes' Rule, we need to consider:

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam was enrolled in each field.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam was *not* enrolled in each field.

We will also use Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since the actual value of \( P(E) \) (the overall probability of personality sketch \( E \)) is unknown and constant across all cases, we will focus on the relative comparison between different hypotheses rather than exact numerical values.

I'll now estimate the relative probabilities for each field based on the given personality sketch.

1. **business administration**:
   - **P(H)**: Let's assume a moderately common likelihood for graduate students.
   - **P(E|H)**: Low, as the personality sketch (interest in nature, plants, empathy, animals) does not strongly align with typical business administration interests.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: Higher, as the personality sketch better aligns with other fields.

2. **agricultural and veterinary science**:
   - **P(H)**: Let's assume a moderately common likelihood for graduate students.
   - **P(E|H)**: High, as the personality sketch (genuine curiosity about nature, plants, love for animals) aligns very well with this field.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: Lower, as the personality sketch more specifically fits agricultural and veterinary science.

3. **computer science**:
   - **P(H)**: Similarly, assume a moderately common likelihood for graduate students.
   - **P(E|H)**: Moderate, as the high intelligence and puzzle-solving might fit, but the nature and animals part does not closely align.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: Higher, as the personality sketch fits less closely with computer science compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

Based on these qualitative assessments:

- **business administration**: P(H) = 0.2, P(E|H) = 0.1, P(E|\neg H) = 0.4
- **agricultural and veterinary science**: P(H) = 0.3, P(E|H) = 0.8, P(E|\neg H) = 0.3
- **computer science**: P(H) = 0.3, P(E|H) = 0.4, P(E|\neg H) = 0.4

Let's compute their relative values:
\[ \text{Relative }P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Thus:
- **business administration**: \( \text{Relative } P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02 \)
- **agricultural and veterinary science**: \( \text{Relative } P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \)
- **computer science**: \( \text{Relative } P(H|E) \propto 0.4 \times 0.3 = 0.12 \)

Now normalize these relative values to obtain probabilities that sum to 1 for simplicity:

Sum of relative values = 0.02 + 0.24 + 0.12 = 0.38

Normalized probabilities:
- **business administration**: \( 0.02 / 0.38 \approx 0.053 \)
- **agricultural and veterinary science**: \( 0.24 / 0.38 \approx 0.632 \)
- **computer science**: \( 0.12 / 0.38 \approx 0.316 \)

Final answer:

{
  "business administration": 0.053,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.632,
  "computer science": 0.316
}
