To solve the problem using Bayes' Theorem, we need to evaluate the probability \( P(H|E) \). Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( H \) is the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
- \( E \) is the evidence, i.e., the personality sketch of Adam.
    
We will assume the following:

1. \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field (business administration, computer science, or agricultural and veterinary science). Let’s assume the priors are equally likely since we don’t have specific prior information.

2. \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence given the hypothesis.

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence given that the hypothesis is not true.

4. \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H)) \)

Since we want relative probabilities, we'll normalize at the end. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.33 \) initially for each field due to equal likelihood. Let's assess \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \) qualitatively based on the given personality sketch.

### Business Administration:
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \) is likely low, as Adam's traits suggest a preference for nature and puzzles over business.
- Let's estimate: \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.1 \).
- Assume \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \) is the average of P(E|H for other fields), estimate: \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.3 \).

### Computer Science:
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) could be moderate as puzzles and high intelligence are common traits in this field. However, his emphasis on nature and animals reduces this likelihood.
- Let's estimate: \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.2 \).
- Assume \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.3 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \) is likely very high due to Adam's love for nature, animals, and empathy.
- Let's estimate: \( P(E|H_{AVS}) = 0.6 \).
- Assume \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) = 0.2 \).

Now, we can estimate \( P(H|E) \) for each field using the assumed values.

### Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \approx  \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.33}{(0.1 \cdot 0.33 + 0.3 \cdot 0.67)} = \frac{0.033}{0.3} = 0.11\]

### Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.33}{(0.2 \cdot 0.33 + 0.3 \cdot 0.67)} = \frac{0.066}{0.3} = 0.22 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.33}{(0.6 \cdot 0.33 + 0.2 \cdot 0.67)} = \frac{0.198}{0.3} = 0.66\]

So, our final probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.11,
  "computer science": 0.22,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.66
}
```
