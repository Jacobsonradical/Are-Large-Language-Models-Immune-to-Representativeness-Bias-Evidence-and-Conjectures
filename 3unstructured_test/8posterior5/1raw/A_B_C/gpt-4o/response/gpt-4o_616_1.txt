To calculate the probabilities using Bayes' theorem, we need the following:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the field \( H \).
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam is in the field \( H \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam is not in the field \( H \).

\( P(H|E) \), the posterior probability, can be calculated using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have precise numerical values and to provide a qualitative measure, we'll estimate these probabilities based on the provided personality sketch.

**Field: Business Administration**  
- \( P(H \text{ for Business Administration}) \): Graduate students from various fields exist; business administration is common.
  Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
- \( P(E|H \text{ for Business Administration}) \): Adam's love for nature, empathy, and abstract thinking seem less fitting for business administration compared to other fields.
  Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.05 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H \text{ for Business Administration}) \): The evidence given seems more in line with fields emphasizing nature or abstraction.
  Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

**Field: Agricultural and Veterinary Science**  
- \( P(H \text{ for Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) \): Adam's love for nature and animals fits well here.
  Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).
- \( P(E|H \text{ for Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) \): The evidence perfectly fits the field.
  Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H \text{ for Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) \): Less likely we'd see such a match in unrelated fields.
  Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

**Field: Computer Science**  
- \( P(H \text{ for Computer Science}) \): A widely popular and common field for graduate studies.
  Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.3 \).
- \( P(E|H \text{ for Computer Science}) \): His intelligence and capability to understand abstract concepts align well, though less so the love for plants and animals.
  Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.25 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H \text{ for Computer Science}) \): Other fields would be more strongly related to his personality sketch.
  Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.25 \).

Using Bayes’ Theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Assuming \( P(E) \) is the same across all hypotheses, and considering it acts as a normalizing constant, we focus on the numerator:

{
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.05 * 0.15}{P(E)} = 0.0075 \),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{0.8 * 0.05}{P(E)} = 0.04 \),
  "computer science": \( \frac{0.25 * 0.3}{P(E)} = 0.075 \)
}

To express these as relative probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.0075 / (0.0075 + 0.04 + 0.075) ≈ 0.061,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.04 / (0.0075 + 0.04 + 0.075) ≈ 0.327,
  "computer science": 0.075 / (0.0075 + 0.04 + 0.075) ≈ 0.612
}

Consolidated, the values result as:

{
  "business administration": 0.061,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.327,
  "computer science": 0.612
}
