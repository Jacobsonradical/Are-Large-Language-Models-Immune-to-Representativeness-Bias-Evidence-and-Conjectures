To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we'll need to make educated estimations for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in a particular field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in that particular field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch \(E\), which can be computed using the Law of Total Probability.

Since we do not have exact data, our estimations are based on logical reasoning.

### 1. Business Administration

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of a graduate student being in Business Administration. Let’s assume this is somewhat average among diverse fields, so let's set \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam having his personality traits given he is in Business Administration may not be very high, as his traits seem more suited to science-related fields. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Considering all other fields, the personality traits described might be more probable, so let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Given the probabilities:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

We'll normalize in the final step to express \( P(E) \).

### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- \( P(H) \): This field may have lower enrollment than broader categories like Business Administration. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Adam's personality sketch (love for nature, animals, empathy) seems highly compatible with this field. Let's set \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given all other fields, the probability would be lower, so let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Given the probabilities:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

### 3. Computer Science

- \( P(H) \): Computer Science is a highly popular field, so let's assume it’s somewhat likely. \( P(H) = 0.3 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Adam’s intelligence and problem-solving skills fit well, but his empathy and nature interest are not closely related. Assume \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Given the probabilities:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \]

### Normalizing 

To compare the probabilities in a common setup, we'll normalize assuming \( P(E) \) is equal for all cases:

\[ P(H|E \text{ for Business Administration}) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.3} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.08 + 0.06} = \frac{0.02}{0.16} = 0.125 \]

\[ P(H|E \text{ for Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.3} = \frac{0.08}{0.02 + 0.08 + 0.06} = \frac{0.08}{0.16} = 0.5 \]

\[ P(H|E \text{ for Computer Science}) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.3} = \frac{0.06}{0.02 + 0.08 + 0.06} = \frac{0.06}{0.16} = 0.375 \]

So the final probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.125,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5,
  "computer science": 0.375
}
```

These results indicate the highest posterior probability for Adam being in Agricultural and Veterinary Science given his personality sketch, followed by Computer Science, and lastly Business Administration.
