Let's start by analyzing the probabilities for each hypothesis.

### Step 1: Define Prior Probabilities (P(H))

These are our initial beliefs about the likelihood that Adam is enrolled in each field before considering the personality sketch.

- **P(H for Agricultural and Veterinary Science)**: Let's assume the probability that a student could be in this field is relatively average, say 0.15.
- **P(H for Computer Science)**: Given the popularity of this field, let's assume a higher prior, say 0.30.
- **P(H for Business Administration)**: Let's assume the probability for this field is somewhere in between the others, say 0.20.

### Step 2: Define Likelihoods (P(E|H) and P(E|¬H))

These are the probabilities that we would observe the personality sketch if Adam were in each field or not.

- **P(E|H for Agricultural and Veterinary Science)**: Given Adam's passion for nature, plants, and animals, there is a high likelihood he is in this field, let's say 0.8.
- **P(E|¬H for Agricultural and Veterinary Science)**: If he is not in this field, the probability of him having interest in nature and animals but being in a different field might be relatively lower. Let's assume 0.2.

- **P(E|H for Computer Science)**: Adam's love for puzzles and high intelligence suits computer science well, though his empathy and love for nature might not be central to CS. So let's say 0.4.
- **P(E|¬H for Computer Science)**: If Adam isn't in computer science, then he’s less likely to exhibit these traits to a significant degree, let’s say 0.25.

- **P(E|H for Business Administration)**: It's less likely for someone in this field to exhibit a strong interest in nature and animals. Let’s rate it 0.3.
- **P(E|¬H for Business Administration)**: If he is not in business administration, the probability that someone with this personality is in a different field is still somewhat significant but slightly adjusted upwards. Let’s say 0.35.

### Step 3: Apply Bayes Rule

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to compute the total evidence \(P(E)\) for normalization purposes:

\[ P(E) = P(E | H) \cdot P(H) + P(E | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For simplicity, let's assume \(\neg H\) represents the sum probability for all other fields.

### Calculations

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.8 \cdot 0.15 + (1-0.15) \cdot 0.2}
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.17} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.414
   \]

2. **Computer Science**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.30}{0.4 \cdot 0.30 + (1-0.30) \cdot 0.25}
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.175} = \frac{0.12}{0.295} \approx 0.407
   \]

3. **Business Administration**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.20}{0.3 \cdot 0.20 + (1-0.20) \cdot 0.35}
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.28} = \frac{0.06}{0.34} \approx 0.176
   \]
