To analyze the probabilities using Bayes Rule, we need to define the components clearly:

- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H|E) \): Posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field given the personality sketch.

Given the details in the personality sketch \( E \), we need to make educated estimations for the respective values. For simplicity, I will assign hypothetical values based on typical correlations between Adam's traits and the likelihood of being in various fields.

### Business Administration

- \( P(H) = 0.2 \): Moderate base rate, as business administration is a common field.
- \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \): The personality sketch (love for nature, animals, solving puzzles, warm heart) is not strongly correlated with a business administration field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \): Higher likelihood to have these traits in non-business fields.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Estimating \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.24 = 0.26 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.26} = \frac{0.02}{0.26} \approx 0.077 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- \( P(H) = 0.15 \): Less common than business, but not rare.
- \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \): Very high correlation given the personality sketch.
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \): Traits are somewhat common even outside this field.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.3 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.255 = 0.375 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.375} = \frac{0.12}{0.375} \approx 0.32 \]

### Computer Science

- \( P(H) = 0.25 \): Fairly common field.
- \( P(E|H) = 0.6 \): Traits such as solving puzzles and high intelligence correlate well.
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \): Although high intelligence is common in this field, empathy and love for nature are less so.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.6 \cdot 0.25 + 0.3 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.15 + 0.225 = 0.375 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.25}{0.375} = \frac{0.15}{0.375} \approx 0.4 \]
