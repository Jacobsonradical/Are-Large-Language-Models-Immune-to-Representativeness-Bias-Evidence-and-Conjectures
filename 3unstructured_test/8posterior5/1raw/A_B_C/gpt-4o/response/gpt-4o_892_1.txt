To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need the following steps:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

where \( P(E) \) can be expanded as:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

Let's denote the probability \( P(H) \) for each field to reflect the prior belief of students enrolling in these fields. Similarly, we estimate \( P(E|H) \), the likelihood of observing Adam's qualities in a student of these fields, and \( P(E|\neg H) \), the likelihood of observing Adam's qualities in a student not in these fields.

Given that these values are subjective judgments, I'll make reasonable estimates based on the personality sketch of Adam:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- \( P(H)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} \): Let’s estimate this as 0.1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science is a specialized field with fewer students compared to more popular fields like Business Administration.
- \( P(E|H)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} \): Students in this field generally have a strong interest in nature and animals. Let’s estimate this high, say 0.8.
- \( P(E|\neg H)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} \): Given Adam's qualities, they could occur in other fields as well. Let’s estimate this as 0.2.

### Computer Science

- \( P(H)_{\text{computer science}} \): Given the popularity of this field, let’s estimate this as 0.4.
- \( P(E|H)_{\text{computer science}} \): Computer Science students do enjoy solving puzzles, and some may have interests in nature, but less commonly so. Let’s estimate this as 0.3.
- \( P(E|\neg H)_{\text{computer science}} \): Adam’s interests are quite possible outside of Computer Science. Let’s estimate this as 0.6.

### Business Administration

- \( P(H)_{\text{business administration}} \): This is also a popular field, so let’s estimate this as 0.3.
- \( P(E|H)_{\text{business administration}} \): Business students are less likely to have strong inclinations towards nature and animals. Let’s estimate this as 0.1.
- \( P(E|\neg H)_{\text{business administration}} \): Adam’s interests might be more commonly found outside of Business Administration. Let’s estimate this as 0.7.

Now, let's compute \( P(E) \):

\[
P(E) = \sum_{\text{fields}} P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

\[
P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.4) + (0.1 \cdot 0.3) + (\text{Other terms})
\]

This simplifies our calculation by considering the terms we used.

Finally, using Bayes' Rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Here are the final values:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.35,
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.05
