To answer this question, we'll use Bayes' rule, which is defined as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability, i.e., the probability that hypothesis \( H \) is true given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood, i.e., the probability of evidence \( E \) given that hypothesis \( H \) is true.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the evidence probability, a normalizing constant that ensures all probabilities sum to 1.

Given the information in the personality sketch (E) of Adam, let's make some educated estimates for each field.

### Business Administration

- **Prior Probability (\( P(H) \)):** Let's assume that the prior probability of a graduate student specializing in business administration is moderate, say 0.20.
- **Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \)):** The likelihood that someone with Adam's characteristics would be in business administration is low because his traits don't particularly align with those typically associated with business administration (e.g., less emphasis on nature, animals, strong empathy). Let's say 0.05.
- **Likelihood (\( P(E |\neg H) \)):** The likelihood of someone with his personality sketch being in a non-business administration field is higher because his traits align better with other fields. Let's assume 0.30.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.20}{P(E)} \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **Prior Probability (\( P(H) \)):** Given Adam's characteristics, the prior probability of specialization in agricultural and veterinary science is quite high. Let's say 0.30.
- **Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \)):** The likelihood of evidence \( E \) given \( H \) is very high because his traits align well with a field focused on nature, plants, and animals. Let's say 0.85.
- **Likelihood (\( P(E |\neg H) \)):** The likelihood of someone with such traits being in a non-agricultural and veterinary science field is relatively lower. Let's say 0.20.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.85 \cdot 0.30}{P(E)} \]

### Computer Science

- **Prior Probability (\( P(H) \)):** Assume the prior probability of a graduate student specializing in computer science is moderate, say 0.25.
- **Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \)):** The likelihood that someone with Adam's characteristics would be in computer science is moderate. His love for puzzles and high intelligence in abstract concepts aligns well, but his empathy and love for nature and animals are not typically highlighted in computer science. Let's say 0.50.
- **Likelihood (\( P(E |\neg H) \)):** The likelihood of someone with such traits being in a non-computer science field is moderate as well. Let's say 0.30.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.50 \cdot 0.25}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant, we don't need to compute its exact value, but we can say:
\[ P(E) = P(H_1)P(E|H_1) + P(H_2)P(E|H_2) + P(H_3)P(E|H_3) + \ldots \]

For simplicity, let's consider these as relative comparisons rather than exact values. Given that \( P(E) \) is the same for each, we can just compare the numerators. So the final posterior probabilities can be compared based on the products of \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(H) \).

{
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.20}{0.05 \cdot 0.20 + 0.85 \cdot 0.30 + 0.50 \cdot 0.25} \),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{0.85 \cdot 0.30}{0.05 \cdot 0.20 + 0.85 \cdot 0.30 + 0.50 \cdot 0.25} \),
  "computer science": \( \frac{0.50 \cdot 0.25}{0.05 \cdot 0.20 + 0.85 \cdot 0.30 + 0.50 \cdot 0.25} \)
}

Which results in approximate values:

{
  "business administration": 0.030,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.637,
  "computer science": 0.333
}

So the final answer is:

{
  "business administration": 0.03,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.64,
  "computer science": 0.33
}
