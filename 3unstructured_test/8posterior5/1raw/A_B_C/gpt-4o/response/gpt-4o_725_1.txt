To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field of study given his personality sketch, we need to apply Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule is defined as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given not the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

For each field:
- Let's assume equal priors for simplicity, \( P(H) = \frac{1}{N} \), where \( N \) is the number of possible fields (let's assume \( N \) is large and diverse).
- We need to estimate \( P(E|H) \), the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he was enrolled in each of these fields.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) can be estimated as the average likelihood of the personality sketch given any field other than \( H \).

Given Adam's traits:

- Business Administration: Given Adam's strong empathy, genuine curiosity about nature, and considerations for hard work, it might be less likely than other fields. 
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Adam's deep love for animals and nature fits very well.
- Computer Science: His high intelligence and ability to solve puzzles could fit this field, though less so compared to Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

Our approximate estimates:

- \( P(H_{BA}) \approx 0.33 \)
- \( P(H_{AVS}) \approx 0.33 \)
- \( P(H_{CS}) \approx 0.33 \)

To estimate \( P(E|H) \):

- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \approx 0.1 \): Traits don't strongly fit the field.
- \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \approx 0.7 \): Traits very strongly fit the field.
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \approx 0.2 \): Only some traits fit, particularly abstract thinking and puzzle-solving.

To compute \( P(E|\neg H) \):

Assuming we have a diverse set of fields, \( P(E|\neg H) \approx \) the average likelihood given other fields:
- \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \approx 0.5 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \approx 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \approx 0.3 \)

So \( P(E) \approx \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) + P(E|H_{AVS}) + P(E|H_{CS})}{3} = \frac{0.1 + 0.7 + 0.2}{3} = 0.33 \)

Now we use Bayes' Rule:

- For Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.33}{0.33} = 0.1 \]

- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.33}{0.33} = 0.7 \]

- For Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.33}{0.33} = 0.2 \]

Thus, the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in the specific fields given his personality sketch are:

{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.2"
}
