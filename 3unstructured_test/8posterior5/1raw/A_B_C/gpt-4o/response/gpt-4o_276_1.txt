To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis (i.e., Adam's field of study), we use Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

However, we need to estimate some initial probabilities (prior probabilities \( P(H) \)) and conditional probabilities (\( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \)). \( P(E) \) is constant across all hypotheses, so we only need to correctly evaluate the relative probabilities to rank the fields.

Here are the general estimates given the personality sketch of Adam:

### Business Administration
1. **Prior (\( P(H) \))**: Moderate, as business administration is a common field.
2. **Conditional Probability (\( P(E|H) \))**: Low, as the personality sketch doesn't align well with the typical interests and personality traits of someone in business administration.
3. **Conditional Probability (\( P(E|\neg H) \))**: Likely higher because the traits mentioned don't particularly indicate business administration.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **Prior (\( P(H) \))**: Moderate, as this is a less common graduate field.
2. **Conditional Probability (\( P(E|H) \))**: High, as Adam's love for nature, plants, animals, and a warm heart aligns strongly with this field.
3. **Conditional Probability (\( P(E|\neg H) \))**: Lower, as these traits are less indicative of other fields compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

### Computer Science
1. **Prior (\( P(H) \))**: Moderate to high, as computer science is a highly popular field.
2. **Conditional Probability (\( P(E|H) \))**: Moderate, as his skills in puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts could fit well with computer science.
3. **Conditional Probability (\( P(E|\neg H) \))**: Still substantial but lower than while considering computer science directly.

Let's estimate these values more precisely, although the actual numbers are rough estimates:

### Rough Probability Estimates
- **Business Administration:**
  - \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \)
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \)
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \)

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
  - \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \)
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.6 \)
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \)

- **Computer Science:**
  - \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \)
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \)
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.25 \)

### Applying Bayes' Rule
Using Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H)P(H)
\]

We normalize these probabilities later, but to rank them, we can use the multiplication results directly:

- **Business Administration:**
  - \( P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02 \)

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
  - \( P(H|E) \propto 0.6 \times 0.1 = 0.06 \)

- **Computer Science:**
  - \( P(H|E) \propto 0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09 \)

### Normalizing
The sum is \( 0.02 + 0.06 + 0.09 = 0.17 \).

Thus, to normalize:
- **Business Administration:**
  - \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.17} \approx 0.118 \)

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
  - \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.17} \approx 0.353 \)

- **Computer Science:**
  - \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.17} \approx 0.529 \)
