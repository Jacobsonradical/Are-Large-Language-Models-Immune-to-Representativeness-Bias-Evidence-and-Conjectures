To compute the posterior probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for each of the three fields of study based on the given personality sketch \(E\), we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's consider the personality sketch \(E\) and assess the probabilities for each field.

### 1. Computer Science

- **P(H):** The prior probability that a graduate student is in computer science. Given the popularity of computer science, let's assume \(P(H) = 0.2\).
- **P(E|H):** The likelihood of \(E\) given that Adam is in computer science. Adam's traits (high intelligence, problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts) do align somewhat with computer science students, though his love for nature and animals isn't as common. Let's estimate \(P(E|H) = 0.3\).
- **P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood of \(E\) given that Adam is NOT in computer science. Assuming he's in another field, Adam's traits might still match reasonably well with other fields. Let's estimate \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.4\).

### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H):** The prior probability that a graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. This is a more specialized field, so let's assume \(P(H) = 0.05\).
- **P(E|H):** The likelihood of \(E\) given that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science. Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals is a strong match. Let's estimate \(P(E|H) = 0.8\).
- **P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood of \(E\) given that Adam is NOT in agricultural and veterinary science. His traits might be less likely in other fields, let's estimate \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.3\).

### 3. Business Administration

- **P(H):** The prior probability that a graduate student is in business administration. This is a common field, so let's assume \(P(H) = 0.3\).
- **P(E|H):** The likelihood of \(E\) given that Adam is in business administration. While intelligence and appreciation for hard work apply, the other traits don't align as closely. Let's estimate \(P(E|H) = 0.2\).
- **P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood of \(E\) given that Adam is NOT in business administration. Given his characteristics, it's less likely for him to be in business. Let's estimate \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.4\).

### Computing P(H|E) for each field:

1. **Computer Science:**
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.06}{P(E)} \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{P(E)} = \frac{0.04}{P(E)} \]

3. **Business Administration:**
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.3}{P(E)} = \frac{0.06}{P(E)} \]

To normalize and find \(P(E)\), we sum the numerators and compare:

\[ P(E) = 0.06 + 0.04 + 0.06 = 0.16 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are:

1. **Computer Science:**
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.16} = 0.375 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.16} = 0.25 \]

3. **Business Administration:**
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.16} = 0.375 \]

Therefore, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.375,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.25,
  "business administration": 0.375
}
