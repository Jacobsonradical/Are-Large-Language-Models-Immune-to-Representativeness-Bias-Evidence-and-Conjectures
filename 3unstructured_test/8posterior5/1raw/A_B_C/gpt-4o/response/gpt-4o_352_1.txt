To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need the following:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, to simplify, we do not need the absolute value of \(P(E)\) because it is a constant across all hypotheses. Instead, we'll compute the relative likelihoods since we're only comparing fields.

### 1. Assigning Prior Probabilities (\(P(H)\)):

The overall probability of Adam being enrolled in each field should be somewhat based on common enrollment statistics in the U.S. for graduate students and any additional context.

- Computer Science: This is a popular field, so let's assume a moderate prior probability, say 0.25.
- Business Administration: Also popular, say 0.25.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Less common, perhaps 0.10.

### 2. Likelihoods (\(P(E|H)\)):

These probabilities describe how likely the evidence (Adam's personality sketch) fits within each field:

- **Computer Science**: Puzzle-solving and abstract thinking point toward computer science, but love for nature and animals does not. Let's assign this a moderate likelihood, say 0.50.
- **Business Administration**: The personality traits provided donâ€™t strongly fit this profile, given the lack of visible traits aligning with business-specific skills or interests. Assign a lower likelihood, say 0.20.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Strong fit with love for nature, animals, and empathy. Assign a high likelihood, say 0.80.

### 3. Complement Likelihood (\(P(E|\neg H)\)):

This portrays how likely the evidence fits when not considering each specific field. Since this applies across any fields and any field might attract people with these traits, let's assume:
- General likelihood: 0.50 for simplicity.

### 4. Combining into Bayes' Rule for Relative Likelihoods:

Now, combining all these values using the simplified approach:

#### Computer Science:
\[
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.50 \cdot 0.25 = 0.125
\]

#### Business Administration:
\[
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.20 \cdot 0.25 = 0.05
\]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.80 \cdot 0.10 = 0.08
\]

Based on these relative likelihoods, we can see:

\[
\text{Relative probabilities (unnormalized)} = \{ \text{"computer science": 0.125, "business administration": 0.05, "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08} \}
\]

### Normalization:
To convert these to probabilities summing to 1 (if needed, though not required by your question):
Sum: \(0.125 + 0.05 + 0.08 = 0.255\)

Normalized:
\[
\text{"computer science"}: \frac{0.125}{0.255} \approx 0.49,
\text{"business administration"}: \frac{0.05}{0.255} \approx 0.20,
\text{"agricultural and veterinary science"}: \frac{0.08}{0.255} \approx 0.31
\]

Thus, these values are:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.49,
  "business administration": 0.20,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.31
}
```

Note: These values are not normalized, as requested. If required, they will add up to 1.
