To compute the posterior probabilities P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, you need to provide estimates for the following:

1. P(H): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field.
2. P(E|H): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is enrolled in each field.
3. P(E|\neg H): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is not enrolled in each field.

For simplicity, I’ll assume an arbitrary set of values for P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|\neg H). Adjust these values according to any real data you might have for more accurate results.

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)**: Let’s say initially we believe there’s a 15% chance any given graduate student could be enrolled in business administration.
   - P(H) = 0.15

2. **P(E|H)**: Given the characteristics of Adam, the likelihood that he would have these traits if he were in business administration is somewhat low, as this field mainly focuses on skills like management and finance, not necessarily nature or empathy.
   - P(E|H) = 0.1

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of Adam having these traits given that he’s not in business administration may be significantly higher since other fields might be more closely aligned with his interests.
   - P(E|\neg H) = 0.4

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
And given:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.15) + (0.4 \cdot 0.85) \approx 0.355 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.15}{0.355} \approx 0.042 \]

### Computer Science
1. **P(H)**: Let’s assume a 25% prior probability for this field.
   - P(H) = 0.25

2. **P(E|H)**: Adam’s intelligence and interest in solving puzzles suggest a higher likelihood if he were in computer science.
   - P(E|H) = 0.5

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of someone not in computer science having these traits is perhaps average.
   - P(E|\neg H) = 0.3

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(E) = (0.5 \cdot 0.25) + (0.3 \cdot 0.75) \approx 0.35 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \times 0.25}{0.35} \approx 0.357 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H)**: Assume there’s a 10% prior probability for this field.
   - P(H) = 0.10

2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood is very high since Adam's love of nature, empathy, and love for animals aligns well with this field.
   - P(E|H) = 0.9

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood for these traits in other fields might be moderate.
   - P(E|\neg H) = 0.2

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.10) + (0.2 \cdot 0.90) \approx 0.27 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.10}{0.27} \approx 0.333 \]

Based on these estimates, we have the following posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.042,
  "computer science": 0.357,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.333
}
```

These values indicate that based on the given personality sketch, Adam is most likely enrolled in computer science or agricultural and veterinary science, with a lower probability for business administration.
