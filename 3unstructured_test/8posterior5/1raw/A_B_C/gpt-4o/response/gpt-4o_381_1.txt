To compute the posterior probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for each field of study, we will use Bayes' theorem, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the lack of specific prior probabilities \(P(H)\) for each field of study distribution among graduate students or the complete probability \(P(E)\) for the evidence presented, we will use some qualitative reasoning to estimate these values. Let's consider each field individually:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
**P(H1):** Since Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, along with a love for animals, the prior probability that he is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science should be relatively high.

**P(E|H1):** Given the personality description, the likelihood of E given H1 is very high.

**P(E|\neg H1):** The likelihood of E given not H1 would still be significant, but somewhat lower due to the specificity of his interests towards nature and animals.

### Computer Science
**P(H2):** Adam's traits of high intelligence and abstract thinking align well with characteristics of someone in computer science, but the overall alignment with nature and animals is lesser.

**P(E|H2):** Given that he excels in understanding abstract concepts and solving puzzles, the likelihood of E given H2 is moderately high.

**P(E|\neg H2):** Since computer science doesn't directly relate to interests in nature and animals, it could be significant but moderate.

### Business Administration
**P(H3):** Adamâ€™s described personality doesn't strongly align with typical business administration interests and skills.

**P(E|H3):** Given his empathy and warmth, he could indeed fit in some business contexts (e.g., HR), but the alignment with the description is the weakest here.

**P(E|\neg H3):** Since business administration is quite different in focus than his described interest in nature and animals, this likelihood can be considered moderately low.

### Estimations
Using these qualitative assessments, let's estimate the values:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These values reflect a more informed guess based on the initial description and the qualitative reasoning applied to each hypothesis.
