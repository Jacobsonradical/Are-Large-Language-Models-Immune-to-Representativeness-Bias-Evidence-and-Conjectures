To compute the probability \(P(H|E)\) for each field, we need to use Bayes' rule:

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)}\]

Here's a step-by-step approach for each field:

1. **Prior probability \(P(H)\)**: This is the general likelihood of a student being in a particular field, not considering any specific information about Adam's personality.
2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: This is the probability that Adam would have the given personality if he were in that field.
3. **Marginal likelihood \(P(E)\)**: This is the probability of Adam having the described personality sketch, considering all possible fields.

Since we lack specific data, we'll make some informed assumptions:

- \(P(H)\): Assume all fields have an approximately equal base rate among graduate students (arbitrary moderate probabilities).
- \(P(E|H)\): Estimate how well the personality matches with the stereotypical traits of students in that field.

For simplicity, assume \(P(E) = 1\) for normalization purposes since it cancels out when computing relative probabilities.

### Estimations:

1. **Computer Science**:
    - **Prior \(P(H)\)**: 0.33 (Assume equal likelihood among the three fields provided)
    - **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: Likely to have high intelligence and affinity for solving puzzles, but the empathy and love for animals might not be as common.
        \[P(E|CS) \approx 0.2\]
    - \(\neg H\) includes everything else:
        \[P(E|\neg CS) = \text{1 - weighted average}[P(E|BA) + P(E|AVS)] \approx 0.4\]

2. **Business Administration**:
    - **Prior \(P(H)\)**: 0.33
    - **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: Intelligence applies, but rest of traits (nature, empathy, love for animals) are less common.
        \[P(E|BA) \approx 0.1\]
    - \(\neg H\):
        \[P(E|\neg BA) = \text{1 - weighted average}[P(E|CS) + P(E|AVS)] \approx 0.4\]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - **Prior \(P(H)\)**: 0.33
    - **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: Fits very well with empathy, nature curiosity, and love for animals.
        \[P(E|AVS) \approx 0.7\]
    - \(\neg H\):
        \[P(E|\neg AVS) = \text{1 - weighted average}[P(E|CS) + P(E|BA)] \approx 0.4\]

### Calculations using Bayes' rule:

\[
P(CS|E) = \frac{P(E|CS)P(CS)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.33}{1} = 0.066
\]
\[
P(BA|E) = \frac{P(E|BA)P(BA)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.33}{1} = 0.033
\]
\[
P(AVS|E) = \frac{P(E|AVS)P(AVS)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.33}{1} = 0.231
\]

### Final Probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.066,
  "business administration": 0.033,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.231
}
```

Note: These probabilities are derived under several assumptions and simplified uniform priors; actual values may vary with more precise data.
