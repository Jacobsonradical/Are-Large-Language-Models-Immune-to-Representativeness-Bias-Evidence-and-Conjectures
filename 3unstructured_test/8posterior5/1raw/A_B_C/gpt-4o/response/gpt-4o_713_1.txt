Sure, I'll provide estimates for P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|\(\neg\)H) for each field, and then use Bayes' theorem to compute P(H|E). Here are the calculations:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - P(H): The overall likelihood of being enrolled in this field is relatively low among the general population of graduate students. I'll estimate it at 0.05.
   - P(E|H): Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, it is quite likely that E would be true if H is true. I'll estimate it at 0.7.
   - P(E|\(\neg\)H): Even if Adam is not in this field, there might still be some likelihood of having these personality traits, but this would be lower. I'll estimate it at 0.2.

   Using Bayes' Rule:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   Assuming \( P(E) \approx P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H)) \):

   \[
   P(E) \approx 0.7 \times 0.05 + 0.2 \times 0.95 \approx 0.225
   \]

   \[
   P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.7 \times 0.05}{0.225} \approx 0.156
   \]

2. **Computer Science**:
   - P(H): Computer Science is a more common field among graduate students. I'll estimate it at 0.3.
   - P(E|H): Given Adam's intelligence and puzzle-solving skills, E could be somewhat likely if H is true. I'll estimate it at 0.4.
   - P(E|\(\neg\)H): Even if he is not in Computer Science, these personality traits can still exist but are less likely. I'll estimate it at 0.3.

   Using Bayes' Rule:
   \[
   P(E) \approx P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))
   \]

   \[
   P(E) \approx 0.4 \times 0.3 + 0.3 \times 0.7 \approx 0.33
   \]

   \[
   P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.4 \times 0.3}{0.33} \approx 0.364
   \]

3. **Business Administration**:
   - P(H): Business Administration is fairly common but less likely for someone with Adam's personality sketch. I'll estimate it at 0.2.
   - P(E|H): Given the personality traits described, it is less likely that E would be true if H is true. I'll estimate it at 0.2.
   - P(E|\(\neg\)H): As discussed, Adam's traits seem less aligned but still possible outside this field. I'll estimate it at 0.3.

   Using Bayes' Rule:
   \[
   P(E) \approx P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))
   \]

   \[
   P(E) \approx 0.2 \times 0.2 + 0.3 \times 0.8 \approx 0.28
   \]

   \[
   P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.2 \times 0.2}{0.28} \approx 0.143
   \]


Thus, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.156,
  "computer science": 0.364,
  "business administration": 0.143
}
```
