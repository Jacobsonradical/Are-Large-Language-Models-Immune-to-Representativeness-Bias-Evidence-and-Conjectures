To begin with the calculations, let's denote the following:

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in that specific field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in that specific field.
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field given the personality sketch.

Let's make some reasonable assumptions for the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field, considering they represent general likelihoods of graduate students being in those fields:

- \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.4 \)
- \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.1 \)

Since these should add up to 1 when considering only these three fields, let's assume the rest as "other fields":

- \( P(\text{other fields}) = 0.2 \)

Next, let's reasonably estimate the following values:

- \( P(E|\text{business administration}) \): This might be lower because business administration students may not typically have strong affinities toward nature, empathy for animals, or solving puzzles. Let's estimate it at \( 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \): Students in computer science might have a strong interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence. However, nature and animals might not be a usual trait. Let's estimate it at \( 0.3 \).
- \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \): This field aligns very well with Adam's personality sketch, as it involves nature, plants, animals, and dedication. Let's estimate it at \( 0.8 \).

For \( P(E|\neg H) \), consider the likelihood of the sketch if Adam is in any field not specified directly. Given the unique nature of Adam's traits, we'll conservatively estimate:

- \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \)

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where \( P(E) \) can be derived via the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) + P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) + P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) + P(E|\text{other fields}) \cdot P(\text{other fields}) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.3) + (0.3 \cdot 0.4) + (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.2) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.03 + 0.12 + 0.08 + 0.04 \]

\[ P(E) = 0.27 \]

Finally, compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.3}{0.27} \approx 0.111 \]

\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.4}{0.27} \approx 0.444 \]

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.27} \approx 0.296 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.111,
  "computer science": 0.444,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.296
}
```

These posterior probabilities reflect the updated beliefs about Adam's enrollment in these fields after considering his personality traits and interests.
