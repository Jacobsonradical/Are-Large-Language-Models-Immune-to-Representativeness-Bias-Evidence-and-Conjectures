To evaluate the probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Theorem, we need to consider the following probabilities:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalization constant, we will just rank \( P(H|E) \) comparatively across the fields.

Let's break down the given personality sketch \( E \) in terms of these fields:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- \( P(H) \): Let's assume the base prior probability for any given field is roughly equal, i.e., 1/number of popular graduate fields. Let's approximate it as 0.1 (10%).
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's love for nature, plants, animals, and empathy, the likelihood he matches the profile for agricultural and veterinary science is high, say, 0.8.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): This would be the probability of observing these traits if Adam were in a different field. Given the specificity of his interests, this could be fairly low, say, 0.3.

### Computer Science

- \( P(H) \): Similar base prior probability of 0.1.
- \( P(E|H) \): While Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is good at understanding abstract concepts, his primary interests in nature and animals might not fully align with this field. Let's assign a medium likelihood, say 0.4.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of having these traits outside of computer science remains the same, 0.3.

### Business Administration

- \( P(H) \): Similar base prior probability of 0.1.
- \( P(E|H) \): This field doesnâ€™t align closely with Adam's interests in nature, plants, and animals, so the likelihood here would be low, say 0.2.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of having Adam's traits outside of business administration is consistent with previously mentioned, 0.3.

Now, let's compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.4 \cdot 0.1 = 0.04 \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \cdot 0.1 = 0.02 \]

Thus, the likelihoods that Adam was enrolled in each of these fields, normalized for comparison, are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08,
  "computer science": 0.04,
  "business administration": 0.02
