To solve this using Bayes' Rule, we need to calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \). Here's a breakdown of the terms:

1. \( P(H) \): Prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
2. \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likelihood of evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis is not true.

Bayesâ€™ Rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for all hypotheses, we can calculate \( P(H|E) \) up to a normalizing constant. 

Now let's evaluate each field hypothesis:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): Assuming a neutral prior, let's say 0.2 (20%). 
   - \( P(E|H) \): The personality sketch doesn't particularly support this field strongly. The curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy do not align strongly with typical CS characteristics. However, he is good at solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which are relevant. Let's assume a moderate likelihood of 0.3 (30%).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given the curiosity about nature and love for animals, these traits aren't heavily aligned with CS. Let's assume 0.7 (70%).

2. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H) \): Assuming a neutral prior, let's say 0.2 (20%).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The personality sketch does not align well with a business administration profile. Business usually requires more extroverted traits and less emphasis on nature or animals. Low likelihood, say 0.1 (10%).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Similar reasoning as above, assuming 0.9 (90%).

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): Assuming a neutral prior, perhaps slightly higher because his traits suggest a fit. Let's say 0.3 (30%).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The personality sketch aligns very well; love for nature and animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work fit well here. High likelihood, 0.8 (80%).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given the strong alignment with this field, the likelihood would be notably lower if not in this field. Let's assume 0.2 (20%).

To simplify calculations, let's use approximate values:

- For Computer Science:
  - \( P(H) = 0.2 \)
  - \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \)
  - \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.7 \)
  - \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{ 0.3 \times 0.2 + 0.1 \times 0.2 + 0.8 \times 0.3} \approx \frac{0.06}{0.36} \approx 0.167 \)

- For Business Administration:
  - \( P(H) = 0.2 \)
  - \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \)
  - \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.9 \)
  - \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{ 0.3 \times 0.2 + 0.1 \times 0.2 + 0.8 \times 0.3} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.36} \approx 0.056 \)

- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
  - \( P(H) = 0.3 \)
  - \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \)
  - \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \)
  - \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.3}{0.3 \times 0.2 + 0.1 \times 0.2 + 0.8 \times 0.3} \approx \frac{0.24}{0.36} \approx 0.667 \)

Thus, the approximate posterior probabilities would be:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.167,
  "business administration": 0.056,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.667
}
```
This suggests that given Adam's personality sketch, he is most likely to be in agricultural and veterinary science.
