To apply Bayes' rule, we need to use the following formula for each field:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given that Adam was enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given that Adam was not enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence.

Let me make heuristic estimates for each probability.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H)**: The initial probability that Adam was enrolled in this field, considering the number of fields available — let's guess about 1/20 (0.05).
2. **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's personality sketch aligns well with an interest in nature, animals, and a strong appreciation for hard work, this probability is high — let’s estimate around 0.8.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch if he were not in this field. Since nature and animals play a central role in his profile, let's guess about 0.2.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.95} \approx 0.173 \]

### Computer Science
1. **P(H)**: Let's guess about 1/20 (0.05).
2. **P(E|H)**: Adam's intelligence and enjoyment of puzzles fits with computer science, but the alignment with empathy and nature is weaker. Let's estimate it as 0.4.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of seeing Adam's characteristics in someone not in Computer Science. Let's guess around 0.3.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.05}{0.4 \cdot 0.05 + 0.3 \cdot 0.95} \approx 0.066 \]

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)**: Let's guess about 1/20 (0.05).
2. **P(E|H)**: Adam’s traits don’t particularly align with business administration, except for understanding dedication and hard work. Let’s estimate it as 0.2.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of seeing Adam's characteristics in someone not in Business Administration. Let's guess around 0.4.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.05}{0.2 \cdot 0.05 + 0.4 \cdot 0.95} \approx 0.026 \]

### Final Analysis
Compiling the results:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.173,
  "computer science": 0.066,
  "business administration": 0.026
}
```
These values indicate the relative likelihoods of Adam being in each of these fields based on the given personality sketch.
