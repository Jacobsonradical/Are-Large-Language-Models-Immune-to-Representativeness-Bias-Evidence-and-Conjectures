To apply Bayes rule, we need to assess the probabilities involved for each field of graduate study (H) given the personality sketch (E).

Using Bayes theorem, we have:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Let's judge these probabilities for each field:

1. **Business Administration (H1)**
   - P(H1): Moderate to low, let's assume 0.1.
   - P(E|H1): Low, because the personality sketch doesn't align well with typical traits for this field. Let's assume 0.1.
   - P(E|\neg H1): Could be relatively high since there are other fields better suited to the profile. Let's assume 0.7.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H2)**
   - P(H2): Moderate, reflecting a more likely scenario given Adam's interests. Let's assume 0.3.
   - P(E|H2): High, because the profile suits well with a strong curiosity about nature and empathy for animals. Let's assume 0.8.
   - P(E|\neg H2): Could be lower given how well the profile fits the field. Let's assume 0.4.

3. **Computer Science (H3)**
   - P(H3): Moderate to high, considering his intelligence and affinity for solving puzzles. Let's assume 0.4.
   - P(E|H3): Moderate, since only some aspects fit well. Let's assume 0.5.
   - P(E|\neg H3): Moderate, fitting a less specific profile match. Let's assume 0.6.

Let's compute the values:

**For Business Administration:**
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1)}{P(E)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.1 \cdot 0.1 + 0.9 \cdot 0.7} \]
\[ = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.63} \]
\[ = \frac{0.01}{0.64} \approx 0.0156 \]

**For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2)}{P(E)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.3}{0.8 \cdot 0.3 + 0.2 \cdot 0.4} \]
\[ = \frac{0.24}{0.24 + 0.08} \]
\[ = \frac{0.24}{0.32} \approx 0.75 \]

**For Computer Science:**
\[ P(H3|E) = \frac{P(E|H3) \cdot P(H3)}{P(E)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.4}{0.5 \cdot 0.4 + 0.5 \cdot 0.6} \]
\[ = \frac{0.2}{0.2 + 0.3} \]
\[ = \frac{0.2}{0.5} \approx 0.4 \]

So, the probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": 0.0156,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "computer science": 0.4
