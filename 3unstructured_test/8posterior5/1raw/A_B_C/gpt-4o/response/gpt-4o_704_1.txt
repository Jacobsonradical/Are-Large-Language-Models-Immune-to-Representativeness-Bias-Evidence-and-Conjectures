To compute the Bayesian probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field based on Adam's personality sketch (\( E \)), we need to estimate the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch matches if he is in a given field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability that Adam's personality sketch matches if he is in any other field.

Using Bayes' rule, we can calculate:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \) and we are comparing relative values, we will focus more on the relative likelihoods.

Note: These values are based on typical characteristics of students in each field and how well they align with Adam's personality traits.

### Computer Science
- **P(H):** Moderate (0.2)
- **P(E|H):** Low (0.1) - Computer science students often have intelligence and puzzle-solving skills, but less emphasis on empathy or nature.
- **P(E|\neg H):** Likely similar or higher since Adam's traits aren't strongly indicative of computer science.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H):** Low to Moderate (0.1)
- **P(E|H):** High (0.9) - Strong match with curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work.
- **P(E|\neg H):** Lower since these traits are more specific to this field.

### Business Administration
- **P(H):** Moderate to high (0.3)
- **P(E|H):** Low to medium (0.2) - Business students may value hard work and intelligence, but less alignment with nature/animals.
- **P(E|\neg H):** Likely higher since Adamâ€™s traits don't specifically match this field.

**Calculations:**

For relative values using:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

1. **Computer Science:**
   \[
   P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02
   \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   \[
   P(H|E) \propto 0.9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.09
   \]

3. **Business Administration:**
   \[
   P(H|E) \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.3 = 0.06
   \]

Normalize these values (sum = 0.17):

- Normalized Computer Science:
   \[
   \frac{0.02}{0.17} \approx 0.118
   \]

- Normalized Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
   \[
   \frac{0.09}{0.17} \approx 0.529
   \]

- Normalized Business Administration:
   \[
   \frac{0.06}{0.17} \approx 0.353
   \]

### Final Answer:

{
  "computer science": 0.118,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.529,
  "business administration": 0.353
