Let's break down the process to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Rule. 

Bayes' Rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to evaluate:
1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in the field \( H \).
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in the field \( H \).

Since we don't have precise values, we'll estimate based on general knowledge and make reasonable assumptions. Also, since the total does not need to add up to 1, we'll interpret these as relative likelihoods.

### Computer Science

- \( P(H) \): The likelihood that Adam is enrolled in Computer Science. Let's assume a moderate prior probability. \( P(H) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|H) \): How likely it's to see Adam's traits in Computer Science. Given traits like curiosity, intelligence, and puzzle-solving skills, this might be fairly high. \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): How likely to see Adam's traits in fields other than Computer Science. This might also be moderately high. \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \)

### Business Administration

- \( P(H) \): The likelihood that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration. Let's assume this is lower due to less emphasis on nature and animals. \( P(H) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H) \): Observing Adam's traits in Business Administration might be less common. \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): How likely to see Adamâ€™s traits in fields other than Business Administration. This could be higher. \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \)

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- \( P(H) \): The likelihood that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given his love for nature, plants, and animals, this is higher. \( P(H) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|H) \): Observing Adam's traits in this field is very high. \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): How likely to see Adam's traits in fields other than Agricultural and Veterinary Science. This would be lower. \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \)

Now we calculate the posterior probability:

1. **Computer Science:**
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.08}{P(E)}
   \]

2. **Business Administration:**
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.01}{P(E)}
   \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} = \frac{0.21}{P(E)}
   \]

Since we are comparing relative likelihoods:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.08,
  "business administration": 0.01,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.21
}
```

These values represent the relative likelihoods of Adam being enrolled in each field given the personality sketch \( E \).
