Certainly! We'll begin by assigning reasonable values to the probabilities based on the information provided in the personality sketch of Adam.

### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is studying agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume it to be an uncommon but plausible field, \( P(H) = 0.05 \).
- **P(E|H)**: This is the probability of Adam having the described personality traits given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Since the traits align very well, \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: This is the probability of Adam having the described personality traits given that he is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given that these traits can surface in other fields, we might assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.9 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.95} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.19} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.235} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.191 \]

### 2. Business Administration
- **P(H)**: Let's assume that the probability of a randomly chosen graduate student studying business administration is fairly common, \( P(H) = 0.3 \).
- **P(E|H)**: Given the described personality traits, they do not align particularly well with business administration. Let’s assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: This remains at \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.3}{0.1 \cdot 0.3 + 0.2 \cdot 0.7} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.14} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.17} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.176 \]

### 3. Computer Science
- **P(H)**: Computer Science is a highly common field, so let’s assign a high probability, \( P(H) = 0.25 \).
- **P(E|H)**: Given his intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, the probability is fairly high but he also has very nature-oriented traits, so let's assign \( P(E|H) = 0.5 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: This remains at \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.25}{0.5 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.125}{0.125 + 0.15} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.125}{0.275} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.455 \]

So the calculated values for each field are:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.191,
  "business administration": 0.176,
  "computer science": 0.455
}
```
These values represent the posterior probabilities based on the given personality traits and the initial assumptions.
