To apply Bayes' theorem, we need to determine the likelihood of each hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \), and then find the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood, calculated as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

However, since we only need to compare probabilities and do not require absolute values for \( P(E) \) or the normalization, we can focus on the relative values of \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Let's denote the following assumptions (for simplicity, we'll use subjective estimates):

1. **Prior probability \( P(H) \)** for each field:
   - \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.4 \) (Fairly common field)
   - \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.2 \) (Less common)
   - \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.2 \) (Fairly common)
   
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)** for the evidence given each hypothesis:
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \approx 0.3 \) (Interest in nature and puzzles, empathy is less common)
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \approx 0.7 \) (Matches curiosity about plants, empathy, and love for animals)
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \approx 0.1 \) (Less likely given Adam's traits)

3. **Complementary likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - Since \( P(E|\neg H) \) involves all other fields, we need to estimate it for each hypothesis:
   - For simplicity, letâ€™s assume that the overall likelihood of having such a personality in other fields combined is \( 0.2 \).

Now, let's compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' theorem:

1. **Computer Science**:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.4}{0.3 \cdot 0.4 + 0.7 \cdot 0.2 + 0.1 \cdot 0.2} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.18} \approx 0.67
   \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.3 \cdot 0.4 + 0.7 \cdot 0.2 + 0.1 \cdot 0.2} \approx \frac{0.14}{0.18} \approx 0.78
   \]

3. **Business Administration**:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.3 \cdot 0.4 + 0.7 \cdot 0.2 + 0.1 \cdot 0.2} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.18} \approx 0.11
   \]

Therefore, the posterior probabilities are as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.67,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.78,
  "business administration": 0.11
}
```
