To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given: 
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

We will estimate the values of \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each of the fields. Note that these estimations are somewhat subjective and should be based on general assumptions.

**Business Administration**

- \( P(H_{BA}) \) (the probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is in Business Administration): Approximately 0.2 (since Business Administration is a common field of study)
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): Given the personality sketch of Adam, it is somewhat less likely for a business admin student to match this profile. Thus, let's assume 0.1.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \): The complement of \( P(E|H_{BA}) \) might be higher because the personality traits could fit better with other fields. Let's assume 0.5.
- Since \( P(\neg H_{BA}) = 1 - P(H_{BA}) \) = 0.8

\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.5 \cdot 0.8) = 0.02 + 0.4 = 0.42 \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.42} = \frac{0.02}{0.42} \approx 0.048 \]

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

- \( P(H_{AVS}) \): Approximately 0.1 (less common than Business Administration)
- \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \): Given Adam's personality, it's very likely. Let's assume 0.8.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \): Other fields would collectively have a lower match probability. Let's assume 0.3.
- Since \( P(\neg H_{AVS}) = 1 - P(H_{AVS}) \) = 0.9

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) = 0.08 + 0.27 = 0.35 \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.35} = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \approx 0.229 \]

**Computer Science**

- \( P(H_{CS}) \): Approximately 0.25 (a common field of study)
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Given Adam's intellect and affinity for abstract concepts but not necessarily the nature aspect, let's assume 0.4.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \): The probability should be higher considering the broader match with other expected fields. Let's assume 0.5.
- Since \( P(\neg H_{CS}) = 1 - P(H_{CS}) \) = 0.75

\[ P(E) = (0.4 \cdot 0.25) + (0.5 \cdot 0.75) = 0.1 + 0.375 = 0.475 \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.25}{0.475} = \frac{0.1}{0.475} \approx 0.211 \]
