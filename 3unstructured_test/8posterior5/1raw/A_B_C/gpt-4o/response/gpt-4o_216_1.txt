To answer the given question, we will use Bayes' theorem to compute \( P(H|E) \), which represents the probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field, given his personality sketch \( E \).

Bayes' theorem is formulated as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality traits \( E \) if Adam were enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality traits \( E \) if Adam were not enrolled in that field.

Let's break it down step-by-step for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
    - \( P(H) \): The prior probability of a graduate student being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science can be considered relatively low compared to more common fields like business administration or computer science.
        - Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).
    - \( P(E|H) \):
      - The personality sketch \( E \) aligns quite well with this field, given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals.
      - Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \):
      - This is the probability of observing \( E \) in any field other than agricultural and veterinary science. Given that Adam's traits are somewhat specific to this field, this value might be moderate.
      - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).
    - Using Bayes' theorem:
      \[
      P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{(0.8 \times 0.05) + (0.3 \times 0.95)} \approx 0.12
      \]

2. **Business Administration:**
    - \( P(H) \): The prior probability of a graduate student being enrolled in business administration is relatively higher due to the popularity of the field.
        - Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.3 \).
    - \( P(E|H) \):
      - The personality sketch \( E \) doesn't strongly correlate with the typical traits of a business administration student. So the likelihood is low.
      - Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \):
      - Adam's traits are less common in fields like business administration.
      - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).
    - Using Bayes' theorem:
      \[
      P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.3}{(0.2 \times 0.3) + (0.5 \times 0.7)} \approx 0.15
      \]

3. **Computer Science:**
    - \( P(H) \): The prior probability of a graduate student being enrolled in computer science is also relatively high.
        - Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.25 \).
    - \( P(E|H) \):
      - The personality traits \( E \) somewhat align with computer science, particularly due to Adam's intelligence and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts, as well as enjoying solving puzzles.
      - Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \).
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \):
      - Given Adam's particular traits, this value could be at a moderate level.
      - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).
    - Using Bayes' theorem:
      \[
      P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.25}{(0.4 \times 0.25) + (0.5 \times 0.75)} \approx 0.21
      \]

Now, we summarize our estimates for \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.12,
  "business administration": 0.15,
  "computer science": 0.21
}
```

Note: These values are empirical estimates based on assumed prior probabilities and likelihoods. Actual probabilities would require more specific data.
