Let's calculate the probabilities for each field using Bayes' Rule: 

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll need to estimate the following:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given that he was enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given that he was not enrolled in the given field.

For simplicity in this example, let's make some reasonable assumptions to fill in these probabilities:

- Assume that the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field are roughly equal for graduate students in the U.S.:

  \[ P(H) = \frac{1}{N} \]

  where \( N \) is the number of different potential fields. Since we're only considering three fields out of many possible fields, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

- Next, we estimate \( P(E|H) \) based on how well Adam's personality sketch aligns with typical traits of students in each field.

- We assume \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality traits in a generic graduate student, which we'll consider to be a normalization factor and simply denote as \( C \).

Let's compute values for \( P(E|H) \):

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work are all traits that fit well.
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \)

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence fit well. However, the deep love for animals and nature does not align as well.
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.4 \)

3. **Business Administration**:
   - Empathy and appreciation for hard work fit to some extent, but curiosity about nature, love for animals, and solving puzzles are less relevant.
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \)

Now for \( P(E|\neg H) \), which is the probability of observing the same traits in students from other fields (approximate these as average values):

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \)

2. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \)

3. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \)

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We don't need to calculate \( P(E) \) as a common normalization constant \( C \) since we're only comparing relative probabilities. So:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{C} \]

2. **Computer Science**:
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.1}{C} \]

3. **Business Administration**:
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{C} \]

Normalization constants \( C \) can be same for all; thus, ignoring it, the relative values are:

So, let's present this in the requested format:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8 * 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4 * 0.1,
  "business administration": 0.3 * 0.1
}
```

Simplified:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08,
  "computer science": 0.04,
  "business administration": 0.03
}
```
