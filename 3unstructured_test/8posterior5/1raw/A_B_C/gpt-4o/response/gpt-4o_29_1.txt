To solve this problem using Bayes' rule, we start by defining the probabilities:

- \(P(H)\): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field.
- \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood of observing Adam’s personality sketch if he is enrolled in that specific field.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The likelihood of observing Adam’s personality sketch if he is not enrolled in that specific field.
- \(P(E)\): The overall probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch.
- \(P(H|E)\): The posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch.

Bayes’ rule is stated as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \(P(E)\) is constant for all fields, we can compare relative values of \(P(H|E)\) for different fields without explicitly calculating \(P(E)\). Note that our assessment is somewhat heuristic, as we do not have precise numerical values.

Let's start with the prior probabilities \(P(H)\) for each field. These are very rough estimates based simply on how common these fields are among graduate students in general. We might assume a rough initial equality for simplicity:

\[
P(\text{business administration}) = P(\text{computer science}) = P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = \frac{1}{3}
\]

We'll then use Adam's personality sketch to adjust these priors. Now let's evaluate the likelihoods \(P(E|H)\):

### Business Administration
- **P(E|H)**: Business administration isn't particularly associated with a strong curiosity about nature and animals, nor with solving puzzles. Hence,
  \[
  P(E|\text{business administration}) \text{ might be relatively low. Let's choose } 0.1.
  \]
- **P(E|\neg H)**: If Adam is not in business administration, he is still likely to have the described traits given the other two fields, so
  \[
  P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) \text{ might be similarly low or slightly higher. Let's choose } 0.25.
  \]

### Computer Science
- **P(E|H)**: Computer science is strongly associated with solving puzzles and abstract concepts, but less so with nature and animals.
  \[
  P(E|\text{computer science}) \text{ might be moderate. Let's choose } 0.6.
  \]
- **P(E|\neg H)**: If Adam is not in computer science, he might still display those traits if he were in agricultural and veterinary science, so
  \[
  P(E|\neg \text{computer science}) \text{ might be slightly lower. Let's choose } 0.3.
  \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(E|H)**: This field aligns strongly with Adam’s love for nature, plants, and animals. Hence,
  \[
  P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \text{ might be high. Let's choose } 0.8.
  \]
- **P(E|\neg H)**: If Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science, his traits would fit less perfectly, though they might align somewhat with computer science. Hence,
  \[
  P(E|\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \text{ might be moderate. Let's choose } 0.4.
  \]
  

Now we apply Bayes’ rule to find \(P(H|E)\):

1. **Business Administration**:
  
   \[
   P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{P(E)}
   \]

2. **Computer Science**:

   \[
   P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{P(E)}
   \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:

   \[
   P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{P(E)}
   \]

Since \(P(E)\) is the same for all, we'll simply compare the numerators:

1. **Business Administration**:

   \[
   0.1 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 0.0333
   \]

2. **Computer Science**:

   \[
   0.6 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 0.2
   \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:

   \[
   0.8 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 0.2667
   \]

Converting these values so they sum to 1 (for better interpretation):

- Total Sum: \(0.0333 + 0.2 + 0.2667 = 0.5\)

- Normalized:

  \[
  P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.0333}{0.5} = 0.0666
  \]
  \[
  P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.2}{0.5} = 0.4
  \]
  \[
  P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.2667}{0.5} = 0.5334
  \]

In conclusion, here are the final posterior probabilities:

```
{
  "business administration": 0.0666,
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5334
}
```
