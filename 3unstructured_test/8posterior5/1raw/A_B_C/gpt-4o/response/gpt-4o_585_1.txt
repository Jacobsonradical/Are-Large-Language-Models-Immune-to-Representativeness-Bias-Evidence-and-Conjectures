To compute \(P(H|E)\) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field (\(P(H)\)), the likelihood of the personality sketch given the hypothesis (\(P(E|H)\)), and the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in that field (\(P(E|\neg H)\)). Finally, we'll use Bayes' rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \(P(E)\) is a normalization constant, for comparison purposes, we can disregard it because it remains the same across all hypotheses. Hence, we will compute the unnormalized version of \(P(H|E)\):

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Let's assign reasonable values to each component based on the given personality sketch.

### Computer Science
- **P(H):** It's reasonable to assume that a significant number of graduate students are in computer science, but not overwhelmingly so. Let's assume \(P(H)\) = 0.2.
- **P(E|H):** The personality sketch describes Adam as someone who is curious about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, and has high intelligence. While these traits are common in computer science students, the emphasis on nature and animals might suggest a slightly lower likelihood. Let's use \(P(E|H)\) = 0.3.
- **P(E|\neg H):** Given that there are many other fields that Adam's interests and traits align with, a tentative estimation could be \(P(E|\neg H)\) = 0.1.

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.3 \cdot 0.2 = 0.06 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H):** The field of agricultural and veterinary science is less common than computer science, but Adam's characteristics strongly align with this field. Let's assume \(P(H)\) = 0.05.
- **P(E|H):** The personality traits described (love for animals, appreciation for hard work, curiosity about nature) align closely with this field. Let's use \(P(E|H)\) = 0.9.
- **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of observing the same traits if Adam were in another field might be lower. Let's use \(P(E|\neg H)\) = 0.05.

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.9 \cdot 0.05 = 0.045 \]

### Business Administration
- **P(H):** Business administration is also a common field among graduate students. Let's assume \(P(H)\) = 0.1.
- **P(E|H):** The personality traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals) do not strongly align with a typical business administration student. However, some traits like high intelligence and appreciation for hard work do align. Let's use \(P(E|H)\) = 0.2.
- **P(E|\neg H):** Given that other fields might match Adam's traits better, we'll use \(P(E|\neg H)\) = 0.1.

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.1 = 0.02 \]

Now we can summarize the results:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.06,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.045,
  "business administration": 0.02
}
```

This representation gives us the unnormalized probabilities which can be compared relative to each other to assess the most likely field of study for Adam.
