To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to identify the following probabilities for each field:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in that field.

Let's estimate these probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

### Computer Science

1. **P(H)**: Computer science is a popular field. Let's assume a prior probability of 0.25.
2. **P(E|H)**: The personality traits don't strongly point towards computer science but could fit. Let's estimate it at 0.3.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Given the personality, it seems less likely but possible that they would fit in other fields too, so let's set this to 0.15.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.25}{P(E)} \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: This field is less common than computer science. Let's assume a prior probability of 0.1.
2. **P(E|H)**: The personality sketch strongly fits this field. Let's estimate it at 0.7.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Given the traits, it's less likely that these would fit as well into significantly different fields. Let's assume 0.05.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: Business administration is a common field. Let's assume a prior probability of 0.15.
2. **P(E|H)**: The personality traits don't align closely with business administration, but it’s possible. Let's estimate it at 0.2.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Similar to computer science, let's set this to 0.15.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \]

To normalize and calculate the final scores, we must recognize that we don't have exact values for \( P(E) \), but we can compare the relative likelihoods.

Here are the approximated values relative to each other:

{
  "computer science": \( \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.25}{P(E)} \approx 0.075 \),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \approx 0.07 \),
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \approx 0.03 \)
}

Since \( P(E) \) is common to all, it’s a normalizing factor:

{
  "computer science": "0.34",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.32",
  "business administration": "0.14"
}

(These values were normalized based on their relative likelihood approximation)
