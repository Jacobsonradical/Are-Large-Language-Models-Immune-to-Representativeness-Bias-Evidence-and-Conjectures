To solve for the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Theorem, we need the following information:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch if Adam is in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch if Adam is not in that field.

For each field \( H \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we do not know the exact values of \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) precisely, we must make reasonable assumptions based on the given information.

Let's make the following assumptions:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
    - \( P(H) \): Let's assume a moderate prior probability (0.2), indicating it is not the most or least common field.
    - \( P(E|H) \): Quite high (0.8) because Adam has a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals.
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Moderate (0.3), as people in other fields might also show some of these traits but less likely.

2. **Computer Science**
    - \( P(H) \): Let's assume a higher prior probability (0.3) because Computer Science is a common graduate field.
    - \( P(E|H) \): Lower (0.2) because while Adam is good at solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, his primary interests are nature and animals.
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Reasonable assumption, also moderate (0.4), as abstract thinking can be present in many other fields.

3. **Business Administration**
    - \( P(H) \): Let's assume a moderate to high prior probability (0.25), as it is quite a common graduate field.
    - \( P(E|H) \): Lower (0.1) because the personality sketch does not align closely with typical interests and skills advocated in business administration.
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Moderate (0.5), similar reasoning, some skills align but not entirely.

Now, we can calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \). However, we do not have the exact value of \( P(E) \). Instead, we can compare the relative values \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) with no normalization factor. 

For simplicity, we'll assume \( P(E) \) is approximately the sum of the products \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

Let's calculate the unnormalized values first:

- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
  - Unnormalized value \( = 0.8 \times 0.2 = 0.16 \)

- For Computer Science:
  - Unnormalized value \( = 0.2 \times 0.3 = 0.06 \)

- For Business Administration:
  - Unnormalized value \( = 0.1 \times 0.25 = 0.025 \)

Now normalize these values by dividing each by their sum:

Sum of unnormalized values \( = 0.16 + 0.06 + 0.025 = 0.245 \)

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.16}{0.245} \approx 0.653 \)
- **Computer Science**: \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.245} \approx 0.245 \)
- **Business Administration**: \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.025}{0.245} \approx 0.102 \)

The final probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.653,
  "computer science": 0.245,
  "business administration": 0.102
