Sure, I can help with that. Let's begin by estimating the necessary probabilities and then use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \).

### Prior Probabilities: \( P(H) \)
- \( P(H_{BA}) \): The probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(H_{CS}) \): The probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(H_{AV}) \): The probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

We can assume that these probabilities depend on general enrollment statistics among graduate students in the U.S. These are rough estimates:

- Business Administration (High Enrollment): \( P(H_{BA}) \approx 0.3 \)
- Computer Science (Moderate Enrollment): \( P(H_{CS}) \approx 0.3 \)
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science (Lower Enrollment): \( P(H_{AV}) \approx 0.1 \)

### Likelihood: \( P(E|H) \)
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): The probability of observing E given Adam is in business administration.
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): The probability of observing E given Adam is in computer science.
- \( P(E|H_{AV}) \): The probability of observing E given Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science.

Based on the personality sketch:
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): In business administration, the traits less frequently align with curiosity about nature and a deep love for animals. Let's estimate it to be around \( 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): In computer science, the traits like high intelligence and problem-solving abilities are more aligned, although less with nature and animals. Let's estimate it to be around \( 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|H_{AV}) \): In agricultural and veterinary science, the traits strongly align with curiosity about nature, love for animals, and dedication. Let's estimate it to be around \( 0.7 \).

### Marginal Likelihood: \( P(E|\neg H) \)
This term doesn't need to be broken down per field but could be used to normalize our posterior probabilities if needed. However, given the problem's simplicity, we can focus directly on computing the unnormalized posterior values,

### Posterior Probability: \( P(H|E) \)
By Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

### Compute Values:

- For Business Administration:
  \[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) = 0.1 \times 0.3 = 0.03 \]

- For Computer Science:
  \[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) = 0.2 \times 0.3 = 0.06 \]

- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
  \[ P(H_{AV}|E) \propto P(E|H_{AV}) \cdot P(H_{AV}) = 0.7 \times 0.1 = 0.07 \]

Now we can normalize these values to get the posterior probabilities if needed. However, normalization is not required by the structure of this problem, so I'll list the unnormalized probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.03,
  "computer science": 0.06,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.07
