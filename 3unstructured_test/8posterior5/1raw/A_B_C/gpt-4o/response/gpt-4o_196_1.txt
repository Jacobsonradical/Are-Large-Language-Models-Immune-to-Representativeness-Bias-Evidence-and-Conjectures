To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \), we'll use Bayes' theorem, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in a certain field, \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing E given that Adam is in a certain field, and \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing E given that Adam is not in the field.

To simplify, we'll use qualitative assessments and relative probabilities. We won't compute exact values but will use heuristics to judge their relative likelihoods.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

**Prior Probability (\( P(H) \))**: Assume a moderate prior, given that agricultural and veterinary science is not the most common graduate field overall. Let's take it as \( 0.2 \).

**Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \))**: Given Adam’s curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy, this field aligns very well. Let's assume \( 0.9 \).

**Complement Likelihood (\( P(E|\neg H) \))**: Given that E describes traits more common in non-business and non-computer fields, let this be lower. Assume \( 0.3 \).

### Computer Science

**Prior Probability (\( P(H) \))**: Higher because computer science is a popular field. Let’s assume \( 0.3 \).

**Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \))**: Though Adam is intelligent and enjoys solving puzzles, his interests seem more aligned with nature and animals. Let's assume \( 0.2 \).

**Complement Likelihood (\( P(E|\neg H) \))**: Higher given that many intelligent individuals with empathy do not choose computer science. Let’s take \( 0.6 \).

### Business Administration

**Prior Probability (\( P(H) \))**: Moderate, as business administration is common but not the most likely given Adam’s traits. Let’s assume \( 0.2 \).

**Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \))**: Low, as Adam’s traits do not align well with typical business administration interests. Assume \( 0.1 \).

**Complement Likelihood (\( P(E|\neg H) \))**: Higher given the high empathy and love for animals might suggest another field. Assume \( 0.7 \).

### Compute Posterior Probabilities

Now, let’s use Bayes' rule qualitatively to estimate \( P(H|E) \).

For simplicity, let’s denote the constant \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

However, we don't need an exact value for \( P(E) \) since we are only interested in the relative values.

Let's compute relative scores:

\[ P(AGRIC|E) \propto P(E|AGRIC)P(AGRIC) = 0.9 \times 0.2 = 0.18 \]
\[ P(CS|E) \propto P(E|CS)P(CS) = 0.2 \times 0.3 = 0.06 \]
\[ P(BUS|E) \propto P(E|BUS)P(BUS) = 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02 \]

Next, normalize these probabilities so they sum to 1:

\[ total = 0.18 + 0.06 + 0.02 = 0.26 \]

\[ P(AGRIC|E) = \frac{0.18}{0.26} \approx 0.69 \]
\[ P(CS|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.26} \approx 0.23 \]
\[ P(BUS|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.26} \approx 0.08 \]
