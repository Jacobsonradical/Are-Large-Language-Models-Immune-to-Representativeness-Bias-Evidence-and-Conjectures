Let's go through each field and determine the probabilities systematically.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   
   - **P(H):** This is the initial probability of Adam being enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science as a graduate student, without any other information. We might assume it's relatively common but not as common as other fields like business or computer science. Let's assume P(H) = 0.05.
   
   - **P(E|H):** Given that Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, this personality aligns well with a student in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Therefore, P(E|H) might be quite high. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.8.
   
   - **P(E|¬H):** This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is not enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Since his traits align well with this field specifically, we might assume it's rarer to see such a personality outside this context, so let's place it lower. Let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.1.

   Using Bayes' Rule:
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H)} \]
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.8 \times 0.05 + 0.1 \times 0.95} = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.095} = \frac{0.04}{0.135} \approx 0.296 \]

2. **Business Administration**

   - **P(H):** This might be more common than Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Let’s assume P(H) = 0.15.
   
   - **P(E|H):** Given that Adam's personality traits do not align strongly with typical traits of a Business Administration student, this probability should be relatively low. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.1.
   
   - **P(E|¬H):** This is the probability of observing Adam’s personality traits if he is not enrolled in Business Administration. Since his traits seem more aligned with fields other than Business Administration, P(E|¬H) might be higher. Let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.25.

   Using Bayes' Rule:
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H)} \]
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.15}{0.1 \times 0.15 + 0.25 \times 0.85} = \frac{0.015}{0.015 + 0.2125} = \frac{0.015}{0.2275} \approx 0.066 \]

3. **Computer Science**

   - **P(H):** This is likely one of the more common fields for graduate students. Let’s assume P(H) = 0.25.
   
   - **P(E|H):** Adam's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts fit well with a Computer Science background. However, other traits like his strong empathy and love for animals are less typical of computer science students. Let’s assume P(E|H) = 0.4.
   
   - **P(E|¬H):** Given that this personality sketch might still align somewhat with other fields, let’s assume P(E|¬H) = 0.2.

   Using Bayes' Rule:
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H)} \]
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.25}{0.4 \times 0.25 + 0.2 \times 0.75} = \frac{0.1}{0.1 + 0.15} = \frac{0.1}{0.25} = 0.4 \]

Thus, our results are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.296,
  "business administration": 0.066,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
