To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). 

Here is the process we'll follow for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - \( P(H) \) (Prior Probability): While it's hard to pinpoint an exact value without specific data, we might assume it is modest since this is a specialized field. Let's suppose \( P(H) \) in the general population of students is around 0.1.
   - \( P(E|H) \) (Likelihood if H is true): Adam's personality fits very well with this field due to his love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work. We'll assume a high value here, say 0.8.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \) (Likelihood if H is false): Given his fit for this field, the probability of having such a personality sketch in a different field might be lower, maybe around 0.2.

2. **Computer Science**
   - \( P(H) \): Computer science is a popular field, so the prior probability is high in the general population of students, maybe around 0.3.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's love for solving puzzles and high intelligence fits well with computer science, though the lack of emphasis on nature and animals makes it somewhat less likely. Let's estimate 0.5.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam having such a personality sketch while being in another field might be moderate, given his interests span multiple areas. Let's say 0.4.

3. **Business Administration**
   - \( P(H) \): Business Administration is another widely chosen field, so let's assume a prior probability around 0.2.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's personality doesn't particularly align with typical business administration traits, such as a direct interest in commerce or leadership. Let's estimate this at 0.2.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Since his traits are more aligned with fields like agricultural sciences or computer sciences, we will set this at around 0.5.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) + P(E|H_3) \cdot P(H_3) + \ldots \]

Since we're only comparing between the three fields, we'll normalize at the end.

Let's compute:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.08}{P(E)} \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.15}{P(E)} \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.04}{P(E)} \]

Normalizing so that \(P(E) = 1\):
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.15 + 0.04 = 0.27 \]

Normalizing probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{0.08}{0.27} \approx 0.296 \),
  "computer science": \( \frac{0.15}{0.27} \approx 0.556 \),
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.04}{0.27} \approx 0.148 \)
}

So the final output is:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.296,
  "computer science": 0.556,
  "business administration": 0.148
}
