To determine \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis using Bayes' Theorem, we use the formula:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Given the three fields: computer science, business administration, and agricultural and veterinary science, we need to estimate the probabilities. Let's break it down for each field.

### Computer Science
- **P(H)**: The probability that a random graduate student in 2021 enrolls in computer science (let's assume a moderately common occurrence).
- **P(E|H)**: The probability that someone in computer science has Adam's personality sketch (lower, given there's no direct alignment with nature, animals, or solving abstract concepts strictly related to puzzles).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that someone not in computer science has Adam's personality (moderate).

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: The probability of a student being in business administration (also common).
- **P(E|H)**: The probability that a business administration student matches Adam's personality (lower, as there's less natural alignment with nature and animals).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that someone outside business administration matches Adam's personality (moderate).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: The likelihood of a graduate student studying agricultural and veterinary science (less common compared to others).
- **P(E|H)**: The probability that somebody in this field matches Adam's personality (high, due to the strong correlation with nature, animals, empathy).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that someone not in this field matches Adam's personality (lower).

Now, let's provide numeric estimates and compute:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) = 0.30 \)
   - \( P(E|H) = 0.10 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.60 \)
   - Applying Bayes' Rule: \( P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.10 \times 0.30}{P(E)} = 0.03 / P(E) \)

2. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) = 0.30 \)
   - \( P(E|H) = 0.05 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.60 \)
   - Applying Bayes' Rule: \( P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.05 \times 0.30}{P(E)} = 0.015 / P(E) \)

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) = 0.10 \)
   - \( P(E|H) = 0.80 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.50 \)
   - Applying Bayes' Rule: \( P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.80 \times 0.10}{P(E)} = 0.08 / P(E) \)

We normalize these to probabilities:

- **Computer Science**:
  \[
  P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{(0.03 + 0.015 + 0.08)} \approx 0.23
  \]
- **Business Administration**:
  \[
  P(H|E) = \frac{0.015}{(0.03 + 0.015 + 0.08)} \approx 0.12
  \]
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  \[
  P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{(0.03 + 0.015 + 0.08)} \approx 0.65
  \]

Therefore, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.23,
  "business administration": 0.12,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.65
}
```
