Let's start by analyzing each field in relation to Adam's personality sketch. We will then calculate the probability of Adam being enrolled in each field based on the provided information.

**Step-by-step thoughts for each field:**

1. **Business Administration (B):**
   - P(H): The prior probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is in business administration.
     - Let's assume P(B) = 0.1 (10% of graduate students are in business administration).
   - P(E|H): The probability of Adam's personality sketch (E) given that he is in business administration.
     - Given his interest in nature, puzzles, empathy, and animals, this seems less likely for business administration. Let's assume P(E|B) = 0.05.
   - P(E|¬H): The probability of Adam's personality sketch (E) given that he is not in business administration.
     - Let's assume P(E|¬B) = 0.2 (as it's more likely that people with this kind of personality are in other fields).
  
   Applying Bayes' Theorem:
   - P(B|E) = [P(E|B) * P(B)] / P(E)
   - Assume P(E) is the same for all fields and proportional comparisons are sufficient for our purposes.

2. **Computer Science (C):**
   - P(H): The prior probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is in computer science.
     - Let's assume P(C) = 0.2 (20% of graduate students are in computer science).
   - P(E|H): The probability of Adam's personality sketch (E) given that he is in computer science.
     - He enjoys solving puzzles and is intelligent, which aligns well with computer science. Let's assume P(E|C) = 0.4.
   - P(E|¬H): The probability of Adam's personality sketch (E) given that he is not in computer science.
     - This would be the same P(E|¬C) = 0.2.
  
   Applying Bayes' Theorem:
   - P(C|E) = [P(E|C) * P(C)] / P(E)

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (A):**
   - P(H): The prior probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science.
     - Let's assume P(A) = 0.05 (5% of graduate students are in agricultural and veterinary science).
   - P(E|H): The probability of Adam's personality sketch (E) given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science.
     - Given his empathy, curiosity about nature, and love for animals, this is highly likely. Let's assume P(E|A) = 0.8.
   - P(E|¬H): The probability of Adam's personality sketch (E) given that he is not in agricultural and veterinary science.
     - This would be the same P(E|¬A) = 0.2.
  
   Applying Bayes' Theorem:
   - P(A|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / P(E)

**Bayesian calculations:**

Let's assume P(E) is the same across the board just for relative comparison purposes, and calculate each one.

For Business Administration:
- P(B|E) = (0.05 * 0.1) / P(E) = 0.005 / P(E)

For Computer Science:
- P(C|E) = (0.4 * 0.2) / P(E) = 0.08 / P(E)

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- P(A|E) = (0.8 * 0.05) / P(E) = 0.04 / P(E)

Combining these proportional values (normalizing considering P(E) is the same):

{
  "business administration": 0.005 / (0.005 + 0.08 + 0.04) = 0.037,
  "computer science": 0.08 / (0.005 + 0.08 + 0.04) = 0.593,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.04 / (0.005 + 0.08 + 0.04) = 0.370
}

Hence:

{
  "business administration": 0.037,
  "computer science": 0.593,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.370
}
