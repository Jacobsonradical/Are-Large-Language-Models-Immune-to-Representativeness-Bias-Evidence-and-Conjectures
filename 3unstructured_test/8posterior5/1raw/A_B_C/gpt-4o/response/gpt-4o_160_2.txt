To compute the posterior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each of the specified graduate fields using Bayes' Rule, I need to make reasonable assumptions about the prior probabilities and the likelihood of the given personality sketch given each hypothesis.

Let's denote:
- P(H) as the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field.
- P(E|H) as the probability of observing personality sketch E given that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.
- P(E|\neg H) as the probability of observing personality sketch E given that Adam is not enrolled in a particular field.

Let's assume:
- P(H1) = P(Adam was enrolled in business administration) is 0.25.
- P(H2) = P(Adam was enrolled in computer science) is 0.30.
- P(H3) = P(Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science) is 0.20.

Now, estimate P(E|H) and P(E|\neg H) based on the personality sketch E:

1. For **business administration**:
   - P(E|H1): Likely relatively low because Adam’s personality sketch describes strong interests in nature, animals, and abstract concepts, which are less directly related to this field. Let's assume 0.10.
   - P(E|\neg H1): Based on complementary fields, let's assume a slightly higher value, say, 0.20.

2. For **computer science**:
   - P(E|H2): Likely moderate because Adam's intelligence and abstract thinking fit the field, though the rest of his characteristics are less relevant. Let's assume 0.20.
   - P(E|\neg H2): Given that it complements other fields well, let's assume 0.15.

3. For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
   - P(E|H3): Likely very high because Adam’s love for nature, plants and animals aligns well with this field. Let's assume 0.70.
   - P(E|\neg H3): This is less likely given his specific interests, so let's assign 0.10.

Now, compute the posterior probabilities using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \text{, where } P(E)= P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

However, since exact values for P(E) may be complex to compute exactly, we can focus on relative probabilities for comparison:

For business administration:
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.10 \cdot 0.25}{0.10 \cdot 0.25 + 0.20 \cdot 0.75} \approx 0.1429 \]

For computer science:
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.20 \cdot 0.30}{0.20 \cdot 0.30 + 0.15 \cdot 0.70} \approx 0.3636 \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H3|E) = \frac{0.70 \cdot 0.20}{0.70 \cdot 0.20 + 0.10 \cdot 0.80} \approx 0.6364 \]

Now, normalizing these probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.1429,
  "computer science": 0.3636,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6364
}

Here are the relative probabilities reflecting how likely Adam might be enrolled in each given his personality sketch. Please note that exact values and probabilities will depend on more precise data.
