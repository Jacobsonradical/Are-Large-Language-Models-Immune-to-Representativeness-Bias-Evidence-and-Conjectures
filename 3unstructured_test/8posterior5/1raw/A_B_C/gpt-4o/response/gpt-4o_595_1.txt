Let's analyze the fields one by one:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS):**
   - **P(H):** This represents the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, it seems reasonable to consider this field as likely. Let's approximate P(H) as 0.3.
   - **P(E|H):** This represents the probability of observing personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in AVS. Since his interests and traits align well with this field, we'll set P(E|H) relatively high, around 0.8.
   - **P(E|¬H):** This represents the probability of observing personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in AVS. Since there are other fields that might align with Adam's interests, let's set P(E|¬H) as moderate, around 0.3.

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

We'll use the fact that \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot (1 - P(H)) \).

\[P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 + 0.3 \cdot 0.7\]

\[P(E) = 0.24 + 0.21 = 0.45\]

\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.3}{0.45} \approx 0.533\]

Hence:
\[
\text{"agricultural and veterinary science"}: 0.533
\]

2. **Business Administration (BA):**
   - **P(H):** Given Adam's traits, it seems less likely he would be enrolled in this field, so we can approximate P(H) as 0.1.
   - **P(E|H):** The probability of observing \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in BA is low since his described interests and personality traits do not align well with business administration. Let's set this as 0.2.
   - **P(E|¬H):** This might be slightly higher than zero since it's possible to have empathetic and nature-oriented individuals in BA but still relatively low compared to other fields. Let's set it to 0.35.

\[P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.35 \cdot 0.9\]

\[P(E) = 0.02 + 0.315 = 0.335\]

\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.335} \approx 0.060\]

Hence:
\[
\text{"business administration"}: 0.060
\]

3. **Computer Science (CS):**
   - **P(H):** While it's possible he is in this field, it's less likely given his interest in nature and plants. Let’s approximate P(H) as 0.2.
   - **P(E|H):** The probability of observing \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in CS might be moderate. Despite the field not aligning perfectly with all of his interests, his intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles might fit well. Let's set this as 0.5.
   - **P(E|¬H):** This might be around the average considering other fields. Let’s set it as 0.4.

\[P(E) = 0.5 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8\]

\[P(E) = 0.1 + 0.32 = 0.42\]

\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.42} \approx 0.238\]

Hence:
\[
\text{"computer science"}: 0.238\
]

Summary:
\[
\{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.533,
  "business administration": 0.060,
  "computer science": 0.238
\}
