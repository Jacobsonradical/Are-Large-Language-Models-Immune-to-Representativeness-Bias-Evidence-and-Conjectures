To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to assess \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) and then apply Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Since we are interested in relative probabilities and actual numerical values for \( P(H) \) and \( P(E) \) aren't given, we will focus on the relative likelihoods.

1. **Business Administration**:
   - **\( P(H) \) (Prior probability)**: Let's assume a relatively moderate to low prior probability, as Business Administration isnâ€™t closely related to the personality sketch provided.
   - **\( P(E|H) \) (Likelihood)**: Low, because the characteristics of strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature are not typical for Business Administration students.
   - **\( P(E|\neg H) \) (Likelihood of sketch given not enrolled)**: Could be higher, as there are many fields more related to the sketch provided than Business Administration.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - **\( P(H) \)**: Let's assume a moderate prior probability, as Computer Science is popular among graduate students but may not align perfectly with the sketch.
   - **\( P(E|H) \)**: Moderate, as the characteristics of high intelligence and being good at solving puzzles align well, but empathy and love for nature and animals are less common in this field.
   - **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The characteristics are well-suited for other fields, so this likelihood could also be higher.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **\( P(H) \)**: Let's assume a moderate to low prior probability, as fewer graduate students enroll in Agricultural and Veterinary Science compared to other fields.
   - **\( P(E|H) \)**: High, given the strong alignment of love for nature and animals, empathy, and appreciation of hard work.
   - **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Lower, since the personality sketch closely fits this field.

Based on these qualitative assessments, we can now apply Bayes' Rule qualitatively:

\[
\begin{aligned}
  P(H|E)_{\text{business admin}} &\approx \frac{\text{Low likelihood} \times \text{Moderate to Low prior}}{\text{Combined probability terms}} \\
  P(H|E)_{\text{computer science}} &\approx \frac{\text{Moderate likelihood} \times \text{Moderate prior}}{\text{Combined probability terms}} \\
  P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} &\approx \frac{\text{High likelihood} \times \text{Moderate to Low prior}}{\text{Combined probability terms}}
\end{aligned}
\]

Given this, we can infer the relative probabilities for \( P(H|E) \):

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
``` 

These values show the relative confidence in Adam's enrollment based on the personality sketch, with the highest confidence in Agricultural and Veterinary Science aligning most closely with the described traits, followed by Computer Science and lastly Business Administration.
