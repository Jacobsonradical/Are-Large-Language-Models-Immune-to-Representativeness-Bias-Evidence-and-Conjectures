In order to use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis \( H \) (i.e., each field of study), we need the following probabilities: \( P(H) \) (the prior probability of enrolling in that field), \( P(E|H) \) (the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is in that field), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) (the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not in that field).

To make these estimates, let's first consider the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field:

1. Agricultural and veterinary science is relatively specialized but aligns with Adam's love for nature and animals, so let's set \( P(H) = 0.10 \).
2. Computer science is a broad and popular field, so we'll give this a higher prior probability, \( P(H) = 0.20 \).
3. Business administration is also a broad field but seems less aligned with Adam's personality traits, so we'll set \( P(H) = 0.15 \).

Next, we estimate \( P(E|H) \) for each field:

1. For agricultural and veterinary science, the personality sketch fits very well, so let's set \( P(E|H) = 0.70 \).
2. For computer science, the interest in solving puzzles fits well, but the empathy and nature might be less directly relevant, so let's set \( P(E|H) = 0.50 \).
3. For business administration, the traits described seem less aligned, so we set \( P(E|H) = 0.20 \).

Finally, we estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \). This is a bit more complex, but let's make rough estimates for the sake of this calculation:

1. For \( P(E|\neg H) \) corresponding to agricultural and veterinary science, let’s say 0.30.
2. For \( P(E|\neg H) \) corresponding to computer science, let’s say 0.40.
3. For \( P(E|\neg H) \) corresponding to business administration, let’s say 0.60.

Now, we can apply Bayes' rule for each field:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \), we have:

1. For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(E) = (0.70 \cdot 0.10) + (0.30 \cdot 0.90) = 0.07 + 0.27 = 0.34 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.70 \cdot 0.10}{0.34} \approx 0.206 \]

2. For computer science:
\[ P(E) = (0.50 \cdot 0.20) + (0.40 \cdot 0.80) = 0.10 + 0.32 = 0.42 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.50 \cdot 0.20}{0.42} \approx 0.238 \]

3. For business administration:
\[ P(E) = (0.20 \cdot 0.15) + (0.60 \cdot 0.85) = 0.03 + 0.51 = 0.54 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.20 \cdot 0.15}{0.54} \approx 0.056 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.206,
  "computer science": 0.238,
  "business administration": 0.056
