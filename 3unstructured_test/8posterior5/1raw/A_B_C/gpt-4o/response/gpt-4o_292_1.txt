Let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Prior Probability \( \text{P}(H) \):** This is the initial probability we assign to the hypothesis, before observing the evidence \( E \).

2. **Likelihood \( \text{P}(E|H) \):** This is the probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that the hypothesis \( H \) is true.

3. **Likelihood of Not \( H \) \( \text{P}(E|\neg H) \):** This is the probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that the hypothesis \( H \) is not true.

4. **Posterior Probability \( \text{P}(H|E) \):** This is the probability of the hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \), calculated using Bayes' rule.

Bayes' rule states:
\[
\text{P}(H|E) = \frac{\text{P}(E|H) \cdot \text{P}(H)}{\text{P}(E)}
\]

Where:
\[
\text{P}(E) = \text{P}(E|H) \cdot \text{P}(H) + \text{P}(E|\neg H) \cdot \text{P}(\neg H)
\]

Given that there are many fields of study, we can't definitively say what the priors are, but we can make educated estimates. Here are the estimates and calculations for each field:

### Business Administration

- **P(H):** Business administration is a relatively common field of study for graduate students, so let's assume a moderate prior probability, say \(0.2\).
- **P(E|H):** The traits described (curiosity about nature, love for animals, etc.) do not strongly align with business administration, so let's assign a low probability, say \(0.1\).
- **P(E|\neg H):** Given that this evidence is more likely in other fields (like agricultural sciences or veterinary sciences), let's again assign this a somewhat low probability, say \(0.3\).

\[
\text{P}(H|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.02}{0.26} \approx 0.0769
\]

### Computer Science

- **P(H):** Computer science is a very common field, so let's assume a higher prior probability, say \(0.3\).
- **P(E|H):** The traits described (solving puzzles and high intelligence) align somewhat with computer science, say \(0.3\).
- **P(E|\neg H):** Similarly, these traits are not specific to computer science and could apply to many other fields, let's say \(0.4\).

\[
\text{P}(H|E) \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.3}{0.3 \cdot 0.3 + 0.4 \cdot 0.7} = \frac{0.09}{0.37} \approx 0.2432
\]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H):** This field is less common but aligns strongly with the described personality traits. Let's assume a moderate prior probability, say \(0.2\).
- **P(E|H):** The traits described align very strongly with agriculture and veterinary science, say \(0.7\).
- **P(E|\neg H):** As the traits are more specific to this field, the probability is lower, say \(0.2\).

\[
\text{P}(H|E) \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.7 \cdot 0.2 + 0.2 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.14}{0.3} \approx 0.4667
\]

Now putting these together in the required format:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0769,
  "computer science": 0.2432,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4667
}
```

These calculations are based on reasonable assumptions and can be adjusted if more precise data regarding the priors or likelihoods is available.
