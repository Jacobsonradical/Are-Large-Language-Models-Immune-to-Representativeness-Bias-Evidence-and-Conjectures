Sure, let's walk through the Bayesian calculations for each field. Recall that Bayes' rule can be expressed as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that \( P(E) \) (the overall probability of the evidence) is the same for all fields (since E is constant), we only need to compare the numerators across the fields.

Let's define and estimate the components for each field based on the information provided:

1. **Business Administration:**
   - \(P(H_{BA})\): The prior probability that Adam is studying business administration.
   - \(P(E|H_{BA})\): The probability of Adam having the personality traits described if he is in business administration.
   - \(P(E|\neg H_{BA})\): The probability of Adam having the personality traits described if he is not in business administration.

Given E, Adam's traits seem less aligned with a business administration field. It's less likely for someone deeply interested in nature, animals, and abstract concepts to pursue business administration.

\[ P(H_{BA}) = 0.2 \]
\[ P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.1 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.2 \]

The exact values are hypothetical but should reflect the idea that business administration is less likely.

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \(P(H_{AVS})\): The prior probability that Adam is studying agricultural and veterinary science.
   - \(P(E|H_{AVS})\): The probability of Adam having the personality traits described if he is in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - \(P(E|\neg H_{AVS})\): The probability of Adam having the personality traits described if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science.

Given Adam’s strong love for nature, animals, and empathy, agricultural and veterinary science seems highly plausible.

\[ P(H_{AVS}) = 0.3 \]
\[ P(E|H_{AVS}) = 0.8 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) = 0.4 \]

Higher probabilities for this field due to trait alignment.

\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \]

3. **Computer Science:**
   - \(P(H_{CS})\): The prior probability that Adam is studying computer science.
   - \(P(E|H_{CS})\): The probability of Adam having the personality traits described if he is in computer science.
   - \(P(E|\neg H_{CS})\): The probability of Adam having the personality traits described if he is not in computer science.

Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and high intelligence points toward some suitability for computer science.

\[ P(H_{CS}) = 0.2 \]
\[ P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.4 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.3 \]

Intermediate probabilities due to partial alignment of traits.

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

Normalizing across these to compare:

1. Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.02}{P(E)} \]

2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.24}{P(E)} \]

3. Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.08}{P(E)} \]

Given \( P(E) \) is constant and only used for normalization, these result in the following relative probabilities:

{
  "business administration": "0.02",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.24",
  "computer science": "0.08"
}

These values are indicative and would need normalization by dividing each by the sum of the probabilities (0.02 + 0.24 + 0.08 = 0.34) for actual likelihoods:

{
  "business administration": "0.02/0.34 ≈ 0.06",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.24/0.34 ≈ 0.71",
  "computer science": "0.08/0.34 ≈ 0.24"
}

Upon normalization:

{
  "business administration": "0.06",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.71",
  "computer science": "0.24"
}
