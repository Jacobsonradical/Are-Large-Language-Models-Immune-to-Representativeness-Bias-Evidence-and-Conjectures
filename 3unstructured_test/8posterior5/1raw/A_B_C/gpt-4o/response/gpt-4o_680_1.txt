To apply Bayes' Theorem, we need to consider the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam exhibits the traits and background described in \( E \) given that he was enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that Adam exhibits the traits and background described in \( E \) given that he was not enrolled in that field.
4. \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given the personality sketch \( E \).

Let's break this down for each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that a random student is enrolled in this field. Generally, let's assume a moderately low number due to the specialized nature of this field (e.g., 5% or 0.05).
- **P(E|H)**: Given the description, Adam seems highly compatible with this field due to his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. Let's assign a high probability (e.g., 0.8).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that someone not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science exhibits Adam's traits might be reasonably low because the traits align well with this field (e.g., 0.2).

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that a random student is enrolled in Business Administration. This field is quite popular, so let's assume a higher number (e.g., 20% or 0.20).
- **P(E|H)**: The personality traits described do not strongly align with Business Administration. Adam's traits are more oriented towards natural sciences than business. Assign a low probability (e.g., 0.1).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood that someone not in Business Administration exhibits these traits might be higher than in agricultural sciences, considering the non-specific nature of the traits (e.g., 0.4).

### Computer Science
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that a random student is enrolled in Computer Science. This field is also quite popular, so let's assume a moderate number (e.g., 15% or 0.15).
- **P(E|H)**: Adam's love for problem-solving aligns well with Computer Science, though the nature-related interests are not as strong a match. A moderate probability (e.g., 0.6).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Given that the traits are not highly specific to Computer Science but not completely irrelevant, the probability might be moderate (e.g., 0.5).

Now, apply Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

For simplicity, assume each trait occurs independently.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{(0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95)} = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.19} = \frac{0.04}{0.23} \approx 0.174 \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.20}{(0.1 \cdot 0.20) + (0.4 \cdot 0.80)} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.32} = \frac{0.02}{0.34} \approx 0.059 \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.15}{(0.6 \cdot 0.15) + (0.5 \cdot 0.85)} = \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.425} = \frac{0.09}{0.515} \approx 0.175 \]

Based on these calculations, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.174,
  "business administration": 0.059,
  "computer science": 0.175
}
