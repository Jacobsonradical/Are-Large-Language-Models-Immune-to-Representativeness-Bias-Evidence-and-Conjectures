Let's start by estimating the probabilities. We're interested in the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H) \). Then, we'll use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \).

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - **P(H)**: The probability of Adam being enrolled in this field might be relatively low due to the specific nature of this field.
   - **P(E|H)**: Given his personality sketch, it seems highly likely that Adam would be in this field because of his love for nature and animals.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: Even if Adam is not in this field, his personality traits are generally favorable for several other fields, so this likelihood is moderate.

2. **Computer Science**
   - **P(H)**: This field is quite popular, and many students enroll in it, so the base probability might be moderate.
   - **P(E|H)**: While Adam's intelligence and problem-solving skills fit well, his love for nature and animals doesn't directly align with this field.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: Adam's traits being associated with another field is fairly high because of the breadth of his interests and skills.

3. **Business Administration**
   - **P(H)**: Many students also select this field, so the base probability is moderate.
   - **P(E|H)**: His personality sketch doesn't align strongly with business administration; his empathy and love for animals don't map well here.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of these traits fitting better elsewhere is high.

Let's denote P(E) as the total probability of evidence E. Although we won't calculate it explicitly here, it will be cancelled out in Bayes' rule.

Bayes' rule: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Estimations:
1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
   - \( P(H)_{\text{AV}} \) might be around 0.1
   - \( P(E|H)_{\text{AV}} \) might be around 0.8
   - \( P(E|\neg H)_{\text{AV}} \) might be around 0.3

2. Computer Science:
   - \( P(H)_{\text{CS}} \) might be around 0.25
   - \( P(E|H)_{\text{CS}} \) might be around 0.5
   - \( P(E|\neg H)_{\text{CS}} \) might be around 0.4

3. Business Administration:
   - \( P(H)_{\text{BA}} \) might be around 0.25
   - \( P(E|H)_{\text{BA}} \) might be around 0.2
   - \( P(E|\neg H)_{\text{BA}} \) might be around 0.4

Now, applying Bayes' rule:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[
   P(H|E)_{\text{AV}} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{P(E)}
   \]

2. **Computer Science**:
   \[
   P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} = \frac{0.5 \times 0.25}{P(E)}
   \]

3. **Business Administration**:
   \[
   P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} = \frac{0.2 \times 0.25}{P(E)}
   \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for all, it's essentially a normalization factor to ensure our probabilities are relative.

Final estimations:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8 * 0.1 = 0.08,
  "computer science": 0.5 * 0.25 = 0.125,
  "business administration": 0.2 * 0.25 = 0.05
}
```
