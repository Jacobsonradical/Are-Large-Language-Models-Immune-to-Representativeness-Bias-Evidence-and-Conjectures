Let's break down the problem using Bayes' Theorem, which is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that \(E\) is the personality sketch of Adam, we need to determine the probabilities related to each field of study.

1. **business administration**
2. **computer science**
3. **agricultural and veterinary science**

Let's assign some hypothetical values based on general assumptions:

1. P(H): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in each field.
   - Business Administration: 0.20 (as many students pursue this)
   - Computer Science: 0.30 (also quite common)
   - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.10 (less common than the other two but still significant)

2. P(E|H): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in each field.
   - Business Administration: 0.05 (less likely given his love for nature and animals)
   - Computer Science: 0.10 (likely due to his intelligence and puzzle-solving skills)
   - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.80 (very likely given his interests in nature, plants, and animals)

3. P(E|\neg H): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is *not* enrolled in each field (essentially the complement probabilities).

Now, we need to calculate \(P(E)\), the overall probability of the evidence. This can be approximated by summing over all possible hypotheses:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|H_{AV}) \cdot P(H_{AV}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.05 \cdot 0.20) + (0.10 \cdot 0.30) + (0.80 \cdot 0.10) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.01 + 0.03 + 0.08 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 \]

Now, let's apply Bayes' Theorem to each hypothesis:

1. **Business Administration:**
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.20}{0.12} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.12} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) ≈ 0.083 \]

2. **Computer Science:**
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.10 \cdot 0.30}{0.12} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.12} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) ≈ 0.25 \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(H_{AV}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AV}) \cdot P(H_{AV})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{AV}|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.10}{0.12} \]
\[ P(H_{AV}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.12} \]
\[ P(H_{AV}|E) ≈ 0.667 \]

Putting it all together:
