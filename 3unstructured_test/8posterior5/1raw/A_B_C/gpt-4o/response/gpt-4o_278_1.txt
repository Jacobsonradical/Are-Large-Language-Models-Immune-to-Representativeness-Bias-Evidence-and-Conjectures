Let's use Bayes' rule to find the probabilities \( P(H|E) \), the probabilities that Adam is enrolled in each field given his personality sketch \(E\).

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to make some assumptions about the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihoods \( P(E|\neg H) \). Note that \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant and can be computed as \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Here are the steps based on the provided information and general assumptions about the fields:

### Assumptions:
1. **Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)**:
    - \( P(\text{computer science}) \approx 0.25 \): Assume computer science is quite popular.
    - \( P(\text{business administration}) \approx 0.3 \): Assume business administration is also popular.
    - \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.1 \): This field is less common than the above two.

2. **Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \)**:
    - \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \approx 0.1 \): Curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy might not be very common in computer science.
    - \( P(E|\text{business administration}) \approx 0.05 \): The given traits appear less aligned with business administration.
    - \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.7 \): These traits align very well with agricultural and veterinary science.

3. **Likelihoods \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
    - \( P(E|\neg \text{computer science}) \approx 0.2 \)
    - \( P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) \approx 0.3 \)
    - \( P(E|\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.2 \)

Now we can compute \( P(H|E) \):

### Calculation:
For **computer science**:
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{(0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.05 \cdot 0.3 + 0.7 \cdot 0.1)} \approx \frac{0.025}{0.095} \approx 0.263 \]

For **business administration**:
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.3}{0.095} \approx \frac{0.015}{0.095} \approx 0.158 \]

For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.095} \approx \frac{0.07}{0.095} \approx 0.737 \]

### Results:
