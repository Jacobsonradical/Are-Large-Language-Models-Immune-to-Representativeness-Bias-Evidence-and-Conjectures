Sure, let's make some educated guesses and do the Bayesian calculation for each field of specialization:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1)**
   - \(P(H1)\): Let's assume a base rate of 0.05 for the general likelihood of a graduate student being in this field.
   - \(P(E|H1)\): Given Adam’s traits (curiosity about nature, plants, love for animals), it is highly likely he would be in this field. Let's assume this to be 0.8.
   - \(P(E|\neg H1)\): The probability of having Adam’s traits given he is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given these traits, they might be more likely in other fields related to nature or animals but not entirely absent in other areas, let's assume 0.2.
   - Now, using Bayes' rule:
     \[
     P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1)}{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1) + P(E|\neg H1) \cdot P(\neg H1)} 
     = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.95} 
     = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.19} 
     = \frac{0.04}{0.23} 
     ≈ 0.174
     \]

2. **Computer Science (H2)**
   - \(P(H2)\): Let's assume a base rate of 0.3 for the general likelihood of a graduate student being in this field.
   - \(P(E|H2)\): Given Adam’s traits (intelligence, good at solving puzzles, understanding abstract concepts), this is moderately likely, say 0.4.
   - \(P(E|\neg H2)\): The probability of having Adam’s traits given he is not in Computer Science. As these traits might be common in several fields, let's assume 0.3.
   - Using Bayes' rule:
     \[
     P(H2|E) = \frac{P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2)}{P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2) + P(E|\neg H2) \cdot P(\neg H2)} 
     = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{0.4 \cdot 0.3 + 0.3 \cdot 0.7} 
     = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.21} 
     = \frac{0.12}{0.33} 
     ≈ 0.364
     \]

3. **Business Administration (H3)**
   - \(P(H3)\): Let's assume a base rate of 0.2 for the general likelihood of a graduate student being in this field.
   - \(P(E|H3)\): Given Adam’s traits, this is less likely, say 0.1.
   - \(P(E|\neg H3)\): The probability of having Adam’s traits given he is not in Business Administration. Traits like empathy and understanding dedication could be present in this field but are not exclusive, let's assume 0.5.
   - Using Bayes' rule:
     \[
     P(H3|E) = \frac{P(E|H3) \cdot P(H3)}{P(E|H3) \cdot P(H3) + P(E|\neg H3) \cdot P(\neg H3)} 
     = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.8} 
     = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.4} 
     = \frac{0.02}{0.42} 
     ≈ 0.048
     \]

Putting it all together:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.174,
  "computer science": 0.364,
  "business administration": 0.048
}
```
