To solve this problem using Bayes' rule, we will generally use the form:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability of the hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence \( E \).

Given:
- \( P(E) \) is not explicitly given but is the same for all hypotheses we consider, and thus can be ignored for relative comparisons.
- You need to estimate:
  - \( P(H) \): The prior probability Adam would be enrolled in that field.
  - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is in that field.
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is NOT in that field.

Given this explanation, here's the evaluation for each field:

### 1. Business Administration

- **\( P(H) \)**: Let’s assume a relatively common field but not specifically aligned with Adam's traits.
  \[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.2 \]

- **\( P(E|H) \)**: A business administration student might have some empathy and understanding of hard work, but curiosity about nature, love for animals, and high interest in abstract puzzles are less typical.
  \[ P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.1 \]

- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Assuming this is a very diverse group with various interests.
  \[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.5 \]

Using Bayes’ rule:

\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) \propto 0.02 \]

### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **\( P(H) \)**: Fits well with Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals. Assuming less common than business administration but this prior.
  \[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.05 \]

- **\( P(E|H) \)**: Very high, given alignment with love for animals, nature etc.
  \[ P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.9 \]

- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Assuming traits not as common elsewhere.
  \[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.4 \]

Using Bayes’ rule:

\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) \propto 0.045 \]

### 3. Computer Science

- **\( P(H) \)**: Fairly common field with abstract, puzzle-solving.
  \[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.25 \]

- **\( P(E|H) \)**: High intelligence, puzzle solving. Not highly correlated with other factors (strong empathy).
  \[ P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.3 \]

- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Diverse interests assumed.
  \[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.5 \]

Using Bayes’ rule:

\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.25}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) \propto 0.075 \]

Putting these normalized values into a comprehensible format:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.04,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.09,
  "computer science": 0.15
}
```

Remember, these aren't absolute but relative probabilities relative to each other and given the assumptions.
