To determine P(H|E) for each of the fields, we use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam having the personality E given that he is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of Adam having his personality sketch E.

Since P(E) is constant for each field and we are comparing relative probabilities, we can focus on calculating the product \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \). We will make reasonable assumptions about \( P(E|H) \) based on the information given in E and general field characteristics.

**Assumptions**:
- For students enrolling in Business Administration (\( H \)), let's assume \( P(H) = 0.3 \). The likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is relatively low since the personality sketch matches less typically with business students. Thus, let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science (\( H \)), let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \). This field aligns well with Adam's personality traits of empathy, love for animals, and nature curiosity. Hence, let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
- For Computer Science (\( H \)), let's assume \( P(H) = 0.5 \). Adam’s high intelligence and abstract concept understanding fits well with this field, but it doesn’t directly connect with his empathy and nature interests. Thus, let's set \( P(E|H) = 0.5 \).

Calculations:
- For Business Administration:
  \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.3 = 0.03 \]

- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
  \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.2 = 0.16 \]

- For Computer Science:
  \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.5 \cdot 0.5 = 0.25 \]

Normalization to make the probabilities comparable requires summing these and then dividing each by the sum:
\[ \text{Sum} = 0.03 + 0.16 + 0.25 = 0.44 \]

Normalized probabilities:
- Business Administration:
  \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.44} \approx 0.068 \]

- Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
  \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.16}{0.44} \approx 0.364 \]

- Computer Science:
  \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.25}{0.44} \approx 0.568 \]

Therefore, the final probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": 0.068,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.364,
  "computer science": 0.568
