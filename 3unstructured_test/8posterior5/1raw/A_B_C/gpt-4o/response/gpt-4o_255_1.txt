Let's consider the given personality sketch of Adam and apply Bayes' theorem to compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis \( H \). We start by estimating the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) given the hypothesis, and the likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \) given not the hypothesis.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1)**:
   - **P(H1)**: This field is relevant to Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, so let's assume a somewhat higher prior probability. Given the number of fields, let's estimate it around 0.15.
   - **P(E|H1)**: Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and warm heart fit very well with this field, suggesting a high likelihood. Let's estimate it at 0.9.
   - **P(E|\neg H1)**: For many other fields, such traits may not be as common, although some fit with broader scientific fields or personal empathy. Let's guess a moderate 0.4.

2. **Business Administration (H2)**:
   - **P(H2)**: This field seems less likely given Adam's traits that focus more on empathy, animals, nature, and puzzles. Let's estimate a lower prior of 0.05.
   - **P(E|H2)**: The sketch doesn't strongly align with business interests; we might assume a low likelihood here, around 0.2.
   - **P(E|\neg H2)**: Since excluding business includes a wide range of fields that might fit Adam's personality sketch to varying extents, let's estimate this at 0.45.

3. **Computer Science (H3)**:
   - **P(H3)**: Given Adam's intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles, computer science is plausible. Let's estimate a moderate prior probability, say 0.1.
   - **P(E|H3)**: While computer science aligns with problem-solving and intelligence, it doesnâ€™t strongly connect with nature, empathy, and animals. Let's guess 0.5.
   - **P(E|\neg H3)**: This, similar to previous cases, covers a broad range of fields, so we estimate a moderate likelihood of 0.5.

Bayes' rule is: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Let's calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1)**:
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.15}{(0.9 \cdot 0.15) + (0.4 \cdot 0.85)} = \frac{0.135}{0.135 + 0.34} = \frac{0.135}{0.475} \approx 0.284 \]

2. **Business Administration (H2)**:
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.05}{(0.2 \cdot 0.05) + (0.45 \cdot 0.95)} = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.4275} = \frac{0.01}{0.4375} \approx 0.023 \]

3. **Computer Science (H3)**:
\[ P(H3|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.1}{(0.5 \cdot 0.1) + (0.5 \cdot 0.9)} = \frac{0.05}{0.05 + 0.45} = \frac{0.05}{0.5} = 0.1 \]

Here are the results:
