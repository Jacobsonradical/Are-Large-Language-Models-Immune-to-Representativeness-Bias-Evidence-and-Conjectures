To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in each of these fields given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes’ theorem, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of being enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given enrollment in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the personality sketch, which can be computed as:
  \[ P(E) = P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) + P(E|H_3) \cdot P(H_3) + \ldots \]

Below is the breakdown and estimation for each field:

### Computer Science
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of a graduate student enrolling in computer science can be considered moderate given it is a common field, let’s say \( P(H) = 0.3 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam’s personality sketch given computer science is low to moderate; while intelligence and puzzle-solving are relevant, his strong empathy and love for nature aren't typical. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): This is the likelihood of the personality sketch given he's **not** in computer science. Given the various other fields, let’s estimate it to be \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.35 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability for agricultural and veterinary science might be lower than computer science; let’s say \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch here is quite high since his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy fit well. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): This is the likelihood of the personality sketch given he's **not** in agricultural and veterinary science. Given the match in some other fields, let's estimate it to be \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of enrolling in business administration may also be moderate given its popularity, let’s say \( P(H) = 0.25 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam’s personality sketch fitting business administration is quite low, as the traits of empathy and love for nature are not typically associated with business administration. Let’s assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): This is the likelihood of the personality sketch given he’s **not** in business administration. Let’s estimate it to be \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.36 \).

### Calculations
For simplicity, assume \( P(E) \) is the same across all these fields for normalization purposes and is less critical here since we are comparing relative probabilities.

Using the estimated values:
#### Computer Science
\[ \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \]

#### Business Administration
\[ \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{P(E)} \]

To compare them:
{
  "computer science": \(\frac{0.06}{P(E)}\),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \(\frac{0.105}{P(E)}\),
  "business administration": \(\frac{0.025}{P(E)}\)
}

Thus, based on relative probabilities:
{
  "computer science": 0.06,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.105,
  "business administration": 0.025
}

These values represent the relative likelihood of Adam being in each field, given his personality sketch. Agricultural and veterinary science is the most likely field, followed by computer science, and least likely is business administration.
