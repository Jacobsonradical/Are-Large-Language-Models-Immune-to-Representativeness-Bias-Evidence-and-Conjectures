To start with, let’s assign some subjective probabilities to each field based on the personality sketch of Adam.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H₁)**
2. **Business Administration (H₂)**
3. **Computer Science (H₃)**

### Step 1: Assign Initial Probabilities (P(H))
- \( P(H₁) \): Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given Adam's love for animals, nature, and plants, it seems relatively likely.
- \( P(H₂) \): Business Administration. This choice seems less likely given Adam's personality, but not impossible.
- \( P(H₃) \): Computer Science. Given Adam's intelligence and enjoyment in solving puzzles, this seems reasonably likely.

For example’s sake:
- \( P(H₁) \) = 0.4
- \( P(H₂) \) = 0.1
- \( P(H₃) \) = 0.3

### Step 2: Assign Likelihoods (P(E|H))
- \( P(E|H₁) \): Given Adam's traits, it is highly likely he would fit this field.
- \( P(E|H₂) \): It is less likely, considering business administration doesn’t align strongly with his love for animals and nature.
- \( P(E|H₃) \): This is also quite likely, especially because of his intelligence and interest in puzzles.

For example’s sake:
- \( P(E|H₁) = 0.9 \)
- \( P(E|H₂) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|H₃) = 0.7 \)

### Step 3: Assign Prior Not-Hypothesis Probabilities (P(E|¬H))
For each \( P(E|\neg H) \), it's the probability of E given that the hypothesis is not true.

- \( P(E|\neg H₁) = \) The probability of having Adam’s traits if he is not in Agricultural/Veterinary
- \( P(E|\neg H₂) = \) The probability of having Adam’s traits if he is not in Business Administration
- \( P(E|\neg H₃) = \) The probability of having Adam’s traits if he is not in Computer Science

Given his traits:
- \( P(E|\neg H₁) \approx 0.4 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H₂) \approx 0.7 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H₃) \approx 0.5 \)

### Step 4: Bayesian Update (Compute P(H|E))

Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = \sum_{i} P(E|H_{i}) \cdot P(H_{i}) \approx P(E|H₁)P(H₁) + P(E|H₂)P(H₂) + P(E|H₃)P(H₃) \)

\[ P(E) = (0.9 \times 0.4) + (0.2 \times 0.1) + (0.7 \times 0.3) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.36 + 0.02 + 0.21 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.59 \]

Now, for each hypothesis:

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H₁)
\[ P(H₁|E) = \frac{P(E|H₁) \cdot P(H₁)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H₁|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.4}{0.59} \]
\[ P(H₁|E) = \frac{0.36}{0.59} \]
\[ P(H₁|E) = 0.61 \]

#### Business Administration (H₂)
\[ P(H₂|E) = \frac{P(E|H₂) \cdot P(H₂)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H₂|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{0.59} \]
\[ P(H₂|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.59} \]
\[ P(H₂|E) = 0.034 \]

#### Computer Science (H₃)
\[ P(H₃|E) = \frac{P(E|H₃) \cdot P(H₃)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H₃|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.3}{0.59} \]
\[ P(H₃|E) = \frac{0.21}{0.59} \]
\[ P(H₃|E) = 0.36 \]

### Summary:
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( P(H₁|E) = 0.61 \)
- Business Administration: \( P(H₂|E) = 0.034 \)
- Computer Science: \( P(H₃|E) = 0.36 \)
