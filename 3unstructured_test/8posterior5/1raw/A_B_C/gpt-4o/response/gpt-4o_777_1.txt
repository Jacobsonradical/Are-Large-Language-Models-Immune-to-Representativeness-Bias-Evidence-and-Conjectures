To calculate \(\text{P(H|E)}\) (the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given the personality sketch), we need to use Bayes' rule:

\[ \text{P(H|E)} = \frac{\text{P(E|H)} \cdot \text{P(H)}}{\text{P(E)}} \]

Given the information, we have to subjectively estimate the probabilities:

1. \(\text{P(H)}\): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
2. \(\text{P(E|H)}\): The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
3. \(\text{P(E|\neg H)}\): The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.

Let's denote:
- \(\text{H}_1\): Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \(\text{H}_2\): Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \(\text{H}_3\): Adam was enrolled in computer science.

Since we don't have exact numbers, let's estimate based on the description.

### Estimates
- \(\text{P(H_1)}\): Given the large number of fields, let's assume there is an equal probability across fields. For simplicity, we'll estimate \(\text{P(H_1)}\) at 1/20 = 0.05.
- \(\text{P(H_2)}\) and \(\text{P(H_3)}\): Same as above, both are 0.05.

- \(\text{P(E|H_1)}\): Likelihood that a business administration student has Adam's profile.
  - Curiosity about nature and plants: Low relevance.
  - Enjoys solving puzzles: Moderate relevance in business contexts.
  - Empathy, warm heart: Can be useful in business.
  - High intelligence: Relevant.
  Estimate: 0.2

- \(\text{P(E|H_2)}\): Likelihood that an agricultural and veterinary science student has Adam's profile.
  - Curiosity about nature and plants: High relevance.
  - Enjoys solving puzzles: Can be relevant.
  - Empathy, warm heart: High relevance for working with animals.
  - High intelligence: Relevant.
  Estimate: 0.8

- \(\text{P(E|H_3)}\): Likelihood that a computer science student has Adam's profile.
  - Curiosity about nature and plants: Low relevance.
  - Enjoys solving puzzles: High relevance.
  - Empathy, warm heart: Lesser relevance.
  - High intelligence: Highly relevant.
  Estimate: 0.5

- \(\text{P(E|\neg H)}\): An average likelihood that any student not in the specified fields has Adam's profile. Since this is a mix of all other fields, we will estimate this to be moderate. 
  Estimate: 0.2

#### Calculation

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ \text{P(H_1|E)} = \frac{\text{P(E|H_1)} \cdot \text{P(H_1)}}{\text{P(E)}} \]
\[ \text{P(H_2|E)} = \frac{\text{P(E|H_2)} \cdot \text{P(H_2)}}{\text{P(E)}} \]
\[ \text{P(H_3|E)} = \frac{\text{P(E|H_3)} \cdot \text{P(H_3)}}{\text{P(E)}} \]

For normalization and simplicity, let's consider:
\[ \text{P(E)} \approx \text{P(E|H_1)} \cdot \text{P(H_1)} + \text{P(E|H_2)} \cdot \text{P(H_2)} + \text{P(E|H_3)} \cdot \text{P(H_3)} + \text{P(E|\neg H)} \cdot \text{P(\neg H)} \]

Assuming \(\text{P(\neg H)}\) is the rest probability mass, i.e., 1 - 3*0.05 = 0.85, and estimate:

\[ \text{P(E)} \approx 0.2 \cdot 0.05 + 0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.5 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 = 0.01 + 0.04 + 0.025 + 0.17 = 0.245 \]

Finally, we can plug in values:

{
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.05}{0.245} \approx 0.041 \),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.245} \approx 0.163 \),
  "computer science": \( \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.05}{0.245} \approx 0.102 \)
}
