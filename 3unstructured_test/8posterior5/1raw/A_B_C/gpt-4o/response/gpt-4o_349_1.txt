Sure, let's break down the probabilities step by step for each field.

### Business Administration:
1. \( P(H) \): Probability that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration.
   - This field is fairly common, let's assume it is \(0.20\).

2. \( P(E|H) \): Probability of having Adam's characteristics given he is in Business Administration.
   - Business students might not commonly have a strong love for nature or animals, so this might be quite low. Let's estimate it at \(0.05\).

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of having Adam's characteristics given he is **not** in Business Administration.
   - Considering all other grads, those with Adam's characteristics could still be common in fields like agricultural sciences or biology. Let's assume \(0.15\).

Now using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \),
\[ P(E) = (0.05 \cdot 0.20) + (0.15 \cdot 0.80) = 0.01 + 0.12 = 0.13 \]

Thus,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.20}{0.13} = 0.0769 \]

### Computer Science:
1. \( P(H) \): Probability that Adam is enrolled in Computer Science.
   - Fairly common, assume it is \(0.25\).

2. \( P(E|H) \): Probability of having Adam's characteristics given he is in Computer Science.
   - Not highly probable, but there are some who love solving puzzles. Let's estimate it at \(0.10\).

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of having Adam's characteristics given he is **not** in Computer Science.
   - Likely still around \(0.15\).

Now using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(E) = (0.10 \cdot 0.25) + (0.15 \cdot 0.75) = 0.025 + 0.1125 = 0.1375 \]

Thus,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.10 \cdot 0.25}{0.1375} = 0.1818 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
1. \( P(H) \): Probability that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
   - Less common but fitting well with Adam's characteristics, assume \(0.10\).

2. \( P(E|H) \): Probability of having Adam's characteristics given he is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
   - Very high, let's estimate it at \(0.80\).

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of having Adam's characteristics given he is **not** in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
   - Again, let's assume \(0.15\).

Now using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.10) + (0.15 \cdot 0.90) = 0.08 + 0.135 = 0.215 \]

Thus,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.10}{0.215} = 0.3721 \]

Here is the summary:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0769,
  "computer science": 0.1818,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3721
}
```
These probabilities indicate that given Adam's personality traits, he is more likely to be enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science than in Business Administration or Computer Science.
