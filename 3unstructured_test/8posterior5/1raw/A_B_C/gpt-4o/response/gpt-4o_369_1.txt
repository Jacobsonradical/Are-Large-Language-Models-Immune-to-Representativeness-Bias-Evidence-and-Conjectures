To estimate the probabilities of Adam being enrolled in the given fields based on his personality sketch E, we need to evaluate the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihoods \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field, and then apply Bayes' rule to calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \).

### Prior Probabilities (\( P(H) \))

This reflects the initial guess without any additional information:
- **business administration**: Generally, fewer students enroll in business administration compared to the other fields.
- **computer science**: High enrollment rates in the current academic climate.
- **agricultural and veterinary science**: Less common but could be relevant considering Adam's nature interests.

We might set these priors as follows (though these are subjective estimates):
- \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.4 \)
- \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.2 \)

### Likelihoods (\( P(E|H) \))

This reflects how likely Adam's personality sketch is given the field.

- **business administration**: Moderate fit given the empathy and understanding, but other traits don't align strongly.
  - \( P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.2 \)

- **computer science**: Good fit for high intelligence and puzzle solving, but less clear relevance to empathy and love for nature/animals.
  - \( P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.3 \)

- **agricultural and veterinary science**: Strong fit given the interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy.
  - \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.7 \)

### Likelihoods (\( P(E|\neg H) \))

This reflects how likely Adam's personality sketch is given he is not in the specified field. For simplicity, letâ€™s average the likelihoods of the other fields:

- \( P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) \approx (0.3 + 0.7)/2 = 0.5 \)
- \( P(E|\neg \text{computer science}) \approx (0.2 + 0.7)/2 = 0.45 \)
- \( P(E|\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx (0.2 + 0.3)/2 = 0.25 \)

### Applying Bayes' Rule

Bayes' rule: 

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \):

For **business administration**:
\[ P(E) \approx 0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.5 \cdot 0.9 = 0.02 + 0.45 = 0.47 \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.47} \approx 0.0425 \]

For **computer science**:
\[ P(E) \approx 0.3 \cdot 0.4 + 0.45 \cdot 0.6 = 0.12 + 0.27 = 0.39 \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.4}{0.39} \approx 0.3077 \]

For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
\[ P(E) \approx 0.7 \cdot 0.2 + 0.25 \cdot 0.8 = 0.14 + 0.2 = 0.34 \]
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.34} \approx 0.4118 \]

Therefore, the answers are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0425,
  "computer science": 0.3077,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4118
}
