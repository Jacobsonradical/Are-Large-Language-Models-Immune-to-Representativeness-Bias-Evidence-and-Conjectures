To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study given the personality sketch \( E \) and applying Bayes' Rule, we need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihoods \( P(E|\neg H) \). Here is how we might proceed with reasonable assumptions and simplifications.

1. Determine prior probabilities \( P(H) \):
   Assuming we know nothing specific about Adam's likelihood of being in each field beforehand, we might assign equal priors to keep things simple:
   - \( P(\text{computer science}) = \frac{1}{3} \)
   - \( P(\text{business administration}) = \frac{1}{3} \)
   - \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = \frac{1}{3} \)

2. Determine \( P(E|H) \) - the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given each field:
   - For computer science: Given Adam's love for nature, animals, and his empathy, the likelihood is probably low because these traits are not typically associated with the stereotypical computer science student. However, his high intelligence and abstract thinking align well. So, let's assume \( P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.3 \).
   - For business administration: Adam's traits do not particularly align with the typical traits associated with business administration. So, let’s assume \( P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.1 \).
   - For agricultural and veterinary science: His love for nature, animals, and strong empathy significantly match well with this field. So, \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.8 \).

3. Determine \( P(E|\neg H) \) - the likelihood of the personality sketch given Adam is in any other field:
   - For computer science: Considering the remaining fields, shifting probabilities to account for his personality not correlating well with non-agricultural sciences, maybe \( P(E|\neg \text{computer science}) = 0.6 \).
   - For business administration: Considering the remaining fields, spending more likelihood on agricultural sciences due to Adam’s traits, maybe \( P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) = 0.5 \).
   - For agricultural and veterinary science: As we consider fields other than agricultural and veterinary sciences, maybe again \( P(E|\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary sciences}) = 0.2 \).

Now, calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) + P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) + P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \]

Substitute the values:
\[ P(E) = 0.3 \cdot \frac{1}{3} + 0.1 \cdot \frac{1}{3} + 0.8 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{0.3 + 0.1 + 0.8}{3} = \frac{1.2}{3} = 0.4 \]

Finally, calculate each:
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.4} = \frac{0.1}{0.4} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.4} = \frac{0.033}{0.4} = 0.083 \]
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.4} = \frac{0.267}{0.4} = 0.667 \]

Thus, based on our calculations, the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) are:

{
  "computer science": 0.25,
  "business administration": 0.083,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.667
}
