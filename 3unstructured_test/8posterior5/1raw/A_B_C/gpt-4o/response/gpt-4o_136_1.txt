To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) we can use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to estimate the probabilities for each field:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field. It's challenging to know exact values without data, so let's assume rough estimates for graduate students' enrollment in the U.S.

- Business Administration: 0.25
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.10
- Computer Science: 0.30

2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he's enrolled in that field.

- Business Administration: 0.10 (business students are less likely to have his personality traits)
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.60 (fits well with his love for nature and animals)
- Computer Science: 0.50 (fits well with his intelligence and puzzle-solving skills)

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he's not enrolled in that field, which is relatively lower than \(P(E|H)\) for more fitting fields.

- Business Administration: 0.15
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.20
- Computer Science: 0.20

We then use these estimates to compute \( P(H|E) \). Let's assume \( P(E) \) is roughly averaged across these fields for simplicity.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assuming \( P(E) \) is roughly normalized to average likelihood among given hypotheses:

\( P(E) \approx \sum P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \)

Let's break it down:

\[ P(E) \approx (0.10 \times 0.25) + (0.60 \times 0.10) + (0.50 \times 0.30) + (0.15 \times 0.75) + (0.20 \times 0.70) + (0.20 \times 0.70) \]

\[ P(E) \approx 0.025 + 0.06 + 0.15 + 0.1125 + 0.14 + 0.14 = 0.6275 \]

Now, let's compute each \( P(H|E) \):

1. Business Administration:

\[ P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.10 \cdot 0.25 = 0.025 \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.025}{0.6275} \approx 0.040 \]

2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[ P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.60 \cdot 0.10 = 0.06 \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.06}{0.6275} \approx 0.096 \]

3. Computer Science:

\[ P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.50 \cdot 0.30 = 0.15 \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.15}{0.6275} \approx 0.239 \]

So, the probabilities for each field are approximately:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.040,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.096,
  "computer science": 0.239
}
