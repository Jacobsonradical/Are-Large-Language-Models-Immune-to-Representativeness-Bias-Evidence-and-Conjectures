To apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, we'll provide estimates for the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood of observing \( E \) given that Adam is not in that field \( P(E|\neg H) \). For \( P(E) \), which represents the overall probability of the sketch \( E \), we don't need the exact value, as we would compare the relative values of \( P(H|E) \) among the fields.

### Computer Science
**P(H):** The prior probability \( P(H) \) of Adam studying computer science might be moderate, given the popularity of this field among graduate students, but it's not necessarily exceptionally high or low. Let's estimate it at 0.2.

**P(E|H):** Given Adam's personality sketch, he might not fit the typical profile of a computer science student, who may typically be more interested in technology than animals and nature. So, this might be lower, say 0.1.

**P(E|\neg H):** The probability of having Adam's personality traits if he is not studying computer science could be higher, considering his interests align more with fields involving nature. Let's use 0.3.

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

### Business Administration
**P(H):** The prior probability \( P(H) \) for business administration might be smaller due to a lesser focus on nature and animals within this field. Let’s estimate it at 0.1.

**P(E|H):** Given Adam’s traits, the likelihood that he is enrolled in business administration is probably low. His empathy and love for animals do not strongly align with the typical emphasis in business administration. So, let's say 0.05.

**P(E|\neg H):** The probability of having these personality traits if he is not studying business could be higher, considering his interest areas. Let's use 0.25.

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.05 \cdot 0.1 = 0.005 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
**P(H):** The prior probability \( P(H) \) of Adam being in agricultural and veterinary science, given his interest in nature and animals, should be higher. Let’s estimate it at 0.3.

**P(E|H):** Adam’s personality sketch strongly matches this field. Thus, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) should be relatively high, say 0.8.

**P(E|\neg H):** If Adam is not studying this field, the likelihood of having such traits might be lower because these traits are specifically aligned with agricultural and veterinary interests. Let's use 0.1.

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \]

### Calculating Normalized Probabilities:
To compute the normalized probabilities, we would sum the unnormalized values and divide each by this sum. However, since we're only asked for the general estimates:

\[
\text{Sum} = 0.02 + 0.005 + 0.24 = 0.265
\]

\[
P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.265} \approx 0.075 \quad (\text{for normalization})
\]
\[
P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.265} \approx 0.018 \quad (\text{for normalization})
\]
\[
P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.24}{0.265} \approx 0.906 \quad (\text{for normalization})
\]

Hence, the relative probabilities, without normalization as requested, are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.02,
  "business administration": 0.005,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.24
}
