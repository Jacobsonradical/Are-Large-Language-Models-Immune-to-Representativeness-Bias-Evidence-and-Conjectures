To determine the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the given fields, we will utilize Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in that particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in that particular field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.
- \( \neg H \) represents the event that Adam is not enrolled in that particular field.

For simplicity, we will assume the following:
- The prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field are uniformly distributed (i.e., each field has an equal chance of being Adam's field of study initially).
- \( P(E) \) is a normalization constant which ensures that the probabilities sum up to 1 over all possible fields (though we are not concerned with this directly since we're only comparing the relative likelihoods).

Assume:
- \( P(H) = 0.1 \) for each field (as an estimate, assuming there are many fields of study and we're equally unsure of all).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's characteristics if he is not in that particular field.

We'll now estimate the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) based on how well Adam's personality fits each field.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
    - \( P(E|H) \) might be relatively high because the field aligns well with Adam's love for nature, animals, and empathy.
    - Let \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \)

2. **Computer Science**
    - \( P(E|H) \) could be moderate. Adam's intelligence and puzzle-solving skills fit well, but his empathy and love for animals are less relevant.
    - Let \( P(E|H) \approx 0.4 \)

3. **Business Administration**
    - \( P(E|H) \) might be lower. While Adam's intelligence and understanding of hard work are relevant, his affinity for nature, animals, and empathy aren't key traits for this field.
    - Let \( P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \)

For the sake of these calculations, assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \) as an average likelihood for fields not strongly associated with Adam's traits.

Now, applying Bayes' rule (without calculating \( P(E) \) exactly, focusing on relative magnitudes):

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  \[
  P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08
  \]

- **Computer Science**:
  \[
  P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.4 \cdot 0.1 = 0.04
  \]

- **Business Administration**:
  \[
  P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \cdot 0.1 = 0.02
  \]

Converting these to probabilities proportional to each other yields:

\[
P(H_{AgVet}|E) \approx \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.04 + 0.02} = 0.08 / 0.14 \approx 0.57
\]
\[
P(H_{CS}|E) \approx \frac{0.04}{0.08 + 0.04 + 0.02} = 0.04 / 0.14 \approx 0.29
\]
\[
P(H_{BusAdmin}|E) \approx \frac{0.02}{0.08 + 0.04 + 0.02} = 0.02 / 0.14 \approx 0.14
\]

Thus, the Bayesian updated probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.57",
  "computer science": "0.29",
  "business administration": "0.14"
}
