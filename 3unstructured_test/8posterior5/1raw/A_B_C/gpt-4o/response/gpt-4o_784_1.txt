To use Bayes' rule to compute the probability of each hypothesis \(H\) given the evidence \(E\), \(P(H|E)\), we need to assess:

1. \(P(H)\), the prior probability of each hypothesis.
2. \(P(E|H)\), the probability of the evidence given that the hypothesis is true.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\), the probability of the evidence given that the hypothesis is false.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \(P(E)\) is the same for all hypotheses and serves as a normalizing constant, we can simplify the comparison by computing:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) P(H) \]

Let's estimate these probabilities for each field:

1. **Agricultural and veterinary science**
   - \(P(H)\): This is the prior probability of being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This field is not extremely common but is more relevant given Adam's interests.
     - \(P(H) \approx 0.1\)
   - \(P(E|H)\): The probability of having Adam's personality sketch if he is in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his love for nature, plants, and animals, this is quite high.
     - \(P(E|H) \approx 0.9\)
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of having Adam's personality sketch if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. While still feasible, this is lower as other fields might not align as well.
     - \(P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3\)
   - Hence, \( P(H|E) \propto 0.9 \times 0.1 \)

2. **Business administration**
   - \(P(H)\): This is the prior probability of being enrolled in business administration. This field is relatively common among graduate students but less likely given Adam's personality traits.
     - \(P(H) \approx 0.2\)
   - \(P(E|H)\): The probability of having Adam's personality sketch if he is in business administration. His traits do not typically align with this field.
     - \(P(E|H) \approx 0.1\)
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of having Adam's personality sketch if he is not in business administration. This remains unchanged.
     - \(P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3\)
   - Hence, \( P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.2 \)

3. **Computer science**
   - \(P(H)\): This is the prior probability of being enrolled in computer science. This field is quite common among graduate students, especially those with high intelligence and a propensity for abstract thinking.
     - \(P(H) \approx 0.4\)
   - \(P(E|H)\): The probability of having Adam's personality sketch if he is in computer science. His interest in solving puzzles aligns well, though his love for nature and animals is less typical.
     - \(P(E|H) \approx 0.4\)
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of having Adam's personality sketch if he is not in computer science.
     - \(P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2\)
   - Hence, \( P(H|E) \propto 0.4 \times 0.4 \)

Combining these, we get:

- Agricultural and veterinary science: \( P(H|E) \propto 0.9 \times 0.1 = 0.09 \)
- Business administration: \( P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02 \)
- Computer science: \( P(H|E) \propto 0.4 \times 0.4 = 0.16 \)

To summarize these proportional probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.09,
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.16
}
```

Note: The values should be normalized if you need exact probabilities that add up to 1, but these proportional values are sufficient for comparison purposes.
