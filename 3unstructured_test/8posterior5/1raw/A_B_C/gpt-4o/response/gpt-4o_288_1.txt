Sure, I'll take you through each field and provide the probabilities step-by-step.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given his genuine curiosity about nature, animals, and plants, this field seems quite likely. Let's assign a moderately high prior probability.
     - P(H) ≈ 0.2
   - **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam exhibits the traits described in E given he is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. This is quite high since his interests align well with this field.
     - P(E|H) ≈ 0.9
   - **P(E|¬H)**: The probability that Adam exhibits the traits described in E given he is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. While these traits can occur in other fields, they are less likely.
     - P(E|¬H) ≈ 0.3
   - **P(H|E)**: Using Bayes' rule:
     - P(H|E) = \(\frac{P(E | H) * P(H)}{P(E)}\)
     - P(E) can be simplified to a proportional representation of P(E|H) given all H possibilities. Since we are dealing with qualitative values, let's simplify it here:
     - P(H|E) is approximately proportional to P(E|H) * P(H)
     - P(H|E) = 0.9 * 0.2 / (0.9 * 0.2 + 0.3 * (1 - 0.2))
     - P(H|E) ≈ 0.56

2. **Computer Science**:
   - **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science. Given his high intelligence and abstract thinking, it might be somewhat likely.
     - P(H) ≈ 0.15
   - **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam exhibits the traits described in E given he is in Computer Science. Strong abstract thinking aligns well, but play with nature and empathy for animals less so.
     - P(E|H) ≈ 0.4
   - **P(E|¬H)**: Similar reasoning as above.
     - P(E|¬H) ≈ 0.3
   - **P(H|E)**: Using Bayes' rule:
     - P(H|E) = \(\frac{P(E | H) * P(H)}{P(E)}\)
     - P(H|E) is approximately proportional to P(E|H) * P(H)
     - P(H|E) = 0.4 * 0.15 / (0.4 * 0.15 + 0.3 * (1 - 0.15))
     - P(H|E) ≈ 0.186

3. **Business Administration**:
   - **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration. Adam's characteristics don't strongly align with the interests usually associated with this field.
     - P(H) ≈ 0.1
   - **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam exhibits the traits described in E given he is in Business Administration. This is relatively low given his empathy for animals and nature interest.
     - P(E|H) ≈ 0.2
   - **P(E|¬H)**: Similar reasoning as above field.
     - P(E|¬H) ≈ 0.3
   - **P(H|E)**: Using Bayes' rule:
     - P(H|E) = \(\frac{P(E | H) * P(H)}{P(E)}\)
     - P(H|E) is approximately proportional to P(E|H) * P(H)
     - P(H|E) = 0.2 * 0.1 / (0.2 * 0.1 + 0.3 * (1 - 0.1))
     - P(H|E) ≈ 0.087

Putting it all together:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.56",
  "computer science": "0.186",
  "business administration": "0.087"
}
```

Please note that these probabilities are approximate and based on the qualitative analysis provided. For exact probabilities, more specific data and a comprehensive context would be needed.
