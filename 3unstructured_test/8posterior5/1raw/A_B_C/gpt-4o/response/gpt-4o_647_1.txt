To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) of Adam being enrolled in a particular field given the personality sketch \( E \), I need to use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for all hypotheses and we're only comparing the relative probabilities, it will cancel out in our comparisons. Therefore, we only need to estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field.

### Business Administration

- \( P(H) \): Graduate students in Business Administration are quite common, but let's assume it is less likely for Adam given his traits. Let's assign \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): The personality sketch does not strongly align with typical business administration traits. Empathy and warmth might align somewhat with business, particularly human resources or organizational behavior, but curiosity about nature and plants is less relevant. Let's assign \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The traits seem less typical when compared to other fields. Let's set \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.8 \).

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.8} = 0.025 \]

### Computer Science

- \( P(H) \): Given the prominence of computer science students among graduate students, let's assign \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Curiosity, intelligence, and puzzle-solving align well with computer science, but love for nature and animals do not. Let's assign \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The personality sketch is a bit less typical for other fields like business or pure nature sciences. Let's set \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.8 \).

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.8} = 0.075 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- \( P(H) \): Given Adam's interests, it's quite plausible. Let's assign \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Adamâ€™s curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work strongly align with this field. Let's assign \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The traits, particularly those related to nature, empathy, and animals, are less typical for other fields. Let's set \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.5} = 0.16 \]

To summarize:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.025,
  "computer science": 0.075,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.16
}
```

These values indicate that, given Adam's personality sketch, it is most likely that he was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
