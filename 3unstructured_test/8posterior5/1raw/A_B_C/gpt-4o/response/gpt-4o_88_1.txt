Sure, let's proceed to apply Bayesian inference to calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study. 

### Step-by-Step Process:
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being in a specific field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the evidence E given Adam is in that field.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing the evidence E given Adam is not in that field.

### Bayes Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( P(E) \) represents the overall probability of observing the evidence E, but we can simplify this calculation because we are interested in the relative probabilities across different fields.

### Assumptions:
- We don't have exact statistics, so we can assume common reasonable values for prior probabilities and probabilities based on the given sketch.
  
### Prior Probabilities (P(H)) and Evidence Likelihoods (P(E|H) and P(E|¬H)):
- **P(H)**:
  - It's not uniform; some fields are more common than others. We will assume:
    - Business Administration: 0.2
    - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.1
    - Computer Science: 0.4
  
- **P(E|H)**:
  - Based on the sketch:
    - Business Administration: Medium likelihood (he is intelligent, but other traits do not strongly correlate): 0.2
    - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: High likelihood (fits well with curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals): 0.8
    - Computer Science: Medium likelihood (good at abstract concepts & puzzles, but no direct mention of computing): 0.4
  
- **P(E|¬H)**:
  - General likelihood of a random student fitting the profile:
    - Business Administration: 0.1
    - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.2
    - Computer Science: 0.1

### Bayes Rule Calculation:
Let's denote the normalization constant \( P(E) \) as Z, to simplify relative comparisons.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{Z} \]

Since we are comparing probabilities relative to each other, we don't need to explicitly calculate Z.

#### Business Administration:
\[ P(\text{Business Admin}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{Business Admin}) \cdot P(\text{Business Admin})}{Z} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{Z} = \frac{0.04}{Z} \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(\text{Agri & Vet Science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{Agri & Vet Science}) \cdot P(\text{Agri & Vet Science})}{Z} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{Z} = \frac{0.08}{Z} \]

#### Computer Science:
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science})}{Z} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.4}{Z} = \frac{0.16}{Z} \]

Putting these together, the normalized probabilities, \( P(H|E) \), are relative to the same \( Z \):

{
  "business administration": "0.04",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.08",
  "computer science": "0.16"
