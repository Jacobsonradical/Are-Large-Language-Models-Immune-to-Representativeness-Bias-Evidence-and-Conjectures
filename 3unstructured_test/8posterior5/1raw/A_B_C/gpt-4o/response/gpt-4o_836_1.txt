To estimate the probabilities, I'll make reasonable general assumptions about Adam's personality sketch aligning with each field. Bear in mind these are subjective estimates since I don't have actual statistical data.

### Prior Probabilities P(H)
Let's assume some example prior probabilities for each field based on general enrollment statistics and the nature of Adam's traits:

- Computer Science (CS): P(H) ≈ 0.3 (CS is a popular and broad field)
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS): P(H) ≈ 0.2 (relatively smaller field but suits Adam's interest in plants and animals)
- Business Administration (BA): P(H) ≈ 0.1 (less aligns with Adam's personality sketch)

### Likelihoods P(E|H)
Now, let's estimate how likely Adam’s personality sketch (E) is given enrollment in each field (H):

- **Computer Science:**
  - P(E|H) ≈ 0.4 (CS requires intelligence and abstract reasoning, which Adam has, but his interest in nature is less typical)

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
  - P(E|H) ≈ 0.7 (Aligns well with his interest in nature, plants, and animals, though not all AVS students have to be exactly like Adam)

- **Business Administration:**
  - P(E|H) ≈ 0.2 (Less likely given his focus on empathy, nature, and puzzles, which are less central to BA)

### Complementary Probabilities P(E|\neg H)
Estimating how likely Adam’s personality sketch (E) is given he is not enrolled in that field (\neg H) can be tricky, but we might assume for simplicity sake uniform values adjusted by general alignment with his traits:

- **Computer Science:**
  - P(E | \neg H) ≈ 0.1 (aversion to nature-related field)

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
  - P(E | \neg H) ≈ 0.3 (Nature-related interests span multiple fields, not necessarily in AVS)

- **Business Administration:**
  - P(E | \neg H) ≈ 0.5 (less likely overall but general traits like empathy and intelligence span multiple fields)


### Applying Bayes Rule
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E|H) P(H) + P(E|\neg H) (1-P(H))} \]

#### Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.3}{0.4 \times 0.3 + 0.1 \times 0.7} = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.07} = \frac{0.12}{0.19} \approx 0.63 \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.2}{0.7 \times 0.2 + 0.3 \times 0.8} = \frac{0.14}{0.14 + 0.24} = \frac{0.14}{0.38} \approx 0.37 \]

#### Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{0.2 \times 0.1 + 0.5 \times 0.9} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.45} = \frac{0.02}{0.47} \approx 0.04 \]
