To compute the probabilities, we'll follow the steps as outlined, using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, as we don't have the exact probabilities for each variable, we will make plausible guesses based on the given information.

1. **agricultural and veterinary science**:
    - \( P(H) \) (prior probability of Adam being in this field): Since Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants along with a deep love for animals, it seems reasonably high. Let's estimate \( P(H) \) at 0.25 (25%).
    - \( P(E|H) \) (probability of the personality sketch given this field): Given his interests and traits, this fits very well. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) at 0.9 (90%).
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \) (probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is *not* in this field): This is harder to estimate without specific details but should be reasonably lower, say 0.2 (20%).

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{(0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75)} = \frac{0.225}{0.225 + 0.15} = \frac{0.225}{0.375} = 0.6 \]

2. **computer science**:
    - \( P(H) \) (prior probability of Adam being in this field): Less likely given his strong bond with nature, let's estimate \( P(H) \) at 0.10 (10%).
    - \( P(E|H) \) (probability of the personality sketch given this field): Given his intelligence and enjoyment of puzzles, this is possible but not a strong match. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) at 0.3 (30%).
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \) (probability of the personality sketch if Adam is not in this field): Should be higher as he could fit well in other fields too, let's estimate at 0.4 (40%).

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.10}{(0.3 \cdot 0.10) + (0.4 \cdot 0.90)} = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.36} = \frac{0.03}{0.39} \approx 0.077 \]

3. **business administration**:
    - \( P(H) \) (prior probability of Adam being in this field): Least likely given his profile, let's estimate \( P(H) \) at 0.05 (5%).
    - \( P(E|H) \) (probability of the personality sketch given this field): Unlikely, considering his warm heart and deep love for nature/animals doesn't align well with business administration. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) at 0.1 (10%).
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \) (probability of the personality sketch if Adam is not in this field): Should still be reasonably high for other reasons, let's estimate at 0.45 (45%).

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.05}{(0.1 \cdot 0.05) + (0.45 \cdot 0.95)} = \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.4275} = \frac{0.005}{0.4325} \approx 0.012 \]

The resulting values are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.60,
  "computer science": 0.077,
  "business administration": 0.012
}
