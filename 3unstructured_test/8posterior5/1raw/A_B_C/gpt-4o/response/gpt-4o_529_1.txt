In order to compute the posterior probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for each field given the personality sketch of Adam, I'll start by estimating the values for \(P(H)\), \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E|\neg H)\):

**P(H)**:
1. **Computer Science**: Given the large number of students in this field but considering Adam's characteristics, let's estimate \(P(H)\) = 0.2.
2. **Business Administration**: Similar considerations, but Adam's empathy and love for nature might make this less likely. Let's estimate \(P(H)\) = 0.1.
3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's love for nature and animals, this seems more likely. Let's estimate \(P(H)\) = 0.3.

**P(E|H)**:
1. **Computer Science**: Students in this field may not typically show strong empathy and a love for animals. Let's estimate \(P(E|H)\) = 0.2.
2. **Business Administration**: Similar reasons, but empathy might play a larger role here. Let's estimate \(P(E|H)\) = 0.3.
3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Fits well with Adam's personality sketch. Let's estimate \(P(E|H)\) = 0.7.

**P(E|\neg H)** (assuming \(\neg H\) refers to any field not listed):
1. Considering other fields that may share some of Adam's traits but are less specialized in empathy and nature, let's estimate \(P(E|\neg H)\) = 0.1.

Now we can use Bayes' rule to compute \(P(H|E)\):

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

To simplify, note that we can compare the relative probabilities and ignore \(P(E)\) since we're only interested in the ratios:

\[P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H)\]

Normalize these to sum to 1 within the context of the given fields:

For **Computer Science**:
\[P(H|E) \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.2 = 0.04\]

For **Business Administration**:
\[P(H|E) \propto 0.3 \cdot 0.1 = 0.03\]

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[P(H|E) \propto 0.7 \cdot 0.3 = 0.21\]

Normalize these probabilities by their sum:

Sum of unnormalized probabilities:
\[0.04 + 0.03 + 0.21 = 0.28\]

Normalized probabilities:
1. **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.28} \approx 0.143 \]

2. **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.28} \approx 0.107 \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.21}{0.28} \approx 0.75 \]

Therefore, the approximate probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.143,
  "business administration": 0.107,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75
}
```

This analysis suggests that based on the personality sketch, Adam is most likely to be enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
