Sure, here is the analysis:

1. **Business Administration**

   - P(H): The prior probability of a graduate student being in business administration. Let's suppose this is 0.25, as it is a relatively common field.
   - P(E|H): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in business administration. Given his traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy), this is likely low. Let's assume 0.05.
   - P(E|¬H): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in business administration. Given that his traits align more with fields related to nature and animals, we can estimate this to be higher than the above probability. Let's assume 0.15.

   Using Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
   \]
   Simplifying P(¬H) as 1 - 0.25 = 0.75, we get:

   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.25}{0.05 \cdot 0.25 + 0.15 \cdot 0.75} \approx 0.1
   \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

   - P(H): The prior probability of a graduate student being in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume this is 0.1.
   - P(E|H): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science, considering his traits, is high. Let's assume 0.75.
   - P(E|¬H): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in agricultural and veterinary science is lower. Let's assume 0.10.

   Using Bayes' theorem:
   Simplifying P(¬H) as 1 - 0.1 = 0.9, we get:

   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.75 \cdot 0.1}{0.75 \cdot 0.1 + 0.10 \cdot 0.9} \approx 0.45
   \]

3. **Computer Science**

   - P(H): The prior probability of a graduate student being in computer science. Let's assume this is 0.2.
   - P(E|H): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in computer science. Given his traits (high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts), this is moderate. Let's assume 0.40.
   - P(E|¬H): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in computer science is also relatively moderate. Let's assume 0.3.

   Using Bayes' theorem:
   Simplifying P(¬H) as 1 - 0.2 = 0.8, we get:

   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.40 \cdot 0.2}{0.40 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8} \approx 0.25
   \]

Therefore, the results are:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.45,
  "computer science": 0.25
}

These values represent the approximate probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the respective fields based on his personality sketch as described.
