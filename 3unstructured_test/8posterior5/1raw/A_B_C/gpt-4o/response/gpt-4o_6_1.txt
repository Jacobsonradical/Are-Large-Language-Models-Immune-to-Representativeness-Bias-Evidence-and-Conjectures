To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to assess the following probabilities:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is not enrolled in a particular field.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
However, since we're comparing relative probabilities among the given fields and not calculating absolute probabilities, we can assume \( P(E) \) is constant across all hypotheses. Therefore, we can compare:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Let’s estimate these probabilities for each field.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Let's assume that the prior probability of Adam being in this field is moderate, as it aligns well with his interests. Let's estimate this at 0.2.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals, the probability of his traits being observed if he is in this field is very high. Let’s estimate this at 0.9.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's traits given he is not in this field can still be reasonably high considering his interests could align with other fields. Let's estimate this at 0.3.

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \propto 0.9 \cdot 0.2 = 0.18 \]

2. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is in this field is relatively low, as it does not align closely with his interests and personality traits. Let’s estimate this at 0.05.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's traits if he is in this field is quite low, as business administration typically does not align well with his described interests and traits. Let’s estimate this at 0.1.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Still the same as before, 0.3.

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.05 = 0.005 \]

3. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Assume the prior probability of Adam being in this field is moderate to high, considering his intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles. Let’s estimate this at 0.3.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's traits if he is in this field is moderately high, as computer science involves abstract concepts and problem-solving, but it might not align as well with his empathy and love for animals. Let’s estimate this at 0.6.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Still the same as before, 0.3.

\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) \propto 0.6 \cdot 0.3 = 0.18 \]

Here are the results:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.18,
  "business administration": 0.005,
  "computer science": 0.18
}

Adam seems equally likely to be in agricultural and veterinary science or computer science based on the given personality sketch. However, he is much less likely to be in business administration.
