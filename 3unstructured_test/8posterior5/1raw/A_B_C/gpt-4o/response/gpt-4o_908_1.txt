First, let's break down the components necessary for calculating the posterior probabilities using Bayes' rule:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in each field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in the field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not enrolled in the field.

Let's assign some hypothetical values for the prior probabilities \(P(H)\). 
These values should be reflective of the general population distribution of graduate students in these fields. 

Suppose:
- P(agricultural and veterinary science) = 0.2
- P(business administration) = 0.3
- P(computer science) = 0.15

Next, let's assign some likelihoods \(P(E|H)\) and \(P(E|\neg H)\):

Given Adam's personality sketch, he seems more inclined towards a field that involves nature, animals, abstract thinking, and possibly some analytical work, suggesting he is more likely to be in fields like agricultural and veterinary science or computer science, rather than business administration.

- P(E|agricultural and veterinary science) = 0.9
- P(E|\neg agricultural and veterinary science) = 0.3

- P(E|business administration) = 0.1
- P(E|\neg business administration) = 0.5

- P(E|computer science) = 0.6
- P(E|\neg computer science) = 0.4

Now, let's compute the posterior probabilities \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll also need the term \(P(E)\):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

Since calculating exact values requires knowing distributions and complementary probabilities (\neg H), let's focus on the relative ranking which is usually the more informative outcome in these settings.

Let's compute each posterior probability relatively:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(\text{Ag \& Vet Science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{Ag \& Vet Science}) \cdot P(\text{Ag \& Vet Science})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.2}{[0.9 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot (1-0.2)]} \]

2. **Business Administration**:
\[ P(\text{Business Admin}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{Business Admin}) \cdot P(\text{Business Admin})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.3}{[0.1 \cdot 0.3 + 0.5 \cdot (1-0.3)]} \]

3. **Computer Science**:
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.15}{[0.6 \cdot 0.15 + 0.4 \cdot (1-0.15)]} \]

Given these relative calculations, let's normalize them to fit between 0 and 1:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.85,
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.4
}

These values are indicative of the relative posterior probabilities given the evidence but are scaled for illustrative purposes. Ensure to adjust based on actual prior data and more precise likelihoods if available for an accurate model.
