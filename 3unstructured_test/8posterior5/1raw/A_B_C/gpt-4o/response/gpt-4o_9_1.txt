To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following components for each field \( H \):

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in the field \( H \).
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that the student is enrolled in the field \( H \).
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that the student is not enrolled in the field \( H \).

Since we don't have exact statistical probabilities, we will assume reasonable estimates for these probabilities based on given information and logical inference:

### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: Moderate likelihood, considering the range of graduate fields.
  \[ P(H) \approx 0.1 \]
- **P(E|H)**: High, as Adam's empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for nature align well with this field.
  \[ P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \]
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Lower, as these traits are less strongly associated with other fields.
  \[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \]

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \approx 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \]

### 2. Business Administration
- **P(H)**: Moderate likelihood, considering the range of graduate fields.
  \[ P(H) \approx 0.2 \]
- **P(E|H)**: Low, as Adam's traits do not strongly align with typical business administration characteristics.
  \[ P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \]
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Higher, as Adam's traits are more commonly associated with non-business fields.
  \[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \]

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \approx 0.2 \times 0.2 = 0.04 \]

### 3. Computer Science
- **P(H)**: High likelihood, considering the prevalence of computer science graduate students.
  \[ P(H) \approx 0.3 \]
- **P(E|H)**: Moderate, as intelligence and abstract thinking align, though not perfectly with empathy and love for animals.
  \[ P(E|H) \approx 0.5 \]
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Moderate, as the traits are generally broad and could apply to multiple fields.
  \[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \]

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \approx 0.5 \times 0.3 = 0.15 \]

Combining these results:

\[
\{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08,
  "business administration": 0.04,
  "computer science": 0.15
\}
\]

These probabilities give an indication of which field Adam is more likely to be enrolled in, given the personality sketch \( E \).
