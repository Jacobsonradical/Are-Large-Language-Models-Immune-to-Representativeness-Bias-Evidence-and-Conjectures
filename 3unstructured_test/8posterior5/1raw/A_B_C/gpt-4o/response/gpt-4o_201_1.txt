To calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study using Bayes' Theorem, we need to estimate the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood of the evidence given that the hypothesis is false \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Let's break down and estimate these probabilities for each of the fields.

### 1. Business Administration

- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**
  - Given that Business Administration is a common graduate field, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.15 \).

- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**
  - Since Adam is described as having a love for nature, animals, puzzles, and high empathy, it does not align strongly with typical Business Administration characteristics. Let's assign \( P(E|H) = 0.05 \).

- **Likelihood of Evidence Given Not H \( P(E|\neg H) \)**
  - Given that many other fields might better match Adam's personality traits, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.10 \).

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.15}{0.05 \cdot 0.15 + 0.10 \cdot 0.85} = \frac{0.0075}{0.0075 + 0.085} = \frac{0.0075}{0.0925} \approx 0.081 \]

### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**
  - This field aligns well with Adam's love for nature and animals. Assuming \( P(H) = 0.10 \), since it is less common than business administration but not rare.

- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**
  - Since this field aligns strongly with Adam's interests, \( P(E|H) = 0.90 \).

- **Likelihood of Evidence Given Not H \( P(E|\neg H) \)**
  - Given that his attributes are much more specific to this field, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.05 \).

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.90 \cdot 0.10}{0.90 \cdot 0.10 + 0.05 \cdot 0.90} = \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.045} = \frac{0.09}{0.135} \approx 0.667 \]

### 3. Computer Science

- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**
  - Computer Science is a common and growing field. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.20 \).

- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**
  - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which aligns well with Computer Science. Assume \( P(E|H) = 0.70 \).

- **Likelihood of Evidence Given Not H \( P(E|\neg H) \)**
  - Since other fields might still match some aspects of Adam's personality, assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.30 \).

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.70 \cdot 0.20}{0.70 \cdot 0.20 + 0.30 \cdot 0.80} = \frac{0.14}{0.14 + 0.24} = \frac{0.14}{0.38} \approx 0.368 \]

Therefore, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.081,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.667,
  "computer science": 0.368
}
