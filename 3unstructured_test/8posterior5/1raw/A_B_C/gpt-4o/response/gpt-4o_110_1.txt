To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each of the given fields using Bayes' Rule, we need to firstly estimate the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood of the evidence given that the hypothesis is not true \( P(E|\neg H) \). Then we can use these to find \( P(H|E) \).

Bayes' Rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

### Prior Probabilities
Let us assume the following prior probabilities for the fields, based on typical graduate distributions:
- Computer science: \( P(\text{H}_{\text{CS}}) = 0.3 \)
- Business administration: \( P(\text{H}_{\text{BA}}) = 0.2 \)
- Agricultural and veterinary science: \( P(\text{H}_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.1 \)

### Likelihoods
Given Adam's personality sketch, we estimate the likelihoods as follows:
- For Computer science:
  - \( P(E|\text{H}_{\text{CS}}) \): Computer science generally involves a lot of abstract thinking, which Adam is skilled at, but it does not necessarily align very well with his love for nature and animals.
    - Estimate: 0.4
    
  - \( P(E|\neg \text{H}_{\text{CS}}) \): The general likelihood of his personality given any other discipline (not specifically aligned to computer science).
    - Estimate: 0.05

- For Business administration:
  - \( P(E|\text{H}_{\text{BA}}) \): Business administration typically does not focus on nature, animals, or solving puzzles.
    - Estimate: 0.1
    
  - \( P(E|\neg \text{H}_{\text{BA}}) \): The general likelihood of his personality given any other discipline.
    - Estimate: 0.08

- For Agricultural and veterinary science:
  - \( P(E|\text{H}_{\text{AVS}}) \): This field aligns very well with his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work.
    - Estimate: 0.8
    
  - \( P(E|\neg \text{H}_{\text{AVS}}) \): The general likelihood of his personality given any other discipline.
    - Estimate: 0.04

### Applying Bayes' Rule
Now, we calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

1. **Computer science:**
\[ P(\text{H}_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{H}_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(\text{H}_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{H}_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{(0.4 \cdot 0.3 + 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.8 \cdot 0.1) \cdot 0.7} \]
\[ P(\text{H}_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.185} \approx 0.649 \]

2. **Business administration:**
\[ P(\text{H}_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{H}_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(\text{H}_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{H}_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{(0.4 \cdot 0.3 + 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.8 \cdot 0.1) \cdot 0.8} \]
\[ P(\text{H}_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.185} \approx 0.108 \]

3. **Agricultural and veterinary science:**
\[ P(\text{H}_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{H}_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(\text{H}_{\text{AVS}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{H}_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{(0.4 \cdot 0.3 + 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.8 \cdot 0.1) \cdot 0.9} \]
\[ P(\text{H}_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.185} \approx 0.432 \]

Summarizing the values:

{
  "computer science": 0.649,
  "business administration": 0.108,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.432
