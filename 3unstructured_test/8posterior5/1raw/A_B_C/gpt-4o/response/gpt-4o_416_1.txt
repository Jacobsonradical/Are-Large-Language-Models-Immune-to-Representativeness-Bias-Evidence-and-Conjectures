To address the problem using Bayes' rule, we'll go through the steps of assigning probabilities and then calculating the posterior probabilities.

Bayes' Rule formula is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

Given that we don't have exact probabilities for these values, I'll make reasonable assumptions based on the personality sketch provided.

### Evidence Analysis:
1. Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
2. He enjoys solving puzzles and has a high intelligence level.
3. He has empathy and a deep love for animals.
4. He values hard work and dedication.

### Hypothesis Analysis:
1. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability of a random graduate student being enrolled in this field could be relatively high.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The probability that a Business Administration student has attributes like curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals is perhaps lower.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability that someone not in Business Administration has these attributes might be comparatively higher.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): This is a common field for graduate studies, so the prior might also be high.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Enjoying solving puzzles aligns well, but the deep love for animals and curiosity about plants are less typical.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Having these attributes while being in another field might slightly lower the values here.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): This field may have a lower overall prior probability.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The specific combination of curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy aligns very well.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): This personality sketch outside this field might be less correlated.

Hypothetical Values:

### Business Administration:
- \( P(H) \): 0.2 (20%)
- \( P(E|H) \): 0.1 (10%)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): 0.3 (30%)

### Computer Science:
- \( P(H) \): 0.3 (30%)
- \( P(E|H) \): 0.2 (20%)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): 0.2 (20%)

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- \( P(H) \): 0.1 (10%)
- \( P(E|H) \): 0.8 (80%)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): 0.1 (10%)

Now we apply these to Bayes' Rule:

1. **Business Administration**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)}
   \]

2. **Computer Science**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)}
   \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)}
   \]

Since \( P(E) \) will be the same across all hypotheses and will cancel out for comparative purposes:
1. **Business Administration**: 
   \[
   P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.02}{P(E)}
   \]

2. **Computer Science**: 
   \[
   P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.06}{P(E)}
   \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: 
   \[
   P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.08}{P(E)}
   \]

Giving us the final comparison:

\[
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.06,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08
}
\]

These values indicate that based on the personality sketch, Adam is most likely studying Agricultural and Veterinary Science, followed by Computer Science, and is least likely to be enrolled in Business Administration.
