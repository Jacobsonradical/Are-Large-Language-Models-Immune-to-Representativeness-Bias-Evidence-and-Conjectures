To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to have values for the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H) \). Here's a probable way to approach the problem qualitatively, though precise numeric values may need domain-specific statistics:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: Let's assume a moderate prior probability since this field aligns well with Adam's personality sketch.
       - \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \)
   - **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood is high since Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, and animals aligns well with this field.
       - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \)
   - **Likelihood of the evidence given the negation, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The likelihood that Adamâ€™s personality matches this description if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science is lower.
       - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \)

2. **Business Administration:**
   - **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: The prior probability might be moderate but less compared to agricultural science because business administration is a common field but doesn't align as closely with Adam's description.
       - \( P(H) \approx 0.05 \)
   - **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood is low as this personality sketch does not significantly indicate traits typically associated with business administration.
       - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \)
   - **Likelihood of the evidence given the negation, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: If Adam is in any other field, his personality sketch might still fit reasonably well.
       - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \)

3. **Computer Science:**
   - **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: The prior might be slightly higher due to the popularity of computer science.
       - \( P(H) \approx 0.15 \)
   - **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood aligns moderately since computer science often involves problem-solving skills and abstract concepts.
       - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.5 \)
   - **Likelihood of the evidence given the negation, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The personality traits might fit moderately well in other fields.
       - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \)

Next, we'll use Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \)

For simplicity, let's assume \( P(\neg H) \approx 1 - P(H) \).

Let's calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   \[
   P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) \approx 0.09 + 0.27 = 0.36
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{0.36} \approx \frac{0.09}{0.36} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Business Administration:**
   \[
   P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.05) + (0.4 \cdot 0.95) \approx 0.005 + 0.38 = 0.385
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.05}{0.385} \approx \frac{0.005}{0.385} \approx 0.013
   \]

3. **Computer Science:**
   \[
   P(E) = (0.5 \cdot 0.15) + (0.4 \cdot 0.85) \approx 0.075 + 0.34 = 0.415
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.15}{0.415} \approx \frac{0.075}{0.415} \approx 0.181
   \]

So, the final probabilities \( P(H|E) \) are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.25,
  "business administration": 0.013,
  "computer science": 0.181
}
