To solve this problem with Bayes' rule, we need to judge the initial probabilities, the likelihood of the personality sketch given each hypothesis, and then apply Bayes' rule to find the posterior probabilities.

### Definitions and Assumptions:
- **P(H)**: Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
- **P(E|H)**: Likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in the given field.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in the given field.

### Computing Posteriors Using Bayes' Rule:
- **Bayes' Rule**: \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \)
- \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant; since we are interested in relative probabilities, we can ignore it for comparisons.

### Estimates for Different Fields:

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: Moderate because it's a less common field but aligns with his love for animals and nature.
- **P(E|H)**: High, given his personality fits well.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Lower because the personality sketch is quite distinct.
- Calculations are relative so let's assume:
  - **P(H)** = 0.1
  - **P(E|H)** = 0.7
  - **P(E|\neg H)** = 0.3
  - **Using Bayes' Rule**: \( P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = 0.07 / P(E) \)

#### Computer Science
- **P(H)**: Moderate-to-high because it's a common field for high intelligence and puzzle-solving.
- **P(E|H)**: Moderate because his empathy and love for animals are less relevant.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Higher relative to the animal-centric fields.
- Assume:
  - **P(H)** = 0.3
  - **P(E|H)** = 0.4
  - **P(E|\neg H)** = 0.3
  - **Using Bayes' Rule**: \( P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} = 0.12 / P(E) \)

#### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: Lower because it doesn't strongly match his interests in animals and nature.
- **P(E|H)**: Low because traits like empathy and love for puzzles are less aligned.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Higher because the personality is less distinct for this field.
- Assume:
  - **P(H)** = 0.2
  - **P(E|H)** = 0.2
  - **P(E|\neg H)** = 0.3
  - **Using Bayes' Rule**: \( P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = 0.04 / P(E) \)

### Final Judged Probabilities:
Given our relative comparisons:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.70,
  "computer science": 0.12,
  "business administration": 0.04
}
```

These values above represent ratios based on the prior probabilities and the likelihoods assessed, showing that the most aligned field given Adam's personality sketch is agricultural and veterinary science.
