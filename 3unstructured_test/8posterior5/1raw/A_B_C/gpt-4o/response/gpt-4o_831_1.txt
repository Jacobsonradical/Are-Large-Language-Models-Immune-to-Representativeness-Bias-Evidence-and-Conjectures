To employ Bayes' Rule, we need to calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Firstly, let’s estimate the probabilities for each field.

**Computer Science:**

1. P(H) - The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Given the popularity of computer science, let's estimate this as 0.20.
2. P(E|H) - The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he was studying computer science. Elements like high intelligence and problem-solving skills align with computer science, but a love of nature and empathy are somewhat less typical. Let’s estimate this as 0.30.
3. P(E|¬H) - The probability of observing the personality sketch if Adam was not studying computer science. Since computer science isn't highly correlated with his noted love for nature and animals, let's estimate this as 0.70.

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

1. P(H) - The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let’s assign this a value given the relative fewer students in this field compared to computer science, estimating it as 0.10.
2. P(E|H) - The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he was in agricultural and veterinary science. His love for nature and animals strongly aligns with this field. Let’s estimate this as 0.90.
3. P(E|¬H) - The probability of observing the personality sketch if Adam was not studying agricultural and veterinary science. Let's estimate this as 0.50 since his interests are not unique to this field alone but still somewhat indicative. 

**Business Administration:**

1. P(H) - The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Given the popularity similar to computer science but potentially less applicable to his personality, let’s estimate this as 0.15.
2. P(E|H) - The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he was studying business administration. His empathy might fit here, but love for nature and animals does not as much. Let’s estimate this as 0.20.
3. P(E|¬H) - The probability of observing the personality sketch if Adam was not studying business administration. Since his traits are quite atypical for a business student. Let's estimate it as 0.80.

Assuming P(E) is the same across all hypotheses since this doesn't change our relative comparison, we can now calculate \( P(H|E) \):

**Computer Science:**

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.30 \cdot 0.20}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.06 / P(E) \]

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.90 \cdot 0.10}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.09 / P(E) \]

**Business Administration:**

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.20 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.03 / P(E) \]

Finally, normalizing by the same \( P(E) \):

{
  "computer science": 0.06,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.09,
  "business administration": 0.03
}

These are the relative values rather than absolute probabilities, focusing on their relative chances given the personality traits of Adam.
