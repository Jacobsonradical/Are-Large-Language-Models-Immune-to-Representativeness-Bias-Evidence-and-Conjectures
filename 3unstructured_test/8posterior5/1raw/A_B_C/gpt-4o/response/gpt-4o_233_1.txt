Let's break down the likelihoods using Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field, \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the given personality traits if Adam is in that field, and \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality traits regardless of the field. \( P(E|\neg H) \) will help us understand how likely the traits are if Adam is not in a specific field, which helps in finding \( P(E) \).

Since we do not have actual numerical values, we'll make some reasonable assumptions based on the provided personality sketch.

### Assumptions & Reasoning

1. **Business Administration**:
   - P(H) (prior): Might be around 0.2, as many students enroll in business administration.
   - P(E|H): Likely low, let's assume 0.1, as the personality sketch doesn't strongly align with typical traits of an MBA student.
   - P(E|\neg H): We'll assume a moderate probability, say 0.4, as the traits could fit into numerous other fields besides business.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - P(H): Likely lower compared to other fields, say 0.1, as fewer students may be enrolled in this field.
   - P(E|H): High, around 0.8, since the personality sketch perfectly fits someone in this field.
   - P(E|\neg H): Lower, around 0.2, since these traits are less common outside of agricultural and veterinary science.

3. **Computer Science**:
   - P(H): Quite high, perhaps around 0.3, as computer science is a very popular field.
   - P(E|H): Moderate, around 0.6, as intelligence and problem-solving align well, though other traits like empathy and love for nature/animals might not align as closely.
   - P(E|\neg H): Moderately high, around 0.5, since intelligence and problem-solving align with many other fields too.

### Calculation

Let's calculate the normalized posterior probabilities, noting that the total doesn't need to add up to 1 because there are other fields of specialization.

Here's a simplified representation, not scaled to probabilities summing to 1 but reflecting the relative likelihoods based on our assumptions:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(E) ≈ P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)(1 - P(H)) \)
   - \( P(E|H) = 0.1, P(H) = 0.2, P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \)
   - \( P(E) ≈ 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8 ≈ 0.08 + 0.32 = 0.4 \)
   - \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.4} = \frac{0.02}{0.4} = 0.05 \)

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(E|H) = 0.8, P(H) = 0.1, P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \)
   - \( P(E) ≈ 0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9 ≈ 0.08 + 0.18 = 0.26 \)
   - \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.26} ≈ \frac{0.08}{0.26} ≈ 0.308 \)

3. **Computer Science**: 
   - \( P(E|H) = 0.6, P(H) = 0.3, P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \)
   - \( P(E) ≈ 0.6 \cdot 0.3 + 0.5 \cdot 0.7 ≈ 0.18 + 0.35 = 0.53 \)
   - \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.3}{0.53} ≈ \frac{0.18}{0.53} ≈ 0.34 \)

Therefore, the relative posterior probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.308,
  "computer science": 0.34
}
```

Note: These values indicate relative likelihoods based on the assumptions. For more precise values, actual data on enrollment and personality trait distributions would be needed.
