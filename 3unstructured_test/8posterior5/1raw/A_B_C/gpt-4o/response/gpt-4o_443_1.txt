To apply Bayes' rule and compute the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the specified fields based on the given personality sketch \( E \), we'll follow these steps:

1. **Make some reasonable assumptions:**

   We'll assume P(H) (the prior probability) for each field, along with the likelihoods P(E|H) and P(E|\neg H).

2. **Apply Bayes' Rule:**

   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]

   Since we have multiple fields, the normalization term \(P(E)\) can be computed, but for simplicity, we'll compare the relative scales directly.

### Assumptions:

1. **Prior Probabilities \(P(H)\):**

   Given that Adam is a graduate student in the U.S., we can assume some rough prior probabilities:
   - Agricultural and veterinary science might be less common generally.
   - Computer science is a very popular graduate field.
   - Business administration is also quite popular.

   Let’s assume:
   \[
   P(\text{Ag. and Vet. Sci.}) = 0.1
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{Comp. Sci.}) = 0.4
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{Bus. Adm.}) = 0.3
   \]

2. **Likelihoods \(P(E|H)\):**

   Given Adam's personality sketch:
   - Agricultural and veterinary science fits well due to his curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals.
   - Computer science might fit moderately due to his intelligence and enjoyment of puzzles, but doesn’t directly correlate with his love for nature and animals.
   - Business administration seems less fitting.

   Let's assume:
   \[
   P(E|\text{Ag. and Vet. Sci.}) = 0.8
   \]
   \[
   P(E|\text{Comp. Sci.}) = 0.5
   \]
   \[
   P(E|\text{Bus. Adm.}) = 0.2
   \]

3. **Complement Likelihoods \(P(E|\neg H)\):**

   This is a bit more complex, but generally, let's consider:
   \[
   P(E|\neg \text{Ag. and Vet. Sci.}) = 0.1
   \]
   \[
   P(E|\neg \text{Comp. Sci.}) = 0.3
   \]
   \[
   P(E|\neg \text{Bus. Adm.}) = 0.4
   \]

### Computation:

Let's assume \(P(E)\) is a normalization constant, but treat the relative subsections directly.

For each field:

#### Agricultural and veterinary science:
\[
P(\text{Ag. and Vet. Sci.}|E) = \frac{0.8 * 0.1}{0.8 * 0.1 + 0.5 * 0.4 + 0.2 * 0.3}
\]
\[
= \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.2 + 0.06} = \frac{0.08}{0.34} \approx 0.24
\]

#### Computer science:
\[
P(\text{Comp. Sci.}|E) = \frac{0.5 * 0.4}{0.8 * 0.1 + 0.5 * 0.4 + 0.2 * 0.3}
\]
\[
= \frac{0.2}{0.08 + 0.2 + 0.06} = \frac{0.2}{0.34} \approx 0.59
\]

#### Business administration:
\[
P(\text{Bus. Adm.}|E) = \frac{0.2 * 0.3}{0.8 * 0.1 + 0.5 * 0.4 + 0.2 * 0.3}
\]
\[
= \frac{0.06}{0.08+ 0.2 + 0.06} = \frac{0.06}{0.34} \approx 0.18
\]

Thus, our results are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.24,
  "computer science": 0.59,
  "business administration": 0.18
}
```
