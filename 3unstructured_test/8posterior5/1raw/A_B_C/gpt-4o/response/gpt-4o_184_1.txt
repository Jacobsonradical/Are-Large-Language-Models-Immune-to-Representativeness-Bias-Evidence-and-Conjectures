To answer your question, we will use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probabilities for Adam being enrolled in each of the given fields, given the personality sketch (denoted as \( P(H|E) \)). Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis,
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis,
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

First, we need to estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field. While these calculations are somewhat subjective, we will base them on the information provided in the personality sketch.

### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Given Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, the prior probability (before knowing the personality sketch) might be slightly higher for this field.
- **Evidence Given Hypothesis \( P(E|H) \)**: The personality sketch (E) is strongly correlated with the hypothesis that Adam is in this field.
- **Evidence Given Not Hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The personality sketch might be less likely if Adam were in a different field.

### 2. Computer Science
- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: While Adam's intelligence and problem-solving skills might align with computer science, his love for nature and animals might make this less probable.
- **Evidence Given Hypothesis \( P(E|H) \)**: The personality sketch supports some relevant traits like high intelligence and solving puzzles, but other traits are less aligned.
- **Evidence Given Not Hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Similar to above, but more general.

### 3. Business Administration
- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Adam's traits do not strongly align with those typically associated with business administration.
- **Evidence Given Hypothesis \( P(E|H) \)**: The sketch does not particularly align with this field.
- **Evidence Given Not Hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: There should be weaker alignment.

Let's assign subjective but reasoned values to these probabilities.

#### Subjective Estimates:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  - \( P(H) \): 0.30
  - \( P(E|H) \): 0.90
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \): 0.40

- **Computer Science**:
  - \( P(H) \): 0.25
  - \( P(E|H) \): 0.60
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \): 0.50

- **Business Administration**:
  - \( P(H) \): 0.20
  - \( P(E|H) \): 0.30
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \): 0.55

Next, let's assume a simplified model where these are the only fields available for consideration, and compute the results using Bayes' theorem.

For simplicity's sake, we sidestep the denominator \( P(E) \) as it normalizes the three calculated values.

#### Simplified Bayes' Theorem Calculation:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.90 \cdot 0.30}{(0.90 \cdot 0.30) + (0.40 \cdot 0.70)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.27}{0.27 + 0.28} \approx 0.49 \]

2. **Computer Science**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.60 \cdot 0.25}{(0.60 \cdot 0.25) + (0.50 \cdot 0.75)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.375} \approx 0.29 \]

3. **Business Administration**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.30 \cdot 0.20}{(0.30 \cdot 0.20) + (0.55 \cdot 0.80)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.44} \approx 0.12 \]

Based on our simplified calculations using Bayesian inference:

\[ \text{Result} = \{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.49,
  "computer science": 0.29,
  "business administration": 0.12
\} \]

Note: The actual real-world calculations might differ based on more detailed data, but these values are reasonable estimates based on the given information.
