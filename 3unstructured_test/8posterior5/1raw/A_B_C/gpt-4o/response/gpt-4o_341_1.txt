Given the personality sketch of Adam and the nature of the fields in question, let's assess the probabilities and compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule.

### General Breakdown of Probabilities

1. **P(H)**: Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field. Without specific data, assume these priors are equal for simplicity, meaning each field has an equal chance.

2. **P(E|H)**: Probability of Adam having the described personality traits given he is enrolled in that field. Here, we need to evaluate how well the personality traits match typical students in each field.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability of Adam having these traits regardless of his field. It is common, so assign a balanced, less specific estimate.

### Calculations per Field 

#### 1. Business Administration
- **P(H)**: Low interest in nature and animals among business students.
- **P(E|H)**: Unlikely as the traits describe interests and empathy more aligned with other fields.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Personality traits do not typically align with business students.

#### 2. Computer Science
- **P(H)**: Middle-ground likelihood, popularity of the field among various personalities.
- **P(E|H)**: Curiosity and intelligence appreciated, though not specifically tied to empathy or nature.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Mixed; traits somewhat align depending on personal interests.

#### 3. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: High likelihood, strong alignment with a love for animals, nature, and empathy.
- **P(E|H)**: Very high, traits match perfectly with field requirements.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Traits common among this specialization.

### Using Bayes' Rule

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \). Simplify assuming \( P(\neg H) \approx 1 - P(H) \) and straightforward priors.

### Evaluation

Assuming:
- **Equal prior (\( P(H) = 0.33 \))**
- **Business Administration:**
    - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \)
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \)
- **Computer Science:**
    - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.4 \)
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.6 \)
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
    - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \)
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \)

Bayes' computation roughly yields:

1. Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \times 0.33}{0.1 \times 0.33 + 0.5 \times 0.67}  = \frac{0.033}{0.033 + 0.335} \approx 0.09 \]

2. Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.4 \times 0.33}{0.4 \times 0.33 + 0.6 \times 0.67}  = \frac{0.132}{0.132 + 0.402} \approx 0.25 \]

3. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.9 \times 0.33}{0.9 \times 0.33 + 0.2 \times 0.67}  = \frac{0.297}{0.297 + 0.134} \approx 0.69 \]

### Final Answer

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.09,
  "computer science": 0.25,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.69
}
