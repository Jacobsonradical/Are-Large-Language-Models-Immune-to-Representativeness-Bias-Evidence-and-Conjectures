To calculate the probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in various fields based on his personality sketch \( E \), we'll use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalization factor and is the same for all fields, we can compare the fields based on the product \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

We'll start by making reasonable assumptions about \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \) (prior probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in business administration): Let's assume 0.2 (20%).
   - \( P(E|H) \) (likelihood of Adam having his characteristics given that he is in business administration): Given that Adam's traits do not strongly align with typical traits for business administration students, let's assume 0.1 (10%).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \) (probability of Adam having his characteristics in other fields): Assume a generic value of 0.9 (90%).

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Let's assume 0.1 (10%) as a prior.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam’s love for nature and animals, his traits highly align with this field, let's assume 0.7 (70%).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Assume a generic value of 0.3 (30%).

3. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Let's assume 0.3 (30%).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam’s intelligence and interest in solving puzzles, let's assume 0.5 (50%).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Assume a generic value of 0.5 (50%).

Using Bayes' theorem:

For **Business Administration**:
- \( P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \)

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
- \( P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.7 \cdot 0.1 = 0.07 \)

For **Computer Science**:
- \( P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.5 \cdot 0.3 = 0.15 \)

Since we are not normalizing these values to sum to 1, we directly use these proportional values. The stronger the proportional value, the more likely the field given the personality sketch.

Here is the resulting set of probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.07,
  "computer science": 0.15
