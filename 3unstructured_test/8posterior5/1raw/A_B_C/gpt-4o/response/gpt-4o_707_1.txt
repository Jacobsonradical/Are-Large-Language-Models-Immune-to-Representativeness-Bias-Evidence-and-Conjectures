To calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need the following terms:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing his personality sketch given he was in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing his personality sketch given he was not in that field.
- \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) regardless of the field, which can be calculated using \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \).

For simplicity, let's assume:
- \( P(H) \) is equally likely for each field (since we don't have prior data about Adam's preferences), so \( P(H) = 1/3 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is a combined probability of observing the personality sketch in any other discipline, which we may assume to be equal across non-specified fields for simplicity.

Given the personality sketch, we estimate:
- \( P(E|H) \) for each field based on how well the description matches the common traits of students in that field.

Now, let's assign values based on the provided personality sketch:

### Field: Computer Science
- \( P(H) = 1/3 \)
- Quiet, enjoys solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts are characteristics that could fit a computer science student. However, the strong empathy and deep love for animals might be less characteristic.
- Let's assign: \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) can be generically assigned less than \( P(E|H) \): \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \)

### Field: Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) = 1/3 \)
- Strong empathy, deep love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants align very well with this field.
- Let's assign: \( P(E|H) = 0.6 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \)

### Field: Business Administration
- \( P(H) = 1/3 \)
- High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts can fit, though the other traits are less characteristic of business administration.
- Let's assign: \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \)

Now, we use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

### Calculations:

#### Computer Science:
\[ P(E) = (0.3 \times \frac{1}{3}) + (0.2 \times \frac{2}{3}) = 0.1 + 0.133 = 0.233 \]
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.3 \times \frac{1}{3}}{0.233} = \frac{0.1}{0.233} \approx 0.429 \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(E) = (0.6 \times \frac{1}{3}) + (0.2 \times \frac{2}{3}) = 0.2 + 0.133 = 0.333 \]
\[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) = \frac{0.6 \times \frac{1}{3}}{0.333} = \frac{0.2}{0.333} \approx 0.6 \]

#### Business Administration:
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \times \frac{1}{3}) + (0.2 \times \frac{2}{3}) = 0.067 + 0.133 = 0.2 \]
\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.2 \times \frac{1}{3}}{0.2} = \frac{0.067}{0.2} = 0.333 \]

Final results:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.429,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.333
}
