To use Bayes' Rule to compute \( P(H|E) \), the probability that Adam was enrolled in each field given his personality sketch, we need to estimate the following probabilities for each field:
1. \( P(H) \): The general probability that a graduate student in the U.S. was enrolled in that particular field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he was enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he was not enrolled in that field.

Bayes' Rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the evidence, which can be calculated as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) + \ldots + P(E|H_n) \cdot P(H_n) \]

Here we'll provide estimated values for each field:

**Computer Science:**
- \( P(H) \): Computer Science is a popular field among graduate students, let's assume about 0.20 (20%).
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's love for puzzles and high intelligence, he might fit well, but it's less aligned with his love for nature and animals. Let's assume 0.10.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): This would be the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he was enrolled in any other field. Given that several fields might not align perfectly, let's assume 0.12.

**Business Administration:**
- \( P(H) \): Business Administration is also a common field, let's assume about 0.15 (15%).
- \( P(E|H) \): This field is less related to Adam's personality traits; let's assume 0.05.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of the personality sketch if not in Business Admin would similarly be around 0.13.

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- \( P(H) \): This is less common than the others but clearly fits Adam's interests perfectly, let's assume 0.05 (5%).
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adamâ€™s traits, this field fits him very well. Let's assume 0.70.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability would be lower as many other fields wouldn't align as well. Let's assume 0.08.

Plugging these values into Bayes' Rule:

1. **Computer Science:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.10 \cdot 0.20}{(\text{Normalizing factor})} \]

2. **Business Administration:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.15}{(\text{Normalizing factor})} \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.70 \cdot 0.05}{(\text{Normalizing factor})} \]

The normalizing factor (denominator) ensures that the total probabilities add up to 1 considering all possible fields. However, since we have been asked for individual probabilities, we can focus on computing relative values:

{
  "computer science": "\(\approx 0.057\)",
  "business administration": "\(\approx 0.015\)",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "\(\approx 0.35\)"
}

Thus:
{
  "computer science": "0.057",
  "business administration": "0.015",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.35"
}

Note: These values should ultimately be normalized so that they fit within the full scope of likely graduate fields, shown here roughly for comparison purposes.
