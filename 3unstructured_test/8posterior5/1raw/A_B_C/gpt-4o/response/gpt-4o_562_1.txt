Certainly! Let's analyze the probabilities for each field using Bayes' rule. We'll need to consider:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability Adam was studying in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch of Adam given he was in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch of Adam given he was not in that field.

Then we compute:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) (the total probability of the evidence) is constant for all comparisons, we can use the simplified form of Bayes' rule (ignoring normalization):
\[ \text{Posterior} \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Now let's assume some illustrative values based on general knowledge and intuition. These values are subjective estimates:

1. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H) \): 0.15 (a reasonable estimation given the broad number of fields)
   - \( P(E|H) \): 0.1 (the personality sketch is less typical for a business administration student)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): 0.05

2. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): 0.25 (computer science is a popular choice among graduate students)
   - \( P(E|H) \): 0.3 (a good fit with high intelligence and problem-solving skills, though less on nature and empathy)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): 0.05

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): 0.05 (less common compared to fields like business or computer science, but relevant to his interest in nature and animals)
   - \( P(E|H) \): 0.8 (the personality sketch strongly aligns with interests typical for this field)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): 0.05

Performing the calculations (relative values since \( P(E) \) is constant):

- **Business Administration**:
  \[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) \propto P(E|\text{Business Administration}) \cdot P(\text{Business Administration}) = 0.1 \cdot 0.15 = 0.015 \]

- **Computer Science**:
  \[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) \propto P(E|\text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science}) = 0.3 \cdot 0.25 = 0.075 \]

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  \[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) \propto P(E|\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) \cdot P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04 \]

Normalizing these values can provide more precise probabilities, but for the purpose of this exercise, we can present the comparative strengths without exact normalization:

{
  "business administration": 0.015,
  "computer science": 0.075,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.04
