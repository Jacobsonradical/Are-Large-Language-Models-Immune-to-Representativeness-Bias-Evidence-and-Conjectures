Let's break this down step by step using Bayes' rule:

Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \)
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \)
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \)
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of evidence \( E \)

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)** : Let's assume a moderate prior that a graduate student could be studying agricultural and veterinary science. This field is not extremely broad, but reasonable for Adam's personality traits.
  \[ P(H) = 0.1 \]
  
- **P(E|H)** : Given that Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, plants, animals, and empathy, the probability that he would be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science seems quite high.
  \[ P(E|H) = 0.9 \]
  
- **P(E|¬H)** : For students not in agricultural and veterinary science, the probability of evidence that Adam fits the profile is lower since other fields might not align as closely with his traits.
  \[ P(E|¬H) = 0.2 \]

### Computer Science

- **P(H)** : Computer science is a popular field for graduate studies. Assume a higher prior probability but consider if it fits Adam's profile.
  \[ P(H) = 0.3 \]
  
- **P(E|H)** : Given Adam's traits, the probability that he is in computer science is moderate. His intelligence and love for puzzles align, but the nature and animals part don't fit as well.
  \[ P(E|H) = 0.4 \]
  
- **P(E|¬H)** : For a non-computer science field, the probability of the given traits might still be moderately represented, but not specific to computer science.
  \[ P(E|¬H) = 0.3 \]

### Business Administration

- **P(H)** : Business Administration is also a common field. Assume a moderate prior probability.
  \[ P(H) = 0.2 \]
  
- **P(E|H)** : Adam's profile doesn't really fit well with business administration, except possibly for his intelligence and appreciation for hard work.
  \[ P(E|H) = 0.2 \]
  
- **P(E|¬H)** : For fields other than business administration, Adam's profile could be more common.
  \[ P(E|¬H) = 0.4 \]

Now, we will compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' theorem:

Total probability of evidence \( E \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

\[ P(E) = (0.9 \times 0.1) + (0.2 \times 0.9) = 0.09 + 0.18 = 0.27 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.1}{0.27} \approx 0.333 \]

### Computer Science

\[ P(E) = (0.4 \times 0.3) + (0.3 \times 0.7) = 0.12 + 0.21 = 0.33 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.3}{0.33} \approx 0.364 \]

### Business Administration

\[ P(E) = (0.2 \times 0.2) + (0.4 \times 0.8) = 0.04 + 0.32 = 0.36 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.2}{0.36} \approx 0.111 \]

Thus, the results are as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.333,
  "computer science": 0.364,
  "business administration": 0.111
}
