Sure, let's use Bayes' Theorem to find the probability of Adam being enrolled in each of the mentioned fields, given his personality sketch (E). 

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to estimate the following probabilities for each field:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in the specific field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in the specific field.

### Assumptions:

- \( P(H) \): We will assume all three fields have an equal prior probability since no specific prior information is given. Thus, \( P(H) \) for each field is \(\frac{1}{3}\).

- We will estimate \( P(E|H) \) based on how well Adam's personality traits match each field:

  - For **business administration**:
    - Personality traits like empathy, intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts might somewhat fit, but strong curiosity about nature and love for animals are less relevant.
    - \( P(E|H) \) is likely moderate: Let's say 0.2.
  
  - For **computer science**:
    - Traits such as high intelligence, solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts fit well. However, his strong empathy and love for nature and animals are less relevant.
    - \( P(E|H) \) is likely moderate to high: Let's say 0.4.
  
  - For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
    - The traits of genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy match exceptionally well.
    - \( P(E|H) \) is likely very high: Let's say 0.8.

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): We'll assume the average likelihood of seeing such traits in people not in these fields is around 0.1.

Now we apply Bayes' Theorem:

- **business administration**:
  \[
  P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{P(E)}
  \]

- **computer science**:
  \[
  P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{P(E)}
  \]

- **agricultural and veterinary science**:
  \[
  P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{P(E)}
  \]

Note that \( P(E) \) is the same for all calculations and just serves as a normalizing constant.

### Results:

1. **business administration**:
  \[
  P(H|E) \propto 0.2 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 0.0667
  \]

2. **computer science**:
  \[
  P(H|E) \propto 0.4 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 0.1333
  \]

3. **agricultural and veterinary science**:
  \[
  P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 0.2667
  \]

Thus:

{
  "business administration": 0.0667,
  "computer science": 0.1333,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.2667
}
