To calculate \( P(H|E) \), where \( H \) denotes the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in a particular field, and \( E \) denotes the personality sketch of Adam, we can use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For each field, we need to estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

- **P(H_agriculture and veterinary science)**: The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume this is 0.1 (since it is a relatively specialized field).
- **P(E|H_agriculture and veterinary science)**: Given Adam's interests and personality, especially his love for nature and animals, this is likely high. Let's estimate this at 0.8.
- **P(E|\neg H_agriculture and veterinary science)**: The probability of Adam's profile if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science is still possible, but lower. Let's estimate this at 0.3.

2. **Computer Science**

- **P(H_computer science)**: The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in computer science. Let's assume this is relatively high, say 0.2.
- **P(E|H_computer science)**: Adam’s interest in solving puzzles and intelligence suggests some likelihood, but his love for nature and animals doesn’t directly align. Let's estimate this at 0.4.
- **P(E|\neg H_computer science)**: The probability of his profile if he is not in computer science would be relatively similar. Let's estimate this at 0.4.

3. **Business Administration**

- **P(H_business administration)**: The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in business administration might be around 0.15.
- **P(E|H_business administration)**: Adam's personality does not strongly suggest an inclination towards business administration. Let's estimate this at 0.2.
- **P(E|\neg H_business administration)**: If not in business administration, he could fit another profile better. Let's estimate this at 0.4.

Finally, we use Bayes' rule for each field:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( P(E) \) is the same for all comparisons as we are comparing relative likelihoods.

Let's calculate these:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  \[
  P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = 0.08/P(E)
  \]

- **Computer Science**:
  \[
  P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = 0.08/P(E)
  \]

- **Business Administration**:
  \[
  P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} = 0.03/P(E)
  \]

Now, normalizing these:

- Normalizing factor = \(0.08 + 0.08 + 0.03 = 0.19\)

The probabilities will then be:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08/0.19 = 0.42,
  "computer science": 0.08/0.19 = 0.42,
  "business administration": 0.03/0.19 = 0.16
}
```

Thus, the final probabilities are:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.42,
  "computer science": 0.42,
  "business administration": 0.16
}
```
