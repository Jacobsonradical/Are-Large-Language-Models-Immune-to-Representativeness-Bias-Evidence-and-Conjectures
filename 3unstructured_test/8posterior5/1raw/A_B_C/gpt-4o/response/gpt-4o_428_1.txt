To apply Bayes' rule and compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis \( H \), we need the following components:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of evidence \( E \) given that hypothesis \( H \) is not true.

Bayes' rule formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be calculated as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Given these, we will make reasonable assumptions for each value based on the provided information and domain knowledge:

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): The likelihood that a random graduate student is in business administration. Given the numerous graduate students in various fields, let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Given that Adam is in business administration, how likely is it that he fits the personality sketch. Given the traits don't strongly align with typical business administration students, let’s assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the evidence given Adam is not in business administration. This is hard to pinpoint precisely, but let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \), since the traits might align better with other fields.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): Likelihood that a random graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. Let’s assume \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Given that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science, how likely is it that he fits the personality sketch. Given the traits perfectly align, let’s assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the evidence given Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \).

### Computer Science
- \( P(H) \): Likelihood that a random graduate student is in computer science. Given the popularity of the field, let’s assume \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Given that Adam is in computer science, how likely is it that he fits the personality sketch? Given the traits somewhat align, let’s assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the evidence given Adam is not in computer science. Assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \).

**Calculations:**

For **Business Administration**:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E_{BA}) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.8 \]
\[ P(E_{BA}) = 0.02 + 0.4 = 0.42 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.42} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx 0.048 \]

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(E_{AVS}) = 0.9 \cdot 0.1 + 0.4 \cdot 0.9 \]
\[ P(E_{AVS}) = 0.09 + 0.36 = 0.45 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{0.45} \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = 0.2 \]

For **Computer Science**:
\[ P(E_{CS}) = 0.3 \cdot 0.3 + 0.4 \cdot 0.7 \]
\[ P(E_{CS}) = 0.09 + 0.28 = 0.37 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.3}{0.37} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \approx 0.243 \]

So the final result is:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.048,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.243
}
