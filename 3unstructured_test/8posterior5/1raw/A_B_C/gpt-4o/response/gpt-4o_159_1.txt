To evaluate the probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Theorem, we need to understand:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch given he is in each field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch given he is not in each field.

Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the personality sketch E. Since we are comparing the probabilities for different fields, we do not need an absolute value for \( P(E) \); it will be normalized when comparing the different fields.

Let's evaluate each field:

1. **Business Administration**

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of being enrolled in Business Administration as a graduate student. I'll assume a generic prior without detailed statistics, so let's set \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch given Business Administration. Given the sketch mostly emphasizes nature, animals, and problem-solving with abstract concepts, this seems less typical for Business Administration fields. Let's set \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): This accounts for the likelihood of E given any other fields. Let's set \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.8 \).

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02 \]

2. **Computer Science**

- \( P(H) \): Assuming a similar generic prior probability of enrolling in Computer Science, let's set \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Given the empathy and love for animals, the sketch matches less perfectly with usual Computer Science features, though problem-solving could fit. Let's be moderately more probable and set \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Cleaving similar to Business Administration, let's use \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.8 \).

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.3 \times 0.2 = 0.06 \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

- \( P(H) \): This field seems particularly in tune given Adam's love for animals, nature, and empathy. Let's assume a similar prior, \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): The personality sketch fits very well, suggesting a definite inclination towards these sciences. Let's set \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Same general likelihood, so again \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.8 \).

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \times 0.2 = 0.16 \]

Given these calculations, let's present the results in normalized form:

{
  "business administration": 0.02 / (0.02 + 0.06 + 0.16)  ≈ 0.085,
  "computer science": 0.06 / (0.02 + 0.06 + 0.16) ≈ 0.255,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.16 / (0.02 + 0.06 + 0.16) ≈ 0.68
}

Rounding values:

{
  "business administration": 0.085,
  "computer science": 0.255,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.68
}
