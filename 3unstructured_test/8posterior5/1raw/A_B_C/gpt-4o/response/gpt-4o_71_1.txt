To compute the probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for each graduate field using Bayes' rule, let's denote:

- \(E\) as the personality sketch of Adam.
- \(H\) as the hypothesis that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.

Bayes' Rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We should estimate three key probabilities for each field:
1. \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam is in a particular field.
2. \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam is in that field.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam is not in that field.

However, because \(P(E)\) (the probability of observing the personality sketch) is the same denominator for all fields when calculating \(P(H|E)\), we can ignore it in our relative comparisons. We primarily need to focus on \(P(H) \cdot P(E|H)\) for each field.

Let's estimate these values:

### 1. Computer Science
- **\(P(H)\)**: Computer Science is a popular field. Let's estimate it as 0.2.
- **\(P(E|H)\)**: Since Adam's personality sketch shows a deep love for nature, plants, animals, and empathy, it seems less likely for a typical Computer Science student, possibly around 0.1.
- **\(P(E|\neg H)\)**: More typical among other non-CS students, let's estimate it as 0.5.

### 2. Business Administration
- **\(P(H)\)**: Business Administration is also a common field. Estimate it as 0.1.
- **\(P(E|H)\)**: The personality sketch does not strongly align with typical traits of business admin students, possibly 0.05.
- **\(P(E|\neg H)\)**: As before, a higher likelihood among other non-business students, estimate 0.4.

### 3. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **\(P(H)\)**: Less common but relevant given Adam's interests. Estimate it at 0.05.
- **\(P(E|H)\)**: Very likely given his sketch (love for nature, plants, animals), possibly around 0.9.
- **\(P(E|\neg H)\)**: Lower compared to this field. Estimate at 0.2.


### Calculation of \(P(H|E)\) for each field:
Using the posterior estimation proportionally:

1. **Computer Science**
\[ P(H|E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

2. **Business Administration**
\[ P(H|E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \propto 0.05 \cdot 0.1 = 0.005 \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
\[ P(H|E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \propto 0.9 \cdot 0.05 = 0.045 \]

Here are the results, normalized to indicate relative strengths:

{
  "computer science": \( \frac{0.02}{0.02+0.005+0.045} = \frac{0.02}{0.07} \approx 0.286 \),
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.005}{0.07} \approx 0.071 \),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{0.045}{0.07} \approx 0.643 \)
}

So, in a more comprehensive format:
{
  "computer science": 0.286,
  "business administration": 0.071,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.643
}
