Let's go through each field one by one, using Bayes' theorem, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll need an estimate for \(P(E)\), the overall probability of the personality sketch fitting any graduate student, but for simplicity, we'll assume it to be a common constant term in all fields, which means we can focus on \(P(H)\), \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E|\neg H)\).

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:

   - **P(H)**: The prior probability that a graduate student is in this field. Let's assume a moderate number of students enter this field. For simplicity, let's assume \(P(H)\) = 0.1.
   - **P(E|H)**: The likelihood that a student in this field has the described personality sketch. Given the description (interest in nature, animals, hard work), this is likely high. Let's assume \(P(E|H)\) = 0.8.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood that a student not in this field has the described personality sketch. This might be lower, as the interest in nature and animals could be less common. Let's assume \(P(E|\neg H)\) = 0.2.

   Using Bayes' rule:

   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{P(E)}
   \]

2. **Business Administration**:

   - **P(H)**: The prior probability that a graduate student is in this field. Business administration is popular, so let's say \(P(H)\) = 0.2.
   - **P(E|H)**: The likelihood that a student in this field has the described personality sketch. This is likely low, as the personality description does not align well. Let's assume \(P(E|H)\) = 0.1.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: This remains the same for all fields, so \(P(E|\neg H)\) = 0.2.

   Using Bayes' rule:

   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{P(E)}
   \]

3. **Computer Science**:

   - **P(H)**: The prior probability that a graduate student is in this field. Computer science is also very popular, so let's assume \(P(H)\) = 0.3.
   - **P(E|H)**: The likelihood that a student in this field has the described personality sketch. Given the interest in puzzles and abstract concepts, this is moderately high. Let's assume \(P(E|H)\) = 0.5.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: This remains the same for all fields, so \(P(E|\neg H)\) = 0.2.

   Using Bayes' rule:

   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \times 0.3}{P(E)}
   \]

Given we don't have \(P(E)\), we'll provide the relative scores:

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{agricultural and veterinary science} & : \frac{0.08}{P(E)} = 0.08 \\
\text{business administration} & : \frac{0.02}{P(E)} = 0.02 \\
\text{computer science} & : \frac{0.15}{P(E)} = 0.15
\end{align*}
\]

Normalizing these to add up to 1 for better comparison, we get:

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Sum of all scores} & = 0.08 + 0.02 + 0.15 = 0.25 \\
\text{Normalization factor} & = \frac{1}{0.25} = 4
\end{align*}
\]

Applying the normalization factor:

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{agricultural and veterinary science} & : 0.08 \times 4 = 0.32 \\
\text{business administration} & : 0.02 \times 4 = 0.08 \\
\text{computer science} & : 0.15 \times 4 = 0.60
\end{align*}
\]

So, the final probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.32,
  "business administration": 0.08,
  "computer science": 0.60
}
