To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in each of these fields (agricultural and veterinary science, business administration, and computer science) given his personality sketch (E), we can use Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule is as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence given the hypothesis is false.

Given Adam's personality sketch, we can make rough estimates for each of these probabilities. Let's make some educated estimates:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that any given graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. Assuming an average distribution:
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.05 \)
  
2. **P(E|H)**: Given that Adam enjoys nature, animals, has a high degree of empathy, and appreciates hard work, it is likely that he would be in this field:
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \)
   
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: If Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science, his personality traits align less strongly with other fields:
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \)

Plugging these into Bayes' rule, we get:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{(\text{Total probability})} \]

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that any given graduate student is in business administration. Assuming an average distribution:
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.15 \)
  
2. **P(E|H)**: Adam's traits do not strongly suggest business administration (though empathy and appreciation for hard work are positive traits for business):
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \)
   
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: If Adam is not in business administration, his personality fits even less closely with this field:
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.25 \)

Plugging these into Bayes' rule, we get:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.15}{(\text{Total probability})} \]

### Computer Science
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that any given graduate student is in computer science. Assuming an average distribution:
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.20 \)
  
2. **P(E|H)**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, which fit well with computer science:
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.7 \)
   
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: If Adam is not in computer science, his personality still might fit other fields lightly:
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \)

Plugging these into Bayes' rule, we get:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.20}{(\text{Total probability})} \]

To summarize, I'll provide rough values without calculating the total probability explicitly:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science":  \(\frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.9 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot (1 - 0.05)} \approx \frac{0.045}{0.225} \approx 0.20\),
  "business administration":  \(\frac{0.3 \cdot 0.15}{0.3 \cdot 0.15 + 0.25 \cdot (1 - 0.15)} \approx \frac{0.045}{0.2575} \approx 0.17\),
  "computer science":  \(\frac{0.7 \cdot 0.20}{0.7 \cdot 0.20 + 0.5 \cdot (1 - 0.20)} \approx \frac{0.14}{0.54} \approx 0.26\)
}

These values are rough estimates and should be refined with accurate prior and likelihood probabilities.
