To calculate the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each of the fields using Bayes' rule, which is formulated as: 

\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}, \]

we will need estimates for \( P(H) \), \( P(E | H) \), and \( P(E) \). Here's the plan:

1. \( P(H) \): Prior probability of enrolling in each of the fields.
2. \( P(E | H) \): Probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in the specific field \( H \).
3. \( P(E | \neg H) \): Probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in the specific field \( H \).

We then use these values to calculate \( P(H|E) \) through Bayes' rule.

To simplify, let's assume \( P(E) \) is similar across all fields as Adam must be enrolled in one of them. Therefore, we focus more on \( P(H) \) and \( P(E | H) \), and \( P(E | \neg H) \).

### Field: Computer Science

1. **\( P(H) \)**: Let's assume the prior probability of enrolling in Computer Science is \( 0.2 \). This is just an educated guess; actual distributions may vary.
2. **\( P(E | H) \)**: Given that Adam has a high intelligence and good abstract reasoning skills, this fits well with Computer Science. Given the personality sketch, we estimate \( P(E | H) \) to be \( 0.5 \).
3. **\( P(E | \neg H) \)**: Given a wide variety of other fields, many of which may not require abstract reasoning as strongly, we estimate \( P(E | \neg H) \) to be \( 0.3 \).

### Field: Business Administration

1. **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability of enrolling in Business Administration, let's assume, is \( 0.15 \).
2. **\( P(E | H) \)**: Business Administration does not particularly align with curiosity about nature and love for animals. Therefore, \( P(E | H) \) might be \( 0.2 \).
3. **\( P(E | \neg H) \)**: Similar to above, estimating \( P(E | \neg H) \) to be \( 0.3 \).

### Field: Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability for Agricultural and Veterinary Science is assumed to be \( 0.1 \).
2. **\( P(E | H) \)**: Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy, \( P(E | H) \) aligns well, so let's say \( 0.8 \).
3. **\( P(E | \neg H) \)**: Given Adam's personality, other fields are less fitting, so let's estimate this to be \( 0.25 \).

Using Bayes' rule to calculate \( P(H|E) \):

1. **Computer Science:**
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   Assuming \( P(E) \) cancels out as it's common:
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.5} = 0.2
   \]

2. **Business Administration:**
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   Assuming \( P(E) \) cancels out:
   \[
   P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{0.3} = 0.1
   \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   Assuming \( P(E) \) cancels out:
   \[
   P(\text{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.25} = 0.32
   \]
