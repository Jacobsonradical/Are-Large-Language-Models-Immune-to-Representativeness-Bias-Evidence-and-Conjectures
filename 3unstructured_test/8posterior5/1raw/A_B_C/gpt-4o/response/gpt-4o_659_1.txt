To compute \( P(H|E) \), or the probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field given his personality sketch, we will use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in that specific field.
- \( P(E) \): Total probability of Adam's personality sketch.

Since we are comparing among three fields only, we’ll consider their relative probabilities without normalizing (summing to 1 is not necessary). Here are the steps broken down:

1) Assign estimates to \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \):

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): Assume there is a moderate base rate of people studying agricultural and veterinary sciences given the overall number of graduate fields (~0.1 or 10%).
- \( P(E|H) \): High probability since Adam’s love for nature, plants, animals, and warm heart are very consistent with this field (~0.9 or 90%).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Assume his personality sketch fits moderately well with fields other than agricultural and veterinary sciences (~0.3 or 30%).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

### Computer Science
- \( P(H) \): Assume there's a higher base rate for computer science due to its popularity (~0.2 or 20%).
- \( P(E|H) \): Moderate probability as solving puzzles and abstract thinking are good fits, but less so for empathy and love for nature (~0.4 or 40%).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Higher than agricultural because he fits into more non-computer science fields than fit the exact traits of computer science (~0.5 or 50%).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): Assume a moderate base rate for business administration, around the popularity of agricultural science (~0.1 or 10%).
- \( P(E|H) \): Lower probability since his personality is less aligned with typical business traits (~0.2 or 20%).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Similar estimate as the one for agricultural and veterinary sciences as his traits could fit better in other fields more (~0.4 or 40%).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

### Calculations and Relative Probabilities:
We do not need the exact value of \( P(E) \); only the relative comparisons matter.

- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = 0.09 \div P(E) \)
- Computer Science: \( \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = 0.08 \div P(E) \)
- Business Administration: \( \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = 0.02 \div P(E) \)

Relative values normalized for comparison (as \( P(E) \) cancels out):

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.09,
  "computer science": 0.08,
  "business administration": 0.02
}

Therefore, based on these assumptions and calculations:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.09,
  "computer science": 0.08,
  "business administration": 0.02
}
```
