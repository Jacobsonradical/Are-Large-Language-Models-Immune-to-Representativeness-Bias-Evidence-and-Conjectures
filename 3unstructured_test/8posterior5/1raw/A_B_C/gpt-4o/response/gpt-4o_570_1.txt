To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in each of these fields (computer science, agricultural and veterinary science, and business administration) given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' rule. We need the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in each field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in each field.

Let's estimate these probabilities based on the personality sketch provided.

### Given Probabilities

- **P(H)** (Prior Probability)
  - I will assume a uniform distribution because no specific prior probabilities are provided:
    - \( P(\text{computer science}) = 1/3 \)
    - \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 1/3 \)
    - \( P(\text{business administration}) = 1/3 \)

- **P(E|H)** (Likelihood)
  - **Computer Science:**
    - Curiosity about nature: less relevant
    - Solving puzzles: highly relevant
    - Animals, empathy, warm heart: less relevant
    - Intelligence, abstract concepts: highly relevant
  - Given this mix, estimate \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \approx 0.4 \)

  - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
    - Curiosity about nature: highly relevant
    - Solving puzzles: less relevant but can be somewhat relevant
    - Animals, empathy, warm heart: highly relevant
    - Intelligence, abstract concepts: somewhat relevant
  - Given this mix, estimate \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.7 \)

  - **Business Administration:**
    - Curiosity about nature: less relevant
    - Solving puzzles: can be relevant
    - Animals, empathy, warm heart: less relevant 
    - Intelligence, abstract concepts: somewhat relevant
  - Given this mix, estimate \( P(E|\text{business administration}) \approx 0.2 \)

- **P(E|\neg H)** (Probability of E given NOT H)
  - Let's assume this is the average personality match for people not in each specific field:
    - \( P(E|\neg \text{computer science}) \approx 0.5 \)
    - \( P(E|\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.3 \)
    - \( P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) \approx 0.4 \)

### Bayes' Rule

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For each hypothesis (field), we compute \( P(H|E) \). Since \( P(E) \) is the same for all, we just need the numerator and can normalize afterward.

### Computation

- For **Computer Science**:
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{P(E)} \approx 0.133 \]

- For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{P(E)} \approx 0.233 \]

- For **Business Administration**:
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{P(E)} \approx 0.067 \]

Normalizing these values (scaling so they sum to 1) is not necessary for comparing relative probabilities as the sum can be greater than 1 if there are other fields.

Here's the answer as requested:

{
  "computer science": 0.133,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.233,
  "business administration": 0.067
}
