To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' Rule. Given \[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \], where:

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the given field before considering the personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is enrolled in the field H.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is not enrolled in the field H.

Let's consider \( P(E) \) to be a normalizing constant that would be the same across all fields, thus we won't compute it explicitly as it will cancel out when comparing ratios.

Here are the assignments with hypothetical probabilities:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): Agricultural and Veterinary Science fields tend to be less common graduate programs compared to fields like Computer Science. Let's assume a prior of \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given his love for nature, plants, animals, and empathy, there is a high likelihood he'd fit in this field. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Assuming that empathy and love for nature are traits less commonly found outside this field, let's assign \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).
   - Using Bayes’ Rule: \( P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

2. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): Computer Science is a common graduate program. Let's assume a prior of \( P(H) = 0.3 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given his intelligence, problem-solving ability, and enjoyment of puzzles, these traits align with Computer Science but not his interest in nature and animals. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Considering these traits are somewhat common in people outside this field as well, let's assign \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).
   - Using Bayes’ Rule: \( P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

3. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H) \): Business Administration is also a fairly common graduate program. Let's assume a prior of \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): His traits do not particularly mesh well with typical Business Administration attributes. Let’s assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given that these traits are largely uncommon in this field, let’s assign \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.8 \).
   - Using Bayes’ Rule: \( P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

Now, we compute the conditional probabilities:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \)

2. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H|E) \propto 0.4 \times 0.3 = 0.12 \)

3. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02 \)

After computing the proportional values, they are normalized to give actual probabilities.
