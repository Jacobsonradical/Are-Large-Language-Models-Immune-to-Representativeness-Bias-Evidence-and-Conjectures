To calculate the probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' Rule, we need the known probabilities \(P(H)\), \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E|\neg H)\). We'll assume some reasonable judgments for these probabilities based on the information given. Note that \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of a student being enrolled in a particular field, \(P(E|H)\) is the probability of Adam's characteristics given that he is in that field, and \(P(E|\neg H)\) is the probability of Adam's characteristics given that he is not in that particular field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **\(P(H)\)**: Given the overall distribution of graduate students by field, let's assume the prior probability is around 0.05 (5% of graduate students).
- **\(P(E|H)\)**: Adam's traits such as a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and empathy align very well with this field, so let's assume 0.8.
- **\(P(E|\neg H)\)**: The probability of Adam's characteristics given he is not in agricultural and veterinary science might be lower, let's say 0.2.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
\]

Calculating:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.95} = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.19} = \frac{0.04}{0.23} \approx 0.174
\]

### Business Administration

- **\(P(H)\)**: Assume around 0.1 (10% of graduate students).
- **\(P(E|H)\)**: Adam's personality traits do not strongly align with business administration, so let's assume 0.2.
- **\(P(E|\neg H)\)**: Similar to the general population of graduate students, so 0.4.

Calculating:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.4 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.36} = \frac{0.02}{0.38} \approx 0.053
\]

### Computer Science

- **\(P(H)\)**: Assume around 0.15 (15% of graduate students).
- **\(P(E|H)\)**: Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts align with computer science, so let's assume 0.6.
- **\(P(E|\neg H)\)**: The probability of Adam's characteristics given he is not in computer science could be moderate, let's say 0.35.

Calculating:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.15}{0.6 \cdot 0.15 + 0.35 \cdot 0.85} = \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.2975} = \frac{0.09}{0.3875} \approx 0.232
\]
