To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to judge the probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Bayes' rule states:

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} 
\]

Since we don't have exact values for these probabilities, we'll estimate them based on the personality sketch of Adam.

### Business Administration

- **P(H)**: Let's assume there are many fields of graduate study, and the probability that Adam is in any one specific field, such as business administration, is relatively low. Let's say \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
- **P(E|H)**: The personality traits described don’t strongly align with business administration. Curiosity about nature, deep empathy, and a love for animals are not typical traits associated with business administration. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The traits described are likely to be common or moderately common in some other fields, making \( P(E|\neg H) \) somewhat higher. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{0.5} = 0.04
\]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)**: Assuming the same initial low probability for any specific field, \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
- **P(E|H)**: The personality traits described perfectly align with this field. Curiosity about nature, empathy, and a love for animals are very relevant. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Given that these traits are less common in other fields, we assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.1}{0.2} = 0.45
\]

### Computer Science

- **P(H)**: As before, \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
- **P(E|H)**: Problem-solving and high intelligence align with computer science, but the love for nature and animals is less relevant. So, let’s estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.5 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Given that problem-solving and intelligence are fairly common in various fields, we’ll assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \times 0.1}{0.4} = 0.125
\]

Thus, the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.04,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.45,
  "computer science": 0.125
}
