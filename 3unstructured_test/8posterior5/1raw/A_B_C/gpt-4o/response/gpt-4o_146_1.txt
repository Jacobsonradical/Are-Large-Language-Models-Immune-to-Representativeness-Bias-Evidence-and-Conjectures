To begin, let's consider the three fields in relation to the subject's personality sketch \( E \).

### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
#### a. \( P(H) \) - Prior Probability
Let's assume the prior probability of a graduate student being in this field is relatively low, for example: \( P(H) = 0.10 \).

#### b. \( P(E|H) \) - Likelihood
Given the traits described, such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, the likelihood of Adam being in this field is high: \( P(E|H) = 0.80 \).

#### c. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - Likelihood of E given that H is false
The profile could reasonably fit other fields, so let's say it's less, such as: \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.30 \).

Using Bayes' Rule, we can calculate:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.10}{0.80 \cdot 0.10 + 0.30 \cdot 0.90} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.27} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \approx 0.2286 \]

### 2. Computer Science
#### a. \( P(H) \) - Prior Probability
Let's assume the prior probability of a graduate student being in this field is higher: \( P(H) = 0.20 \).

#### b. \( P(E|H) \) - Likelihood
The fit is not as strong as the first field, but still plausible given his intelligence and problem-solving skills: \( P(E|H) = 0.50 \).

#### c. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - Likelihood of E given that H is false
Similar to the previous reasoning: \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.30 \).

Using Bayes' Rule,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.50 \cdot 0.20}{0.50 \cdot 0.20 + 0.30 \cdot 0.80} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.10}{0.10 + 0.24} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.10}{0.34} \approx 0.2941 \]

### 3. Business Administration
#### a. \( P(H) \) - Prior Probability
Let's assume the prior probability of a graduate student being in this field is also moderate: \( P(H) = 0.20 \).

#### b. \( P(E|H) \) - Likelihood
The fit seems weaker compared to the previous fields: \( P(E|H) = 0.20 \).

#### c. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - Likelihood of E given that H is false
Maintaining the previous logic: \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.30 \).

Using Bayes' Rule,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.20 \cdot 0.20}{0.20 \cdot 0.20 + 0.30 \cdot 0.80} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.24} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.28} \approx 0.1429 \]
