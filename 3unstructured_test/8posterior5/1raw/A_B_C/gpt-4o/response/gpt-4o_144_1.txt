Sure, let's apply Bayes' rule to estimate the probabilities for each field using the provided information:

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll need the following components for each field:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he was enrolled in the field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he was not enrolled in the field.
4. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of Adam's personality sketch. Since we're considering multiple non-mutually exclusive fields, \( P(E) \) can be simplified if relative comparisons are sufficient.

First, let's assign reasonable values to these probabilities based on the sketch:

### Business Administration
#### \(P(H)\): The prior for business administration enrollment, given it's a common field, let's assume:
\[ P(H_{\text{business}}) \approx 0.2 \]

#### \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood that Adam's personality matches someone in business administration. Since interest in nature, puzzles, and animals doesn't strongly fit this field:
\[ P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \approx 0.1 \]

#### \(P(E|\neg H)\): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he was not in business administration. Considering multiple other fields align better:
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}}) \approx 0.5 \]

### Computer Science
#### \(P(H)\): The prior for computer science enrollment. This is also quite common:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.25 \]

#### \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood that Adamâ€™s personality matches someone in computer science, given his intelligence and puzzle-solving interests:
\[ P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.4 \]

#### \(P(E|\neg H)\): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he was not in computer science; other fields might also align well:
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.6 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
#### \(P(H)\): The prior for agricultural and veterinary science enrollment, less common compared to business or CS:
\[ P(H_{\text{agri/vet}}) \approx 0.1 \]

#### \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood that Adam's personality matches someone in agricultural and veterinary science, given his nature curiosity and love for animals:
\[ P(E|H_{\text{agri/vet}}) \approx 0.6 \]

#### \(P(E|\neg H)\): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he was not in agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{agri/vet}}) \approx 0.5 \]

### Application of Bayes' Rule
Since \( P(E) \) is factored as a constant and applied equally across all fields in relative comparison, we can focus on the numerator only for calculation:

#### Business Administration
\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}}) \]
\[ \approx 0.1 \cdot 0.2 \]
\[ = 0.02 \]

#### Computer Science
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) \]
\[ \approx 0.4 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ = 0.10 \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H_{\text{agri/vet}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{agri/vet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agri/vet}}) \]
\[ \approx 0.6 \cdot 0.1 \]
\[ = 0.06 \]

Finally, after normalizing to obtain probabilities:
1. Sum = 0.02 + 0.10 + 0.06 = 0.18
2. Normalize by dividing each by 0.18:

\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) \approx \frac{0.02}{0.18} = 0.11 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx \frac{0.10}{0.18} = 0.56 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agri/vet}}|E) \approx \frac{0.06}{0.18} = 0.33 \]

The values will be:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.11,
  "computer science": 0.56,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.33
}
```

These values represent the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in the respective fields given his personality sketch.
