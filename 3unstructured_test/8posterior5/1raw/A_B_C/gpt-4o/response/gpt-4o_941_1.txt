To compute \(P(H|E)\) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate the prior probability \(P(H)\), the likelihood \(P(E|H)\), and the likelihood under the complement \(P(E|\neg H)\). Then we can calculate the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\) as follows:

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assuming that the prior probabilities \(P(H)\) for all fields are equal, we can focus on the relative likelihoods \(P(E|H)\) and \(P(E|\neg H)\) to judge the relative scores of \(P(H|E)\) across different fields.

Given Adam's interests and personality traits, we can hypothesize as follows:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \(P(H)\): Assuming equal prior across fields, we start with a neutral prior. Let's use 1 for simplicity.
   - \(P(E|H)\): High, because Adam has a strong curiosity about nature, a love for animals, an understanding of hard work, and empathy, all of which align well with this field. Let's estimate it as 0.9.
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\): Lower since other fields may not align as well. Let's assume 0.2.

2. **Business Administration:**
   - \(P(H)\): Neutral prior. We start with 1.
   - \(P(E|H)\): Low, because Adam's traits do not strongly align with business administration, especially in terms of empathy for animals or curiosity about nature. Let's estimate it as 0.1.
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\): Higher, maybe some interest in nature but less specific alignment. Let's assume 0.5.

3. **Computer Science:**
   - \(P(H)\): Neutral prior. We start with 1.
   - \(P(E|H)\): Moderate, considering his high intelligence and interest in solving puzzles, but less alignment with nature and animals. Let's assume 0.5.
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\): Moderate, similar reasons. Let's assume 0.4.

Now, we will apply Bayes' rule to get an indication of \(P(H|E)\):

\[P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 1}{0.9 \cdot 1 + 0.1 \cdot 1 + 0.5 \cdot 1} = \frac{0.9}{1.5} = 0.6\]
\[P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 1}{0.9 \cdot 1 + 0.1 \cdot 1 + 0.5 \cdot 1} = \frac{0.1}{1.5} = 0.067\]
\[P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 1}{0.9 \cdot 1 + 0.1 \cdot 1 + 0.5 \cdot 1} = \frac{0.5}{1.5} = 0.333\]

Thus, the results are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.067,
  "computer science": 0.333
}
