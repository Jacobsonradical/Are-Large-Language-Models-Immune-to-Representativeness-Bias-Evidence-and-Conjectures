To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields based on the personality sketch provided, we can follow these steps:

1. Assign prior probabilities \(P(H)\) for each field. These priors represent our initial beliefs about the likelihood of Adam being in each field before considering the personality sketch.
2. Determine the likelihood \(P(E|H)\), which is the probability of observing the personality sketch if Adam is in the given field.
3. Determine the likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\), which is the probability of observing the personality sketch if Adam is not in the given field.
4. Use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\).

Assuming we do not know much about graduate specialization distribution and treating them equally, we can assign equal priors initially. Let's assume \(P(H) = 1/3\) for each field.

The likelihoods \(P(E|H)\) and \(P(E|\neg H)\) will be based on how well the personality sketch fits each field:

- For **business administration**:
  - \(P(E|H)\): Business students might not necessarily fit the personality sketch perfectly (curiosity about nature, love for animals), so a lower likelihood is assigned.
  - \(P(E|\neg H)\): This is relatively higher since his traits do not align strongly with this field.

- For **computer science**:
  - \(P(E|H)\): Computer science students can be quiet, good at solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts, so this fits fairly well.
  - \(P(E|\neg H)\): This is more neutral since some traits fit this field.

- For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
  - \(P(E|H)\): This field closely aligns with Adam’s interests in nature and love for animals.
  - \(P(E|\neg H)\): This is lower as his traits strongly align with this field.

After deciding on the likelihood estimates, we use Bayes’ rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \(P(E)\) is the normalization factor across all hypothesis.

To simplify calculations, we can assume generic values for ease of comparison (and these don't need to be completely precise but should reflect the above logic):

Let's assume:
- \(P(E|H_{\text{business administration}})\) ≈ 0.2
- \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{business administration}})\) ≈ 0.8
- \(P(E|H_{\text{computer science}})\) ≈ 0.6
- \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{computer science}})\) ≈ 0.4
- \(P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})\) ≈ 0.9
- \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})\) ≈ 0.1

Since \(P(H) = 1/3\) for each and assuming the prior likelihood weight cancels out uniformly, dropping \( \frac{1}{P(E)} \) which is normalization constant:

The calculation of each posterior without the exact p(E):

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.2 * \frac{1}{3}}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.6 * \frac{1}{3}}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.9 * \frac{1}{3}}{P(E)} \]

Relative posteriors (proportional based scores):

{
  "business administration": 0.2 / (0.2 + 0.6 + 0.9) = 0.2/1.7 ≈ 0.118,
  "computer science": 0.6 / (0.2 + 0.6 + 0.9) = 0.6/1.7 ≈ 0.353,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.9 / (0.2 + 0.6 + 0.9) = 0.9/1.7 ≈ 0.529
}

Final answers:

{
  "business administration": 0.118,
  "computer science": 0.353,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.529
