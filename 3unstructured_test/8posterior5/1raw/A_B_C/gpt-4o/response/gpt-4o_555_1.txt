To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in each specified field, we can use Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, because we are comparing hypotheses and do not have the value for \(P(E)\), we will use proportional reasoning. Here's an illustrative breakdown of the process:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - \(P(H)\): The prior probability for a graduate student to be in Computer Science is perhaps average since it's a common field.
   - \(P(E|H)\): Adam's profile (curiosity about nature, love for animals) doesn't strongly fit the stereotype of a Computer Science student, although his intelligence and puzzle-solving skills do align somewhat.
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of E given Adam is not in Computer Science remains based on his interests in nature and animals, suggesting a higher value.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \(P(H)\): The prior probability for a graduate student to be in Agricultural and Veterinary Science might be lower due to fewer students in this field.
   - \(P(E|H)\): Adam's profile matches well with this field, considering his love for nature, plants, and animals.
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of E given Adam is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is low since his traits strongly suggest this field.

3. **Business Administration**:
   - \(P(H)\): The prior probability for a graduate student to be in Business Administration is relatively high since it's popular.
   - \(P(E|H)\): Adam's profile doesn't strongly match that of a typical Business Administration student.
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of E given Adam is not in Business Administration might be higher due to his distinct interests.

Using these qualitative judgments, we can provide relative probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

Explanation:
- The value for `agricultural and veterinary science` is relatively higher because Adam's interests and personality strongly align with this field.
- `Computer science` has a moderate probability, boosted slightly by Adam's intelligence and puzzle-solving skills but dampened by his strong leanings towards nature.
- `Business administration` has a lower probability given the mismatch with Adam's interests and empathy.
