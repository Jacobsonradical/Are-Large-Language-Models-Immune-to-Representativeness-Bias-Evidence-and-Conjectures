To determine \( P(H|E) \) for each field through Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the fields are:

1. Computer Science
2. Business Administration
3. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

We make a few reasonable assumptions about the fields and how well Adam's personality sketch (E) matches each one.

### Probabilities:
- Let’s assume graduate students distribution as follows (P(H)):
  - Computer Science: \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.3 \)
  - Business Administration: \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.2 \)
  - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.1 \)
  - Other fields: \( P(\text{others}) = 0.4 \)

- Conditional probabilities \( P(E|H) \) based on fit to the personality sketch:
  - For Computer Science:
    - High intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts fit, but there is no specific match with curiosity about plants or empathy and love for animals.
    - \( P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.4 \)
  - For Business Administration:
    - While his intelligence might fit, there's little to suggest a match with his other characteristics.
    - \( P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.2 \)
  - For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
    - A very strong match due to his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy.
    - \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.8 \)

- Conditional probabilities \( P(E|\neg H) \):
  - This represents how likely it is that the personality sketch fits for students in other fields.
  - Since “others” is 0.4 probability:
    - \( P(E|\neg H) = \frac{P(E) - P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(\neg H)} \)
    - Assume P(E) is more likely in other fields by default. Reasonably, let's pick:
    - \( P(E|\neg \text{computer science}) = 0.4 \)
    - \( P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) = 0.4 \)
    - \( P(E|\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.4 \)

Bayes’ rule gives us:

1. For Computer Science:
   \[
   P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)}
   \]
2. For Business Administration:
   \[
   P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)}
   \]
3. For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
   \[
   P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)}
   \]

Given this approach matches structure of \( E \) properly, let's assume \( P(E) \approx 0.45 \).

Thus, 
\[
P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.3}{0.45} \approx 0.267
\]
\[
P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.2}{0.45} \approx 0.089
\]
\[
P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.45} \approx 0.178
\]

### Computed Values:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.267,
  "business administration": 0.089,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.178
}
```

These probabilities give us insights into which field Adam is more likely to be enrolled in, given the personality sketch provided.
