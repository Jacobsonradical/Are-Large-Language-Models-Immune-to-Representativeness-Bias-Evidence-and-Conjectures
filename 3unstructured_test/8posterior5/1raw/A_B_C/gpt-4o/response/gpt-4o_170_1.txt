To estimate the probabilities using Bayes' Rule, we need to evaluate the following:

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field of study.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam's personality sketch is observed given that he is enrolled in that field.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that Adam's personality sketch is observed given that he is **not** enrolled in that field.

Finally, we'll use Bayes' Rule to find **P(H|E)**, which is the posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch.

### Estimations
- **P(H)**: This is context-dependent and can be difficult to estimate without specific data. For simplicity, we can assume equal priors initially or use typical enrollment data. Let's use typical U.S. graduate enrollment data for these fields:
  - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 5%
  - Computer Science: 15%
  - Business Administration: 25%
  - Others/Unknown: 55%

- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam's sketch given the field. We need to consider how well the personality traits fit the typical student in each field.
  - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: High (0.8) - Adam's love for nature, animals, and plants aligns well with this field.
  - Computer Science: Moderate (0.4) - His intelligence and puzzle-solving skills align well, but empathy and love for animals do not fit as naturally.
  - Business Administration: Low (0.2) - Business students need to be empathetic, but other traits, such as love for nature and animals, are less relevant.

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in that field. This could be quite broad.
  - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Low-Moderate (0.2)
  - Computer Science: Moderate (0.4)
  - Business Administration: Moderate-High (0.6)

### Calculations
Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's compute these step-by-step for each field.

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H) = 0.05 \]
\[ P(E|H) = 0.8 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \]

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.05) + (0.2 \times 0.95) = 0.04 + 0.19 = 0.23 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.23} = \frac{0.04}{0.23} \approx 0.174 \]

#### Computer Science
\[ P(H) = 0.15 \]
\[ P(E|H) = 0.4 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \]

\[ P(E) = (0.4 \times 0.15) + (0.4 \times 0.85) = 0.06 + 0.34 = 0.40 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.15}{0.40} = \frac{0.06}{0.40} = 0.15 \]

#### Business Administration
\[ P(H) = 0.25 \]
\[ P(E|H) = 0.2 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \]

\[ P(E) = (0.2 \times 0.25) + (0.6 \times 0.75) = 0.05 + 0.45 = 0.50 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.25}{0.50} = \frac{0.05}{0.50} = 0.10 \]

### Summary
So, the probability of Adam being enrolled in each field given his personality sketch is:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.174,
  "computer science": 0.15,
  "business administration": 0.10
}
```
Please note that these probabilities are not normalized to sum to 1, as there are other fields beyond the three considered here.
