To compute the probabilities, let’s follow these steps:

1. **Define the Prior Probabilities (P(H))**: These are our initial beliefs about the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in each field before considering the personality sketch.

2. **Likelihood (P(E|H))**: This is the probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is in a particular field.

3. **Likelihood (P(E|¬H))**: This is the probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is not in a particular field.

4. **Use Bayes Rule to Compute Posterior Probability (P(H|E))**: \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \)

Since we don't have precise numerical values, I’ll make qualitative judgments based on the information provided.

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- P(H): Moderate (e.g., 0.2), considering Adam's love for nature and animals.
- P(E|H): High (e.g., 0.9), as the personality sketch fits well with this field.
- P(E|¬H): Low-Moderate (e.g., 0.2), as such individuals might be less frequent in non-related fields.

**Business Administration:**
- P(H): Moderate-Low (e.g., 0.1), seems less likely given Adam’s traits.
- P(E|H): Low (e.g., 0.1), since his personality sketch doesn’t align well with typical traits for this field.
- P(E|¬H): Moderate (e.g., 0.3), these traits might appear at a moderate rate in the general population not in business administration.

**Computer Science:**
- P(H): Moderate (e.g., 0.2), plausible given Adam's high intelligence and interest in abstract concepts.
- P(E|H): Moderate-High (e.g., 0.7), as his traits can suit a computer scientist, especially the problem-solving aspect.
- P(E|¬H): Moderate (e.g., 0.3), since these personality traits might also appear in other scientific disciplines.

Using Bayes' Rule for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]

2. **Business Administration:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \]

3. **Computer Science:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) (probability of observing Adam's traits regardless of field) remains constant for comparison:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "\(\frac{0.18}{P(E)} \approx 0.18\)",
  "business administration": "\(\frac{0.01}{P(E)} \approx 0.01\)",
  "computer science": "\(\frac{0.14}{P(E)} \approx 0.14\)"
}

If you can assume \( P(E) \) as a normalizing constant which ensures probabilities sum to 1 across all possible fields, you can fine-tune these values accordingly. For this sketch, the prominent fit is seen in "agricultural and veterinary science," followed by "computer science," and least likely "business administration."
