To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we will use Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \):

For the context of this problem:
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in the specified field.

### Hypotheses:
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS)**
   - \( P(H) \): Let's assume the probability that an average graduate student is in AVS is reasonably low. Suppose \( 0.05 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's strong empathy, deep love for animals, and genuine curiosity about nature and plants, this probability is high. We can use \( 0.8 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Assuming that if Adam is not in AVS, the likelihood of him still displaying such a personality sketch is lower. Suppose \( 0.2 \).

2. **Computer Science (CS)**
   - \( P(H) \): The probability that an average graduate student is in CS might be higher due to the popularity of the field. Suppose \( 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's description, solving puzzles aligns well, but the deep love for animals and nature might not align as closely. Thus, \( 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): If Adam is not in CS, other fields are likely. Let's set \( 0.7 \).

3. **Business Administration (BA)**
   - \( P(H) \): The probability of enrollment in BA could be similar to CS due to its popularity. Suppose \( 0.25 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The personality sketch provided might not fit BA perfectly, so letâ€™s set this as \( 0.05 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): If Adam is not in BA, it is more likely he fits this personality sketch and not business administration. Suppose \( 0.6 \).

### Calculation:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS)**
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
        = (0.8 \times 0.05) + (0.2 \times 0.95)
        = 0.04 + 0.19
        = 0.23
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
          = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.23}
          = \frac{0.04}{0.23}
          \approx 0.174
   \]

2. **Computer Science (CS)**
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
        = (0.1 \times 0.2) + (0.7 \times 0.8)
        = 0.02 + 0.56
        = 0.58
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
          = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.58}
          = \frac{0.02}{0.58}
          \approx 0.034
   \]

3. **Business Administration (BA)**
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
        = (0.05 \times 0.25) + (0.6 \times 0.75)
        = 0.0125 + 0.45
        = 0.4625
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
          = \frac{0.05 \times 0.25}{0.4625}
          = \frac{0.0125}{0.4625}
          \approx 0.027
   \]
