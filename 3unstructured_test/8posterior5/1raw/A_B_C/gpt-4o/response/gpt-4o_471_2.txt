To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) through Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for each field, we can compare \( P(H|E) \) directly using the numerator \( P(E|H)P(H) \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

**P(H) - Prior probability**:
Assume an equal likelihood across all fields without additional background information. There's also a reasonable likelihood for graduate students pursuing this field.

\[ P(H_{ag}) \approx 0.2 \] (example prior, depending on total graduate programs)

**P(E|H) - Likelihood**:
Adam's traits of curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy fit well with this field.

\[ P(E|H_{ag}) \approx 0.9 \]

**P(E|\neg H) - Likelihood outside this field**:
Likelihood that someone with Adam's personality is in any field other than agricultural and veterinary science:

\[ P(E|\neg H_{ag}) \approx 0.6 \]

### Business Administration

**P(H) - Prior probability**:
Given the general popularity of business administration among graduate students, assume it is relatively high.

\[ P(H_{ba}) \approx 0.25 \]

**P(E|H) - Likelihood**:
Adam’s traits do not strongly align with business administration (analysis, puzzles may possibly align but not the nature curiosity, empathy).

\[ P(E|H_{ba}) \approx 0.2 \]

**P(E|\neg H) - Likelihood outside this field**:
Likelihood that someone with Adam's personality is in any field other than business administration.

\[ P(E|\neg H_{ba}) \approx 0.8 \]

### Computer Science

**P(H) - Prior probability**:
This is a popular field for graduate students with highly intelligent traits and abstract thinking abilities.

\[ P(H_{cs}) \approx 0.25 \]

**P(E|H) - Likelihood**:
Though the subject’s love for animals and nature doesn't align perfectly, his puzzle-solving, intelligence, and abstract thinking do fit.

\[ P(E|H_{cs}) \approx 0.6 \]

**P(E|\neg H) - Likelihood outside this field**:
Likelihood that someone with Adam’s personality traits is in any field other than computer science.

\[ P(E|\neg H_{cs}) \approx 0.5 \]

### Applying Bayes' Rule

Now compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H_{field}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{field}) \cdot P(H_{field})}{P(E)} \]

Given \( P(E) \) is common and cancels out in comparison:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = 0.18 \),
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{P(E)} = 0.05 \),
  "computer science": \( \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.25}{P(E)} = 0.15 \)
}

So the proportional probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( 0.18 \approx 0.6 \),
  "business administration": \( 0.05 \approx 0.08 \),
  "computer science": \( 0.15 \approx 0.5 \)
}

Note: To normalize and ensure that total probabilities add up to 1 for precision, more fields need to be added. However, within the consideration of just these fields, the above results provide a proportional comparison. These values are based on assumptions and should be adjusted with real data whenever available.
