To apply Bayes' rule, we use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence.

Given the personality sketch of Adam, we will make reasonable assumptions about \( P(H) \) (the prior probability Adam was enrolled in each specific field), \( P(E|H) \) (the probability the personality sketch fits given enrollment in each field), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) (the probability the personality sketch fits given enrollment in a different field).

We assume some typical prior probabilities:
- Computer Science: \( P(H_\text{CS}) \approx 0.3 \)
- Business Administration: \( P(H_\text{BA}) \approx 0.2 \)
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( P(H_\text{AVS}) \approx 0.1 \)

For the likelihoods of the evidence given the hypothesis, we can estimate:
- \( P(E|H_\text{CS}) \approx 0.2 \) (as his warm heart and empathy are less typical traits for computer science, despite the intelligence and problem-solving skills)
- \( P(E|H_\text{BA}) \approx 0.1 \) (as his deep love for animals and nature seems less relevant to business administration)
- \( P(E|H_\text{AVS}) \approx 0.8 \) (as his love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work align well with this field)

To estimate the probabilities of the evidence under these hypotheses, we need to approximate \( P(E) \). This can be calculated using:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_\text{CS}) \cdot P(H_\text{CS}) + P(E|H_\text{BA}) \cdot P(H_\text{BA}) + P(E|H_\text{AVS}) \cdot P(H_\text{AVS}) + P(E|\neg \{H_\text{CS}, H_\text{BA}, H_\text{AVS}\}) \cdot P(\neg \{H_\text{CS}, H_\text{BA}, H_\text{AVS}\}) \]

However, for simplicity, we will approximate it assuming the other fields combined have a relatively low impact. We'll assume:

- \( P(E|\neg H_\text{CS}) \approx 0.5 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_\text{BA}) \approx 0.5 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_\text{AVS}) \approx 0.5 \)

Thus, using Bayes' theorem:
- \( P(H|E)_\text{CS} = \frac{0.2 \times 0.3}{0.2 \times 0.3 + 0.1 \times 0.2 + 0.8 \times 0.1 + 0.5 \times 0.4} \approx \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.02 + 0.08 + 0.20} \approx \frac{0.06}{0.36} \approx 0.17 \)
- \( P(H|E)_\text{BA} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.2 \times 0.3 + 0.1 \times 0.2 + 0.8 \times 0.1 + 0.5 \times 0.4} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.36} \approx 0.06 \)
- \( P(H|E)_\text{AVS} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.2 \times 0.3 + 0.1 \times 0.2 + 0.8 \times 0.1 + 0.5 \times 0.4} \approx \frac{0.08}{0.36} \approx 0.22 \)

So,

  "computer science": 0.17,
  "business administration": 0.06,
