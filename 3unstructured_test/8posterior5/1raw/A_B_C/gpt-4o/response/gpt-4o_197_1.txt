To solve this problem using Bayes' theorem, we need to evaluate the following probabilities for each field:

- \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood of Adam having E's characteristics given that he was enrolled in that field.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The likelihood of Adam having E's characteristics given that he was not enrolled in that field.
- \(P(H|E)\): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field given his personality sketch.

By Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We can break this down step by step for each field:

1. **Business Administration**

- \(P(H)\): Let's assume the prior probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in business administration is moderate, say \(0.2\).
- \(P(E|H)\): The probability that Adam displays E's characteristics if he is in business administration might be lower as business administration typically isn't focused on nature, animals, or empathy. Let’s approximate it as \(0.1\).
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): This would be the sum of the probabilities of Adam having E's characteristics across all other fields. Given that the other fields potentially align better with Adam's characteristics, we'll estimate this as \(0.4\).

Using these estimates:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]

To normalize, let's compute the value for normalization:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.1 \times 0.2 + 0.4 \times 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.32 = 0.34 \]

Now:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.34} \approx 0.0588 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

- \(P(H)\): Assume a prior probability reflecting that this field is less common than business administration, say \(0.1\).
- \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood is high since it matches well with Adam's interest in nature, empathy, and love for animals. Let’s estimate it as \(0.7\).
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): Same as before, \(0.4\).

Using these estimates:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.1}{0.34} \approx 0.2059 \]

3. **Computer Science**

- \(P(H)\): Let’s assume the initial prior probability is moderate, say \(0.2\).
- \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood might be higher than business administration due to Adam's intelligence and problem-solving skills, but not as high as agricultural sciences. Say \(0.3\).
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): Same, \(0.4\).

Using these estimates:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{0.34} \approx 0.1765 \]

Summarizing these results, we get:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0588,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.2059,
  "computer science": 0.1765
}
