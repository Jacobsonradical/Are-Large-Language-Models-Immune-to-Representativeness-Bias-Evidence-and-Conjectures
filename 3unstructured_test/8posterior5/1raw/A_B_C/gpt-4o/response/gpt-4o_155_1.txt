To solve this, let's break down the probabilities involved for each field. We'll start with the base probabilities \(P(H)\), the likelihoods \(P(E|H)\), and the complements \(P(E|\neg H)\). Using Bayes' Rule, we can then compute the posterior probabilities \(P(H|E)\).

Bayes' Rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that \(P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)\), and assuming the base rates for each field, we can break this down:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H)**: This is the prior probability or the base rate that any given graduate student might be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Suppose this is approximately 0.05 (5%) based on general statistics.
2. **P(E|H)**: Given Adam’s background and interests, the likelihood that his personality sketch matches someone in this field is high, say 0.8 (80%).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: This is the likelihood that the personality sketch matches given that Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Because his personality could fit into other fields but less so, we might estimate this at 0.2 (20%).

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)**: Let's assume the base rate for business administration among graduate students is higher, say 0.2 (20%).
2. **P(E|H)**: Given Adam’s interests and personality, which do not strongly align with business administration’s typical focus, we might set this to 0.1 (10%).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: If Adam is not in business administration but in some other field, the personality sketch fitting him would still be around 0.2 (20%).

### Computer Science
1. **P(H)**: Assuming computer science also has a relatively high base rate among graduate students, say 0.15 (15%).
2. **P(E|H)**: While Adam has high intelligence and abstract thinking ability (which fits computer science), his strong nature and animal interests are less typical. We can set this at 0.3 (30%).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of his personality matching other fields can be considered around the same as the general mismatch, maybe 0.2 (20%).

Now, let's calculate \(P(H|E)\) for each:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll use a simplified combined \(P(E)\) approach assuming each field is fairly independent. Given the weights, \(P(E)\) might be approximated as weighted considering all hypotheses and their \(\neg\).

Let's denote:
\[ P(E)\approx 0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.95 + 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.2 \cdot 0.8 + 0.3 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 \]

Simplify calculations (normally these base rates and likelihood details would need greater precision):

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \(0.8 \times 0.05 \div 0.31=0.129\)
}

{
  "business administration": \(0.1 \times 0.2 \div 0.31 =0.065\)
}

{
  "computer science": \(0.3 \times 0.15 \div 0.31=0.129\)
}

ans :

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science":  0.258,
  "business administration": 0.065,
  "computer science": 0.129
}
