Sure, let's evaluate each field (H) based on the given personality sketch (E) of Adam using Bayes' rule. The Bayes' rule states:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

### 1. Business Administration

**P(H):** The probability of being enrolled in business administration without any other information might be moderate as it's a popular field. Let's assume:
\[
P(H) = 0.2
\]

**P(E|H):** Given E, it seems less likely that someone with Adam's interests and personality is enrolled in business administration. The interest in nature, animals, solving puzzles, and empathy might not align well with the typical stereotype of a business administration student. Let's assume:
\[
P(E|H) = 0.1
\]

**P(E|¬H):** If Adam is not enrolled in business administration, the probability of E would be slightly higher given the other fields (agricultural/veterinary science and computer science) are more aligned with his interests. Let's assume this is more probable:
\[
P(E|¬H) = 0.9
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)}
\]

### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

**P(H):** The probability of being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science without any other information might be lower than business administration, as it is a more specialized field. Let's assume:
\[
P(H) = 0.05
\]

**P(E|H):** Given E, it's very likely someone enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science would display Adam's characteristics -- curiosity about plants, empathy, love for animals etc. Let's assume:
\[
P(E|H) = 0.7
\]

**P(E|¬H):** If Adam is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, the probability of E would be lower compared to being in this field. This is how he matches. Let's assume:
\[
P(E|¬H) = 0.3
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)}
\]

### 3. Computer Science

**P(H):** The probability of being enrolled in computer science without any other information might be moderate, as it is a popular and large field. Let's assume:
\[
P(H) = 0.2
\]

**P(E|H):** Given E, it's reasonably probable someone enrolled in computer science would display Adam's characteristics -- high intelligence, enjoyment of puzzles, understanding abstract concepts. Let's assume:
\[
P(E|H) = 0.6
\]

**P(E|¬H):** If Adam is not enrolled in computer science, the probability of E would be balanced depending on the field, but can be fairly similar for other technical or empathy-related fields. Let's assume:
\[
P(E|¬H) = 0.4
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)}
\]

### Summary of Probabilities

Given the above assumptions, the probabilities P(H|E) for each field can be compared proportionally as follows (proportional to the computation):

\[
\text{business administration} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)}
\]

\[
\text{agricultural and veterinary science} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)}
\]

\[
\text{computer science} = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)}
\]

Given these proportional relationships (not exact values due to \(P(E)\)), we can infer relative likely probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.035,
  "computer science": 0.12
}
```

These values reflect comparative likelihoods and should be interpreted with \(P(E)\) cancelling out common factors in denominator.
