To answer this question using Bayes' Theorem, we need to calculate the probability that Adam was enrolled in each field given the personality sketch. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability Adam was enrolled in a given field (H) given the personality sketch (E).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch given Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the personality sketch, which can be expanded as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's estimate each component for the given fields:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   The proportion of graduate students in agricultural and veterinary science is relatively low compared to all graduate fields, but given Adam's interests, it's still plausible.
   \[ P(H) \approx 0.10 \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and warm heart, it fits well with someone in the agricultural and veterinary sciences.
   \[ P(E|H) \approx 0.90 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   Given how distinct these qualities are for this field, only a small number of people outside this field would exhibit these.
   \[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.20 \]

### Business Administration:
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   Business administration is a common field among graduate students, but Adam's personality sketch doesn't strongly align with typical interests for this field.
   \[ P(H) \approx 0.15 \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   While empathy and intelligence are valuable traits, the rest of Adam's personality traits don't strongly indicate business administration.
   \[ P(E|H) \approx 0.30 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   These traits are reasonably common among people outside the business field as well.
   \[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.50 \]

### Computer Science:
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   Computer science is a popular field. Adam's interest in puzzles and intelligence align with typical computer science students, but affinity for nature and animals is less common.
   \[ P(H) \approx 0.20 \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   While problem-solving aligns well, the other aspects like empathy, nature, and animals are less common in computer science.
   \[ P(E|H) \approx 0.40 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   These traits are fairly common among the general population outside computer science.
   \[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.60 \]

Now we can compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' theorem:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.90 \times 0.10}{(0.90 \times 0.10 + 0.20 \times 0.90)} \approx \frac{0.09}{0.27} = 0.33 \]

### Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.30 \times 0.15}{(0.30 \times 0.15 + 0.50 \times 0.85)} \approx \frac{0.045}{0.475} = 0.095 \]

### Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.40 \times 0.20}{(0.40 \times 0.20 + 0.60 \times 0.80)} \approx \frac{0.08}{0.56} = 0.143 \]

In summary:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.33,
  "business administration": 0.095,
  "computer science": 0.143
