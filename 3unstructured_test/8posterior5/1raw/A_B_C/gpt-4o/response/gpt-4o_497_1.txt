To apply Bayes' rule, we need to use the formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of being in a specific field (H).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of having the personality sketch (E) given that Adam is enrolled in the specific field (H).
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of having the personality sketch (E).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of having the personality sketch (E) given that Adam is not in the specific field (H).

Since the exact prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field aren't given, I'll assume a uniform prior for simplicity. This means we consider each field equally likely before we examine Adam's personality sketch. Let us denote this uniform prior by \( P(H) = 1/3 \).

Next, let's estimate the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field based on Adam's personality traits matching the typical characteristics associated with the fields:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(E|H) \): High, as Adam's traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals) are well aligned with this field.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Lower, since these traits are less likely outside this field.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(E|H) \): Low, as Adam's personality traits (solving puzzles, strong empathy, love for animals) don't strongly align with business administration.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Higher, since these traits are quite rare in this field but common outside.

3. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(E|H) \): Moderate, as the traits (solving puzzles, high intelligence) can align with Computer Science, although the love for nature and animals is less typical.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Moderate, since these traits are somewhat common in but also outside this field.

Now, we'll calculate \( P(H|E) \) using these qualitative estimates:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- \( P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \)

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \approx 0.9 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 0.3 \]

### Business Administration

- \( P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.7 \)

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \approx 0.2 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 0.0667 \]

### Computer Science

- \( P(E|H) \approx 0.5 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \)

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \approx 0.5 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 0.1667 \]

Since we applied uniform priors, the unnormalized values can be interpreted directly. Normalizing these values to compare among the given fields is not strictly necessary, but for clarity:

\[ \text{Normalization factor} = 0.3 + 0.0667 + 0.1667 = 0.5334 \]

So, normalized probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{0.3}{0.5334} \approx 0.562 \),
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.0667}{0.5334} \approx 0.125 \),
  "computer science": \( \frac{0.1667}{0.5334} \approx 0.313 \)
