To apply Bayes' Rule, we need to estimate:

1. **Prior probability, P(H)**: The likelihood that Adam is enrolled in a particular field without any additional information.
2. **Likelihood, P(E|H)**: The likelihood of the personality sketch E given that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.
3. **Marginal likelihood, P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of the personality sketch E given that Adam is not enrolled in that particular field.

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that exact statistical data is not provided, we'll make reasonable assumptions based on general knowledge.

### Hypotheses and Assumptions

**Prior Probabilities (P(H)):**
- Computer Science (P(Cs)): Admittedly, many students enroll in CS, so P(H) = 0.3
- Business Administration (P(Ba)): A significant field, yet different from technical fields, P(H) = 0.2
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science (P(AgVet)): Less common than CS, P(H) = 0.05

**Likelihoods P(E|H):**

1. **Computer Science (CS)**
   - P(E|Cs): Adam's love for nature and animals doesn't directly align with computer science, but his intelligence and abstract thinking do. 
   - Estimated P(E|Cs) = 0.4

2. **Business Administration (BA)**
   - P(E|Ba): Adam's empathy and quiet demeanor aren't stereotypically aligned with business administration, which might value more extroverted qualities.
   - Estimated P(E|Ba) = 0.2

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AgVet)**
   - P(E|AgVet): Adam's curiosity about nature and love for animals align perfectly with this field.
   - Estimated P(E|AgVet) = 0.8

**Marginal Likelihood (P(E|\neg H)):**
- For simplicity, assume average likelihood across other fields. 
  - Computer Science: \( P(E|\neg Cs) \) ≈ 0.6
  - Business Administration: \( P(E|\neg Ba) \) ≈ 0.7
  - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( P(E|\neg AgVet) \) ≈ 0.4

### Computation

#### Computer Science

\[ P(Cs|E) = \frac{P(E|Cs) \cdot P(Cs)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(Cs|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.3}{0.6} = \frac{0.12}{0.6} = 0.2 \]

#### Business Administration

\[ P(Ba|E) = \frac{P(E|Ba) \cdot P(Ba)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(Ba|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.2}{0.7} = \frac{0.04}{0.7} \approx 0.057 \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

\[ P(AgVet|E) = \frac{P(E|AgVet) \cdot P(AgVet)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(AgVet|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.4} = \frac{0.04}{0.4} = 0.1 \]

So the results are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.057,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.1
}
```
