To determine the probability of Adam being enrolled in each field based on his personality sketch (E), we'll apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we don't have specific numerical values for these probabilities, so we will make reasonable assumptions and estimations based on the given information.

### Computer Science
- **P(H)**: Probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
  - Assuming an average proportion, let's estimate \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

- **P(E|H)**: Probability that Adam's personality sketch matches if he was in computer science.
  - Given his interest in puzzles and high intelligence, let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).

- **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability that Adam's personality sketch matches if he was not in computer science.
  - Given his strong empathy and love for animals, let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: Probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
  - Assuming a proportion, let's estimate \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

- **P(E|H)**: Probability that Adam's personality sketch matches if he was in business administration.
  - Given his appreciation for hard work but lack of explicit interest in business, let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

- **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability that Adam's personality sketch matches if he was not in business administration.
  - Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: Probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
  - Given his love for animals and nature, let's estimate \( P(H) = 0.05 \).

- **P(E|H)**: Probability that Adam's personality sketch matches if he was in agricultural and veterinary science.
  - Given the personality sketch is very fitting, let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

- **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability that Adam's personality sketch matches if he was not in agricultural and veterinary science.
  - Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Now applying Bayes' rule for each hypothesis, we use the following generalized formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

But since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant that will be the same for all comparisons, we can compare the numerators directly:

### Normalized Probabilities
- **Computer Science:** 
  \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.3 \cdot 0.2 = 0.06 \]

- **Business Administration:**
  \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.1 = 0.01 \]

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
  \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04 \]

We can normalize these values by dividing each by the sum of these values:

\[ \sum P(H) = 0.06 + 0.01 + 0.04 = 0.11 \]

The normalized probabilities:
- **Computer Science:** 
  \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.11} \approx 0.545 \]

- **Business Administration:**
  \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.11} \approx 0.091 \]

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
  \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.11} \approx 0.364 \]

So the final probability estimates are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.545,
  "business administration": 0.091,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.364
}
