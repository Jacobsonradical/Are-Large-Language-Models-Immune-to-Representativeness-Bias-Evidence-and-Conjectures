Let's first calculate the probabilities using Bayes' theorem. We will denote:

- \( P(H) \) as the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \) as the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) as the probability of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H|E) \) as the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence, which we are aiming to calculate.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that \( P(E) \) is a constant normalization factor that will be the same for all hypotheses, we only need to calculate the numerator \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for each field and then normalize the results.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **\( P(H) \)** (Assuming a fairly common enrollment in this field in U.S. graduate studies, though not exceedingly common)
  - Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \)
- **\( P(E|H) \)** (Adam's personality aligns very closely with interests in nature, empathy, and animals)
  - Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \)
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)** (Considering that other fields may not align so well with his personality)
  - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \)

### Business Administration
- **\( P(H) \)** (A very common field in U.S. graduate studies)
  - Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \)
- **\( P(E|H) \)** (Adam's personality does not strongly align with typical interests in business)
  - Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \)
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**  
  - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \)

### Computer Science
- **\( P(H) \)** (A very common and growing field)
  - Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \)
- **\( P(E|H) \)** (Adam's intelligence and problem-solving abilities match, but nature orientation is less relevant)
  - Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.5 \)
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**  
  - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \)
  
We can now compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field by the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{\sum_{\text{fields}} P(E|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Normalizing these values (so they sum to 1):

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
  \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{(0.9 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.2) + (0.5 \cdot 0.2)} \approx \frac{0.09}{0.27} = 0.333 \]

- **Business Administration**
  \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{(0.9 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.2) + (0.5 \cdot 0.2)} \approx \frac{0.04}{0.27} = 0.148 \]

- **Computer Science**
  \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{(0.9 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.2) + (0.5 \cdot 0.2)} \approx \frac{0.10}{0.27} = 0.370 \]

Therefore, the final probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.333,
  "business administration": 0.148,
  "computer science": 0.370
}
