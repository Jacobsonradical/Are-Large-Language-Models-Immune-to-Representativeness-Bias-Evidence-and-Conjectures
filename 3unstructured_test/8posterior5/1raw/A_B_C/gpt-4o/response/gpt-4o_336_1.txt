Let's start by analyzing the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in each of the provided fields based on given personality sketch \(E\).

1. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H) \) (Prior Probability of Adam being enrolled in Business Administration): As Business Administration is a common field for graduate studies, let's assume a moderate prior probability, say \(0.2\).
   - \( P(E|H) \) (Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in Business Administration): Adam's qualities such as empathy, appreciation for hard work, and high intelligence are valuable, but the strong love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles are less relevant, so let's assign a low probability, say \(0.1\).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \) (Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is **not** enrolled in Business Administration): Considering there are other fields where this personality fits well (e.g., Agricultural and Veterinary Science), we can assign a moderate to high probability, say \(0.4\).

   Using Bayes' rule, we compute \( P(H|E) \):
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot (1 - 0.2)} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.32} = \frac{0.02}{0.34} \approx 0.059
   \]

2. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(H) \) (Prior Probability of Adam being enrolled in Computer Science): Considering the popularity of the field, let's assign a prior probability, say \(0.3\).
   - \( P(E|H) \) (Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in Computer Science): Adam's traits like high intelligence and love for solving puzzles fit well, but his empathy and love for nature and animals are less relevant here, so let's assign a moderate probability, say \(0.3\).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \) (Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is **not** enrolled in Computer Science): Given that his personality might be common in other fields such as Agricultural and Veterinary Science, assign a moderate probability, say \(0.4\).

   Using Bayes' rule, we compute \( P(H|E) \):
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.3}{0.3 \cdot 0.3 + 0.4 \cdot (1 - 0.3)} = \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.28} = \frac{0.09}{0.37} \approx 0.243
   \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H) \) (Prior Probability of Adam being enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science): This field is less common, let's assume a prior probability, say \(0.1\).
   - \( P(E|H) \) (Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science): Adam's traits like love for nature, animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work strongly align with this field, so letâ€™s assign a high probability, say \(0.8\).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \) (Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is **not** enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science): Finally, since his personality could still fit in other fields like Business Administration or Computer Science, let's assign a moderate probability, say \(0.4\).

   Using Bayes' rule, we compute \( P(H|E) \):
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.4 \cdot (1 - 0.1)} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.36} = \frac{0.08}{0.44} \approx 0.182
   \]

Summarizing the results for the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \):
