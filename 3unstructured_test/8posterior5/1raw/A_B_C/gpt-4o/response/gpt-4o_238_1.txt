To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we'll first define the following probabilities for each field:

1. \( P(H) \) - The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in this field.
2. \( P(E|H) \) - The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) (Adam's personality sketch) given that Adam was enrolled in this field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in this field.
4. \( P(E) \) - The total probability of observing the evidence \( E \).

According to Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be computed as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Given that \( P(H) \) may generally be low across multiple fields due to the large number of potential graduate fields in the U.S., we'll assume conservative but reasonable estimates for these probabilities based on how well Adam's personality fits each field.

Let's assume:
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is relatively low given the specificity of Adam's personality traits to certain fields.

Now, we'll estimate these values specifically:

### Computer Science:
- \( P(H) \) - The prior probability is relatively moderate, say 0.1, given the popularity of Computer Science among graduate students.
- \( P(E|H) \) - Given Adam's intelligence and interest in abstract concepts, but slight misalignment with nature and animals, let's estimate 0.3.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) - Considering many other fields might fit the description of Empathy and Nature better, we put a lower probability, say 0.05.

Applying Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.1}{(0.3 \times 0.1 + 0.05 \times 0.9)} \approx \frac{0.03}{0.075} = 0.4 \]


### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- \( P(H) \) - The prior probability maybe lower, say 0.05, considering it's a less popular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) - Very high given Adam's empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, say 0.7.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) - For other fields, assume a lower match with empathy for animals and nature, maybe 0.1.

Applying Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.05}{(0.7 \times 0.05 + 0.1 \times 0.95)} \approx \frac{0.035}{0.125} = 0.28 \]

### Business Administration:
- \( P(H) \) - Being a popular field, moderate, say 0.1.
- \( P(E|H) \) - Low compatibility due to Adam's strong interest in nature and animals, say 0.1.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) - For non-business fields, considering match with empathy etc, again assume 0.05.

Applying Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.1}{(0.1 \times 0.1 + 0.05 \times 0.9)} \approx \frac{0.01}{0.055} \approx 0.18 \]

Summarizing:

{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.28,
  "business administration": 0.18
