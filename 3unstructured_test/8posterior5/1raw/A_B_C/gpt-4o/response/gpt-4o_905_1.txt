To apply Bayes' rule, we need to estimate and compute the probabilities as follows:

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E | H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given the field.
- \( P(E | \neg H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given any field other than the specified one.
- \( P(H | E) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in the given field given his personality sketch.

Assumptions on Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \):
- Let's assume the prior probability \( P(H) \) of Adam being in any given field is roughly the same, considering there are many graduate fields. We can assume a baseline of \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

Likelihoods:
- \( P(E | H) \) will depend on how well the personality traits fit each field.

Given traits:
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
2. Love for animals.
3. High intelligence.
4. Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles.
5. Warm heart and strong empathy.
6. Appreciation for hard work.

Evaluation:

**1. Business administration:**
- Prior: \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.1 \).
- Likelihood: \( P(E|\text{business administration}) \).
  - Curiosity about nature and plants: low relevance.
  - Love for animals: low relevance.
  - High intelligence: relevance.
  - Enjoys solving puzzles: moderate relevance.
  - Warm heart and empathy: moderate relevance in people-focused roles.
  - Appreciation for hard work: high relevance.
  - Estimate: \( P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.2 \).

- General population (other fields) has varying likelihood, and for simplicity, let's assume:
  - \( P(E|\neg\text{business administration}) = 0.1 \)

**2. Agricultural and veterinary science:**
- Prior: \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.1 \).
- Likelihood: \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \).
  - Curiosity about nature and plants: high relevance.
  - Love for animals: high relevance.
  - High intelligence: relevance.
  - Enjoys solving puzzles: moderate relevance.
  - Warm heart and empathy: high relevance.
  - Appreciation for hard work: high relevance.
  - Estimate: \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.8 \).

- For other fields: 
  - \( P(E|\neg\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.2 \).

**3. Computer science:**
- Prior: \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.1 \).
- Likelihood: \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \).
  - Curiosity about nature and plants: low relevance.
  - Love for animals: low relevance.
  - High intelligence: high relevance.
  - Enjoys solving puzzles: high relevance.
  - Warm heart and empathy: low relevance (depending on area).
  - Appreciation for hard work: high relevance.
  - Estimate: \( P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.5 \).

- For other fields:
  - \( P(E|\neg\text{computer science}) = 0.2 \).

Bayes' Rule Calculations:

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's calculate for each field separately:

**1. Business administration:**
\[ P(\text{H|E}) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{(0.2 \times 0.1 + 0.1 \times 0.9)} = \frac{0.02}{0.02+0.09} = \frac{0.02}{0.11} \approx 0.18 \]

**2. Agricultural and veterinary science:**
\[ P(\text{H|E}) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{(0.8 \times 0.1 + 0.2 \times 0.9)} = \frac{0.08}{0.08+0.18} = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \approx 0.31 \]

**3. Computer science:**
\[ P(\text{H|E}) = \frac{0.5 \times 0.1}{(0.5 \times 0.1 + 0.2 \times 0.9)} = \frac{0.05}{0.05+0.18} = \frac{0.05}{0.23} \approx 0.22 \]

Final Answer:

{
  "business administration": 0.18,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.31,
  "computer science": 0.22
