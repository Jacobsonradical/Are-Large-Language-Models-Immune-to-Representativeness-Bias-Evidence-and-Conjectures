To apply Bayes' rule for each field, \( H \), given the evidence \( E \), we need to calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \). Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Unfortunately, \( P(E) \) is typically difficult to ascertain directly without more data, but we can focus on the terms relative to each field to understand their qualitative relevance.

### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that a random graduate student is studying agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume it is relatively low compared to other fields because it is a specialized field.
- **P(E|H)**: Since Adam's personality sketch aligns well with the traits often associated with this field (interest in nature, love for animals, and empathy), this would be high.
- **P(E|¬H)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he were not in agricultural and veterinary science. Given the uniqueness of these traits for this field, this would be lower.

Based on this qualitative assessment, \( P(H|E) \) should be relatively high.

### 2. Computer Science
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that a random graduate student is studying computer science is relatively high because it's a popular field.
- **P(E|H)**: Adam's love for puzzles and high intelligence align, but his deep love for animals and empathy may not directly align with the typical personality associated with computer science.
- **P(E|¬H)**: Given that Adam's traits are somewhat unique for this field, this would be moderate.

Given these factors, \( P(H|E) \) is moderate due to moderate alignment with the personality sketch.

### 3. Business Administration
- **P(H)**: Business administration is also a popular field, so the prior probability here is high.
- **P(E|H)**: Adam's traits such as empathy and understanding hard work are valuable in this field, but his deep interest in nature and animals is not a direct fit.
- **P(E|¬H)**: Given the mix of unrelated traits, this would also be moderate.

So, \( P(H|E) \) would be relatively lower compared to agricultural and veterinary science but higher than other less relevant fields.

### Estimations

Combining these insights leads us to a relative probability:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

### Explanation
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7)**: High because Adam’s traits strongly align with this field.
- **Computer Science (0.4)**: Moderate alignment with Adam’s puzzle-solving abilities and intelligence.
- **Business Administration (0.3)**: Somewhat relevant but less fitting compared to the more specialized traits for agricultural and veterinary science.
