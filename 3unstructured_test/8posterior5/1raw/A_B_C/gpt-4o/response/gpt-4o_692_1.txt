To compute the conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch \( E \), we can use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

We need to assess \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Prior probability of being in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume a somewhat higher prior given his love for nature and animals, say 0.2.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's traits align very well with agricultural and veterinary science, this likelihood is high, say 0.8.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likelihood of having these traits if not in agricultural science. Given his traits, this could be moderate, say 0.3.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): Prior probability of being in business administration. Let's assume it's lower due to lesser alignment with his traits, say 0.1.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given that his empathy and warmth could be helpful in business but not a perfect fit for his curiosity about nature and animals, say 0.3.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Moderate chance still since these traits are somewhat general, say 0.5.

3. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Prior probability of being in computer science. Given his intelligence and abstract thinking, say 0.3.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood is moderate to high due to his intelligence and problem-solving skills, say 0.6.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likelihood still moderately high given these attributes fit other fields too, say 0.4.

Now, let's use these to compute \( P(H|E) \):

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{(0.8 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8)} = \frac{0.16}{0.16 + 0.24} = \frac{0.16}{0.40} = 0.4 \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{(0.3 \cdot 0.1 + 0.5 \cdot 0.9)} = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.45} = \frac{0.03}{0.48} = 0.0625 \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.3}{(0.6 \cdot 0.3 + 0.4 \cdot 0.7)} = \frac{0.18}{0.18 + 0.28} = \frac{0.18}{0.46} = 0.3913 \]

Thus, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.0625,
  "computer science": 0.3913
}
```
