To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to follow these steps:

1. Define \( P(H) \) as the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the given field.
2. Define \( P(E|H) \) as the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in the given field.
3. Define \( P(E|\neg H) \) as the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in the given field.
4. Apply Bayes' theorem to find \( P(H|E) \):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
\]

### Assumptions:
- Assume \( P(H) \) is equally likely for each field: \( \frac{1}{3} \).
- Assume \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the sketch given that Adam is in any other field but the one being considered; because we don't have exact numbers, we will assume it to be lower than \( P(E|H) \).

Given the personality sketch provided, let's consider the likelihoods:

### Business Administration:
- \( P(E|H) \): Low, because nothing specifically links the sketch to business qualities such as leadership in corporate settings.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Let's assume this to be lower compared to other fields.
  
### Computer Science:
- \( P(E|H) \): Moderate, given Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): This could also be moderately likely, though lower than \( P(E|H) \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- \( P(E|H) \): High, due to Adamâ€™s strong empathy, love for animals, curiosity about plants, and appreciation for hard work.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Lower, as this sketch strongly aligns with agricultural and veterinary interests.

Calculating the posteriors:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E|H) P(H) + P(E|\neg H) P(\neg H)}
\]

Let's assign the following plausible values:
- \( P(E|H) \) for business administration: 0.1
- \( P(E|H) \) for computer science: 0.4
- \( P(E|H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science: 0.8
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) for business administration: 0.3
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) for computer science: 0.2
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science: 0.1

Using \( P(H) \) = 0.33 (approx. \(\frac{1}{3}\)):
### Business Administration:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.33}{(0.1 \times 0.33) + (0.3 \times 0.67)} \approx 0.14
\]

### Computer Science:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.33}{(0.4 \times 0.33) + (0.2 \times 0.67)} \approx 0.50
\]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.33}{(0.8 \times 0.33) + (0.1 \times 0.67)} \approx 0.79
\]

So, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.14,
  "computer science": 0.50,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.79
}
```
