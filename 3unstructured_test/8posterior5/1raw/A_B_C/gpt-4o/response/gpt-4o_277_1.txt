To evaluate the probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in various graduate fields given his personality sketch, we need to consider a few key probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field, given no additional information about Adam.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is enrolled in the field H.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is not enrolled in the field H.

Given the available information, let's make reasonable assumptions based on Adam's personality sketch E:

- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and an appreciation for hard work, which aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science.
- Business administration seems less likely given that there's no mention of interest in business or management skills.
- Computer science is possible due to his intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles, but it doesn't perfectly match his strong empathy and love for animals.

Using these assumptions, let's make the following estimates:

- \( P(H) \):
  - agricultural and veterinary science: 0.2 (assuming it's relatively less common compared to other fields)
  - business administration: 0.2
  - computer science: 0.2

- \( P(E|H) \):
  - agricultural and veterinary science: 0.8 (high alignment with his personality and interests)
  - business administration: 0.1 (low alignment)
  - computer science: 0.6 (moderate alignment with his problem-solving abilities)

- \( P(E|\neg H) \):
  - agricultural and veterinary science: 0.2 (not many people would have his specific interests without being in the field)
  - business administration: 0.6 (many people have varied interests outside their field)
  - computer science: 0.4 (some overlap with general problem-solving skills)

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant, it can be described as \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \). To avoid unnecessary complexity, we can focus on the relative values to provide a reasonable approximation.

\[
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H)
\]

Calculating these approximations, we get:

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[
P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.2 = 0.16
\]

For business administration:
\[
P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02
\]

For computer science:
\[
P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.6 \cdot 0.2 = 0.12
\]

Normalizing these values so their sum is 1:
\[
0.16 + 0.02 + 0.12 = 0.3
\]

\[
P(H|E)_{agricultural and veterinary science} = \frac{0.16}{0.3} = 0.533
\]
\[
P(H|E)_{business administration} = \frac{0.02}{0.3} = 0.067
\]
\[
P(H|E)_{computer science} = \frac{0.12}{0.3} = 0.4
\]

Therefore, the probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.533,
  "business administration": 0.067,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
