To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to follow these steps:

1. Estimate the prior probability \( P(H) \) for each hypothesis \( H \). 
2. Estimate the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), the probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in that field.
3. Estimate the likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \), the probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in that field.
4. Apply Bayes' rule:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]

However, since \( P(E) \) is the same for all hypotheses, we can simplify the comparative calculation by looking at the product \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \), which is proportional to \( P(H|E) \).

Here is the detailed reasoning for each field:

1. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is in Business Administration is relatively low given his interests and qualities (nature, animals, empathy).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given the description, it is not highly probable that Adam would have enrolled in Business Administration.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Consider the general population of other fields, this might be higher than for Business Administration given his interests.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is in Computer Science might be moderate in general, as Computer Science is a broad and popular field.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given the description, while intelligence and abstract thinking are a good match, the lack of mention of specific interest in computers or technology might suggest a lower probability.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): This probability could be moderately high when considering other fields with elements of abstract thinking and problem-solving.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability of this field being chosen can be relatively high given Adam's love for nature, plants, and empathy towards animals.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch fitting this field is high.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): This probability is lower for fields outside Agriculture and Veterinary Science due to the strong match with his traits.

Based on these assessments, let's normalize probabilistic values for a comparative purpose rather than calculating exact posteriors.

{
  "business administration": 0.1 * 0.2 = 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.3 * 0.4 = 0.12,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5 * 0.9 = 0.45
