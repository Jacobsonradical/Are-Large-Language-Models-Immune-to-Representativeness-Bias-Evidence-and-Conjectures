To compute the probabilities of Adam being enrolled in different fields based on his personality sketch, let's use Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(H|E)\) is the probability of hypothesis \(H\) given the evidence \(E\).
- \(P(E|H)\) is the probability of evidence \(E\) given the hypothesis \(H\).
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of hypothesis \(H\).
- \(P(E)\) is the total probability of the evidence \(E\).

Since we don't have exact numerical values, we will make qualitative assessments based on the descriptions provided.

### Business Administration
1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**: Business administration is a common field, so let's assume a moderate prior probability. We can estimate it at around 0.2.
   
2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: Based on Adam's personality sketch, business administration doesn't strongly align with his deep love for animals, warm heart, strong empathy, or curiosity about nature. Therefore, this probability might be low. Let's estimate it at 0.1.

3. **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)**: This would include all other fields. Given that many other fields might align better with Adam’s personality, let’s estimate this at 0.4.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.4} = 0.05 \]

### Computer Science
1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**: Computer science is another common field, so let's assume a moderate prior probability. We can estimate it at around 0.25.

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence and an understanding of abstract concepts, which could fit well with computer science. Let's estimate this probability at 0.3.

3. **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)**: This would include all other fields, some of which align well with Adam’s personality. Let’s estimate this at 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} = 0.25 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**: This is a more specialized field, possibly less common than business administration or computer science. We can estimate the prior probability at around 0.15.

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: This field directly aligns with Adam’s curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. Hence, this probability might be high. Let's estimate it at 0.6.

3. **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)**: Many other fields might not align as perfectly but could still somewhat fit his characteristics. Let’s estimate this at 0.5.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.15}{0.5} = 0.18 \]

Thus, the probabilities using the given format are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.25,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.18
}
