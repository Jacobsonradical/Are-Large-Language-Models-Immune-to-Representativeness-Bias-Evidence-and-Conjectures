To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate each probability:

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's analyze each field:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Generally, this could be considered moderate given the broad interest in computer science among graduate students.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood of the personality sketch given Adam was in computer science. Given that Adam is intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, but noting no direct connection to nature or animals, this might be moderate.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likelihood of the personality sketch given Adam was not in computer science. This could be somewhat high as there are many other fields more directly connected to his interests.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This might be lower than computer science, given fewer students enroll in this field.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood of the personality sketch given Adam was in agricultural and veterinary science. This is high due to his strong interest in nature and animals.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given the interests and traits described, if he were not in this field, the probability of the personality sketch fitting him would be lower.

3. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. This could be moderate to low, given it's a popular field but less directly connected to his interests.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood of the personality sketch given Adam was in business administration. This is lower, as there is little connection between the sketch and business administration traits.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): If he were not in business administration, the sketch would probably fit better into other fields, so this likelihood could be high.

Based on these qualitative evaluations, we can assign approximate values to compute \( P(H|E) \):

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,  // Moderate prior, moderate fit.
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,  // Lower prior, high fit.
  "business administration": 0.1  // Moderate-to-low prior, low fit.
}
```

These values are based on a combination of typical enrollment rates and the fit between Adamâ€™s personality sketch and the field descriptions. Adjustments can be made based on more specific data if available.
