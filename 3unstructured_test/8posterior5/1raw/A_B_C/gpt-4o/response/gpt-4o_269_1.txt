To estimate the probabilities \(P(H)\), \(P(E|H)\), \(P(E|\neg H)\), and subsequently compute \(P(H|E)\) for each field using Bayes' rule, let's break down the reasoning process for each field:

1. **Computer Science**
2. **Business Administration**
3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

Given the personality sketch of Adam, we need to consider how likely it is that his personality fits each of these fields.

### Prior Probability \(P(H)\):
The prior probability is our initial guess about the likelihood that Adam is enrolled in each of these graduate programs before considering the personality sketch. Since we don't have specific data, we can assume relatively equal priors, but perhaps slightly adjusted based on the prevalence of each field among graduate students:

- **Computer Science**: Computer science is a very common field for graduate studies.
- **Business Administration**: Also quite common for graduate students.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Less common but directly related to Adam's interest in nature and animals.

Let's assume:
\[P(\text{H(computer science)}) = 0.4\]
\[P(\text{H(business administration)}) = 0.3\]
\[P(\text{H(agricultural and veterinary science)}) = 0.3\]

### Likelihood \(P(E|H)\):
The likelihood is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is in a particular field.

- **Computer Science**:
  - Some aspects fit, like high intelligence and abstract thinking.
  - Other aspects (empathy, love for animals) are less relevant.
  \[P(E|\text{H(computer science)}) = 0.4\]

- **Business Administration**:
  - High intelligence is relevant.
  - Empathy and dedication are also valuable traits.
  - However, interest in nature and animals is less fitting.
  \[P(E|\text{H(business administration)}) = 0.3\]

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  - Strong fit with curiosity about nature and love for animals.
  - Dedication and empathy are also highly relevant.
  \[P(E|\text{H(agricultural and veterinary science)}) = 0.8\]

### Complement Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\):
The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in the particular field. This considers the other fields combined.

Let's assume:
\[P(E|\neg \text{H(computer science)}) = 0.5\]
\[P(E|\neg \text{H(business administration)}) = 0.6\]
\[P(E|\neg \text{H(agricultural and veterinary science)}) = 0.3\]

### Posterior Probability \(P(H|E)\):
Using Bayes' rule:
\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}\]

For succinctness, we will compute the values directly:

- **Computer Science**:
\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.4}{0.4 \cdot 0.4 + 0.5 \cdot 0.6}\]
\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.16}{0.16 + 0.3} = \frac{0.16}{0.46} \approx 0.348\]

- **Business Administration**:
\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.3}{0.3 \cdot 0.3 + 0.6 \cdot 0.7}\]
\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.42} = \frac{0.09}{0.51} \approx 0.176\]

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.3}{0.8 \cdot 0.3 + 0.3 \cdot 0.7}\]
\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.24}{0.24 + 0.21} = \frac{0.24}{0.45} \approx 0.533\]

Thus, the calculated posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.348,
  "business administration": 0.176,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.533
}
