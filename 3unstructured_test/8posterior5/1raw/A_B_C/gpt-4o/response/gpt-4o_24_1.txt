To solve this problem using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the following probabilities for each field:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field in general.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in each field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is NOT enrolled in each field.
4. \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field given his personality sketch.

For simplicity, we'll assume some values based on typical distributions and general knowledge:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that a graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume 0.05.
- \( P(E|H) \): Probability of observing Adam's sketch given he's in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his love for nature, animals, and appreciation for hard work, this is high. Let's assume 0.8.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of observing Adam's sketch if he's not in this field. Given how specific his interests are to this field, let's assume this to be lower. Let's assume 0.1.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
We can calculate \( P(E) \) as:
\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]
\[
P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.1 \cdot 0.95) = 0.04 + 0.095 = 0.135
\]

So,
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.135} \approx 0.296
\]

### Computer Science
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that a graduate student is in computer science. Let's assume 0.2.
- \( P(E|H) \): Probability of observing Adam's sketch given he's in computer science. Considering his interest in solving puzzles, this could be somewhat high. Let's assume 0.4.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of observing Adam's sketch if he's not in this field. Let's assume 0.15.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[
P(E) = (0.4 \cdot 0.2) + (0.15 \cdot 0.8) = 0.08 + 0.12 = 0.2
\]

So,
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.2} = 0.4
\]

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that a graduate student is in business administration. Let's assume 0.15.
- \( P(E|H) \): Probability of observing Adam's sketch given he's in business administration. Given his traits, this might be lower. Let's assume 0.1.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of observing Adam's sketch if he's not in this field. Let's assume 0.25.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[
P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.15) + (0.25 \cdot 0.85) = 0.015 + 0.2125 = 0.2275
\]

So,
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{0.2275} \approx 0.066
\]

Now we compile the results:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.296,
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.066
}
```
These probabilities illustrate our belief in each field being the one Adam is enrolled in, given the provided personality sketch.
