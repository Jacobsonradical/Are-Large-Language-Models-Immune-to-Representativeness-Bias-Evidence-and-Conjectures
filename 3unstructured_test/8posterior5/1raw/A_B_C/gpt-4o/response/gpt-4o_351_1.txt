Sure, let's calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' theorem, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to make some educated assumptions for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) based on the provided sketch. Here are my estimations for the prior and conditional probabilities:

1. **Business Administration:**
   - **P(H):** Probability Adam is enrolled in Business Administration. Business fields are common among graduate students, but given Adam's profile, we might consider it to be less likely. Let's say \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \).
   - **P(E|H):** Probability that Adam would have his personality sketch if he were a business administration student. Given his curiosity about nature and empathy for animals, this seems less aligned. Let's say \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \).
   - **P(E|\neg H):** Probability that Adam would have his personality sketch if he were not a business administration student. Given all other fields, this would be higher: \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.9 \).

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - **P(H):** Probability Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. This field aligns strongly with his love for nature and animals. Let's say \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \).
   - **P(E|H):** Probability that Adam would have his personality sketch if he were an Agricultural and Veterinary Science student. This fits extremely well. Let's say \( P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \).
   - **P(E|\neg H):** Given how specific his traits are, if he's not in this field, his profile might only somewhat fit other fields. \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \).

3. **Computer Science:**
   - **P(H):** Probability Adam is enrolled in Computer Science. Given his intelligence and interest in puzzle-solving, but less alignment with nature focus: \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \).
   - **P(E|H):** Probability that Adam would have his personality sketch if he were a Computer Science student. Let's say \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \).
   - **P(E|\neg H):** This would potentially be more aligned to other fields fitting his sketch better. \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.7 \).

Next, let's compute \( P(H|E) \):

For **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \]

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]

For **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \]

We can compute an approximate values without calculating \( P(E) \) exactly, as we care more about relative results. Using key approximations and ignoring \( P(E) \) since it stays constant across relative probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.01,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.18,
  "computer science": 0.03
}
```

So, **Agricultural and Veterinary Science** has the highest posterior probability given the personality sketch.
