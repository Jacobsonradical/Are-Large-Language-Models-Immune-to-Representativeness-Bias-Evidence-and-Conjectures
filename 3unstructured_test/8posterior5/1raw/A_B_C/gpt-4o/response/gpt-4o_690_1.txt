Sure, let's run through the Bayesian analysis step by step for each field.

Given:
* \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in that field.
* \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the evidence given that Adam is in that field.
* \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the evidence given that Adam isn't in that field.

We'll use Bayes' Rule: \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \), but because we will be comparing probabilities across different hypotheses (fields), the denominator \( P(E) \) will cancel out, leaving our calculations as a comparison of numerators.

We will assume equal priors (this may be unrealistic without further information, but it simplifies our calculations).

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): Assuming it's one of three possibilities under consideration, a simple prior might be \( \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.33 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Unlikely, given Adam's interests. Let's assign a low probability, say \( 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Assuming we consider the other two potential fields equally, \( \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \).

Calculation for Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.33 = 0.033 \]

### Computer Science
- \( P(H) \): Similar uniform prior \( \sim 0.33 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's abstract thinking skills and puzzle interests, moderate likelihood, say \( 0.5 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Similarly, reasoning among the other fields: \( \sim 0.5 \).

Calculation for Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.5 \cdot 0.33 = 0.165 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): Uniform prior \( \sim 0.33 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, high likelihood, say \( 0.8 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): \( \sim 0.5 \) as with the others for simplicity.

Calculation for Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.33 = 0.264 \]

So, comparatively:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.033,
  "computer science": 0.165,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.264
}
```

These values indicate that, given Adam's personality sketch, he is most likely enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, followed by Computer Science, and least likely in Business Administration.
