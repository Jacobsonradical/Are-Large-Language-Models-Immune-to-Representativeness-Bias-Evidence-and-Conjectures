To use Bayes' Rule to compute \(P(H|E)\) for each field \(H\), we need to quantify:

1. \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in each field.
2. \(P(E|H)\): The probability of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam is enrolled in field \(H\).
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam is not enrolled in field \(H\).

While exact values are challenging to provide without more context, I will use reasonable estimates based on the description.

### Hypotheses

1. **Computer Science (CS):** Adam's intelligence and ability to solve puzzles could fit the CS profile. However, his deep love for animals and nature is not a typical trait for someone in CS.
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS):** Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and warm heart strongly align with this field.
3. **Business Administration (BA):** Adam's empathy and understanding of hard work could fit, but his specific interest in nature, animals, and puzzles is less aligned.

### Estimations

Using qualitative reasoning for the estimations:

- **P(H_CS)**: Probability that Adam is in CS is low to moderate due to high intelligence but conflicting interest in nature/animals.
- **P(H_AVS)**: Probability that Adam is in AVS is high due to strong alignment with all personality traits.
- **P(H_BA)**: Probability that Adam is in BA is lower due to conflicting interests.

### Probability Assessments

#### Prior Probabilities (P(H))
These are based on typical enrollment distributions and Adam's described personality:
- \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.25 \) (moderate likelihood)
- \( P(H_{AVS}) = 0.50 \) (high likelihood)
- \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.15 \) (low likelihood)
- Other fields: Remaining probability out of 1.

#### Likelihoods (P(E|H))
These are based on how well the personality aligns with each field:
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.3 \) (moderate alignment)
- \( P(E|H_{AVS}) = 0.9 \) (strong alignment)
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.2 \) (weak alignment)

#### Normalizing Factors (P(E|\neg H))
These consider the overall personality likelihood, irrespective of the specific fields:
- For simplicity, assume \( P(E|\neg H) \) incorporates all other possible fields.

### Bayesian Updates

1. **Computer Science:**
   \[
   P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} 
   \]
   - Assume \( P(E) \approx P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) + P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) \). This simplifies our calculation.
   \[
   P(E) \approx (0.3 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.50) + (0.2 \cdot 0.15)
   \]
   \[
   P(E) \approx 0.075 + 0.45 + 0.03 = 0.555
   \]
   \[
   P(H_{CS}|E) \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.25}{0.555} \approx \frac{0.075}{0.555} \approx 0.135
   \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   \[
   P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)}
   \]
   \[
   P(H_{AVS}|E) \approx \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.50}{0.555} \approx \frac{0.45}{0.555} \approx 0.811
   \]

3. **Business Administration:**
   \[
   P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)}
   \]
   \[
   P(H_{BA}|E) \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{0.555} \approx \frac{0.03}{0.555} \approx 0.054
   \]
