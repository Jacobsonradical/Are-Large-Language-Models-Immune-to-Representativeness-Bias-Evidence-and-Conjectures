To solve this problem, we use Bayes' theorem, which provides a way to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. We want to calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field, which is the probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch \( E \).

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality given he is in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality given he is not in that field.

We'll make the following assumptions for simplicity, acknowledging that more precise statistics would require detailed empirical data:

1. **Prior Probabilities \(P(H)\)**: These represent the prior likelihood of any random graduate student being enrolled in a particular field.
   - For simplicity, we'll assume equal priors, meaning \(P(\text{computer science}) = P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = P(\text{business administration}) = 0.1\), reflecting the idea that each of these fields is equally likely given no other information. However, the precise priors would ideally be adjusted based on real-world statistics.
   
2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: These represent how well Adam's personality sketch matches the typical traits of students in these fields.

   - **Computer Science**: A high intelligence and interest in solving puzzles might fit well, but a strong love for nature and animals is less typical. Thus, we assign \( P(E | \text{computer science}) = 0.3 \).
   - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: A strong love for nature, empathy, and animals fits very well. Thus, we assign \( P(E | \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.8 \).
   - **Business Administration**: This field may not align as well with Adam's personality traits. Thus, we assign \( P(E | \text{business administration}) = 0.1 \).

3. **Complement Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)**: These represent the probability of observing Adam's personality in other fields:

   - For simplicity, let's define the complement field probabilities considering the other specified fields' lack of fit (averaging uniform distribution over others).
   - Taking out the target field from potential ones (given three significant fields listed) leaves us two fields to distribute remaining probability with the understanding of broad diverse graduate fields' existence. Hypothetical adjustment: remainder fits see \((P(E_{\neg H1})=\frac{P(E_{\text{sum of remaining others}})}{N\text{-1 remaining}})\).

Given no more detail distribution data:
1. Computer Science: moderately likely
2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science: moderately less without fitting all traits observed
3. Business Administration: low fit beyond study dedications

Now we compute:

We first calculate the normalization factor \( P(E) \):

Let, \( P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{computer science}})P(H_{\text{computer science}}) + P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) + P(E|H_{\text{business administration}})P(H_{\text{business administration}})\)

\[ P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.3) + (0.1 \times 0.8) + (0.1 \times 0.1) +... (field of exclusion) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.03 + 0.08 + 0.01 +\ldots = normalized factor for fields]

Now, application for each:
  Calculate each posterior \( P(H|E) \), as per  P(E):
  { 
  \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) = \frac{(0.3) * (0.1)}{P(E)} \approx \]
  \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = \frac{(0.8) * (0.1)}{P(E)} \approx \]
  \( P(H_{\text{business administration}) = \frac{(0.1) * (0.1)}{P(E)} \approx
  as per normalized

}
Hence approximate outputs accordingly readable like;
