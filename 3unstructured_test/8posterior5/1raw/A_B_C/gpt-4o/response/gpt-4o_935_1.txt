To use Bayes' Theorem to compute \( P(H|E) \), we need to identify \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in the field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence (personality sketch).

Let's denote the fields by:
- \( H_1 \): Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( H_2 \): Business Administration
- \( H_3 \): Computer Science

We'll assume some reasonable values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) based on typical distributions and the fit of the personality sketch to each field.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - \( P(H_1) \): Probability that any random graduate student is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
     - Let's consider this to be around 0.05 (5%) since it's a relatively smaller field compared to others.
   - \( P(E|H_1) \): Probability of Adam's personality given he is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
     - Given his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, this is very likely. We'll set this at 0.7.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_1) \): Probability of Adam’s personality given he is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
     - This might be less likely, given the specific traits. We'll set this at 0.2.

2. **Business Administration**
   - \( P(H_2) \): Probability that any random graduate student is in Business Administration.
     - Business Administration is a popular field. Let's consider this to be around 0.2 (20%).
   - \( P(E|H_2) \): Probability of Adam’s personality given he is in Business Administration.
     - His personality and interests don't seem to fit well with the typical traits for Business Administration. We'll set this at 0.1.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_2) \): Probability of Adam’s personality given he is not in Business Administration.
     - This might be higher since Business Administration is relatively general. We'll set this at 0.3.

3. **Computer Science**
   - \( P(H_3) \): Probability that any random graduate student is in Computer Science.
     - Computer Science is another popular field. Let's consider this to be around 0.15 (15%).
   - \( P(E|H_3) \): Probability of Adam’s personality given he is in Computer Science.
     - His intelligence and problem-solving abilities fit well, though his love for nature and animals might not point strongly here. We'll set this at 0.3.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_3) \): Probability of Adam’s personality given he is not in Computer Science.
     - This might be relatively similar to the general population. We'll set this at 0.25.

Now, let's compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) + P(E|H_3) \cdot P(H_3) \), let's compute \( P(E) \).

\( P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.05) + (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.15) \)

\( P(E) = 0.035 + 0.02 + 0.045 = 0.1 \)

Now, we compute \( P(H|E) \):

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   \[
   P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{0.1} = \frac{0.035}{0.1} = 0.35
   \]

2. **Business Administration**
   \[
   P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1} = \frac{0.02}{0.1} = 0.2
   \]

3. **Computer Science**
   \[
   P(H_3|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.15}{0.1} = \frac{0.045}{0.1} = 0.45
   \]

Therefore, the results are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.35,
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.45
}
```
