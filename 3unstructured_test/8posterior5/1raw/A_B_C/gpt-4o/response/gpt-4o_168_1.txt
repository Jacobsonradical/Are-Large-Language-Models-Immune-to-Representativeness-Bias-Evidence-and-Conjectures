To apply Bayes' Rule, we need to calculate the conditional probability of Adam being enrolled in each field given his personality sketch (E).

Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of being enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given enrollment in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given not being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of the personality sketch.

Since we are comparing multiple fields, \( P(E) \) will be the same when comparing across fields but isn't needed for calculating relative probabilities via \( P(H|E) \).

Let's estimate these values for each field:

### Computer Science
- \( P(H) \) (prior for computer science): Roughly moderate, assuming many graduate students are in this field.
- \( P(E|H) \) (likelihood of the personality sketch given computer science): Lower, as Adam's curiosity about nature and animals is less related to computer science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) (likelihood of the personality sketch given not in computer science): Could be higher than \( P(E|H) \).

Let's assign some approximate values:
- \( P(H) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \)= 0.7 (assume more likely outside this field)

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \) (prior for agricultural and veterinary science): Lower, as fewer graduate students might be in this field compared to others.
- \( P(E|H) \) (likelihood of the personality sketch given agricultural and veterinary science): Very high, as Adam's love for nature and animals fits well here.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) (likelihood of the personality sketch given not in agricultural and veterinary science): Lower, as it's less likely outside this field given his personality.

Let's assign some values:
- \( P(H) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \)= 0.3 (assume less likely outside this field)

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \) (prior for business administration): Roughly moderate, many graduate students are enrolled in this field.
- \( P(E|H) \) (likelihood of the personality sketch given business administration): Lower, as Adam's interests and traits are less matched to business.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) (likelihood of the personality sketch given not in business administration): Could be higher than \( P(E|H) \).

Let's assign values:
- \( P(H) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \)= 0.8 (assume more likely outside this field)

Now we compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule for each field. Given that \( P(E) \) will cancel out when comparing across fields, we have:

For computer science:
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.3*0.3}{0.3} = 0.09 \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(\text{Ag & Vet}|E) = \frac{0.1*0.9}{0.3} = 0.3 \]

For business administration:
\[ P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{0.3*0.2}{0.3} = 0.06 \]

Thus the output probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": 0.09,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.06
}
