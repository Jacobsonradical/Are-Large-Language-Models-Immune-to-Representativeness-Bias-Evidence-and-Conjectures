To solve this problem using Bayes' Rule, we must estimate the following probabilities:

- P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
- P(E|H): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in a specific field.
- P(E|\neg H): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in that specific field.

Bayes' Rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for each field (because we're only comparing hypotheses about the field), we can simply use:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Let's make reasonable assumptions about these values based on the personality sketch and Adam's likely interest in each field.

### Business Administration
- P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration can be considered relatively low, as his personality sketch doesn't particularly suggest an affinity for business-related studies.
  - P(H) ≈ 0.1
- P(E|H): The likelihood of Adam having the described personality if he was studying Business Administration is also low.
  - P(E|H) ≈ 0.2
- P(E|\neg H): The likelihood of Adam having the described personality if he was NOT studying Business Administration is moderately high.
  - P(E|\neg H) ≈ 0.8

### Computer Science
- P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science is moderate, given his high intelligence and aptitude for abstract concepts.
  - P(H) ≈ 0.3
- P(E|H): The likelihood of Adam having the described personality if he was studying Computer Science is moderate to high, due to his love for puzzles and intelligence.
  - P(E|H) ≈ 0.7
- P(E|\neg H): The likelihood of Adam having the described personality if he was NOT studying Computer Science remains moderately high.
  - P(E|\neg H) ≈ 0.8

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is high, considering his strong love for nature, plants, animals, and empathy.
  - P(H) ≈ 0.6
- P(E|H): The likelihood of Adam having the described personality if he was studying Agricultural and Veterinary Science is very high.
  - P(E|H) ≈ 0.9
- P(E|\neg H): The likelihood of Adam having the described personality if he was NOT studying Agricultural and Veterinary Science is lower, given the close alignment of his interests with this field.
  - P(E|\neg H) ≈ 0.5

Now, we need to calculate P(H|E) using the proportionality relationship. 

### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} \approx 0.2 \cdot 0.1 = 0.02 \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{computer science}} \approx 0.7 \cdot 0.3 = 0.21 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} \approx 0.9 \cdot 0.6 = 0.54 \]

Normalizing these values so they sum to 1 gives us:

\[ \text{Total} = 0.02 + 0.21 + 0.54 = 0.77 \]

So,
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} = \frac{0.02}{0.77} \approx 0.026 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{computer science}} = \frac{0.21}{0.77} \approx 0.273 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} = \frac{0.54}{0.77} \approx 0.701 \]

Therefore, the final result is:

{
  "business administration": 0.026,
  "computer science": 0.273,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.701
}
