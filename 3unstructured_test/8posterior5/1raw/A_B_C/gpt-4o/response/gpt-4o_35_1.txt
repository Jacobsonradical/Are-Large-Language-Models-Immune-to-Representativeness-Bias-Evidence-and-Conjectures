To assess the probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) and then compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to make some reasonable estimates based on Adam's personality sketch and the nature of the fields. 

### Preliminary Assessments

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- **P(H)**: This is the initial (prior) probability of Adam being in this field. Given his interest in nature, plants, and animals, let's assume a higher prior probability here. Let's say 0.25.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam's traits given he is in agricultural or veterinary science. Given his curiosity about nature and love for animals, this is quite high. Let's assign it 0.9.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam's traits given he is NOT in this field. We would expect that these traits are less common in other fields, so perhaps 0.4.

#### Computer Science:
- **P(H)**: The prior probability of being in this field. Assuming computer science is a common graduate field and knowing Adam's intelligence and puzzle-solving skills, let's say 0.3.
- **P(E|H)**: Probability of Adam's traits given he is in computer science. His intelligence and skills match, but nature-related interests are uncommon, so maybe 0.5.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability of Adam's traits given he is not in computer science. This could be around 0.6 given a broader range of other fields. 

#### Business Administration:
- **P(H)**: The prior probability of this field. Given the general popularity but less alignment with Adam's traits, let's assign it 0.2.
- **P(E|H)**: Probability of Adam's traits given he is in business. His empathy and intelligence fit, but other traits are unusual, so maybe 0.3.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability of Adam's traits if not in business administration. This probability might be similar to others, around 0.6.

### Applying Bayes' Rule
Bayes' Rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \).

Let's approximate \( P(E) \) assuming there are few other major fields:

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.4 \cdot 0.75) = 0.225 + 0.3 = 0.525 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.525} = \frac{0.225}{0.525} \approx 0.429 \]

#### Computer Science:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.5 \cdot 0.3) + (0.6 \cdot 0.7) = 0.15 + 0.42 = 0.57 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.3}{0.57} = \frac{0.15}{0.57} \approx 0.263 \]

#### Business Administration:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.2) + (0.6 \cdot 0.8) = 0.06 + 0.48 = 0.54 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.54} = \frac{0.06}{0.54} \approx 0.111 \]

Thus, we have:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.429,
  "computer science": 0.263,
  "business administration": 0.111
}
