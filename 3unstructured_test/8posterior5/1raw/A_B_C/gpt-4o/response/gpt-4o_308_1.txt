To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to follow these steps:

1. Estimate \( P(H) \) - the prior probability of Adam being in each of the respective fields.
2. Estimate \( P(E|H) \) - the likelihood of Adam having the given personality sketch if he is in each field.
3. Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) - the likelihood of Adam having the given personality sketch if he is not in the specified field.
4. Use Bayes' rule: \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \)

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant and the same for all fields, we can neglect it for the purpose of comparison.

While precise numerical estimates can be complex and context-dependent, we can provide a reasonable qualitative analysis:

### Assumptions:
- **Prior Probabilities \(P(H)\)**:
  - Computer Science: Given the high number of students in this field, we assume a moderate prior. Let's say \( P(\text{CS}) = 0.3 \) (30%).
  - Business Administration: Typically, fewer students compared to sciences, let's assume \( P(\text{BA}) = 0.2 \) (20%).
  - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Relatively specialized but fitting Adam's personality, let's say \( P(\text{AVS}) = 0.15 \) (15%).

### Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \):
- **Computer Science**: While high intelligence and abstract thinking apply, the other personality traits are less typical for CS. Let's give a lower likelihood: \( P(E|\text{CS}) = 0.2 \).
- **Business Administration**: Traits like empathy and love for animals don't strongly align with personality expectations in business. Let's give a lower likelihood: \( P(E|\text{BA}) = 0.1 \).
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Strong fit with curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work. Higher likelihood: \( P(E|\text{AVS}) = 0.7 \).

### Complement Likelihoods \( P(E|\neg H) \):
- We'll assume these are the inverse conditions but simplified with equal rough estimates for the sake of this exercise.

Now, we can estimate conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \):

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3 * 0.2 / (normalizing constant),
  "business administration": 0.2 * 0.1 / (normalizing constant),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.15 * 0.7 / (normalizing constant)
}
```

For clarity, let's calculate the constant by adding denominators:

\[ \text{Sum of weighted probabilities} = 0.3 \times 0.2 + 0.2 \times 0.1 + 0.15 \times 0.7 \]
\[ = 0.06 + 0.02 + 0.105 = 0.185 \]

Now, calculate individually:

- **Computer Science**: \( \frac{0.06}{0.185} = 0.324 \)
- **Business Administration**: \( \frac{0.02}{0.185} = 0.108 \)
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: \( \frac{0.105}{0.185} = 0.568 \)

So, the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) can be approximated as:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.324,
  "business administration": 0.108,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.568
}
```

Please note these values are approximate and reflect a qualitative analysis based on given known information and generalized assumptions.
