Sure, let's calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( P(E) \) stands for the total probability of the evidence, which can be calculated as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Though we don't have exact numerical values, we'll make reasonable estimates to evaluate the relative likelihoods.

### Given the personality sketch E:

1. **Computer Science**
   - **P(H)**: The general probability that a graduate student in the U.S. is in Computer Science. Let's consider this relatively high in the context of graduate studies, say 0.25.
   - **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is a Computer Science student. Due to Adam's interest in nature and animals, this might be lower for computer science students, possibly 0.1.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is not a Computer Science student. This could have a broader base, thus estimated at 0.5.

   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{(0.1 \cdot 0.25)}{(0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.5 \cdot 0.75)} = \frac{0.025}{0.025 + 0.375} \approx 0.0625
   \]

2. **Business Administration**
   - **P(H)**: The base probability for Business Administration is also relatively high, let's assign it 0.20.
   - **P(E|H)**: Given the business administration field, Adam’s personality sketch might be less likely, possibly 0.05.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: As before, estimated 0.5.

   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{(0.05 \cdot 0.20)}{(0.05 \cdot 0.20 + 0.5 \cdot 0.80)} = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.4} \approx 0.024
   \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - **P(H)**: Given fewer students might be in this niche field, let’s estimate 0.10.
   - **P(E|H)**: This field aligns closely with Adam’s described interests, so we say 0.7.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: Same broader base as before, 0.5.

   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{(0.7 \cdot 0.10)}{(0.7 \cdot 0.10 + 0.5 \cdot 0.90)} = \frac{0.07}{0.07 + 0.45} \approx 0.1346
   \]

Here's the probability of Adam being in each field given the personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": 0.0625,
  "business administration": 0.024,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.1346
