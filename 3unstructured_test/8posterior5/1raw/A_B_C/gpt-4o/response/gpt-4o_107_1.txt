To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Rule, we need to evaluate \( P(H), P(E|H), \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Bayes' Rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is constant for all hypotheses, we only need to compare the numerators for each field to get the relative probabilities.

Here are the steps:

1. **Define priors \( P(H) \)**:
   - Business Administration: Approximately moderate likelihood given its popularity.
   - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Lower likelihood due to being a more specialized field.
   - Computer Science: High likelihood due to the popularity and broad scope of the field.

2. **Define likelihoods \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Business Administration: Lower, as the personality traits do not strongly align with typical characteristics needed.
   - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Higher, as Adam's love for nature and animals aligns well.
   - Computer Science: Moderate, as problem-solving skills and high intelligence align well, despite other traits being less relevant.

3. **Define \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - This represents the probability of observing Adam's traits given he is not in the specific field. This is generally inverse to the specificity of the traits for the field.

### Assigning Values:

**Business Administration**:
- \( P(H) \): 0.3 (moderate likelihood)
- \( P(E|H) \): 0.1 (traits do not strongly align)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): 0.3 (traits not specific to the field)

\[ P(H|E) \propto \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.3}{0.3} = 0.1 \]

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
- \( P(H) \): 0.1 (specialized field, lower prior)
- \( P(E|H) \): 0.7 (traits strongly align)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): 0.2 (traits somewhat unique to the field)

\[ P(H|E) \propto \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.2} = 0.35 \]

**Computer Science**:
- \( P(H) \): 0.4 (very popular field)
- \( P(E|H) \): 0.3 (moderate alignment with problem-solving skills and intelligence)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): 0.6 (common traits across multiple fields)

\[ P(H|E) \propto \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.4}{0.6} = 0.2 \]

### Final Probabilities (scaled to a sum of 1):

\[
{
  "business administration": \frac{0.1}{0.1 + 0.35 + 0.2} = \frac{0.1}{0.65} \approx 0.15,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \frac{0.35}{0.1 + 0.35 + 0.2} = \frac{0.35}{0.65} \approx 0.54,
  "computer science": \frac{0.2}{0.1 + 0.35 + 0.2} = \frac{0.2}{0.65} \approx 0.31
}
\]

Therefore:

\[
{
  "business administration": 0.15,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.54,
  "computer science": 0.31
}
\]
