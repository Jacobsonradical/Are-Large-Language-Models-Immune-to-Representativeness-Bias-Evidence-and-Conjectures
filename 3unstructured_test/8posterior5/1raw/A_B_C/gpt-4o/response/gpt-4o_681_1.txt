To estimate the probabilities, we'll use Bayes' rule: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without exact data on the probabilities, we'll make educated guesses based on typical characteristics associated with students in each field and the personality sketch of Adam.

### Assumptions:
1. **P(H):** The prior probabilities that a random graduate student is in each field.
   - Let's assume reasonably equal prior probabilities, given no additional information.
   - \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.33 \)
   - \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.33 \)
   - \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.33 \)
  
2. **P(E|H):** The likelihood of the personality sketch given each field.
   - Computer science: Adam's intelligence fits well, but his love for nature and animals is less typical.
     - \( P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.3 \)
   - Business administration: Adam's empathy and quiet nature are less typical traits for this field.
     - \( P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.1 \)
   - Agricultural and veterinary science: Adam's love for nature, animals, and dedication is highly typical.
     - \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.8 \)

3. **P(E|¬H):** The likelihood of the personality sketch given any other field. 
   - P(E|¬H) is assumed to give a rough combined likelihood of personality sketch E under the other fields. Since P(E) can be approximated by the average of P(E|H), we don't need to compute this explicitly in isolation.

Given these pieces of information, the probability P(H|E) can be computed as follows:

### Computations:
Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We approximate:
\[ P(E) = \sum P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Let's compute each part:

1. P(E) = \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) + P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})
+ P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \)

\[ 
  P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.33) + (0.1 \cdot 0.33) + (0.8 \cdot 0.33) \\
  = 0.099 + 0.033 + 0.264 \\
  = 0.396
\]

2. Compute P(H|E):

\[
  P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} \\
  = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.33}{0.396} \\
  \approx 0.25
\]

\[
  P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} \\
  = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.33}{0.396} \\
  \approx 0.083
\]

\[
  P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)} \\
  = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.33}{0.396} \\
  \approx 0.67
\]

### Results:
\[
{
  "computer science": 0.25, \\
  "business administration": 0.083, \\
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.67
}
\]
