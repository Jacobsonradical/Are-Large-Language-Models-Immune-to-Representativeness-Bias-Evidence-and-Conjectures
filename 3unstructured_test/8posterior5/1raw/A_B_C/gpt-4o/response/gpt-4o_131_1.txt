To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the specified fields of study given his personality sketch E, we will use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of enrolling in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis.

Since we're comparing relative probabilities across the fields rather than the exact probabilities, we'll consider the following steps:

1. **Assessing Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)**:
   For simplicity, let's assume the following subjective priors for the proportion of graduate students enrolled in each field:
   - Agricultural and veterinary science: \( P(H_{\text{ag}}) = 0.2 \)
   - Computer science: \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.4 \)
   - Business administration: \( P(H_{\text{ba}}) = 0.4 \)

2. **Assessing Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, and warmth, we expect a high likelihood:
     \( P(E|H_{\text{ag}}) = 0.7 \)
     Given this field is not chosen:
     \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{ag}}) = 0.1 \)
   - **Computer Science**: Solving puzzles and high intelligence support it, but less so for nature and animals.
     \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.4 \)
     Given this field is not chosen:
     \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.3 \)
   - **Business Administration**: His traits are less aligned with this field:
     \( P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) = 0.1 \)
     Given this field is not chosen:
     \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{ba}}) = 0.7 \)

3. **Calculation of P(E) (Total Marginal Probability)**:
   This is the weighted average of the likelihoods:
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{ag}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ag}}) + P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}}) + P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ba}})
   \]
   \[
   P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.2) + (0.4 \cdot 0.4) + (0.1 \cdot 0.4) = 0.14 + 0.16 + 0.04 = 0.34
   \]

4. **Computing Posterior Probabilities \( P(H|E) \)**:
   Using Bayes' rule:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{ag}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{ag}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ag}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.34} = \frac{0.14}{0.34} \approx 0.41
   \]
   \[
   P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.4}{0.34} = \frac{0.16}{0.34} \approx 0.47
   \]
   \[
   P(H_{\text{ba}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ba}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.4}{0.34} = \frac{0.04}{0.34} \approx 0.12
   \]

So, the probabilities are:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.41,
  "computer science": 0.47,
  "business administration": 0.12
}
```
