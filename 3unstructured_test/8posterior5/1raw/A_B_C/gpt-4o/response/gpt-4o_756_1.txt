Let's go through the evaluation and calculation step-by-step for each field given:

**1. Business Administration**
- **P(H_business) (Prior Probability):** Graduate programs in business administration are fairly common, but not overwhelmingly so. Let's assume a prior probability of 0.15.
- **P(E|H_business) (Likelihood):** The traits described (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals) are not typically associated with business administration. Let's assume a low likelihood, say 0.05.
- **P(E|¬H_business) (Likelihood under null hypothesis):** This is the likelihood of observing the personality traits in someone not in business administration. Since these traits are less aligned with business, we expect they fit better with some other field. Assume 0.2. 

By Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to estimate \( P(E) \), which we can approximate by using:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

Assuming that we integrate over the three fields given:

\[ P(E) \approx 0.05 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 \approx 0.0075 + 0.17 = 0.1775 \]

Finally:

\[ P(H|E)_\text{business} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.15}{0.1775} \approx 0.042 \]

**2. Computer Science**
- **P(H_cs) (Prior Probability):** Graduate programs in computer science are quite common. Assume a prior of 0.3.
- **P(E|H_cs) (Likelihood):** Intelligence and problem-solving align well, but love for animals and nature do not. Assume a moderate likelihood of 0.15.
- **P(E|¬H_cs) (Likelihood under null hypothesis):** This is the likelihood of observing the personality traits in someone not in computer science. Assume 0.2.

\[ P(E) \approx 0.15 \cdot 0.3 + 0.2 \cdot 0.7 \approx 0.045 + 0.14 = 0.185 \]

Finally:

\[ P(H|E)_\text{cs} = \frac{0.15 \cdot 0.3}{0.185} \approx 0.243 \]

**3. Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
- **P(H_agri) (Prior Probability):** Less common than business, but still notable. Assume a prior of 0.1.
- **P(E|H_agri) (Likelihood):** The traits completely align with this field. Let's assume a very high likelihood, say 0.8.
- **P(E|¬H_agri) (Likelihood under null hypothesis):** Assume 0.2 to remain consistent.

\[ P(E) \approx 0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9 \approx 0.08 + 0.18 = 0.26 \]

Finally:

\[ P(H|E)_\text{agri} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.26} \approx 0.308 \]

So, the probabilities would be:

{
  "business administration": 0.042,
  "computer science": 0.243,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.308
}

These values indicate that based on Adam's personality sketch, it is most likely that he was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, followed by Computer Science, and finally Business Administration.
