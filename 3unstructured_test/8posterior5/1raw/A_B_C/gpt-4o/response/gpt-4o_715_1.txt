To solve the problem, we'll apply Bayes' Theorem. The formula for Bayes' Theorem is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, because we are comparing fields, we don't need the absolute value of \( P(E) \), just the relative values of \( P(H|E) \). Our strategy involves estimating \( P(H) \) (the prior probability of being enrolled in a given field), \( P(E|H) \) (the probability of the personality sketch given enrollment in that field), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) (the probability of the personality sketch given not being enrolled in that field).

### Given Probabilities:
Let's assume some reasonable prior probabilities (\( P(H) \)) based on typical enrollment distributions and estimate evidence matching (\( P(E|H) \)) for each field:

1. **Computer Science**
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
3. **Business Administration**

### Assumptions and Estimates:

1. **Computer Science**
   - \( P(H_{CS}) \): Let's assume the prior probability of being enrolled in Computer Science: 0.2 (20%)
   - \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Probability that someone in computer science matches the personality sketch. Given Adam's interest in abstract concepts and puzzles, but not specifically technical or programming inclination, let's estimate it at: 0.4
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \): It's less likely for someone not in computer science to match the abstract thinking part, but still possible. Let's estimate it at: 0.05

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - \( P(H_{AVS}) \): Let's assume the prior probability of being enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.1 (10%)
   - \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \): Given that Adam has a genuine interest in nature, plants, and animals, this probability would be high: 0.9
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \): It's unlikely for someone not in this field to match Adam's detailed interest, so let's keep it low: 0.02

3. **Business Administration**
   - \( P(H_{BA}) \): Let's assume the prior probability of being enrolled in Business Administration: 0.15 (15%)
   - \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): It's unlikely for the personality sketch, which focuses on nature and empathy, to match someone in business administration. Let's estimate it at: 0.1
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \): More likely to generate this personality sketch in other areas, so: 0.1

### Bayes Rule Application:
To compute \( P(H|E) \), we don't need the exact value of \( P(E) \). We need relative values to compare fields.

1. **Computer Science:** 
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = 0.08 / P(E) \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = 0.09 / P(E) \]

3. **Business Administration:**
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} = 0.015 / P(E) \]

Relative probabilities (ignoring \( P(E) \)):

{
  "computer science": 0.08,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.09,
  "business administration": 0.015 
}

Note: These values give a relative measure. Higher values indicate higher posterior probabilities. Given these values, the most likely field relative to the personality sketch is **agricultural and veterinary science**.
