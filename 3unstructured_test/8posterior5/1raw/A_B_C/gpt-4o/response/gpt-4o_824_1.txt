Let's apply Bayes' Theorem to compute the probability that Adam is enrolled in each field given his personality sketch. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam having the personality sketch given he is enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of Adam having the personality sketch E.

### Assumptions

Since we don't have specific prior probabilities, let's assume that \( P(H) \) is uniform across fields for simplicity.

### Estimations

Let's estimate how well Adam's personality sketch matches the typical student profile in each of these fields:

- **Business Administration**:
  - \( P(E|H) \): Moderate. Traits like curiosity, intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts could be useful in business administration, but empathy and a deep love for animals are less relevant.
  - Estimated \( P(E|H_{BA}) \approx 0.4 \)
  
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  - \( P(E|H) \): High. Curiosity about nature, empathy, and a love for animals are highly relevant to this field.
  - Estimated \( P(E|H_{AV}) \approx 0.8 \)
  
- **Computer Science**:
  - \( P(E|H) \): Moderate to High. Intelligence, problem-solving skills, and understanding abstract concepts are very relevant, but the other traits are less specific to this field.
  - Estimated \( P(E|H_{CS}) \approx 0.6 \)

### Calculating Posteriors
Assume:
- \( P(H_{BA}) = P(H_{AV}) = P(H_{CS}) = \frac{1}{3} \)
- For simplicity, assume \( P(E) \) is the same across all fields and thus cancels out in the relative comparison of posteriors.

Let's calculate the posterior probabilities (up to a common factor):

1. **Business Administration**:
   \[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 0.133 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[ P(H_{AV}|E) \propto P(E|H_{AV}) \cdot P(H_{AV}) = 0.8 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 0.267 \]

3. **Computer Science**:
   \[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) = 0.6 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 0.200 \]

### Normalizing

To provide final values:

\[ P(H_{TOTAL}) = 0.133 + 0.267 + 0.200 = 0.6 \]

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.133}{0.6} \approx 0.22 \]

\[ P(H_{AV}|E) = \frac{0.267}{0.6} \approx 0.45 \]

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.200}{0.6} \approx 0.33 \]

### Final Answer

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.22,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.45,
  "computer science": 0.33
}
```

These values indicate the relative likelihood that Adam was in each field given his personality sketch, based on the assumptions and estimations made.
