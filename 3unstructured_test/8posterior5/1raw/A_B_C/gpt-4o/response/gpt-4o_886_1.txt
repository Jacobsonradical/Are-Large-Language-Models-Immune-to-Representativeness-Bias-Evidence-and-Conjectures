To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in each of these fields (computer science, agricultural and veterinary science, business administration), we need to use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we do not have the precise numerical probabilities, we'll make reasonable assumptions based on the personality sketch (E) of Adam and common knowledge about these fields.

1. **Computer Science:**
   * P(H): Probability that a typical graduate student is enrolled in computer science.
     - Assume P(H) is moderate given the popularity of CS in graduate studies, say 0.3.
   * P(E|H): Probability of the personality sketch given computer science.
     - Adam is intelligent and good at abstract concepts, which fits computer science. However, his interest in nature and animals doesn't align strongly with CS. So, let's assume P(E|H) as 0.2.
   * P(E|¬H): Probability of the personality sketch given he is not in computer science.
     - Adam's personality traits might fit other fields better, so P(E|¬H) might be higher, say 0.6.

   Using these assumptions:
   \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \times 0.3 = 0.06 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   * P(H): Probability that a typical graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
     - It's less common than some fields but fits well with someone who loves nature and animals, let's assume P(H) as 0.1.
   * P(E|H): Probability of the personality sketch given agricultural and veterinary science.
     - Adam's traits match very well with this field, so P(E|H) is high, say 0.8.
   * P(E|¬H): Probability of the personality sketch given he is not in agricultural and veterinary science.
     - Since this trait closely matches this field, let's assume P(E|¬H) as 0.4.

   Using these assumptions:
   \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \]

3. **Business Administration:**
   * P(H): Probability that a typical graduate student is enrolled in business administration.
     - This is a common field, so assume P(H) is moderate, say 0.3.
   * P(E|H): Probability of the personality sketch given business administration.
     - Adam's personality doesn't align closely with this field, so assume P(E|H) as 0.1.
   * P(E|¬H): Probability of the personality sketch given he is not in business administration.
     - His traits might fit other fields better than business administration, assume P(E|¬H) as 0.5.

   Using these assumptions:
   \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \times 0.3 = 0.03 \]

By comparing these computed quantities (although not normalized), the probabilities of Adam being in each field are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.06,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08,
  "business administration": 0.03
}
```
Note that these values are not normalized; they provide relative likelihoods based on the given assumptions and need normalization to add up to a probability distribution.
