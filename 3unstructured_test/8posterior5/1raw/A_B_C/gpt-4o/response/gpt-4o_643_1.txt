To apply Bayes' Rule, we need to compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam. Bayes' Rule is given by:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Given that \( P(E) \) is the same for all hypotheses, it cancels out when comparing relative probabilities. Instead, we'll focus on estimating \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) qualitatively. Here’s an estimate:

1. **Business Administration**:
    - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a graduate student chooses Business Administration. This is reasonably high as Business Administration is a popular field.
    - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam’s characteristics fit someone in Business Administration. This is somewhat lower because Adam’s love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles may not be as directly correlated with Business Administration.
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam’s characteristics fitting into any field other than Business Administration. This might be relatively higher, given the specific nature of Adam’s interests.
    - \(\Rightarrow P(H|E)\): Low to Moderate

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - \( P(H) \): The prior probability might be moderate, as this field is less common than Business Administration but still significant.
    - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam fits this field is very high given his genuine curiosity about nature, plants, animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication.
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam’s same characteristics fitting into another field could be moderately lower but not extremely low.
    - \(\Rightarrow P(H|E)\): High

3. **Computer Science**:
    - \( P(H) \): The prior probability is quite high because Computer Science is a very popular field among graduate students.
    - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam fits this field is moderate to high considering his intelligence, love for solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts.
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam’s characteristics being applicable to a field other than Computer Science could be moderate, given that many fields value intelligence and problem-solving skills.
    - \(\Rightarrow P(H|E)\): Moderate to High

Based on these qualitative assessments, here are the rough values for \( P(H|E) \):

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

These values reflect that Adam is most likely to be in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, followed by a respectable chance in Computer Science, and least likely in Business Administration based on the given personality sketch.
