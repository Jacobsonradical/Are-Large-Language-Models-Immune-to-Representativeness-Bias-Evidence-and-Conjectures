To compute the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field of study given his personality sketch \(E\), we will use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we are comparing multiple fields, the exact value of \(P(E)\) is not necessary for our comparison, as it will be the same for all fields and thus proportional calculations will suffice.

Let's assess \(P(H)\), \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E|\neg H)\) for each field:

### Business Administration
- \(P(H)\): The prior probability that a U.S. graduate student is in business administration can be considered moderate, around 0.15 (15%).
- \(P(E|H)\): Given Adam’s interests and personality traits, they do not strongly align with the typical interest in business administration, so this probability is low, around 0.05 (5%).
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): Given the number of other graduate fields, the complement of \(H\) would include a large number of students, so this probability is moderate, around 0.3 (30%).

We calculate:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H)P(H) = 0.05 \times 0.15 = 0.0075 \]

### Computer Science
- \(P(H)\): The prior probability that a U.S. graduate student is in computer science is fairly high, around 0.2 (20%).
- \(P(E|H)\): Adam is good at understanding abstract concepts and enjoys solving puzzles, which aligns well, so this probability is moderate to high, around 0.6 (60%).
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): This includes various other fields, including non-STEM, so this probability is moderate, around 0.4 (40%).

We calculate:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H)P(H) = 0.6 \times 0.2 = 0.12 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \(P(H)\): The prior probability that a U.S. graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science is relatively low, around 0.05 (5%).
- \(P(E|H)\): Given Adam’s love for nature, plants, and animals, it aligns strongly, so this probability is high, around 0.8 (80%).
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): Again, this includes various other fields, so this probability is moderate, around 0.3 (30%).

We calculate:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H)P(H) = 0.8 \times 0.05 = 0.04 \]

Now, to summarize the results:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0075,
  "computer science": 0.12,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.04
}
```

These values reflect the relative likelihood of Adam being in each field given his personality traits.
