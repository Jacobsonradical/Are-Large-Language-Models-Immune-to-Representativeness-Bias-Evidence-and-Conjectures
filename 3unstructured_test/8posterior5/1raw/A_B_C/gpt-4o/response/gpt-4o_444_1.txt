To calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to determine the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E|\neg H) \). For the sake of this calculation, I'll make reasonable assumptions about these values based on general knowledge:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

For simplicity, I'll assume \( P(\neg H) \) is the sum of probabilities for the mentioned fields. We'll assume that each field has an equal prior probability, \( P(H) = 0.33 \) (since there are three fields being considered and no reasoning to favor one over another based on just P(H)). Adjusting these priors based on real-world data or graduate field distributions would make this more accurate.

### 1. **Computer Science**:
- **Prior \( P(H) \)**: 0.33
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's intellectual and abstract reasoning skills, but less alignment with his nature and empathy interests, let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).
- **Evidence \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Given Adam's personality, he fits more with other fields. Assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.7 / 2 = 0.35 \) (excluding CS itself).

### 2. **Business Administration**:
- **Prior \( P(H) \)**: 0.33
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's empathy and different interest profile compared to a typical business administration skillset, let's say \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
- **Evidence \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Suitable fit with the other fields means adjusting with \( 0.7 / 2 = 0.35 \) (excluding BA itself).

### 3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
- **Prior \( P(H) \)**: 0.33
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's love for nature, animals, and empathy aligns well, so let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).
- **Evidence \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Splitting evidence among others, \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.15 \) (excluding AVS itself).

Let's calculate the posterior \( P(H|E) \):

### For Computer Science:
\[ P(E) = (P(E|CS) \times P(CS)) + (P(E|\neg CS) \times P(\neg CS)) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \times 0.33) + (0.35 \times 0.67) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.066 + 0.2345 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.3005 \]

\[ P(CS|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.33}{0.3005} \]
\[ P(CS|E) \approx 0.219 \]

### For Business Administration:
\[ P(E) = 0.1 \times 0.33 + 0.35 \times 0.67 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.033 + 0.2345 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.2675 \]

\[ P(BA|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.33}{0.2675} \]
\[ P(BA|E) \approx 0.123 \]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(E) = 0.9 \times 0.33 + 0.15 \times 0.67 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.297 + 0.1005 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.3975 \]

\[ P(AVS|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.33}{0.3975} \]
\[ P(AVS|E) \approx 0.748 \]

Based on these calculations, the probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": "0.219",
  "business administration": "0.123",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.748"
