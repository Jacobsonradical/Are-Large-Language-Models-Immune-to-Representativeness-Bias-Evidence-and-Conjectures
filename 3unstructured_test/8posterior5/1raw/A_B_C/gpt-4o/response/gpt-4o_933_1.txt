To evaluate the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in different fields of study given his personality sketch (E), we can use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a field \( H \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is in field \( H \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is in any field other than \( H \).
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in field \( H \) given his personality sketch \( E \).

Since the absolute values of \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) are not provided, we can focus on the relative comparisons and reasoning based on the description to make estimated relative judgments.

### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): Moderate to high, given the importance of this field.
- \( P(E|H) \): High, given Adam's curiosity about nature, warm heart, empathy, and love for animals align well with this field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Lower, since the described traits are less common in non-related fields compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

### 2. Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): Moderate to high, given the popularity of this field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Low, given business administration typically requires an interest in management, finance, and similar topics that are not evident in the personality sketch.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Higher, since these traits could still be found in other fields.

### 3. Computer Science
- \( P(H) \): Moderate to high, given the prominence of this field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Moderate, given the intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles fit the profile, but the lack of mention of technology or computing dampens this probability.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Higher, since problem-solving skills are valued in many other fields.

### Posterior Probabilities
Considering the above reasoning to derive relative probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

This breakdown suggests that given Adam's personality sketch, he is most likely to be found in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, with a smaller chance that he is studying Computer Science, and the least likely to be in Business Administration.
