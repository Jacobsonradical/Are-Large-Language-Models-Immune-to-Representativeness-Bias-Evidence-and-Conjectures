To compute \( P(H|E) \), we need to use Bayes' Rule, defined as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) * P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is identical for all fields and is not necessary for comparative purposes, we'll omit it in the calculations. Here's a step-by-step approach for each field:

1. **Business Administration**

   - **P(H)**: The prior probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in business administration. Let's denote this as relatively moderate given the number of MBA programs: 0.2.
   - **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam exhibits his specific traits given he is a business administration student. These traits, especially his empathy and interest in puzzles, might somewhat align but not strongly. Let’s assign a low value: 0.1.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that Adam exhibits his traits given he is not a business administration student. Given that his traits align better with other fields, we can assign it a higher value: 0.8.

   - Calculation for **P(H|E)**:
     \[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) * P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.1 * 0.2}{P(E)} \]

2. **Computer Science**

   - **P(H)**: The prior probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in computer science. Let's denote this relatively high given the field's popularity: 0.3.
   - **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam exhibits his traits given he is a computer science student. His traits of solving puzzles and high intelligence align well, but less so his love for nature and animals. Let’s assign a moderate value: 0.4.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam’s traits given he is not a computer science student. This can be balanced as other fields might align more closely. Assign value: 0.7.

   - Calculation for **P(H|E)**:
     \[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) * P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.4 * 0.3}{P(E)} \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

   - **P(H)**: The prior probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let’s denote this as lower given fewer programs: 0.1.
   - **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam exhibits his traits given he is a student in agricultural and veterinary science. His love for nature and animals is a strong fit. Assign a high value: 0.9.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam’s traits given he is not an agricultural and veterinary science student. This would be relatively low as his traits strongly align with this field: 0.4.

   - Calculation for **P(H|E)**:
     \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 * 0.1}{P(E)} \]

Plugging in these values for comparative purposes (while remembering that \( P(E) \) remains a constant divisor across fields that can be disregarded for ordering probabilities):

{
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.02}{P(E)} \approx 0.025 \),
  "computer science": \( \frac{0.12}{P(E)} \approx 0.171 \),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{0.09}{P(E)} \approx 0.225 \)
}

Thus, the relative probabilities, disregarding the common denomenator, are:

{
  "business administration": 0.025,
  "computer science": 0.171,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.225
}
