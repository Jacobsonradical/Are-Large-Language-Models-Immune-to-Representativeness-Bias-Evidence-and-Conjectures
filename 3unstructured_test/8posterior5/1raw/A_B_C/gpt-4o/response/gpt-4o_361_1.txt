To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we will need the values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Here is a step-by-step breakdown for each field:

### Business Administration

Let's assume that the probability of a random graduate student being in Business Administration, \( P(H_{BA}) \), is relatively high due to its popularity.
- \( P(H_{BA}) \approx 0.2 \)

Given Adam's personality sketch, it seems less likely for him to be in Business Administration because his interests and traits do not align strongly with this field.
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \approx 0.1 \)

The probability of someone not in Business Administration having Adam's characteristics might be more common.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \approx 0.4 \)

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]
Since \( P(E) \) is a normalization factor and is the same across all fields, we can simplify to use relative comparison:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

### Computer Science

Assume a reasonable average probability for a graduate student to be in Computer Science.
- \( P(H_{CS}) \approx 0.15 \)

Adam's traits (solving puzzles, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts) align relatively strongly with this field.
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \approx 0.5 \)

The probability of someone not in Computer Science having Adam's characteristics is moderate.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \approx 0.3 \)

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto 0.5 \cdot 0.15 = 0.075 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

Assume a lower probability for a graduate student to be in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
- \( P(H_{AVS}) \approx 0.1 \)

Adam's deep love for animals and curiosity about nature and plants make this a very suitable field.
- \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \approx 0.8 \)

The probability of someone not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science having Adam's characteristics is lower.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \approx 0.25 \)

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]

### Consolidated Results

Here are the computed probabilities for each field using normalized values for comparison purposes:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.075,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08
}
```

Note: These probabilities are simplified and can be adjusted with more detailed information or assumptions about each field and general graduate student distribution.
