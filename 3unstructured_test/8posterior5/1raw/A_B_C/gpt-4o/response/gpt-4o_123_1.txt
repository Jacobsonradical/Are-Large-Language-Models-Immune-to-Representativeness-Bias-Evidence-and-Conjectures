To estimate \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Rule, we need to determine the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). Bayes' Rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \), we will use this to calculate \( P(H|E) \).

Let's break down the estimates for each field:

### Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**
   - Computer science is a common field for graduate students, albeit not directly related to nature and animals.
   - Estimate: \( P(\text{CS}) = 0.2 \) 

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**
   - Adam's empathy, appreciation for nature and animals, and abstract thinking might translate to programming or problem-solving skills.
   - However, his love for animals and plants suggests it's less likely.
   - Estimate: \( P(E|\text{CS}) = 0.1 \)

3. **Non-Hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H) \)**
   - It's more likely his traits match a field like natural sciences.
   - Estimate: \( P(E|\neg \text{CS}) = 0.3 \)

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**
   - Business administration is another common field, though it doesn't strongly align with Adam's interests.
   - Estimate: \( P(\text{BA}) = 0.1 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**
   - His personality traits and hobbies donâ€™t strongly correlate with typical business administration requirements.
   - Estimate: \( P(E|\text{BA}) = 0.05 \)

3. **Non-Hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H) \)**
   - Considering non-business related fields must bear some of the traits.
   - Estimate: \( P(E|\neg \text{BA}) = 0.3 \)

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**
   - This field suits Adam's interests in nature, plants, and animals.
   - Estimate: \( P(\text{AgVet}) = 0.15 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**
   - Very high due to strong alignment with his listed interests and characteristics.
   - Estimate: \( P(E|\text{AgVet}) = 0.5 \)

3. **Non-Hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H) \)**
   - Less likely to reflect his interests as strongly.
   - Estimate: \( P(E|\neg \text{AgVet}) = 0.2 \)

### Calculation using Bayes Rule


For Computer Science:

\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3(1 - 0.2)} \approx 0.043 \]

For Business Administration:

\[ P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{0.05 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3(1 - 0.1)} \approx 0.016 \]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[ P(\text{AgVet}|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.15}{0.5 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2(1 - 0.15)} \approx 0.269 \]

### Final Output
