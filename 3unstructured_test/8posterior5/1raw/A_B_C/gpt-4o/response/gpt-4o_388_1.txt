To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we first need to estimate the relevant prior probabilities \( P(H) \), as well as the conditional probabilities \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Let's walk through each field step by step. 

### 1. Business Administration

- **\( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \)**: Let's assume the prior probability that a graduate student is in Business Administration is modest (let's say 0.1 or 10%).
- **\( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \)**: The personality traits mentioned such as a love for nature, empathy, and interest in animals might be somewhat less typical among students of Business Administration. Let's assign a low likelihood (say 0.05).
- **\( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \)**: For students not in Business Administration, it is more likely to find traits that match Adam's. Let's assume this is higher (e.g., 0.3).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{BA})}} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.1}{0.05 \times 0.1 + 0.3 \times 0.9} = \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.27} = \frac{0.005}{0.275} \approx 0.018 \]

### 2. Computer Science

- **\( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \)**: Let's assume a slightly higher prior probability for Computer Science given its popularity (say 0.2 or 20%).
- **\( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \)**: The traits of high intelligence and abstract thinking are relevant, but the specific interests in nature and animals might be less typical. Let's assign a moderate likelihood (say 0.1).
- **\( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \)**: Traits not fully specific to Computer Science would still be common among students in other fields (let's assume 0.3).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{CS}})} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.1 \times 0.2 + 0.3 \times 0.8} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.24} = \frac{0.02}{0.26} \approx 0.077 \]

### 3. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **\( P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) \)**: Given the specific interests stated, the prior probability for Agriculture and Veterinary Science might be lower (let's assume 0.05 or 5%).
- **\( P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \)**: The traits directly match those in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, so let's assign a high likelihood (say 0.7).
- **\( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AgVet}}) \)**: Again, the likelihood outside this field would be lower (say 0.2).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_{\text{AgVet}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AgVet}})}{P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{AgVet}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{AgVet}})} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{AgVet}}|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.05}{0.7 \times 0.05 + 0.2 \times 0.95} = \frac{0.035}{0.035 + 0.19} = \frac{0.035}{0.225} \approx 0.156 \]

### Final Estimates

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.018,
  "computer science": 0.077,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.156
}
```

These values indicate the posterior probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each respective field given his personality sketch.
