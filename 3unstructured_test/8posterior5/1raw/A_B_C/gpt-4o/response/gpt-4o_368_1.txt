To solve this problem using Bayes' theorem, we'll need to evaluate the following probabilities for each of the three fields:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.
4. Finally, using Bayes' theorem: 
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]

Let's make some reasonable assumptions about these probabilities based on the personality sketch:

### Computer Science
1. \( P(H) \): Let's assume the percentage of students enrolled in computer science is relatively high in the U.S., but it's still one among many fields. Assume 10%.
2. \( P(E|H) \): Given that Adam has strong intelligence and enjoys solving puzzles, it's moderate to high that he's in computer science. Assume 0.6.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given that others can also have similar interests, we would set this lower than \( P(E|H) \). Assume 0.2.

### Business Administration
1. \( P(H) \): Assume 10% of graduate students are in business administration.
2. \( P(E|H) \): Given his empathy and appreciation for hard work, it's lower that heâ€™s in business administration, as this field often requires a different skill set and interest. Assume 0.2.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): Assume 0.3, accounting for overlap with other fields.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. \( P(H) \): This field is less common, so let's assume 5%.
2. \( P(E|H) \): Given his love for nature, animals, and empathy, it's quite high that he's in this field. Assume 0.8.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): Assume 0.1, since the traits are less common in other fields.

To compute \( P(H|E) \), we also need \( P(E) \), but since we're comparing \( P(H|E) \) relative to each other, we can ignore this and just compare the numerators:

\[
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H)P(H)
\]

So, we calculate as follows:

### Computer Science
\[
P(H|E) \propto 0.6 \times 0.1 = 0.06
\]

### Business Administration
\[
P(H|E) \propto 0.2 \times 0.1 = 0.02
\]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[
P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.05 = 0.04
\]

Converting these proportional values to a normalized form, we get:

\[
\text{Sum} = 0.06 + 0.02 + 0.04 = 0.12
\]

Thus:

\[
P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.12} = 0.5
\]

\[
P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.12} = 0.1667
\]

\[
P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.12} = 0.3333
\]

Therefore, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.1667,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3333
}
```
