To compute \( P(H|E) \), we'll use Bayes' rule: 

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To do this, we'll need to assign some values to the probabilities based on the personality sketch of Adam.

### Plausibility Assignments

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This represents the initial probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field before considering his personality sketch.
   - **Computer Science**: Let's assume a relatively higher prior due to the popularity of the field. \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.2 \)
   - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's curiosity about nature and his love for animals, let's assume a moderate prior. \( P(H_{AVS}) = 0.15 \)
   - **Business Administration**: Given no particular characteristic aligning with this field, let's assume a lower prior. \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.1 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This represents how likely it is for Adam's personality sketch to occur given he is in a specific field.
   - **Computer Science**: Adamâ€™s intelligence and problem-solving align well, but warmth and empathy might be less indicative. Let's give a moderate likelihood. \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.3 \)
   - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Strong indicators due to his love for nature, animals, and empathy. Let's give a higher likelihood. \( P(E|H_{AVS}) = 0.8 \)
   - **Business Administration**: Less alignment with his empathy and curiosity about nature. Let's give a lower likelihood. \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.1 \)

3. **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in a specific field.
   - To simplify, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the average likelihood considering other fields exist. Given Adam's traits, assume higher general likelihood across fields dominated by science, social work, etc. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \)

### Posterior Calculation

For each field:

#### Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]
Since \( P(E) \) is a normalization constant and appears in all calculations, we'll factor it out in the proportionality.

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto 0.3 \cdot 0.2 \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto 0.06 \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.15 \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \propto 0.12 \]

#### Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.1 \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto 0.01 \]

Now, we normalize these proportions to sum up to 1:
- Total proportional value = \( 0.06 + 0.12 + 0.01 = 0.19 \)

### Normalized Probabilities

- **Computer Science**: \( P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.19} \approx 0.316 \)
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: \( P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.19} \approx 0.632 \)
- **Business Administration**: \( P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.19} \approx 0.053 \)

Thus, the probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": 0.316,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.632,
  "business administration": 0.053
