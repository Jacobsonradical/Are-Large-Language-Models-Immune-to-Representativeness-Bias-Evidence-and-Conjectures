To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in each specific field given his personality sketch (E), we'll follow the steps outlined:

1. Assess the prior probability of Adam enrolling in each field, \( P(H) \).
2. Assess the likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits if he were enrolled in each field, \( P(E|H) \).
3. Assess the likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits if he were not enrolled in each field, \( P(E|\neg H) \).
4. Utilize these values within Bayes' Rule to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \).

I'll make some reasonable qualitative judgments to assign these probabilities.

### Step-by-Step Evaluation:

#### Business Administration
- **Prior Probability, \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \)**:
  Generally speaking, business administration is a common graduate field, so we might assign it a moderate prior probability.
  \[
  P(H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.2
  \]

- **Likelihood, \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \)**:
  Business students might not typically exhibit strong empathy, love for animals, or curiosity about nature. Therefore, the likelihood might be low but not impossible.
  \[
  P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.1
  \]

- **Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \)**:
  Assuming there are many other fields with individuals fitting Adam's description better, the likelihood should be higher.
  \[
  P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.4
  \]

#### Computer Science
- **Prior Probability, \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \)**:
  Considering the popularity of computer science among graduate students, we can assign it a moderate prior.
  \[
  P(H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.25
  \]

- **Likelihood, \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \)**:
  Computer science students might exhibit high intelligence and enjoy puzzles, aligning somewhat with Adam's profile.
  \[
  P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.3
  \]

- **Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \)**:
  This likelihood might be similar in magnitude since other fields also likely have empathetic and nature-curious students.
  \[
  P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.35
  \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **Prior Probability, \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \)**:
  Agricultural and veterinary science might be less common fields but highly specific, which fits Adam well.
  \[
  P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.15
  \]

- **Likelihood, \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \)**:
  This field strongly aligns with Adam's appreciation for nature, empathy, and love for animals.
  \[
  P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.7
  \]

- **Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \)**:
  Fewer outside fields might exhibit Adam's combination of qualities.
  \[
  P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.25
  \]

### Calculation of Posterior Probabilities using Bayes' Rule
Bayes' Rule:  
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Since \( P(E) \) is a summation over several plausible hypotheses and considering other fields of specialization, we assume the relative values stay consistent. Given that total sums do not need to add up to 1 (considering other fields as well), let's compute and compare.

For simplicity, let's compute and compare:

\[
P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \propto \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.4} = 0.05
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \approx 0.214
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) \propto \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.15}{0.25} = 0.42
\]

Now scaling these proportionally:

\[
\text{Sum of P(H|E)} \approx 0.05 + 0.214 + 0.42 \approx 0.684
\]

Normalizing them to not exceed 1:

\[
P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \approx \frac{0.05}{0.684} \approx 0.073
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx \frac{0.214}{0.684} \approx 0.313
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) \approx \frac{0.42}{0.684} \approx 0.614
\]

Final result:

  "business administration": 0.073,
  "computer science": 0.313,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.614
