Sure, let's go through the process of calculating \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Bayes' rule formula**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]

2. **Define our terms**:
   - \( P(H) \): Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood of Adam's personality traits given that he's enrolled in that field.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of Adam's personality traits given that he is not enrolled in that field.
   - \( P(E) \): Total probability of Adam's personality traits, which can be calculated as a weighted sum of \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for all fields plus other fields.

Since we aren't given explicit values for these probabilities, we'll make reasonable assumptions based on the context.

### Assumptions:
- **Prior probabilities \( P(H) \)**:
  - Assume the probability of any student choosing a specific field is roughly equal, but agricultural and veterinary science might be a bit lower due to fewer students generally choosing that path.

  Let's assume:
  - \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.25 \)
  - \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.15 \)
  - \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.25 \)
  - The remaining 0.35 is for other fields.

- **Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \)**:
  Based on Adam's traits:
  - \( P(E|\text{business administration}) \): Lower, as personality traits strongly align with other fields.
  - \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \): Very high due to his love for nature, plants, and animals.
  - \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \): Moderate, as analytical and puzzle-solving traits fit, though nature and animals less so.

  Let's assume:
  - \( P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.05 \)
  - \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.8 \)
  - \( P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.4 \)

- **Total probability \( P(E) \)**:
  We sum over all fields. However, considering three fields for simplicity, we balance proportions.

  \[
  P(E) \approx P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) + P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) + P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})
  \]

  Substituting our values:
  \[
  P(E) \approx 0.05 \cdot 0.25 + 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.4 \cdot 0.25
  \]
  \[
  P(E) \approx 0.0125 + 0.12 + 0.1 = 0.2325
  \]

### Now, using Bayes' rule:

- **Business Administration**:
  \[
  P(H|\text{Business Administration}) = \frac{P(E|\text{Business Administration}) \cdot P(\text{Business Administration})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.25}{0.2325} \approx 0.0538
  \]

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  \[
  P(H|\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) = \frac{P(E|\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) \cdot P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.2325} \approx 0.5155
  \]

- **Computer Science**:
  \[
  P(H|\text{Computer Science}) = \frac{P(E|\text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.25}{0.2325} \approx 0.4290
  \]

Therefore, the probabilities are approximately:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0538,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5155,
  "computer science": 0.4290
}
```
