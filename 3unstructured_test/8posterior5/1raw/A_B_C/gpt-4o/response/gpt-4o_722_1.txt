To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to evaluate the following components for each field:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not enrolled in that field.

Let's make some reasonable assumptions for these probabilities:

### Assumptions
1. \( P(H) \) - Prior probabilities:
   - Computer Science: Assume this is a popular field, so \( P(H) = 0.3 \).
   - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Assume this is less common, so \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
   - Business Administration: This is also a popular field, so \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

2. \( P(E|H) \) - Likelihood:
   - Computer Science: Given Adam's interest in puzzles and high intelligence, but a weaker link to nature and animals, assume \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).
   - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Given Adam's love for animals, nature, and empathy, assume \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).
   - Business Administration: This field is less aligned with his interests in nature and animals. Assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - For simplicity, let's assume this to be the same across all fields since it's a baseline likelihood given he is not in a specific field:
   - Assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

### Bayes' Rule Calculations
Now, using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) \) can be considered as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]

Let's compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field.

### Computer Science
\[ P(H) = 0.3 \]
\[ P(E|H) = 0.2 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \]
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \times 0.3) + (0.2 \times 0.7) = 0.06 + 0.14 = 0.2 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.3}{0.2} = 0.3 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H) = 0.1 \]
\[ P(E|H) = 0.7 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \]
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \times 0.1) + (0.2 \times 0.9) = 0.07 + 0.18 = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.1}{0.25} = 0.28 \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(H) = 0.2 \]
\[ P(E|H) = 0.1 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \]
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.2) + (0.2 \times 0.8) = 0.02 + 0.16 = 0.18 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.18} \approx 0.11 \]

Thus, the final probabilities for each field given the evidence are as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.28,
  "business administration": 0.11
}
```

Note that these values are based on the assumptions made and are intended to illustrate the use of Bayes' Rule. Adjustments to the assumptions could change the computed probabilities.
