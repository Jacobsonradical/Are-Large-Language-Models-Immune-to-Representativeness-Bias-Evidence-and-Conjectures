To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field given Adam's personality sketch, we can follow the steps outlined:

1. **Estimate Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
   - General prior probabilities for each field based on typical enrollments.

2. **Estimate Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   - The likelihood that Adam's personality traits fit each field.

3. **Estimate Marginal Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   - The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch fitting other fields.

4. **Combine using Bayes' Rule:**
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   Where \( P(E) \) can be inferred as part of the normalization factor and is not strictly necessary for a comparative analysis.

### Assumptions:
- **P(H)** for each field is set somewhat arbitrarily but reasonably.
- **P(E|H)** is judged based on how well Adam’s personality aligns with typical characteristics of each field.
- **P(E|\neg H)** is considered in relation to the general probability across other fields.

### Estimations:
- \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \) for each specific field (assuming equal prior probabilities for simplicity, though in reality these might be weighted differently).
- \( P(E|H) \) is assigned based on the alignment score of Adam’s traits with each field.

### Fields:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - **P(H)**: 0.3
   - **P(E|H)**: Moderate. Adam’s high intelligence and abstract thinking fit but less so his love for nature and animals. \( P(E|CS) \approx 0.4 \)
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: Considering the general distribution, this might be slightly less due to potential misalignment with other broad fields.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - **P(H)**: 0.3
   - **P(E|H)**: High. Adam’s appreciation of nature, empathy, love for animals, and hard work align well. \( P(E|AVS) \approx 0.9 \)
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: Likely lower in contrast to his specific alignment here.

3. **Business Administration:**
   - **P(H)**: 0.3
   - **P(E|H)**: Low. Business traits often include leadership, economic thinking, which are less consistent with his warm-hearted, nature-oriented traits. \( P(E|BA) \approx 0.2 \)
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: Comparatively higher since many unrelated fields might have coincidental alignment (abstract thinking).

### Normalizing and Applying Bayes:

- For each field, we modify:
  - **Computer Science:** 
    \[
    P(CS|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{N}
    \]
  - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
    \[
    P(AVS|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.3}{N}
    \]
  - **Business Administration:**
    \[
    P(BA|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{N}
    \]

Calculating (N as common normalization):

- Computer Science:
  \[
  P(CS|E) \approx 0.12
  \]

- Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
  \[
  P(AVS|E) \approx 0.27
  \]

- Business Administration:
  \[
  P(BA|E) \approx 0.06
  \]
