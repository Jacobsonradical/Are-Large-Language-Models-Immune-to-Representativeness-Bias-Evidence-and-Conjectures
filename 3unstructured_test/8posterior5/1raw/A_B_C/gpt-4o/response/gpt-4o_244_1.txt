To solve this problem, we'll utilize Bayes' theorem, which is stated as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in the particular field given the evidence \(E\) (the personality sketch).
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the evidence \(E\) being true if Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in that particular field.
- \( P(E) \): The overall probability of the evidence, considering all fields.

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for each field in relative comparison, we only need to compare the numerators for each field and then normalize the probabilities if needed.

We will proceed by making subjective estimates for each probability:

1. **Computer Science**
   - \(P(H)\): Moderate (let's assume 0.3) - Computer Science is a fairly common graduate field.
   - \(P(E|H)\): Low (let's assume 0.1) - Adam's personality sketch does not strongly align with typical traits associated with Computer Science students.
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\): Represents the probability of the personality sketch occurring outside of Computer Science. Given there are many fields, let's assume it is reasonably high (0.8).

2. **Business Administration**
   - \(P(H)\): Moderate (let's assume 0.2) - Business Administration is also fairly common.
   - \(P(E|H)\): Low (let's assume 0.05) - Adam's personality traits do not align closely with Business Administration students.
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\): Again, let's assume a reasonably high value (0.8).

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - \(P(H)\): Low to moderate (let's assume 0.1) - This is a less common field but still relevant.
   - \(P(E|H)\): High (let's assume 0.6) - Adam's traits fit well with the field of Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\): Let's assume it is reasonably high (0.8).

Now, we calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

For **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.3 = 0.03 \]

For **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.05 \cdot 0.2 = 0.01 \]

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.6 \cdot 0.1 = 0.06 \]

To simplify interpretation, we'll normalize by the sum of these values:
\[ \text{Normalization Factor} = 0.03 + 0.01 + 0.06 = 0.1 \]

Thus, the normalized probabilities are:
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.1} = 0.3 \]
\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.1} = 0.1 \]
\[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.1} = 0.6 \]

Using these estimates, we can summarize:
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
