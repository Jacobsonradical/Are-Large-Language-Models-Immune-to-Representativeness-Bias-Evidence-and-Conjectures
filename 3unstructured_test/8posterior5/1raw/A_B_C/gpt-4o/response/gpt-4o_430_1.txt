To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the following probabilities: \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Here we will make reasonable assumptions based on the given personality sketch of Adam:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Since agricultural and veterinary science is a specialized field, we assume fewer graduate students are enrolled in it compared to broader fields like computer science or business administration, so let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's strong love for nature, animals, and empathy, it is highly likely he would be in this field. So, \( P(E|H) \) is high, say 0.8.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): This is the probability of having the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's traits are somewhat uncommon for other fields, we might set this relatively low, say 0.1.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Computer science is a very popular field of study, so we assume a relatively high prior, \( P(H) = 0.3 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's love for solving puzzles and high intelligence fits well into computer science, but his love for nature and animals is less related. We'll set \( P(E|H) \) to be moderate, say 0.3.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): This is the probability of having the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in computer science. Since Computer science is quite prevalent, \( P(E|\neg H) \) might be slightly higher, say 0.4.

3. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): Business administration encompasses a large number of graduate students, but not as many as computer science. We assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's traits do not strongly align with business administration. Thus, we set \( P(E|H) \) to 0.1.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): This is the probability of having the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not in business administration. We set this similar to the agricultural and veterinary case, let's assume it to be 0.2.

Given these estimates, we use Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) \) is the normalizing constant:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_1)P(H_1) + P(E|H_2)P(H_2) + P(E|H_3)P(H_3) + \ldots  \]

For simplicity, let's assume Adam is only enrolled in one of these three fields, so we only normalize by these three probabilities.

\[
P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.3 \cdot 0.3) + (0.1 \cdot 0.2) = 0.04 + 0.09 + 0.02 = 0.15
\]

Now, we compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.15} = \frac{0.04}{0.15} \approx 0.267
\]

2. **Computer Science**:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.3}{0.15} = \frac{0.09}{0.15} \approx 0.6
\]

3. **Business Administration**:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.15} = \frac{0.02}{0.15} \approx 0.133
\]

Final results:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.267,
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.133
