Let's analyze the probabilities based on Adam's personality sketch and field-specific information.

1. **Business Administration**
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration is moderately high because many students pursue this field.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality traits given he is in business administration is relatively low, as his traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals) are not typically associated with business administration.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality traits if he is not in business administration is higher, considering other potential fields like agricultural and veterinary sciences which align better with his traits.

2. **Computer Science**
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science is high given its popularity and the close relationship with solving puzzles and abstract concepts.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality traits given he is in computer science is moderate to low. Although his intelligence and problem-solving align with computer science, his love for nature and animals are less relevant.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam's traits if he is not in computer science is relatively high because his traits are more associated with fields like agriculture or veterinary science.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability is lower compared to computer science but moderately high as a significant number of students are in this field.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality traits given he is in agricultural and veterinary science is very high, as his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy align perfectly.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam's traits if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science is lower because these traits are strongly indicative of this field.

Given these assessments, we use Bayes' rule \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \). Though \( P(E) \) is common to each field and will not affect the relative ranking, we can qualitatively assess the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \):

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}

These relative proportions make sense given how closely Adam's personality aligns with each field.
