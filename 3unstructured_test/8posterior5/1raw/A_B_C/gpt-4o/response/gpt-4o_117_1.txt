Let's break it down step-by-step using Bayes' Rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here's how we'll approach the computations for each field:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in that field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is not enrolled in that field.

Given no specific prior probabilities for the fields, we will assume that the fields are equally likely a priori (\(P(H)\)) for simplicity. This means each has a prior probability of \(1/N\), where \(N\) is the number of fields we are considering. Since we only consider three fields here, \(P(H)\) = 1/3.

We will qualitatively estimate \(P(E|H)\) based on how strongly the personality sketch matches typical students in each field. \(P(E|\neg H)\) will then be set relative to this assessment, considering other fields not explicitly evaluated.

**1. Business Administration**
- **P(H):** Assume prior is \( \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.33 \).
- **P(E|H):** Adamâ€™s love for nature, animals, and his empathy are not very indicative of someone in business administration. Thus, the probability is relatively low.
  \[ P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \]
- **P(E|\neg H)**: This is generally higher since it includes fields more aligned with his interests.
  \[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.6 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{(0.1) \cdot (0.33)}{0.1 \cdot 0.33 + 0.9 \cdot 0.67} \approx 0.05 \]

**2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
- **P(H):** Assume prior is \( \approx 0.33 \).
- **P(E|H):** Very likely, as his traits closely match a student in this field.
  \[ P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \]
- **P(E|\neg H):** Lower since agriculture/veterinary science is a strong match.
  \[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{(0.9) \cdot (0.33)}{0.9 \cdot 0.33 + 0.1 \cdot 0.67} \approx 0.82 \]

**3. Computer Science**
- **P(H):** Assume prior is \( \approx 0.33 \).
- **P(E|H):** Fairly likely, given his intelligence and love for puzzles but less so than agriculture/veterinary science.
  \[ P(E|H) \approx 0.4 \]
- **P(E|\neg H):** Higher due to the match of traits to other non-CS fields.
  \[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.6 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{(0.4) \cdot (0.33)}{0.4 \cdot 0.33 + 0.6 \cdot 0.67} \approx 0.25 \]

Here are the final probability estimates:
