To compute \( P(H|E) \), we need to make reasonable estimates for the following probabilities based on the provided personality sketch \( E \) and the fields considered:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality traits \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in each respective field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality traits \( E \) given Adam is enrolled in any field other than \( H \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since the denominator \( P(E) \) will be the same for all fields, we can focus on the numerator to compare relative probabilities.

**Business Administration**:
- \( P(H_{BA}) \): The prior probability of a graduate student being in Business Administration is fairly common. Let's estimate it as 0.15.
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): The likelihood of someone in Business Administration having Adam's personality traits is relatively low, as these traits do not strongly align with typical business administration students. Let's estimate it as 0.02.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \): This is the probability of having these traits given that the student is not in Business Administration. Since these traits might be more common in other fields, let's assume it to be 0.1.

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) = 0.02 \cdot 0.15 = 0.003 \]

**Computer Science**:
- \( P(H_{CS}) \): The prior probability of a graduate student being in Computer Science is also fairly common. Let's estimate it as 0.2.
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): The likelihood of someone in Computer Science having Adam's personality traits is moderate, especially considering his intelligence and interest in solving puzzles. Let's estimate it as 0.4.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \): This is the probability of having these traits given that the student is not in Computer Science. Let’s assume it to be 0.1.

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) = 0.4 \cdot 0.2 = 0.08 \]

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
- \( P(H_{AVS}) \): The prior probability of a graduate student being in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is less common than the other fields, but still significant. Let's estimate it as 0.1.
- \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \): The likelihood of someone in this field having Adam's personality traits is very high, given his strong interest in nature, plants, and animals. Let's estimate it as 0.7.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \): This is the probability of having these traits given that the student is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Let’s again assume it to be 0.1.

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) = 0.7 \cdot 0.1 = 0.07 \]

Summarizing these values:

{
  "business administration": 0.003,
  "computer science": 0.08,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.07
}

These results show the relative probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each respective field based on his personality sketch and our prior assumptions.
