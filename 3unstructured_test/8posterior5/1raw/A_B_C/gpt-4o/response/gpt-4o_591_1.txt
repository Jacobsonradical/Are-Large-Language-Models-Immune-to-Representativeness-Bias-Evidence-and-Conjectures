To determine \( P(H | E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E | H) \), and \( P(E | \neg H) \). Here are the rough estimates for each:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science is relatively low compared to broader fields like business or computer science. Let's estimate it at 0.05.
- \( P(E | H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits (E) given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science is high because his interests align closely with this field. Let's estimate it at 0.8.
- \( P(E | \neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science is relatively low because his strong interest in nature and animals specifically point toward this field. Let's estimate it at 0.1.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Since \( P(E) \) can be considered a normalization factor based on the different fields, we can calculate it later if needed.

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen student is in business administration is moderately high because it is a popular graduate field. Let's estimate it at 0.3.
- \( P(E | H) \): The probability of observing Adam's traits given he is in business administration is low because his traits don't align well with a typical business student profile. Let's estimate it at 0.1.
- \( P(E | \neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's traits if he is not in business administration is quite high due to the diversity of other fields where nature and empathy might be more relevant. Let’s estimate it at 0.5.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

### Computer Science
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is in computer science is also high because it is another popular graduate field. Let's estimate it at 0.3.
- \( P(E | H) \): The probability of observing Adam's traits given he is in computer science is moderate because while he enjoys solving puzzles (a trait common among computer science students), his focus on nature and empathy is less typical. Let's estimate it at 0.3.
- \( P(E | \neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's traits if he is not in computer science is relatively high, as other fields might better encompass his interests in nature and animals. Let’s estimate it at 0.5.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Now, computing the unnormalized posterior probabilities:

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.04}{P(E)} \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \times 0.3}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.03}{P(E)} \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.3 \times 0.3}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.09}{P(E)} \]

Finally, normalize these to get the final probabilities:

\[
P(E) \approx 0.04 + 0.03 + 0.09 = 0.16 \text{ (approximated)}
\]

Thus:
- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.04}{0.16} = 0.25 \]

- For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.03}{0.16} = 0.1875 \]

- For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.09}{0.16} = 0.5625 \]

So the final probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.25,
  "business administration": 0.1875,
  "computer science": 0.5625
}
