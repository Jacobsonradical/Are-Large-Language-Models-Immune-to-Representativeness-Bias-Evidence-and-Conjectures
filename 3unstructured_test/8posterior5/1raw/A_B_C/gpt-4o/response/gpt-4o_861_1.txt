To compute the values for \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis using Bayes' Rule, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the prior probability, \( P(H) \).**
2. **Determine the likelihood, \( P(E|H) \).**
3. **Determine the likelihood of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis, \( P(E|\neg H) \).**
4. Apply Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the normalizing constant.

Since we are not given the explicit values for \( P(H), P(E|H), \) and \( P(E|\neg H), \) I'll make some justified estimates based on the provided information.

### Hypothesis: Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: Graduate programs in computer science are quite common.
   \[ P(H) \approx 0.3 \]

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: Although Adam is smart and good with abstract concepts, his deep love for plants and animals is not very fitting for computer science.
   \[ P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \]

3. **Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Since there are many other fields, let's assume other fields have similar chances.
   \[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.8 \]

### Hypothesis: Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: Less common than computer science but possible for someone with a genuine interest in nature and animals.
   \[ P(H) \approx 0.1 \]

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: This field aligns very well with Adam’s interests and qualities.
   \[ P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \]

3. **Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: If Adam were in another field, it's less likely he would exhibit all these specific interests and traits.
   \[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \]

### Hypothesis: Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: Business administration is a common graduate field but less suggested by his personality sketch.
   \[ P(H) \approx 0.3 \]

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: Business administration doesn't strongly align with his interests and qualities.
   \[ P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \]

3. **Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Various other fields are more likely given his traits.
   \[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.8 \]

### Calculations

We'll calculate the posterior probability using Bayes’ Rule and provide normalized estimates.

#### Computer Science

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.3}{P(E)} \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \]

#### Business Administration

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.3}{P(E)} \]

To normalize:
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \times 0.3) + (0.9 \times 0.1) + (0.1 \times 0.3) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.06 + 0.09 + 0.03 = 0.18 \]

Now:
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.18} \approx 0.33 \]
\[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.18} = 0.5 \]
\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.18} \approx 0.17 \]

Final results:

{
  "computer science": 0.33,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.17
