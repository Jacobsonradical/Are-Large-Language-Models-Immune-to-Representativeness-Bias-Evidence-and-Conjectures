To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch \( E \).

Since \( P(E) \) is a constant for all fields, we only need to focus on \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

Now let's assign reasonable estimates for each of these probabilities based on the information given:

1. **Computer Science:**
    - \( P(H) \): Assign a moderate prior probability since computer science is a common graduate field. Let's say 0.3.
    - \( P(E|H) \): Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems more inclined towards nature and animals, which are not directly related to computer science. Let's assign a lower probability, say 0.2.
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): This is the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in computer science, which is higher since the description fits better elsewhere. Let's assign 0.8.

   Using Bayes' Theorem:
   \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \cdot 0.3 = 0.06 \]

2. **Business Administration:**
    - \( P(H) \): Assign a moderate prior probability since business administration is another common field. Let's say 0.3.
    - \( P(E|H) \): The personality sketch does not particularly align with business administration, which usually involves a different skill set and interests. Let's assign a lower probability, say 0.1.
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Similar reasoning as above, say 0.9.

   Using Bayes' Theorem:
   \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.3 = 0.03 \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
    - \( P(H) \): Assign a lower prior probability since this field is less common. Let's say 0.1.
    - \( P(E|H) \): The personality sketch fits well with interests in nature, plants, animals, and understanding hard work. Let's assign a higher probability, say 0.7.
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Lower since the personality may not fit as well in other fields. Let's say 0.3.

   Using Bayes' Theorem:
   \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.7 \cdot 0.1 = 0.07 \]

Combining these results:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.06,
  "business administration": 0.03,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.07
}
```

These values indicate the relative likelihood given Adam's personality traits and interests. Note that we did not normalize these values, as the sum across different fields doesn't need to equal 1, and we don't account for all possible fields.
