To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis \( H \) (the fields of specialization), we need to use Bayes' rule. The application of Bayes' rule is as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's assess each term for the hypotheses:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H₁)
- **P(H₁)**: The prior probability that a random graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science.
- **P(E|H₁)**: The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch fits someone in agricultural and veterinary science.
- **P(E|\neg H₁)**: The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch fits someone not in agricultural and veterinary science.

Given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals:
- **P(H₁)**: Moderate probability as agricultural and veterinary science involves nature, plants, and animals.
- **P(E|H₁)**: High, since traits like curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals fit well.
- **P(E|\neg H₁)**: Lower, since other fields might not align as closely with these traits.

### Computer Science (H₂)
- **P(H₂)**: The prior probability that a random graduate student is in computer science.
- **P(E|H₂)**: The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch fits someone in computer science.
- **P(E|\neg H₂)**: The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch fits someone not in computer science.

Given Adam's high intelligence and appreciation for solving puzzles:
- **P(H₂)**: High, as computer science is a popular field.
- **P(E|H₂)**: Moderate, as solving puzzles and high intelligence fit but empathy and love for nature do not fit as well.
- **P(E|\neg H₂)**: Could be higher in fields where empathy and nature orientation are better matched.

### Business Administration (H₃)
- **P(H₃)**: The prior probability that a random graduate student is in business administration.
- **P(E|H₃)**: The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch fits someone in business administration.
- **P(E|\neg H₃)**: The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch fits someone not in business administration.

Given Adam's appreciation of hard work and dedication:
- **P(H₃)**: Moderate, as business administration is another common field.
- **P(E|H₃)**: Low to moderate, as solving puzzles and love for nature aren't as fitting.
- **P(E|\neg H₃)**: Comparable or higher, fitting better with other fields.

Making reasonable estimations:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.65,
  "computer science": 0.25,
  "business administration": 0.10
}
```

These values are based on \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) considerations. Agricultural and veterinary science aligns most closely with his personality sketch, computer science follows due to the alignment with intellectual and puzzle-solving traits, and business administration is the least likely fit.
