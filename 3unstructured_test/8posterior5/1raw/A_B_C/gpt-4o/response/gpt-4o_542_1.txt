To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field based on the given personality sketch E of Adam, we'll use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in the field (assuming equal priors for simplicity).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch given Adam is in the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch given Adam is not in the field (approximately considering other fields).

We will make reasonable subjective estimates for these probabilities based on the sketch provided and use them for computation.

- Let's assume \( P(H) = 1/3 \) for simplicity since there are three fields of interest.
- We will then estimate \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Given Adam's characteristics:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam being quiet, intelligent, and enjoying solving puzzles aligns well with a typical Computer Science student.
   - Estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.6 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Since other fields might not emphasize the same traits, estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \).

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals aligns strongly with this field.
   - Estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Other fields might less often show such strong alignment, estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \).

3. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's personality traits (warm heart, empathy) could be relevant but are not strong indicators for Business Administration.
   - Estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): This personality seems less relevant to Business Administration, estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \).

Now, using Bayes' rule:

1. **Computer Science:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{P(E)} \approx 0.2 \]
\[ P(E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.2} = 1 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{P(E)} \approx 0.267 \]
\[ P(E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.267} = 0.6 \]

3. **Business Administration:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{P(E)} \approx 0.1 \]
\[ P(E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.1} = 0.9 \]

Combining these results:

{
  "computer science": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.267",
  "business administration": "0.1"
