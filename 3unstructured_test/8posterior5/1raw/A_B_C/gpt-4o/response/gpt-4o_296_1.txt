In order to determine the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' theorem, we can use the following formula:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

We need to estimate the following components for each field:
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E) \): Overall prior probability of the personality sketch \( E \).

Given the data available, some reasonable assumptions can be made:

### Computer Science
- \( P(H) \): Assume a typical base rate for computer science graduate students, which can be quite high for male STEM graduate students. Let's set \( P(H) = 0.3 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Adam's love for puzzles and high intelligence might suggest some fit, but less convincing for empathy and love for nature. Let's set \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Assume a general likelihood among all other fields. A lower likelihood for this personality sketch compared to veterinary science. Let's set \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): Assume a moderately high base rate, similar to that of computer science. Let's set \( P(H) = 0.25 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): The personality sketch fits poorly with the typical traits of business administration students. Let's set \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): As in computer science, this is likely the same as above. Let's set \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): Less common but still significant. Let's set \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): The profile strongly fits Adam (with his love for nature, animals, and empathy). Let's set \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): As with other fields, a baseline probability lower than agricultural and veterinary science but still considering other environmental or biological sciences. Let's set \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

Finally, overall \( P(E) \) can be assumed as a normalization factor which is typically estimated by considering all potential fields and their likelihoods. However, this is complex without more data, so we will proceed with these estimated values.

Now, using Bayes' rule, we can calculate \( P(H|E) \):

### For Computer Science:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \times 0.3}{P(E)}
\]

### For Business Administration:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{P(E)}
\]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \times 0.15}{P(E)}
\]

We won't compute the exact numerical values for \( P(E) \) here, but we can establish relative priors based on these calculations.

Thus, the estimates for \( P(H|E) \) are:
\[
P(H|E)_{\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}} \gg P(H|E)_{\text{Computer Science}} \approx P(H|E)_{\text{Business Administration}}
\]

In more relatable terms:

{
  "computer science": "0.09",
  "business administration": "0.025",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.105"
}

These values can be taken relative to each other, showing that agricultural and veterinary science is the highest probability given Adam's personality sketch.
