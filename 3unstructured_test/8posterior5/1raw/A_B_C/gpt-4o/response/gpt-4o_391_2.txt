Let's denote the following:

- \(H_i\) is the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in field \(i\), where \(i\) can be "agricultural and veterinary science", "business administration", or "computer science".
- \(E\) is the personality sketch of Adam.

We will use Bayes' Rule to compute \(P(H_i|E)\):

\[ P(H_i|E) = \frac{P(E|H_i) \cdot P(H_i)}{P(E)} \]

Given that there are many possible graduate fields, we will focus on comparing the probabilities and not worrying about the absolute value of \(P(H_i)\). Hence, we need to estimate the likelihoods \(P(E|H_i)\), the prior probabilities \(P(H_i)\), and \(P(E|\neg H_i)\).

### Prior Probabilities (\(P(H_i)\) and \(P(\neg H_i)\))
We assume a reasonable distribution of students across different fields without specific data. Let's say each field has a base rate —  \(P(H_i)\) — of having 0.1 probability (10%), given the large number of graduate programs. The other hypotheses combined will make up the remainder (\(0.9\)).

### Probabilities (P(E|H_i) and P(E|\neg H_i))
- For "agricultural and veterinary science" (\(H_1\)):
  - \(P(E|H_1)\): Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, it is very high. Let's say 0.9.
  - \(P(E|\neg H_1)\): Significantly lower, considering the specificity of his interests. Maybe 0.2.

- For "business administration" (\(H_2\)):
  - \(P(E|H_2)\): Business administration is less likely to align with Adam's specific interests and personality traits. Let's estimate 0.2.
  - \(P(E|\neg H_2)\): More probable outside this field, let's say 0.8.

- For "computer science" (\(H_3\)):
  - \(P(E|H_3)\): His interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence fit, but less so the nature/animal aspect. Let's say 0.6.
  - \(P(E|\neg H_3)\): A bit higher, but not much. Maybe 0.4.

### Application of Bayes' Rule:

- For "agricultural and veterinary science":
  \[
  P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)}
  \]
  Since \(P(E)\) is constant across fields for comparison, it simplifies to:
  \[
  P(H_1|E) \propto 0.09
  \]

- For "business administration":
  \[
  P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)}
  \]
  Simplified:
  \[
  P(H_2|E) \propto 0.02
  \]

- For "computer science":
  \[
  P(H_3|E) = \frac{P(E|H_3) \cdot P(H_3)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)}
  \]
  Simplified:
  \[
  P(H_3|E) \propto 0.06
  \]

### Normalizing

Here, we compare the unnormalized probabilities. The final step, if needed, would be normalizing these probabilities so they sum to 1.

However, given the prompt allows for these values not necessarily summing to 1, we'll leave them proportional.

Here are the comparative probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.09,
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.06
}
