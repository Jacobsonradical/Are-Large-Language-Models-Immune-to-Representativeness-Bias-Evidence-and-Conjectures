To use Bayes' rule to compute P(H|E) for each field, we'll utilize the given probabilities:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}, \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not in that field.
- \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \) is the total probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.

Given Adam's characteristics, let's estimate the probabilities for each field:

### Hypothesis 1: Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **Prior Probability (P(H))**
  - Because this field aligns well with Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, we’ll estimate a higher prior probability.
  - \( P(H) \approx 0.15 \) (assuming a relatively high but reasonable chance).

- **Likelihood (P(E|H))**
  - Adam's traits align very well with this field.
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \).

- **Non-Hypothesis Likelihood (P(E|\neg H))**
  - Students in other fields might show some but not all of Adam's traits.
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \).

### Hypothesis 2: Business Administration
- **Prior Probability (P(H))**
  - Lower likelihood given Adam's traits and interests.
  - \( P(H) \approx 0.05 \).

- **Likelihood (P(E|H))**
  - Adam's traits do not align well with typical skills and interests in this field.
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \).

- **Non-Hypothesis Likelihood (P(E|\neg H))**
  - Traits can still be present in non-administrative fields.
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \).

### Hypothesis 3: Computer Science
- **Prior Probability (P(H))**
  - Moderate likelihood due to Adam's intelligence and puzzle-solving.
  - \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \).

- **Likelihood (P(E|H))**
  - Somewhat consistent; interests may overlap but not entirely.
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \).

- **Non-Hypothesis Likelihood (P(E|\neg H))**
  - Fairly consistent with a broader range of fields.
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \).

Now, we compute the total probability \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H)). \]

We’ll first compute the individual \( P(E) \) values approximately for each field.

1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(E) \approx (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.3 \cdot 0.85) \approx 0.12 + 0.255 = 0.375 \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.375} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.375} \approx 0.32 \]

2. Business Administration
\[ P(E) \approx (0.1 \cdot 0.05) + (0.4 \cdot 0.95) \approx 0.005 + 0.38 = 0.385 \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.05}{0.385} \approx \frac{0.005}{0.385} \approx 0.013 \]

3. Computer Science
\[ P(E) \approx (0.3 \cdot 0.1) + (0.4 \cdot 0.9) \approx 0.03 + 0.36 = 0.39 \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.39} \approx \frac{0.03}{0.39} \approx 0.077 \]

Summarizing these findings:
