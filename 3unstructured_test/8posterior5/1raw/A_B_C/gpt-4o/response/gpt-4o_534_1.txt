To compute \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we'll use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Assumptions:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in that particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the evidence (E, Adam's personality sketch) if Adam is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the evidence (E) if Adam is not enrolled in the field.

Since exact numerical values are not provided for these probabilities, some reasonable assumptions will be made based on typical distributions of students in various fields and the fitting of Adam's characteristics to these fields.

1. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): Let's assume the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration is low given his interests and personality traits, say 0.1.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch if he is in business administration is also low because his traits do not strongly align with common business administration traits, say 0.2.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in business administration might be more common, say, 0.8.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Let's assume a moderate prior probability for this field given Adam's interest in nature and animals, say 0.3.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch if he is in agricultural and veterinary science is high, say 0.9.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in this field might be lower, say 0.3.

3. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability might be moderate given his high intelligence and puzzle-solving ability, say 0.3.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch if he is in computer science is moderate, say 0.5.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in this field is possibly higher, say 0.5.

Now, applying Bayes' rule for each field:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))} \]

For **Business Administration**:

\[ P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.8 \cdot 0.9} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.72} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.74} \approx 0.027 \]

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:

\[ P(\text{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.3}{0.9 \cdot 0.3 + 0.3 \cdot 0.7} \approx \frac{0.27}{0.27 + 0.21} \approx \frac{0.27}{0.48} \approx 0.562 \]

For **Computer Science**:

\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.3}{0.5 \cdot 0.3 + 0.5 \cdot 0.7} \approx \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.35} \approx \frac{0.15}{0.50} \approx 0.300 \]

Thus, we have:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.027,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.562,
  "computer science": 0.300
}
