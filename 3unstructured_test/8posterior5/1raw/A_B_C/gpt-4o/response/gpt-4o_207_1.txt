We will use Bayes' Theorem to compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \), where \( H \) represents the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.

Bayes' Theorem is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's define the terms for each field:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the evidence given that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the evidence given that Adam was not enrolled in the field.

Without exact data, we will use qualitative assessment and reasonable guesses to estimate these probabilities.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - **\( P(H) \)**: Given Adam's interests in nature, plants, and animals, the prior probability is relatively high.
     \[ P(H) = 0.3 \]
   - **\( P(E|H) \)**: High, as the personality sketches fit well with someone in this field.
     \[ P(E|H) = 0.9 \]
   - **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch if he is not in this field is moderate because his traits can partly match other fields.
     \[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \]

2. **Computer Science**
   - **\( P(H) \)**: This field has a lower prior probability than agricultural and veterinary science, considering Adam's interests.
     \[ P(H) = 0.25 \]
   - **\( P(E|H) \)**: Moderate, as while the traits like puzzle-solving and intelligence are relevant, the direct links to nature and empathy are less compelling.
     \[ P(E|H) = 0.5 \]
   - **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: High, as his traits can fit a variety of other fields.
     \[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \]

3. **Business Administration**
   - **\( P(H) \)**: Lower compared to other fields given Adamâ€™s apparent lack of interest in typical business traits.
     \[ P(H) = 0.10 \]
   - **\( P(E|H) \)**: Low, as the personality sketch doesn't strongly align with what we typically expect in business administration students.
     \[ P(E|H) = 0.2 \]
   - **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Relatively high, as his traits could fit other non-business fields better.
     \[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.7 \]

Finally, let's compute \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \).

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   \[
   P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.3) + (0.4 \cdot 0.7) = 0.27 + 0.28 = 0.55
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.3}{0.55} = \frac{0.27}{0.55} \approx 0.491
   \]

2. **Computer Science**
   \[
   P(E) = (0.5 \cdot 0.25) + (0.6 \cdot 0.75) = 0.125 + 0.45 = 0.575
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.25}{0.575} = \frac{0.125}{0.575} \approx 0.217
   \]

3. **Business Administration**
   \[
   P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.7 \cdot 0.9) = 0.02 + 0.63 = 0.65
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.65} = \frac{0.02}{0.65} \approx 0.031
   \]

So, the approximate probabilities are:
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.491,
  "computer science": 0.217,
  "business administration": 0.031
}
