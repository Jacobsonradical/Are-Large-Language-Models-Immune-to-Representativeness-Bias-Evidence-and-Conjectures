To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to assess the probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Let's estimate these probabilities based on Adam's personality description (E) and typical enrollment distributions.

1. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Probability that a random graduate student is in Computer Science. This field is popular among students, particularly those with high intelligence.
     - Assume \( P(H) = 0.20 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Probability of Adam's personality given he is in Computer Science. While not directly related to nature or animals, high intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles might fit:
     - Assume \( P(E|H) = 0.30 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of Adam's personality given he is not in Computer Science. Given he has characteristics aligning with other fields:
     - Assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.05 \).

   Using Bayes’ rule:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
   = \frac{0.30 \cdot 0.20}{0.30 \cdot 0.20 + 0.05 \cdot 0.80}
   = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.04}
   = \frac{0.06}{0.10}
   = 0.60.
   \]

2. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): Probability that a random graduate student is in Business Administration. This field is also commonly chosen but generally less aligned with Adam’s personality traits:
     - Assume \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Probability of Adam's personality given he is in Business Administration. Less likely due to mismatch with personality sketch.
     - Assume \( P(E|H) = 0.10 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of Adam's personality given he is not in Business Administration:
     - Assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.05 \).

   Using Bayes’ rule:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
   = \frac{0.10 \cdot 0.15}{0.10 \cdot 0.15 + 0.05 \cdot 0.85}
   = \frac{0.015}{0.015 + 0.0425}
   = \frac{0.015}{0.0575}
   = 0.26.
   \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Probability that a random graduate student is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Likely a smaller proportion, but closely aligned with Adam’s love for nature and animals.
     - Assume \( P(H) = 0.10 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Probability of Adam's personality given he is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Highly likely considering the alignment with his interests:
     - Assume \( P(E|H) = 0.80 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of Adam’s personality given he is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
     - Assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.05 \).

   Using Bayes’ rule:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
   = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.10}{0.80 \cdot 0.10 + 0.05 \cdot 0.90}
   = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.045}
   = \frac{0.08}{0.125}
   = 0.64.
   \]

So, the results are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.60,
  "business administration": 0.26,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.64
}
```
