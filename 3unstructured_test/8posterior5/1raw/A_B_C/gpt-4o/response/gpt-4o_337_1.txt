To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider three key probabilities:

1. **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch \( E \) would be observed given he was enrolled in a specific field.
3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch \( E \) would be observed given he was not enrolled in that specific field.

Finally, we use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, we can assume \( P(E) \) is the same across all fields since it acts as a normalizing constant. This will give us relative probabilities.

### Assumptions and Estimates:

1. **\( P(H) \)**: The prior distribution of Adam being in a specific field is based on general enrollment statistics (e.g., how common each field is). Let's assume:
   - Agricultural and veterinary science: 0.1
   - Computer science: 0.2
   - Business administration: 0.15

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: How likely the given personality traits \( E \) fit the field:
   - Agricultural and veterinary science: High (0.8), as his love for nature, plants, and animals make this highly plausible.
   - Computer science: Moderate (0.4), as his intelligence and puzzle-solving skills apply well here, but nature and animals are less relevant.
   - Business administration: Low (0.2), as his traits are less aligned with typical business administration characteristics.

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Since \(\neg H\) encompasses all other fields, it might be dispersed across fields not listed here. We'll assume:
   - Agricultural and veterinary science: 0.4
   - Computer science: 0.4
   - Business administration: 0.4

### Calculations and Results:

Now, calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Normalize the results:

1. **Agricultural and veterinary science**:
   \[ P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \]

2. **Computer science**:
   \[ P(H|E) \propto 0.4 \times 0.2 = 0.08 \]

3. **Business administration**:
   \[ P(H|E) \propto 0.2 \times 0.15 = 0.03 \]

Now, normalize these values to sum to 1:
Total = 0.08 + 0.08 + 0.03 = 0.19

Normalized results:

1. **Agricultural and veterinary science**:
   \[ \frac{0.08}{0.19} \approx 0.42 \]

2. **Computer science**:
   \[ \frac{0.08}{0.19} \approx 0.42 \]

3. **Business administration**:
   \[ \frac{0.03}{0.19} \approx 0.16 \]

So, the final computed probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.42,
  "computer science": 0.42,
  "business administration": 0.16
}
```
