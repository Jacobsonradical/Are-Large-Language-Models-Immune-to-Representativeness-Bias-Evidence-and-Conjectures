To solve for \( P(H|E) \) for each of the given hypotheses, we need to apply Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of being enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given fields other than the ones being considered here.

Since we don't have specific numerical values for these probabilities, we will use qualitative reasoning to estimate them.

### Let's make reasonable assumptions:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in each specific field considering general distribution among all fields.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam’s personality sketch matches a student in each specific field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Generally complementary to \( P(E|H) \), given other fields might not fit his personality sketch as well. 

### Field: Business Administration

- **P(H)**: We assume business administration is a relatively common field of study but not the most probable for Adam based on his personality sketch. Let’s estimate this as low.
- **P(E|H)**: Adam’s personality (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals) does not strongly align with characteristics typically associated with business administration. This should be low.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Higher than \( P(E|H) \) for business admin because other fields (like agricultural science) fit his traits better.

Computing \( P(H|E) \):
\[
P(H|E) \approx \frac{Low \cdot Low}{\text{(relatively not very high)}} \approx Low
\]

### Field: Computer Science

- **P(H)**: Computer science is a popular field but not the most likely given Adam's nature-focused interests. Estimate this as moderate.
- **P(E|H)**: Adam’s intelligence and interest in puzzles align well with computer science. Moderate to high. 
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Moderately high, given computer science is common but he matches more with other fields.

Computing \( P(H|E) \):
\[
P(H|E) \approx \frac{Moderate \cdot Mod-High}{\text{(relative moderate)}} \approx Moderate
\]

### Field: Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)**: This field is less common overall but aligns closely with Adam's interests in nature and animals. We estimate this moderate to high as it fits well with Adam's personality.
- **P(E|H)**: Very high because Adam’s traits (love for animals, nature, and work dedication) directly correspond to this field.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Lower, because this specific match is rare outside this field.

Computing \( P(H|E) \):
\[
P(H|E) \approx \frac{Mod-High \cdot Very High}{\text{(relatively low)}} \approx High
\]

### Summary

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These values reflect the relative likelihoods, with the highest being in agricultural and veterinary science given Adam's personality sketch.
