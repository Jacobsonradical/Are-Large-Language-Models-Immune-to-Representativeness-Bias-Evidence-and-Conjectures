To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the evidence (personality sketch) given that Adam is in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is not in that field.

Given the personality sketch, let's assign rational values to these probabilities.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS)
- \( P(H) \): Probability of a graduate student being in AVS.
  - Let's assume a moderate probability since AVS is a common field but not the most predominant one. \[ P(H) \approx 0.1 \]
  
- \( P(E|H) \): Probability of Adam having the described personality if he’s in AVS.
  - Considering Adam’s love for nature, plants, and animals, AVS is a strong match. \[ P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \]
  
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of Adam having the described personality if he’s not in AVS.
  - While love for nature and animals may exist in other fields, it's significantly lower. \[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \]

### Computer Science (CS)
- \( P(H) \): Probability of a graduate student being in CS.
  - The field of CS is highly popular among graduate students. \[ P(H) \approx 0.25 \]

- \( P(E|H) \): Probability of Adam having the described personality if he’s in CS.
  - A quiet boy with high intelligence and puzzle-solving skills matches well with CS, but the focus on nature and animals is less relevant. \[ P(E|H) \approx 0.4 \]

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of Adam having the described personality if he’s not in CS.
  - Similar to the general population likelihood. \[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \]

### Business Administration (BA)
- \( P(H) \): Probability of a graduate student being in BA.
  - BA is another popular field of study. \[ P(H) \approx 0.2 \]

- \( P(E|H) \): Probability of Adam having the described personality if he’s in BA.
  - BA doesn’t strongly correlate with nature or animals, though a warm heart and work appreciation might fit. \[ P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \]

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of Adam having the described personality if he’s not in BA.
  - Similar to the general population likelihood. \[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \]

### Bayes' Rule
Given Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
We can ignore \( P(E) \) in comparisons as it is a normalizing constant. The relative probabilities are sufficient for ordering.

Let's compute the unnormalized \( P(H|E) \) for each:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]

2. **Computer Science**:
   \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.4 \cdot 0.25 = 0.1 \]

3. **Business Administration**:
   \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \cdot 0.2 = 0.04 \]

To normalize (optional for context, though not necessary given instructions):
Total = 0.08 + 0.1 + 0.04 = 0.22

Normalizing (optional):
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: \[ 0.08 / 0.22 \approx 0.36 \]
2. **Computer Science**: \[ 0.1 / 0.22 \approx 0.45 \]
3. **Business Administration**: \[ 0.04 / 0.22 \approx 0.18 \]

However, the unnormalized values provided in the correct format will be:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08,
  "computer science": 0.10,
  "business administration": 0.04
}
