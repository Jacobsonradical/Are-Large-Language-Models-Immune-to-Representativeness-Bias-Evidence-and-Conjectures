For each field, let's first estimate the probabilities based on the given data:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - **P(H)**: The base rate of being in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's say it's relatively low among all fields; let's assume it to be 0.05.
   - **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's personality sketch, the probability that he would be in agricultural and veterinary science seems high since his interest in nature and animals aligns well with this field. Let's estimate it to be 0.8.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of seeing Adam's personality sketch given he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Given there are many other fields that could partially align with his description, let's estimate this to be 0.1.
   - **P(H|E)**: Use Bayes' rule to calculate \( P(H|E) \).
     \[
     P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \quad \text{where} \quad P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
     \]
     \[
     P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.1 \cdot 0.95) = 0.04 + 0.095 = 0.135
     \]
     \[
     P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.135} \approx 0.296
     \]

2. **Business Administration**
   - **P(H)**: The base rate of being in business administration is typically higher; let's assume it to be 0.2.
   - **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's personality, the alignment with business administration is less likely since his interests and skills point more toward natural sciences or animal-related fields. Let's estimate it to be 0.1.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: Same as before, 0.1.
   - **P(H|E)**:
     \[
     P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.1 \cdot 0.8) = 0.02 + 0.08 = 0.1
     \]
     \[
     P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1} = 0.2
     \]

3. **Computer Science**
   - **P(H)**: The base rate of being in computer science is also relatively high in the U.S.; let's assume it to be 0.15.
   - **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence, this could be a moderately good fit. Let's estimate it to be 0.4.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: Same as before, 0.1.
   - **P(H|E)**:
     \[
     P(E) = (0.4 \cdot 0.15) + (0.1 \cdot 0.85) = 0.06 + 0.085 = 0.145
     \]
     \[
     P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.15}{0.145} \approx 0.414
     \]

Based on the above calculations, we get the following probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.296,
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.414
}
