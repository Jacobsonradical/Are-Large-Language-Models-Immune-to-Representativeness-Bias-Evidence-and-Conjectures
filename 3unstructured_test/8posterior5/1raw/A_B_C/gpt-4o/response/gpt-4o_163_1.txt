To compute the probabilities \( P(H \mid E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to consider the following probabilities:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the specific field.
- \( P(E \mid H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in the specific field.
- \( P(E \mid \neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in the specific field.

Bayes' Rule for computing \( P(H \mid E) \):

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( P(E) \) can be expanded as:

\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H) + P(E \mid \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's estimate the probabilities for each field:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): Let's assume the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science is around 0.2.
   - \( P(E \mid H_{\text{CS}}) \): Given the personality sketch, a computer science student is likely to have high intelligence and be good at abstract concepts, but the strong empathy and love for animals are less indicative for this field. Let's assume this probability is 0.3.
   - \( P(E \mid \neg H_{\text{CS}}) \): Estimates of the probability of having this personality sketch if not in computer science could be around 0.15.
   
   Using Bayes' Rule:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{CS}} \mid E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.15 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.12} = \frac{0.06}{0.18} \approx 0.33
   \]

2. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): Let's assume the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration is around 0.1.
   - \( P(E \mid H_{\text{BA}}) \): The personality sketch is less indicative of a typical business administration student. Let's assume this probability is 0.1.
   - \( P(E \mid \neg H_{\text{BA}}) \): Could be around 0.2.
   
   Using Bayes' Rule:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{BA}} \mid E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.1 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.18} = \frac{0.01}{0.19} \approx 0.053
   \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \): Let's assume the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is around 0.05.
   - \( P(E \mid H_{\text{AVS}}) \): This field aligns well with the personality sketchâ€”curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy. Let's assume this probability is 0.6.
   - \( P(E \mid \neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \): Could be around 0.25.
   
   Using Bayes' Rule:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{AVS}} \mid E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.05}{0.6 \cdot 0.05 + 0.25 \cdot 0.95} = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.2375} = \frac{0.03}{0.2675} \approx 0.112
   \]

So, the resulting probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.33,
  "business administration": 0.053,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.112
}
```
