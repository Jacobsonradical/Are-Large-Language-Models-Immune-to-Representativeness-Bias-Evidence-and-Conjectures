Let's proceed with this task step by step.

First, we need to judge the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field (Computer Science, Agricultural and Veterinary Science, and Business Administration) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Finally, we'll use Bayes' Rule to compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \).

### Computer Science:
- **P(H)**: Considering the popularity of computer science among graduate students, let's assume a prior probability of about 0.25.
- **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's traits (curiosity, intelligence, abstract thinking), there’s a reasonable probability that he might fit into computer science. Let’s assume a likelihood of about 0.4.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that someone with Adam's traits exists outside of computer science might also be relatively high. Let’s assume it to be around 0.3.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- **P(H)**: This field is less common among graduate students compared to computer science but fits more closely with Adam's interest in nature and animals. Let's assign a prior probability of about 0.15.
- **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's deep love for animals and nature, there’s a high probability that he fits into this field. Let’s assume the likelihood is 0.8.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: For someone with Adam's traits but not in this field, the probability might be similar to the overall likelihood. Let’s assume it to be around 0.2.

### Business Administration:
- **P(H)**: This is also a common field among graduate students, so let's assume a prior probability of around 0.20.
- **P(E|H)**: Adam’s empathy and intelligence might fit business administration to some extent but less likely than the other fields. Let’s assume a likelihood of about 0.2.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: For someone with Adam's traits but not in business administration, the probability would be relatively high. Let’s assume it around 0.35.

Now, applying Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H)\cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H)\cdot P(\neg H) \]

#### Computer Science
\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.75 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.4 \cdot 0.25 + 0.3 \cdot 0.75 = 0.1 + 0.225 = 0.325 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.25}{0.325} \approx 0.3077 \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

#### Business Administration
\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.80 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.20 + 0.35 \cdot 0.80 = 0.04 + 0.28 = 0.32 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.20}{0.32} \approx 0.125 \]

So, based on the given information and calculations, we can represent our answers as:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3077,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4138,
  "business administration": 0.125
}
```

These values give us a sense of how likely Adam is to be enrolled in each field given his personality sketch.
