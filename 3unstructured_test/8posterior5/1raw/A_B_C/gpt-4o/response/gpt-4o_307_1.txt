Given the personality sketch of Adam (E) and the hypothesis of various fields (H), we'll compute the probabilities using Bayes' Rule.

Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Our work process will involve estimating three probabilities:
- \(P(H)\): the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field.
- \(P(E|H)\): the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given the field.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given any other field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \(P(H)\): Moderate (not high nor very low). Let's say 0.1 (10% chance prior).
- \(P(E|H)\): High (fits well with curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy). Let's say 0.9 (90% given his profile).
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): Probably lower across other fields. Let's say 0.2 (20%).

### Business Administration
- \(P(H)\): Moderate to low. Let's say 0.05 (5% chance prior).
- \(P(E|H)\): Low (does not fit well with Adam's described traits). Let's say 0.1 (10% given his profile).
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): Higher than the specific case, but hard to tell. Let's say 0.3 (30%).

### Computer Science
- \(P(H)\): Moderate. Let's say 0.1 (10% chance prior).
- \(P(E|H)\): Moderate to high (fits well with intelligence, puzzles, abstract concepts). Let's say 0.7 (70% given his profile).
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): Mixed could vary, but probably 0.3 (30%).

First, we normalize probabilities:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

This is calculated across all fields.
Let's assume the probability across all fields (other than the ones listed) equal total mass to balance.

For simplicity and based on our assumption:

### Calculations

\[
\text{For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:}
\]

\[ P(H = \text{Ag}) = 0.1 \]
\[ P(E|H = \text{Ag}) = 0.9 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H = \text{Ag}) = 0.2 \]
\[ P(\neg H = \text{Ag}) = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = (0.9 \times 0.1) + (0.2 \times 0.9) = 0.09 + 0.18 = 0.27 \]
\[ P(H = \text{Ag}|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.1}{0.27} = \frac{0.09}{0.27} \approx 0.333 \]

\[
\text{For Business Administration:}
\]

\[ P(H = \text{BA}) = 0.05 \]
\[ P(E|H = \text{BA}) = 0.1 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H = \text{BA}) = 0.3 \]
\[ P(\neg H = \text{BA}) = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95 \]
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.05) + (0.3 \times 0.95) = 0.005 + 0.285 = 0.29 \]
\[ P(H = \text{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.05}{0.29} = \frac{0.005}{0.29} \approx 0.017 \]

\[
\text{For Computer Science:}
\]

\[ P(H = \text{CS}) = 0.1 \]
\[ P(E|H = \text{CS}) = 0.7 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H = \text{CS}) = 0.3 \]
\[ P(\neg H = \text{CS}) = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \times 0.1) + (0.3 \times 0.9) = 0.07 + 0.27 = 0.34 \]
\[ P(H = \text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.1}{0.34} = \frac{0.07}{0.34} \approx 0.206 \]

Using the above calculations:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.333,
  "business administration": 0.017,
  "computer science": 0.206
}
```

Please note these values are estimates due to the subjective nature of P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|\neg H).
