To start, let's define the key probabilities and use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \), which is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given the personality sketch \( E \).

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam having the personality sketch given that he is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of Adam having the personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch.

Assumptions:
- For the sake of simplicity, assume the priors \( P(H) \) are equal for each field.
- The big task is to estimate \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Reasonable guesses based on the personality sketch provided:
- Since Adam has a deep love for animals and nature, we might assume a higher \( P(E|H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science.
- His high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts might also align well with computer science.
- Business administration seems less directly connected to his love for animals and nature, so \( P(E|H) \) might be lower.

Let's quantify these assumptions:

1. **Computer Science**
   - \( P(H) \): Let's assume it's 0.33 (1/3 probability as a guess for any field).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Incorporating high intelligence and abstract concepts, maybe 0.6.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Assume 0.4 (less alignment with love for nature).

   Using Bayes' rule:

   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.33}{0.6 \cdot 0.33 + 0.4 \cdot 0.67} \approx 0.37 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - \( P(H) \): Assume 0.33.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given his deep love for animals, let's say 0.8.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Assume 0.3.

   Using Bayes' rule:

   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.33}{0.8 \cdot 0.33 + 0.3 \cdot 0.67} \approx 0.56 \]

3. **Business Administration**
   - \( P(H) \): Assume 0.33.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given weaker alignment compared to the other fields, let's say 0.3.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Assume 0.6.

   Using Bayes' rule:

   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.33}{0.3 \cdot 0.33 + 0.6 \cdot 0.67} \approx 0.20 \]

Putting it all together:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.37,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.56,
  "business administration": 0.20
}
```

These probabilities give an indication of the likelihood that Adam might have been enrolled in each of these fields, given his personality sketch.
