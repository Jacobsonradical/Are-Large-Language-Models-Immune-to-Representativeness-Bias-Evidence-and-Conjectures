To solve the problem using Bayes' Rule, we need the following probabilities:

1. P(H): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field of study.
2. P(E|H): The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in that field of study.
3. P(E|\neg H): The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in that field of study.

Since we do not have exact figures for these probabilities, I will make reasonable assumptions based on the given information about Adam's personality and the typical characteristics associated with each field of study.

Let's summarize this for each field:

1. **Business Administration**: This field usually attracts individuals who are outgoing, strategic thinkers, and have strong leadership skills. While intelligence and empathy are valuable in any field, Adam's deep love for animals and nature, along with his interest in abstract concepts, might not align as closely with this field.
   - P(H) for business administration can be assumed to be low based on Adam's traits.
   - P(E|H) can also be assumed to be low since his personality traits do not strongly correlate with typical traits of business administration students.
   - P(E|\neg H) can be assumed to be higher because Adam's traits are less indicative of involvement in business administration compared to the other fields.

2. **Computer Science**: This field attracts individuals who are logical, enjoy problem-solving, and have strong analytical skills. Adam's interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with this field. However, his love for nature and animals might not be directly relevant.
   - P(H) for computer science can be assumed to be moderate.
   - P(E|H) can be assumed to be moderate to high based on Adam's intellectual characteristics.
   - P(E|\neg H) can be assumed to be moderate since his traits, while not excluding computer science, are not unique to it.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field attracts individuals who have a strong connection with nature, plants, animals, and often possess a high degree of empathy and dedication towards their work. Adam's personality aligns closely with this field.
   - P(H) for agricultural and veterinary science can be assumed to be high.
   - P(E|H) can be assumed to be high since his personality strongly aligns with the traits of individuals in this field.
   - P(E|\neg H) can be assumed to be lower because Adam's traits are quite specific to this field.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we do not have a specific value for P(E), we'll focus on the relative values for each field based on the above assumptions:

{
  "business administration": "0.05",
  "computer science": "0.30",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.65"
}
