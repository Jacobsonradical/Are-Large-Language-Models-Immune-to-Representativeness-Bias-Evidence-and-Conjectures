To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we'll use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.
- \( \neg H \) represents all other hypotheses that are not \( H \).

To get the total probability of the evidence (\( P(E) \)), we sum the contributions from \( H \) and \( \neg H \).

We can make some educated guesses about these probabilities based on the personality sketch provided.

### Probability Judgements

1. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H) \): Let's assume a moderate prior probability since it is a popular field.
     - \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \)
   - \( P(E|H) \): The description doesnâ€™t align strongly with traits typically associated with business administration students.
     - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The characteristics described could fit more closely with other fields.
     - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.05 \)

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): Assume a moderate prior probability based on general enrollment levels.
     - \( P(H) \approx 0.05 \)
   - \( P(E|H) \): The traits like curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals align very well.
     - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Could slightly fit some other fields but not as strongly.
     - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.1 \)

3. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): Assume a higher prior probability due to the popularity of this field.
     - \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \)
   - \( P(E|H) \): Curiosity and intelligence might fit well, but not as strongly as agricultural and veterinary science.
     - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Other fields might align with this personality as well.
     - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \)

### Bayes' Rule Calculation

To apply Bayes' rule, we'll calculate \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

We approximate \( P(\neg H) \) by summing other remaining probabilities and normalizing them.

Let's specifically calculate for each field:

- **Business Administration:**
  \[ P(E) \approx (0.1 * 0.1 + 0.8 * 0.05 + 0.3 * 0.2) = 0.1 * 0.1 + 0.8 * 0.05 + 0.3 * 0.2 = 0.01 + 0.04 + 0.06 = 0.11 \]
  \[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 * 0.1}{0.11} \approx 0.009 \]

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
  \[ P(E) \approx 0.11 \] (Using same total for comparison)
  \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 * 0.05}{0.11} \approx 0.036 \]

- **Computer Science:**
  \[ P(E) \approx 0.11 \] (Using same total for comparison)
  \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 * 0.2}{0.11} \approx 0.054 \]

Summarizing these results:

  "business administration": 0.009,
