Let's start by assigning and evaluating the prior probabilities, conditional probabilities, and using Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior probabilities.

For these calculations, we will use generalized interpretations:

- **P(E)**: The overall probability of Adam's personality traits, without specific context.
- **P(H)**: The prior probability of being enrolled in each specific field.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of having the personality traits given that Adam is enrolled in that specific field.
- **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of having the personality traits given Adam is not enrolled in that specific field.
- **P(H|E)**: The posterior probability, or the probability that Adam is enrolled in that specific field given his personality traits.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H) = 0.1**: We assume a moderate prior probability considering the number of students in this field.
- **P(E|H) = 0.8**: There is a high probability that someone interested in this field would have traits such as curiosity about nature, empathy, and a love for animals.
- **P(E|¬H) = 0.4**: Many other fields might have students with these traits but not as dominantly.

### Business Administration
- **P(H) = 0.25**: A common graduate course with many students enrolled.
- **P(E|H) = 0.1**: This field typically does not align strongly with the traits described.
- **P(E|¬H) = 0.6**: Many students outside this field might have these traits.

### Computer Science
- **P(H) = 0.2**: Another common graduate field.
- **P(E|H) = 0.5**: Moderate probability, given the interest in puzzles and understanding abstract concepts fits well, though other traits less so.
- **P(E|¬H) = 0.5**: Students not in computer science might also have these traits.

Now, using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \(P(E)\) is the same for all hypotheses and we are interested in comparative values (not absolute), we can ignore the denominator \(P(E)\) and focus on the numerator.

### Posterior Probabilities:
The posterior probability with simplified calculations:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: 
  \[ P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \]

- **Business Administration**: 
  \[ P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.25 = 0.025 \]

- **Computer Science**: 
  \[ P(H|E) \propto 0.5 \times 0.2 = 0.1 \]

For normalization and comparison, these values can be presented proportionally:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08,
  "business administration": 0.025,
  "computer science": 0.1
}
```

Thus, based on Adam's personality sketch and these simple models, it seems more likely he is enrolled in "computer science" or "agricultural and veterinary science," with "business administration" being relatively less probable.
