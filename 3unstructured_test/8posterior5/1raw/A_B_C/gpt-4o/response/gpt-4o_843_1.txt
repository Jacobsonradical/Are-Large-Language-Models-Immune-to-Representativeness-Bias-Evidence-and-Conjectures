To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each of the fields using Bayes' Rule, we'll follow the format \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \). This will require some estimation for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field.

### Probabilities estimation:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each specific field. Weâ€™ll assume them to be roughly equal for simplicity (since we are not given specific prior information).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \), given that Adam was enrolled in the field \( H \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \), given that Adam was **not** enrolled in the field \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) can be considered constant across all hypotheses for the purpose of comparing them.

### Estimations for each field:

1. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \) (assuming roughly equal distribution among different fields).
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \) (traits like a love for animals and nature are not highly correlated with Business Administration, though abstract thinking can be).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \) (traits among the rest of the disciplines fairly evenly).

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \)
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \) (high correlation with a love for nature and animals and recognizing the hard work associated with these fields).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \)

3. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \)
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.5 \) (abstract concepts and puzzles fit well, though the empathy and love for nature are less directly correlated).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \)

### Calculating \( P(H|E) \):

For each field:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for all fields, we can use the ratio \( P(E|H)P(H) \):

1. **Business Administration:**
   \[
   P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \approx 0.01 / P(E)
   \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   \[
   P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \approx 0.08 / P(E)
   \]

3. **Computer Science:**
   \[
   P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.5 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \approx 0.05 / P(E)
   \]

To compare realistically, we will normalize these values:

\[
\text{Normalization factor} = 0.01 + 0.08 + 0.05 = 0.14
\]
\[
P(H|E \text{ for Business Administration}) \approx \frac{0.01}{0.14} \approx 0.071
\]
\[
P(H|E \text{ for Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) \approx \frac{0.08}{0.14} \approx 0.571
\]
\[
P(H|E \text{ for Computer Science}) \approx \frac{0.05}{0.14} \approx 0.357
\]

Thus, our probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.071,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.571,
  "computer science": 0.357
}
