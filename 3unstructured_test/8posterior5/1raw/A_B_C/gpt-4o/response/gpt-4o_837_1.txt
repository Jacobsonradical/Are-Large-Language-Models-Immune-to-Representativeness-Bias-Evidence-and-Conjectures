Let's start by examining each field in question with respect to the given personality sketch and use Bayes' rule to calculate \( P(H|E) \).

### Scope:
- \( E \): The given personality sketch of Adam.
- \( H \): Adam is enrolled in a specified field.
  
### Bayes' Rule:
Bayes' Rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll need to estimate:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in a field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing the personality sketch.
  
Let's make reasonable assumptions based on the provided information.

### Field 1: Business Administration
- \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.3 \) (business students are common)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.1 \) (personality traits align poorly with typical business studies)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.9 \) (a keen interest in nature and animals suggests he is likely in another field)

### Field 2: Computer Science
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.3 \) (computer science students are also common)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.3 \) (puzzle-solving and high intelligence align, but less so empathy and nature)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.7 \)

### Field 3: Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.1 \) (a smaller number of graduates)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.8 \) (strong alignment given Adam's love for nature and animals)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.2 \)

### Calculation via Bayes' Rule
For each field:

1. **Business Administration:**
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} = \frac{0.03}{P(E)} \]

2. **Computer Science:**
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} = \frac{0.09}{P(E)} \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.08}{P(E)} \]

### Normalization
To normalize these values, we use the fact that the total probability sum for normalization purposes is:
\[ P(E) = \sum_{i} P(E|H_i) \cdot P(H_i) + P(E|\neg H_i) \cdot P(\neg H_i) \]

Normalization constant:
\[ C = 0.03 + 0.09 + 0.08 = 0.2 \]

Final probabilities:
1. **Business Administration:**
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.2} = 0.15 \]

2. **Computer Science:**
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.2} = 0.45 \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.2} = 0.4 \]

### Summary:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.15,
  "computer science": 0.45,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4
}
```

These probabilities reflect the relative likelihood that Adam, given his personality sketch, was enrolled in each of these fields.
