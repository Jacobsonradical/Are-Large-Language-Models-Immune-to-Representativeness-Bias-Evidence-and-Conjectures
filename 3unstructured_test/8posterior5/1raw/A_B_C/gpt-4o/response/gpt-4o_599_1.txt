Sure, let's go through the probabilities for each of the fields considered:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H_ag):** The probability that a random graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science is relatively low compared to other fields. Let's assume **P(H_ag) = 0.05**.
- **P(E|H_ag):** Given Adam's personality sketch, an enrollment in agricultural and veterinary science is quite plausible due to his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. Let’s assume **P(E|H_ag) = 0.8**.
- **P(E|\neg H_ag):** This probability is relatively lower than P(E|H_ag) but not zero because Adam's personality could fit into other fields as well. Let's guess **P(E|\neg H_ag) = 0.2**.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H_ag|E) = \frac{P(E|H_ag) \cdot P(H_ag)}{P(E|H_ag) \cdot P(H_ag) + P(E|\neg H_ag) \cdot (1 - P(H_ag))} \]
\[ P(H_ag|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.95} = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.19} = 0.174 \]

### Computer Science
- **P(H_cs):** The probability that a random graduate student is in computer science is relatively high due to the popularity of the field. Let's assume **P(H_cs) = 0.2**.
- **P(E|H_cs):** Given Adam's intelligence and proficiency in abstract concepts, but considering his other traits; let's assume **P(E|H_cs) = 0.3**.
- **P(E|\neg H_cs):** This remains the general probability of the personality traits occurring outside this field. Let's guess **P(E|\neg H_cs) = 0.2**.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H_cs|E) = \frac{P(E|H_cs) \cdot P(H_cs)}{P(E|H_cs) \cdot P(H_cs) + P(E|\neg H_cs) \cdot (1 - P(H_cs))} \]
\[ P(H_cs|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.2 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.16} = 0.273 \]

### Business Administration
- **P(H_ba):** The probability that a random graduate student is in business administration is also relatively high. Let's assume **P(H_ba) = 0.15**.
- **P(E|H_ba):** Adam's skills and interests do not directly align with business administration, so let's assign a lower probability here. Let’s assume **P(E|H_ba) = 0.1**.
- **P(E|\neg H_ba):** This remains the general probability outside this field. Let's guess **P(E|\neg H_ba) = 0.2**.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H_ba|E) = \frac{P(E|H_ba) \cdot P(H_ba)}{P(E|H_ba) \cdot P(H_ba) + P(E|\neg H_ba) \cdot (1 - P(H_ba))} \]
\[ P(H_ba|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{0.1 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85} = \frac{0.015}{0.015 + 0.17} = 0.081 \]

Based on these calculations, here are the probabilities:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.174,
  "computer science": 0.273,
  "business administration": 0.081
}
