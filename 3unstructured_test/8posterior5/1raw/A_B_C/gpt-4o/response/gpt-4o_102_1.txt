Sure, let's estimate the probabilities step-by-step for each field. First, we assign initial probabilities \( P(H) \) based on our prior beliefs, then estimate \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \), and finally use Bayes' Theorem to compute \( P(H|E) \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is studying Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Let's adopt a generic initial probability.
   \[ P(H) = 0.1 \]
   
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in this field. His love for nature, plants, empathy for animals, and understanding of hard work align well with this field.
   \[ P(E|H) = 0.8 \]
   
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality if he is not in this field. Since these traits can be found in other fields with a lower but non-negligible consistency:
   \[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \]
   
4. **P(H|E)**: Using Bayes' Theorem:
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
   We can approximate \( P(E) \) as:
   \[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
   \[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9 = 0.08 + 0.27 = 0.35 \]
   Therefore:
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.35} = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \approx 0.229 \]

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is studying Business Administration.
   \[ P(H) = 0.1 \]
   
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in this field. His traits do not align strongly with this field.
   \[ P(E|H) = 0.2 \]
   
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality if he is not in this field.
   \[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \] (higher because there are other fields where his personality fits better)
   
4. **P(H|E)**:
   \[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
   \[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.4 \cdot 0.9 = 0.02 + 0.36 = 0.38 \]
   Therefore:
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.38} = \frac{0.02}{0.38} \approx 0.053 \]

### Computer Science
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is studying Computer Science.
   \[ P(H) = 0.2 \]
   
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in this field. His enjoyment of solving puzzles and intelligence align well with Computer Science, though other traits are less directly related.
   \[ P(E|H) = 0.5 \]
   
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality if he is not in this field. Other fields might fit his personality traits equally well.
   \[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \]
   
4. **P(H|E)**:
   \[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
   \[ P(E) = 0.5 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8 = 0.1 + 0.24 = 0.34 \]
   Therefore:
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.34} = \frac{0.1}{0.34} \approx 0.294 \]

Given these calculations, the estimated probabilities are:
