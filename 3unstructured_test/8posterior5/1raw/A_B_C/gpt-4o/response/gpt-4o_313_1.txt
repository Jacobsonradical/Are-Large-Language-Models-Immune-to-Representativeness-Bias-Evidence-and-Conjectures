Let's break down the probabilities step-by-step for each field.

### Business Administration
**P(H):** The probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration as a baseline. Let's assume the distribution of graduate students across all fields, and assign a relatively high but not overwhelming baseline probability for business, say:
\[ P(H_{\text{business}}) = 0.15 \]

**P(E|H):** The probability that Adam would have the characteristics described in E (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, intelligence) given that he is studying business administration. Business administration usually attracts individuals who are competitive, strategic, and analytical, not necessarily those interested in nature and animals:
\[ P(E|H_{\text{business}}) = 0.05 \]

**P(E|\neg H):** The overall probability that Adam would have the characteristics described in E irrespective of being in business administration. Since these traits (love for nature, animals, intelligence) might be more common in other fields:
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}}) = 0.10 \]

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{business}} = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \times P(H_{\text{business}})}{P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}})} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{business}} = \frac{0.05 \times 0.15}{0.10} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{business}} = 0.075 \]

### Computer Science
**P(H):** The probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science. Computer science is a very popular field, so let's set a moderate baseline probability:
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.20 \]

**P(E|H):** The probability that Adam would have the characteristics in E given that he is studying computer science. Curiosity, intelligence, and puzzle-solving skills align well with computer science, but empathy and love for animals might be less commonly associated:
\[ P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.10 \]

**P(E|\neg H):** The probability that Adam would have these characteristics in fields other than computer science:
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.10 \]

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{cs}} = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \times P(H_{\text{cs}})}{P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}})} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{cs}} = \frac{0.10 \times 0.20}{0.10} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{cs}} = 0.20 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
**P(H):** Letâ€™s assume the probability that a typical student is enrolled in this field is lower compared to others, so:
\[ P(H_{\text{agri_vet_sci}}) = 0.05 \]

**P(E|H):** The characteristics described for Adam (interest in nature, love for animals, empathy) align very well with agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(E|H_{\text{agri_vet_sci}}) = 0.25 \]

**P(E|\neg H):** The probability of these characteristics in students not in agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{agri_vet_sci}}) = 0.10 \]

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agri_vet_sci}} = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agri_vet_sci}}) \times P(H_{\text{agri_vet_sci}})}{P(E|\neg H_{\text{agri_vet_sci}})} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agri_vet_sci}} = \frac{0.25 \times 0.05}{0.10} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agri_vet_sci}} = 0.125 \]

So, the computed probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.075,
  "computer science": 0.20,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.125
}
```
