To compute the posterior probabilities for each field, we can use Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule states that:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we don't have the exact value of \( P(E) \), so we'll be working with the relative values of \( \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E|\neg H)} \). 

Let's break down the problem for each field.

1. **Computer Science**

   - **P(H)**: Baseline assumption, let’s assume the prior for computer science is around 0.3 (as it is a popular field).
   - **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and love for animals, these traits are somewhat less aligned with computer science, so let's say it is 0.2.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: Given that other fields might align more with Adam's personality, let’s assign it a higher value, say 0.8.

   Using Bayes' rule (simplified):

   \[
   P(\text{H|E}) \sim \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|\neg H)}
   \]
    \[
   P(\text{Computer Science|E}) \sim \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{0.8} = 0.075
   \]

2. **Business Administration**

   - **P(H)**: Baseline assumption, let’s assume the prior for business administration is around 0.2.
   - **P(E|H)**: Business administration usually attracts people with different personality traits than Adam’s, so let's assume a lower value, 0.1.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: Given varied fields, let’s assume it remains the same at 0.8 as above.

   Using Bayes' rule (simplified):

   \[
   P(\text{Business Administration|E}) \sim \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.8} = 0.025
   \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

   - **P(H)**: Baseline assumption, let’s assume the prior for agricultural and veterinary science is around 0.1.
   - **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's love for animals and nature, this field aligns well with his personality, so let's say it is 0.9.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: Given that other fields might be less aligned with his personality, let’s assume it is lower than above, say 0.6.

   Using Bayes' rule (simplified):

   \[
   P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science|E}) \sim \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{0.6} = 0.15
   \]

Combining these, we get:

\[
{
  "computer science": 0.075,
  "business administration": 0.025,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.15
}
\]

These values are relative, and they help give us an idea of which field Adam is more likely to be enrolled in given his personality traits. Adjustments can be made based on more precise data or different assumptions about the baseline probabilities and likelihoods.
