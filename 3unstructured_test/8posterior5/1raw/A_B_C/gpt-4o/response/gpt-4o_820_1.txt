To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each of the fields (agricultural and veterinary science, business administration, and computer science), we need to use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch E if Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch E if Adam was not enrolled in the field.

For simplicity, let's assume that the prior probability \( P(H) \) is equal for all fields, which is \(\frac{1}{3}\) since no prior information suggests one field is more likely than the other.

Next, we'll need to estimate \( P(E|H) \) for each field. Let's evaluate:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
    - Given the strong curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is high.
    - \[ P(E|H_{agricultural \& veterinary science}) = 0.9 \]

2. **Business Administration**
    - Adam's traits don't strongly align with typical business administration characteristics; the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is relatively low.
    - \[ P(E|H_{business administration}) = 0.1 \]

3. **Computer Science**
    - Adam's intelligence, aptitude for abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles would make computer science a plausible field, but the nature-related traits are less relevant.
    - \[ P(E|H_{computer science}) = 0.4 \]

Assuming these are representative, let's use these values and the general \( P(E) \approx 0.5 \) due to some moderate fit across the considered fields, but since \( P(H|\neg E) \) needs practical exclusion adjustment, we'll center our computations directly:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll apply Bayes Rule:

\[
\begin{align*}
P(H_{agricultural \& veterinary science}|E) &= \frac{0.9 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.5} = 0.6 \\
P(H_{business administration}|E) &= \frac{0.1 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.5} = 0.0667 \\
P(H_{computer science}|E) &= \frac{0.4 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.5} = 0.2667
\end{align*}
\]

Thus, our final results using these computations are:

\[
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.0667,
  "computer science": 0.2667
}
\]
