To determine the conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study using Bayes' Rule, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Estimate the base rate or prior probability \( P(H) \)**: This is the probability that Adam is studying that field without any specific information.
2. **Estimate the likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is studying that field.
3. **Estimate the marginal likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is *not* studying that field.
4. **Compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \)**: Using Bayes' Rule: 
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Since we do not have the exact base rates or specific probabilities, we will assume plausible values based on typical distributions and the likelihood of the characteristics fitting each field.

### Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)
For simplicity, let's assume the following reasonable prior probabilities:

- \( P(\text{business administration}) \approx 0.3 \) 
- \( P(\text{computer science}) \approx 0.3 \)
- \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.4 \)

### Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)
Given the personality sketch (high empathy, curiosity about nature, love for animals, and solving puzzles), we can estimate:

- \( P(E|\text{business administration}) \approx 0.1 \) 
- \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \approx 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.8 \)

### Marginal Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)
This is difficult to estimate directly, but as a simplifying assumption, let's assume it based on the inverse of how characteristic the personality traits are for each field compared to the general population:

- \( P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) \approx 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|\neg \text{computer science}) \approx 0.5 \)
- \( P(E|\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.3 \)

### Calculate \( P(H|E) \)
Using the formula for Bayesian inference:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
Given that \( P(E) \) is the sum across all hypotheses (fields), it can be approximated from the data.

Let’s skip the exact value of \( P(E) \) since it’s common for all hypotheses, we'll provide relative probabilities assuming \( P(E) \) normalizes the values.

So, using approximate values:

\[
P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)}
\]

\[
P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)}
\]

\[
P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.4}{P(E)}
\]

To normalize these:
\[
P(E) \approx 0.1 \cdot 0.3 + 0.3 \cdot 0.3 + 0.8 \cdot 0.4 = 0.03 + 0.09 + 0.32 = 0.44
\]

So the normalized values are approximately:

\[
P(\text{business administration}|E) \approx \frac{0.03}{0.44} \approx 0.068
\]

\[
P(\text{computer science}|E) \approx \frac{0.09}{0.44} \approx 0.205
\]

\[
P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \approx \frac{0.32}{0.44} \approx 0.727
\]

Now, we denote the final probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.068,
  "computer science": 0.205,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.727
}
```
