To calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to understand the probability of each hypothesis \( H \) (i.e., Adam being enrolled in a given field), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) (i.e., the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in that field), and the likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \) (i.e., the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in that field).

Bayes' Rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we are not given the actual base rates for each discipline, I'll make some reasonable assumptions for the sake of completing the calculations.

### Assumptions:

1. **Base Rates (P(H)):**
   - Let's assume the base rate (prior probability) for each field is as follows (these are assumed values for illustrative purposes):
     - \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.3 \) (Computer Science)
     - \( P(H_{\text{AgSci}}) = 0.2 \) (Agricultural and Veterinary Science)
     - \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.2 \) (Business Administration)
     - Other fields = 0.3

2. **Likelihoods (P(E|H)):**
   - Based on the personality sketch, the likelihoods might be:
     - Computer Science: \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.2 \) (since Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is intelligent, but has a deep love for nature which might be a bit less correlated.)
     - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( P(E|H_{\text{AgSci}}) = 0.8 \) (since Adam is very passionate about nature and animals.)
     - Business Administration: \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1 \) (since his personality traits seem less aligned with typical business administration traits.)

3. **Complement Likelihoods (P(E|Â¬H)):**
   - This will be assumed based on the likelihood of the personality sketch given NOT being in each specific field.
     - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.4 \) 
     - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AgSci}}) = 0.3 \)
     - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.4 \)

### Calculations:

1. **Computer Science**:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)}
   \]
   - Numerator: \( 0.2 \times 0.3 = 0.06 \)
   - Denominator approximation: \( P(E) \approx (0.2 \times 0.3) + (0.8 \times 0.2) + (0.1 \times 0.2) \approx 0.06 + 0.16 + 0.02 = 0.24 \)
   \[
   P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx \frac{0.06}{0.24} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{AgSci}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AgSci}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AgSci}})}{P(E)}
   \]
   - Numerator: \( 0.8 \times 0.2 = 0.16 \)
   - Denominator approximation: As above.
   \[
   P(H_{\text{AgSci}}|E) \approx \frac{0.16}{0.24} = 0.67
   \]

3. **Business Administration**:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)}
   \]
   - Numerator: \( 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02 \)
   - Denominator approximation: As above.
   \[
   P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \approx \frac{0.02}{0.24} = 0.08
   \]


So, approximated values are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.25,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.67,
  "business administration": 0.08
}
```
