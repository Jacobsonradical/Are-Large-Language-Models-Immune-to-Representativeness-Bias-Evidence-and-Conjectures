To solve this problem, we use Bayes' theorem, which is stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the evidence.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence given that the hypothesis is false.

For simplicity, instead of bounding all values into a strict 0 to 1 sum, we'll qualitatively indicate approximate values based on how well Adam's personality and interests align with each field.

1. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H) \): Prior probability of a graduate student being in business administration is moderate, given the diverse nature of fields students can pursue.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality matching someone in business administration is relatively low, as his interests and empathy are more aligned with nature and animals.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam's traits being observed given he is not in business administration is higher, since his traits align better with other fields.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability of a graduate student being in computer science is quite high, given its popularity and broad applications.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam's traits fitting a computer science student is moderate, as his puzzle-solving skills and high intelligence fit, but his love for nature and animals suggests otherwise.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of his traits being observed given he’s not in computer science is also high, because his interests align better with other fields.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability of a graduate student being in agricultural and veterinary science is lower compared to computer science but higher than business administration.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam’s traits fitting someone in agricultural and veterinary science is very high due to his love for nature, plants, and animals.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of his traits being observed, given he’s not in agricultural and veterinary science, is lower.

Now let's assign qualitative values based on this analysis to compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

1. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \)
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \)

2. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.4 \)
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.4 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.6 \)

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \)
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \)

Using these, let's estimate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) qualitatively:


```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.24,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.72
}
```

So, based on Adam's personality sketch, it is most likely that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
