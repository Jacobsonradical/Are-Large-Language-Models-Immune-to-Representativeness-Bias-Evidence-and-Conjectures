To solve this, let's use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Let's denote the following probabilities:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in the field \( H \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in field \( H \).

We are interested to compute \( P(H|E) \), the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field given his personality sketch \( E \).

Let's make some educated guesses:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability of being in computer science is moderate, let's assume 0.20.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's personality sketch moderately fits with computer science (high intelligence, good at abstract concepts). Let's assume 0.5.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): To solve this, we need to consider how likely it is for someone not in computer science to have Adamâ€™s set of traits. Let's assume 0.3.
   
   \[
   P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} = \frac{0.5 \times 0.2}{0.5 \times 0.2 + 0.3 \times 0.8} = \frac{0.1}{0.1 + 0.24} = \frac{0.1}{0.34} \approx 0.29
   \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Let's say the prior probability of being in agricultural and veterinary science is low to moderate, 0.1.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's personality sketch fits very well with this field (love for nature and animals). Let's assume 0.9.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Assume people not in agricultural and veterinary science have much lower chances of having these traits, say 0.2.
   
   \[
   P(H|E)_{\text{AgVetSci}} = \frac{0.9 \times 0.1}{0.9 \times 0.1 + 0.2 \times 0.9} = \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.18} = \frac{0.09}{0.27} \approx 0.33
   \]

3. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): Assumed prior probability for business administration is also moderate, 0.2.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's personality does not strongly align with typical business traits. Let's assume 0.3.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Assume non-business students are slightly more likely to fit his personality, say 0.4.
   
   \[
   P(H|E)_{\text{BusAdmin}} = \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{0.3 \times 0.2 + 0.4 \times 0.8} = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.32} = \frac{0.06}{0.38} \approx 0.16
   \]

Summary:

{
  "computer science": 0.29,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.33,
  "business administration": 0.16
