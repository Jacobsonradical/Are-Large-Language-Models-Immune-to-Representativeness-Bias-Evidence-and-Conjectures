To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we can use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since \( P(E) \) is the same for all fields and doesn't affect the relative comparison, we can focus on comparing the numerators \( P(E|H)P(H) \) across different fields. 

Let's consider the provided personality sketch of Adam (E), and judge the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and then use these to compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \).

1. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability of a graduate student in the U.S. being in computer science is fairly high due to the popularity of the field.
     - Estimate: \( 0.3 \)
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's traits like high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts are consistent with someone in computer science, but his strong empathy, warm heart, and deep love for animals are less typical.
     - Estimate: \( 0.2 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Since the traits are not highly typical, we assume a lower probability compared to other fields.
     - Estimate: \( 0.1 \)

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability of a graduate student in the U.S. being in agricultural and veterinary science is lower compared to computer science but still significant.
     - Estimate: \( 0.1 \)
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's traits such as a love for nature, plants, and animals, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work fit very well with this field.
     - Estimate: \( 0.9 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability that a graduate student not in this field fits this personality sketch is lower.
     - Estimate: \( 0.1 \)

3. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability of a graduate student in the U.S. being in business administration is moderate.
     - Estimate: \( 0.2 \)
   - \( P(E|H) \): While high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts can be useful in business administration, Adam's strong empathy, warm heart, and love for nature, plants, and animals are less typical.
     - Estimate: \( 0.1 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Again, since the traits are not highly typical for business administration, we assume a lower probability.
     - Estimate: \( 0.1 \)

Now, let's compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) P(H) \]

**Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.2 \times 0.3 = 0.06 \]

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.9 \times 0.1 = 0.09 \]

**Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02 \]

To give the final relative estimates, let's normalize these values (sum them up and divide each by the total sum):

**Total**:
\[ 0.06 + 0.09 + 0.02 = 0.17 \]

Normalized value for each field \( P(H|E) \):

**Computer Science**:
\[ \frac{0.06}{0.17} \approx 0.353 \]

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ \frac{0.09}{0.17} \approx 0.529 \]

**Business Administration**:
\[ \frac{0.02}{0.17} \approx 0.118 \]

Final formatted answer:

{
  "computer science": 0.353,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.529,
  "business administration": 0.118
