To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each of the given fields using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, we will assume the probabilities involved, keeping in mind that these are rough estimates and we do not have precise statistical data.

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)**: Let's estimate the prior probability \( P(H) \) that a graduate student is enrolled in business administration. Assume it's relatively common but not overly dominant.
   - Rough estimate: \( P(H) = 0.2 \)

2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood \( P(E|H) \) that Adam's personality sketch fits someone in business administration.
   - Personality traits like a love for nature and animals, solving puzzles, warm empathy, and appreciation for hard work may not be strongly aligned with business administration.
   - Rough estimate: \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \)

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \) that Adam's personality sketch fits someone not in business administration.
   - Given that Adam’s traits are more in line with certain fields other than business, we estimate this to be higher.
   - Rough estimate: \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.35 \)

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.35 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.28} = \frac{0.02}{0.3} \approx 0.067 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability \( P(H) \) that a graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - This is less common than business administration but Adam's traits highly align with this field.
   - Rough estimate: \( P(H) = 0.05 \)

2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood \( P(E|H) \) that Adam's personality sketch fits someone in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Adam’s traits like a love for nature, plants, animals, and empathy are very much aligned.
   - Rough estimate: \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \)

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \) that Adam's personality sketch fits someone not in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - This likelihood would be lower because Adam’s highly fitting traits reduce the likelihood of other fields.
   - Rough estimate: \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \)

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.9 \cdot 0.05 + 0.3 \cdot 0.95} = \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.285} = \frac{0.045}{0.33} \approx 0.136 \]

### Computer Science
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability \( P(H) that a graduate student is enrolled in computer science.
   - This is quite common given the current trends.
   - Rough estimate: \( P(H) = 0.3 \)

2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood \( P(E|H) \) that Adam's personality sketch fits someone in computer science.
   - Traits like high intelligence and solving puzzles fit well, but traits like empathy and love for nature/animals do not align as closely.
   - Rough estimate: \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \)

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \) that Adam's personality sketch fits someone not in computer science.
   - There are many fields where Adam’s personality would fit better.
   - Rough estimate: \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.35 \)

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.3}{0.3 \cdot 0.3 + 0.35 \cdot 0.7} = \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.245} = \frac{0.09}{0.335} \approx 0.269 \]
