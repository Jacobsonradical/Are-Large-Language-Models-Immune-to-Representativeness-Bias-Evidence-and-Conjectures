To calculate \( P(H|E) \), we use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to judge the following probabilities to apply Bayes' rule for each field:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a student is enrolled in a particular field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability that Adam's personality sketch (E) matches if he is enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability that Adam's personality sketch (E) matches if he is not enrolled in that field. 
4. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of Adam's personality sketch (E), which can be obtained using the law of total probability.
   \[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

Given that we don't have exact statistics, we will make reasoned estimates:

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

- \( P(H) \): Graduate programs in agricultural and veterinary sciences are relatively niche compared to fields like business or computer science. Let's assume:
   \[ P(H) \approx 0.05 \]

- \( P(E|H) \): Adam's qualities (love for nature, animals, etc.) fit well with this field:
   \[ P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \]

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam's personality traits aligning if he is in some other field:
   \[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \]

**Business Administration:**

- \( P(H) \): Business administration is a common graduate field, so:
   \[ P(H) \approx 0.3 \]

- \( P(E|H) \): Adam's traits do not typically align with stereotypical traits in business (e.g., curiosity for nature over markets):
   \[ P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \]

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Consistent with general distribution:
   \[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \]

**Computer Science:**

- \( P(H) \): Computer Science is also a popular field:
   \[ P(H) \approx 0.3 \]

- \( P(E|H) \): Certain traits like puzzle-solving fit well, but the deep empathy and love for animals are less stereotypical:
   \[ P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \]

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Consistent with general distribution:
   \[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \]

Now we compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[
   P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.05) + (0.2 \times 0.95) = 0.04 + 0.19 = 0.23
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.23} = \frac{0.04}{0.23} \approx 0.174
   \]

2. **Business Administration**:
   \[
   P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.3) + (0.3 \times 0.7) = 0.03 + 0.21 = 0.24
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.3}{0.24} = \frac{0.03}{0.24} \approx 0.125
   \]

3. **Computer Science**:
   \[
   P(E) = (0.3 \times 0.3) + (0.5 \times 0.7) = 0.09 + 0.35 = 0.44
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.3}{0.44} = \frac{0.09}{0.44} \approx 0.204  \]

Therefore, upon evaluating these fields, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.174,
  "business administration": 0.125,
  "computer science": 0.204
}
