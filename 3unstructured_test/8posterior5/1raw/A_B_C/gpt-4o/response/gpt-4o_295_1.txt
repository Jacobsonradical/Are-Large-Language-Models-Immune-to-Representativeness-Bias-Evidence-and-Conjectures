Let's go through each field step by step.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
    - **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his strong curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals, P(H) is relatively high.
    - **P(E|H)**: This is the probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's characteristics, P(E|H) is very high.
    - **P(E|¬H)**: This is the probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Considering that only a subset of other fields can broadly fit Adam's personality traits, this value can be considered lower.

    Applying Bayes' Rule:
    \[
    P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
    \]
    **Estimate:**
    - **P(H)**: 0.4
    - **P(E|H)**: 0.9
    - **P(E|¬H)**: 0.3
    - **P(E)**: This needs to normalize across all hypotheses. P(E) ~= (0.4*0.9 + 0.6*0.3) = 0.6 

    \[
    P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.4}{0.6} = 0.6 
    \]

2. **Business Administration:**
    - **P(H)**: The prior belief that Adam is enrolled in business administration. Given Adam's interests and personality, this probability is low.
    - **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in business administration, which is low because the sketch does not align well with typical traits of business administration students.
    - **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch if Adam is not enrolled in business administration. 

    **Estimate:**
    - **P(H)**: 0.1  
    - **P(E|H)**: 0.1 
    - **P(E|¬H)**: 0.4 
    - **P(E)**: (0.1*0.1 + 0.9*0.4) = 0.37 

    \{
    P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.37} ≈ 0.027
    \}

3. **Computer Science:**
    - **P(H)**: The prior belief that Adam is enrolled in Computer Science. Given Adam's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, this probability can be moderately high.
    - **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is in computer science, which can be moderate as abstract thinking is appreciated but love for nature and animals is not directly aligned.
    - **P(E|¬H)**: Probability of the sketch given he is not in computer science, falling through.

    **Estimate:**
    - **P(H)**: 0.3  
    - **P(E|H)**: 0.5  
    - **P(E|¬H)**: 0.35  
    - **P(E)**: (0.3*0.5 + 0.7*0.35) = 0.405 

    \{
    P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.3}{0.405} ≈ 0.37
    \}

Hence, the summary result in the format requested:
```
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.027,
  "computer science": 0.37
}
```
