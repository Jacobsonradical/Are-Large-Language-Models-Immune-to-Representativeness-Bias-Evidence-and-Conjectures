To compute the probability of Adam's enrollment in each graduate field, given his personality sketch, we'll use Bayes' Rule. Bayes' Rule is formulated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since \( P(E) \) is the same for all fields and acts as a normalizing constant, we can compare \( P(H|E) \) without explicitly calculating \( P(E) \). We will estimate the probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field:

1. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H) \): Let's assume the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration is moderate. Let's say \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that someone in business administration has Adam's personality is probably low, given his interests in nature and animals. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): This is the complement of the likelihood considering other fields. Assuming differences between fields, let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

2. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): We’ll assume the prior probability is moderately high due to the popularity of computer science. Let's say \( P(H) = 0.3 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that a computer science student has Adam's personality could be moderate, due to his intelligence and problem-solving skills. Let’s estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given the complement likelihood considering other fields, we estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): We'll assume a lower prior probability for enrollment in this field due to it being less common in many universities. Let’s say \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that someone in agricultural and veterinary science has Adam's personality is quite high, considering his love for nature and animals. Let’s estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Using a moderate estimate for the complement field likelihood, let’s estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

Now we apply Bayes' Rule for each field:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Normalize for comparison (not exact, but relative values):

- **Business Administration:**
  \[ P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

- **Computer Science:**
  \[ P(H|E) \propto 0.3 \cdot 0.3 = 0.09 \]

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
  \[ P(H|E) \propto 0.7 \cdot 0.1 = 0.07 \]

Normalize (sum them up and divide):
Total proportion sum = 0.02 + 0.09 + 0.07 = 0.18

Normalize each:
- Business Administration:
  \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.18} \approx 0.11 \]

- Computer Science:
  \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.18} \approx 0.50 \]

- Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
  \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.07}{0.18} \approx 0.39 \]

Final probabilities (approximately):
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.11,
  "computer science": 0.50,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.39
}
```

These values suggest that, based on Adam’s personality sketch, he is most likely to be enrolled in Computer Science, followed by Agricultural and Veterinary Science, and least likely in Business Administration.
