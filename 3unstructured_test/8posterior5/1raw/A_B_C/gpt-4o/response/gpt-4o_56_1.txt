To compute the probability of Adam being enrolled in each graduate field given his personality sketch \(E\), we should follow Bayesian updating. Let's first consider the probabilities and values:

**Prior probability \( P(H) \) for each field:**

Assuming equal priors for simplicity:
- Computer Science
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- Business Administration

Given no specific data, let \( P(H) \) be equal for all:
\( P(H) = \frac{1}{3} = 0.33 \)

**Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**

- Computer Science (\(P(E|H_{\text{CS}})\)):
  - High intelligence and interest in solving puzzles: higher
  - Curiosity about nature: neutral
  - Empathy and love for animals: neutral
  - Understanding of hard work: neutral
  - Estimate: \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.2 \)

- Agricultural and Veterinary Science (\(P(E|H_{\text{AVS}})\)):
  - Curiosity about nature and plants: higher
  - Love for animals: higher
  - Empathy: higher
  - Intelligence and solving puzzles: neutral
  - Understanding hard work: higher
  - Estimate: \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.7 \)

- Business Administration (\(P(E|H_{\text{BA}})\)):
  - Intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: higher
  - Empathy: higher (useful for management)
  - Curiosity about nature and love for animals: neutral to low
  - Understanding of hard work: higher
  - Estimate: \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1 \)

**Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**

This is tricky because \( \neg H \) encompasses all other fields.

Given no specific measure for \( \neg H \):
- Consider average alignment with personality traits across all other fields.
- Rough Estimate: \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.3 \)
- Rough Estimate: \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.3 \)
- Rough Estimate: \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.3 \)

**Bayes' Rule:**

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

\( P(E) \) is essentially a normalization factor for the denominator.

**Now compute \( P(H|E) \):**

**Computer Science:**
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.33}{P(E)} \]

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.33}{P(E)} \]

**Business Administration:**
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.33}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = (0.2 \times 0.33) + (0.7 \times 0.33) + (0.1 \times 0.33) \):

\[ P(E) = 0.066 + 0.231 + 0.033 = 0.33 \]

Thus,

**Computer Science:**
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.066}{0.33} = 0.2 \]

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{0.231}{0.33} = 0.70 \]

**Business Administration:**
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.033}{0.33} = 0.10 \]

So, our final answer:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.70,
  "business administration": 0.10
}
