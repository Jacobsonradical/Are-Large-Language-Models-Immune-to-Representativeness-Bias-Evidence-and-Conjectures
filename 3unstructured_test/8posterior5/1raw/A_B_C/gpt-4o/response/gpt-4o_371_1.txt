To apply Bayes' rule and make a reasonable guess about the probabilities, we need to estimate the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood of the evidence under the negation of each hypothesis \( P(E| \neg H) \).

Given the personality sketch of Adam, we can make the following approximate determinations:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: 
   - **P(H)**: Moderate, maybe around 0.2. It’s not among the most common fields, but his interests align well.
   - **P(E|H)**: High, around 0.8. His curiosity about nature and plants, as well as his love for animals, strongly indicates this field.
   - **P(E| \neg H)**: Lower, around 0.1. These traits are less likely to be as strongly present in other fields.

2. **Business Administration**: 
   - **P(H)**: Moderate to low, around 0.15. This is a common field but his interests do not align strongly.
   - **P(E|H)**: Low, around 0.1. This field generally doesn't require a deep love for nature or animals.
   - **P(E| \neg H)**: Higher, around 0.4. These personality traits are more likely to be present in other fields compared to this one.

3. **Computer Science**: 
   - **P(H)**: Moderate to high, around 0.25. It’s common and aligns somewhat with his quiet nature and intelligence.
   - **P(E|H)**: Moderate, around 0.3. He could enjoy solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, which fits well.
   - **P(E| \neg H)**: Moderate, around 0.3. These traits could also be found in other fields.

Now we apply Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is consistent across calculations, we only need relative comparisons:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.15}{P(E)} \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.25}{P(E)} \]

The actual numbers for \( P(E) \) can be derived if you sum these individual parts across all hypotheses and normalize, but here we just compare relative strengths:

1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( 0.16 \)
2. Business Administration: \( 0.015 \)
3. Computer Science: \( 0.075 \)

Normalized, these become:
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( \approx 0.57 \)
- Business Administration: \( \approx 0.05 \)
- Computer Science: \( \approx 0.27 \)

So the final probabilities are approximately:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.57,
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.27
}
```
