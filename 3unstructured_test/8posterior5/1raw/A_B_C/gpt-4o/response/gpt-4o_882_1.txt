To estimate \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study based on the given personality sketch \( E \), we'll follow these steps:

1. Estimate \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field.
2. Estimate \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in the field.
3. Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in that field.
4. Use Bayes' Rule to compute \( P(H|E) \).

Let's consider each field:

### Business Administration
#### Prior Probability \( P(H) \)
Let’s assume that the proportion of graduate students in business administration in the U.S. is about 20%.

#### Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)
Given Adam’s personality sketch, it seems less likely that he would be enrolled in business administration because his interests and traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, solving puzzles) don’t align well with typical traits of business administration students. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

#### Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)
The traits described are fairly specific and less common in business administration students. Let’s estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

### Computer Science
#### Prior Probability \( P(H) \)
Let’s assume that the proportion of graduate students in computer science in the U.S. is about 15%.

#### Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)
Given Adam’s personality sketch, it seems quite likely, since he enjoys solving puzzles and understands abstract concepts which are important traits for computer science. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.5 \).

#### Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)
Again, the traits are somewhat specific and not as common outside of computer science students. Let’s estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
#### Prior Probability \( P(H) \)
Let’s assume that the proportion of graduate students in agricultural and veterinary science in the U.S. is about 5%.

#### Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)
Given Adam’s personality sketch, it seems highly likely, since he has a deep love for animals and nature, as well as a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).

#### Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)
The traits described fit very well with agricultural and veterinary science, so let’s estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

### Applying Bayes' Rule

Bayes' Rule: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Now, let's calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field.

#### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.20}{0.1 \cdot 0.20 + 0.2 \cdot 0.80} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.16} = \frac{0.02}{0.18} \approx 0.111 \]

#### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.15}{0.5 \cdot 0.15 + 0.3 \cdot 0.85} = \frac{0.075}{0.075 + 0.255} = \frac{0.075}{0.33} \approx 0.227 \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{0.7 \cdot 0.05 + 0.1 \cdot 0.95} = \frac{0.035}{0.035 + 0.095} = \frac{0.035}{0.13} \approx 0.269 \]

So the approximations for \( P(H|E) \) are:

{
  "business administration": 0.111,
  "computer science": 0.227,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.269
}
