To compute \( P(H|E) \)—the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch—we use Bayes' Rule, which is expressed as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing Adam's personality sketch across all fields.

We'll assume the following general prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for graduate students in 2021 in the U.S. (values are for illustrative purposes):
- Business administration: 0.20 (20%)
- Computer science: 0.25 (25%)
- Agricultural and veterinary science: 0.10 (10%)

We should also estimate \( P(E|H) \) and  \( P(E|\neg H) \):

- \( P(E|H) \) is high for agricultural and veterinary science because Adam’s love for nature, plants, and animals matches well with this field.
- \( P(E|H) \) for computer science might be moderate since his quiet personality and enjoyment of solving puzzles align somewhat with this field.
- \( P(E|H) \) for business administration is likely lower, as his traits do not strongly align with typical characteristics needed in this field.

Assuming estimations for \( P(E|H) \):

- Business administration: 0.10
- Computer science: 0.40
- Agricultural and veterinary science: 0.80

Assuming \( P(E|\neg H) \):

\( P(E|\neg H) \) is the average probability of observing Adam’s characteristics in fields other than the one specified, simplifying by assuming they are equally distributed across remaining fields.

\[ P(E|\neg H) = \frac{(\text{Sum of } P(E|H_i) \text{ for all other fields})} {\text{(Number of other fields)}} \]

Calculating these values:

Consider the remaining probabilities for \( P(E|\neg H) \):

\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{business administration}}) = \frac{0.40+\ 0.80}{2} = 0.60 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{computer science}}) = \frac{0.10 + 0.80}{2} = 0.45 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{agriculture and veterinary science}}) = \frac{0.10 + 0.40}{2} = 0.25 \]

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assuming uniform proportionality inside each probability estimation, \( P(E) \) can be considered a normalization constant across evaluated fields so terms adaptively scale:

{
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.10 \cdot 0.20}{0.10 \cdot 0.20 + 0.40 \cdot 0.25 + 0.80 \cdot 0.10} \approx 0.09 \),
  "computer science": \( \frac{0.40 \cdot 0.25}{0.10 \cdot 0.20 + 0.40 \cdot 0.25 + 0.80 \cdot 0.10} \approx 0.36 \),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.10}{0.10 \cdot 0.20 + 0.40 \cdot 0.25 + 0.80 \cdot 0.10} \approx 0.55 \)
}

Thus, the more definite probabilistic values would be:

{
  "business administration": 0.09,
  "computer science": 0.36,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.55
}
