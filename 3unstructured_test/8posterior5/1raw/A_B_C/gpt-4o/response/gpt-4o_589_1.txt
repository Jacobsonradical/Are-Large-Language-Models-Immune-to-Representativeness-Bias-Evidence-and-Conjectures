To evaluate the probability of Adam being in each field based on the given personality sketch and using Bayes' Rule, we need to estimate the following probabilities:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the evidence (Adam's personality sketch) given that he is in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the evidence given that Adam is not in that field.

Then we can use Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) \) is the normalizing constant ensuring that the probabilities sum to 1 (it's not needed to compare the relative probabilities here).

Let's make some reasoned estimates based on the information provided:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. \( P(H) \): Agricultural and veterinary science is a less common field of study than business or computer science, but not exceedingly rare.
   - Let's assume \( P(H) \) to be around 0.05.
   
2. \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, it seems highly probable.
   - Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) to be around 0.8.
   
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given that these traits could somewhat fit other fields but are not as strongly aligned, should be lower.
   - Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) to be around 0.2.

### Business Administration

1. \( P(H) \): Business administration is a common field of study.
   - Let's assume \( P(H) \) to be around 0.2.
   
2. \( P(E|H) \): Adam's traits do not particularly match common business administration profiles, which usually lean towards leadership, strategic thinking, and less focus on nature and animals.
   - Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) to be around 0.1.
   
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): Adam's traits are better explained by other fields, so this probability should be moderately high.
   - Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) to be around 0.3.

### Computer Science

1. \( P(H) \): Computer science is a very common field of study.
   - Let's assume \( P(H) \) to be around 0.25.
   
2. \( P(E|H) \): Adam's traits of intelligence, solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts fit well, but his love for nature and animals is less aligned.
   - Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) to be around 0.3.
   
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given the broad applicability of his traits in other fields, this probability should reflect that.
   - Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) to be around 0.5.

Using Bayes' Rule to compute \( P(H|E) \):

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.25} \approx 0.104 \]

2. **Business Administration**:
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.25} \approx 0.091 \]

3. **Computer Science**:
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.25}{0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.25} \approx 0.487 \]

Thus, summarizing the probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.104,
  "business administration": 0.091,
  "computer science": 0.487
}
