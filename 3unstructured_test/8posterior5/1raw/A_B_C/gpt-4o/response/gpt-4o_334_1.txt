To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we'll need to estimate the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was in each field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was not in each field.

While precise values of these probabilities can be difficult to quantify without more data, I will make reasonable estimates based on the typical characteristics of students in these fields.

Here is the calculation for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H_{\text{agri}}) \): Prior probability of being in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume it's 0.1 given a broad array of fields.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality profile given he is in agricultural and veterinary science is likely high (animals, nature, plants align well). Let's assume 0.8.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agri}}) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality profile given he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume 0.3.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) \): Prior probability of being in computer science. Let's assume it's 0.2 given the popularity of the field.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality profile given he is in computer science could be moderate but not as closely aligned (solving puzzles and high intelligence align, but not all traits). Let's assume 0.5.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}}) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality profile given he is not in computer science. Let's assume 0.4.

3. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H_{\text{ba}}) \): Prior probability of being in business administration. Let's assume it's 0.15.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality profile given he is in business administration is likely lower (not as closely aligned with typical characteristics of business students). Let's assume 0.2.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{ba}}) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality profile given he is not in business administration. Let's assume 0.45.

Now applying Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \), we can compute the posterior probabilities:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) = 0.08 + 0.27 = 0.35 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.35} = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \approx 0.229 \]

2. **Computer Science**:

\[ P(E) = (0.5 \cdot 0.2) + (0.4 \cdot 0.8) = 0.1 + 0.32 = 0.42 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.42} = \frac{0.1}{0.42} \approx 0.238 \]

3. **Business Administration**:

\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.15) + (0.45 \cdot 0.85) = 0.03 + 0.3825 = 0.4125 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{0.4125} = \frac{0.03}{0.4125} \approx 0.073 \]

Therefore, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.229,
  "computer science": 0.238,
  "business administration": 0.073
}
