To use Bayesian probability and compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we'll start with the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) of Adam being enrolled in each field. We'll also estimate the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of the personality sketch given each field and the probability \( P(E|\neg H) \) of the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in the specific field.

First, let's assign values based on reasonable assumptions and estimates:

1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
   - \( P(H) \): Moderate prior probability, given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.3 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): High probability that his personality fits this field. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Moderate probability, as his traits could also fit other fields. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

2. Business Administration:
   - \( P(H) \): Lower prior probability, given Adam's traits. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Low probability that his personality fits this field. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Higher probability, as his traits are less common in business administration. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

3. Computer Science:
   - \( P(H) \): Moderate prior probability, considering his intelligence and puzzle-solving skills. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.3 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Moderate probability that his personality fits this field. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.6 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Moderate probability, as his traits are somewhat common in other fields. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

Using Bayes' Rule: 

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

We'll calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field.

1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.3}{0.8 \cdot 0.3 + 0.4 \cdot 0.7} = \frac{0.24}{0.24 + 0.28} = \frac{0.24}{0.52} \approx 0.46 \]

2. Business Administration:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.2 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.4} = \frac{0.04}{0.44} \approx 0.09 \]

3. Computer Science:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.3}{0.6 \cdot 0.3 + 0.4 \cdot 0.7} = \frac{0.18}{0.18 + 0.28} = \frac{0.18}{0.46} \approx 0.39 \]

Thus, we have:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.46,
  "business administration": 0.09,
  "computer science": 0.39
}
```

These results indicate that based on the personality sketch, Adam is most likely to be enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, followed by Computer Science, and least likely in Business Administration.
