To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in a given field of study based on the provided personality sketch, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is formulated as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence (Adam's personality sketch) given that he was enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the evidence (Adam's personality sketch).

For simplicity, we do not need to calculate \( P(E) \) explicitly as we are comparing probabilities across different hypotheses.

Let's make reasonable assumptions for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field:

**Computer Science:**
- \( P(H) \) - Computer Science is a common graduate field, so we'll assume \( P(H) = 0.25 \).
- \( P(E|H) \) - The sketch describes Adam as interested in nature, plants, animals, and empathy, which are less typical for computer science. Thus, \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) - Given Adam's traits, it is more likely that we would not find a Computer Science student with these traits, so we’ll set \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.8 \).

**Business Administration:**
- \( P(H) \) - Business Administration is also a common graduate field, so we'll assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|H) \) - The personality traits described seem less aligned with Business Administration. Thus, \( P(E|H) = 0.05 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) - Students in fields other than Business Administration are more likely to exhibit these traits, so we’ll set \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.75 \).

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- \( P(H) \) - This is a less common graduate field, so we'll assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).
- \( P(E|H) \) - Adam's sketch fits very well with this field (interest in nature, plants, animals). Thus, \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) - It is unlikely that students not in this field would exhibit the same traits, thus we’ll set \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

We now compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule:

**Computer Science:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{P(E)} = \frac{0.025}{P(E)} \]

**Business Administration:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.05 \times 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.01}{P(E)} \]

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 \times 0.05}{P(E)} = \frac{0.045}{P(E)} \]

The total probability \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant, but we can directly compare the numerators to gauge relative probabilities.

Given above calculations:

{
  "computer science": "0.025",
  "business administration": "0.01",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.045"
