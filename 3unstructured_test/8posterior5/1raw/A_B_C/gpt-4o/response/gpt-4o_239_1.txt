To compute \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to follow the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where \(P(E)\) can be computed as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

We will need to make some assumptions for \(P(H)\), \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E|\neg H)\) for each field.

### Business Administration
- \(P(H_{BA})\): Fairly low, consider 0.1 (10%)
- \(P(E|H_{BA})\): Low, consider 0.1 (10%) since Adam's traits don't strongly align with business administration.
- \(P(E|\neg H_{BA})\): This needs to represent the likelihood of Adam's traits given he is in some other field, consider 0.5 (50%).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \(P(H_{AgVet})\): Low-to-moderate, consider 0.2 (20%)
- \(P(E|H_{AgVet})\): High, consider 0.7 (70%) since Adam's interests and traits strongly align with this field.
- \(P(E|\neg H_{AgVet})\): Moderate, consider 0.4 (40%) as there might be other fields that match his interests.

### Computer Science
- \(P(H_{CS})\): Moderate, consider 0.3 (30%)
- \(P(E|H_{CS})\): Fairly low, consider 0.2 (20%) since Adam's traits donâ€™t perfectly align with typical computer science traits.
- \(P(E|\neg H_{CS})\): Moderate, consider 0.5 (50%).

Let's now compute \(P(H|E)\) for each field.

1. **Business Administration:**
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA})P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E_{BA}) = P(E|H_{BA})P(H_{BA}) + P(E|\neg H_{BA})P(\neg H_{BA}) = 0.1 \cdot 0.1 + 0.5 \cdot 0.9 = 0.01 + 0.45 = 0.46 \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.46} \approx 0.022 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(H_{AgVet}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AgVet})P(H_{AgVet})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E_{AgVet}) = P(E|H_{AgVet})P(H_{AgVet}) + P(E|\neg H_{AgVet})P(\neg H_{AgVet}) = 0.7 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8 = 0.14 + 0.32 = 0.46 \]
\[ P(H_{AgVet}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.46} \approx 0.304 \]

3. **Computer Science:**
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS})P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E_{CS}) = P(E|H_{CS})P(H_{CS}) + P(E|\neg H_{CS})P(\neg H_{CS}) = 0.2 \cdot 0.3 + 0.5 \cdot 0.7 = 0.06 + 0.35 = 0.41 \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{0.41} \approx 0.146 \]

Thus, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.022,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.304,
  "computer science": 0.146
}
