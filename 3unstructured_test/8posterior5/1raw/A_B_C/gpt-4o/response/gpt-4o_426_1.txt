To compute the probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for each hypothesis (field of study), we will use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (field of study).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence (Adam's personality sketch) given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given any other hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence (can be calculated but isn't strictly necessary to compare relative probabilities).

Let's make some reasonable assumptions and calculate the needed values.

### Assumptions:
- Prior probabilities, \( P(H) \), for each field of study:
  - Business Administration: 0.25 (assuming it's among the most common graduate studies)
  - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.10 (assuming it's less common but still plausible)
  - Computer Science: 0.25 (also among the most common and relevant given the details)

- Likelihoods, \( P(E|H) \), based on Adam's personality sketch:
  - Business Administration: 0.05 (as his interests and traits don't strongly align with typical business administration skills or interests)
  - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.60 (several traits and interests strongly align with this field)
  - Computer Science: 0.10 (his abstract thinking and problem-solving fit, but other interests don't align strongly)

- Likelihoods, \( P(E|\neg H) \), average likelihood that Adam's personality would be otherwise:
  - Business Administration: 0.30
  - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.10
  - Computer Science: 0.30

These likelihoods don't need to be exact, but should reasonably reflect relative chances based on the information available.

We'll use these to find the individual posterior probabilities:

### Calculation:
1. Business Administration:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.25}{P(E)} = \frac{0.0125}{P(E)} \]

2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.60 \cdot 0.10}{P(E)} = \frac{0.06}{P(E)} \]

3. Computer Science:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.10 \cdot 0.25}{P(E)} = \frac{0.025}{P(E)} \]

Since our interest is in the relative probabilities rather than exact values, we can compare the numerators directly (as \(P(E)\) is a constant and cancels out in the comparison):

### Results:
We'll normalize these values so they sum to 1 for easier comparison:

Sum of numerators = 0.0125 + 0.06 + 0.025 = 0.0975

Normalized:
- Business Administration: \(\frac{0.0125}{0.0975} \approx 0.128\)
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \(\frac{0.06}{0.0975} \approx 0.615\)
- Computer Science: \(\frac{0.025}{0.0975} \approx 0.256\)

### Final Probabilities:
