To apply Bayes' rule for each hypothesis, we need to define and calculate the following probabilities:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in each field.
- \( P(E| \neg H) \): The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in each field.
- \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field given the evidence \( E \).

### Assumptions for Prior Probabilities
Since we do not have specific prior data, we will assume equal prior probabilities for each field. However, these can be adjusted if more information is available.

### Calculation for Each Field

Let's assume the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for simplicity are uniformly distributed among the fields:
- \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.33 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.33 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.33 \)

### Likelihoods ( \( P(E|H) \) )
Based on the personality sketch \( E \):
- **Business Administration**: The probability \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \) is relatively low because the traits listed (curiosity about nature, love for animals, quiet, enjoys solving puzzles) do not strongly correlate with business administration.
  - \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.1 \)

- **Computer Science**: The traits like high intelligence, abstract thinking, and enjoying solving puzzles are highly relevant, but the interest in plants and animals is less common.
  - \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.3 \)

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The traits like a genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy strongly correlate with this field.
  - \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.8 \)

### Normalization Constant
We'll use the law of total probability to compute the normalization constant \( P(E) \).

\[
P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{business administration}})P(H_{\text{business administration}}) + P(E|H_{\text{computer science}})P(H_{\text{computer science}}) + P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})
\]
\[
P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.33) + (0.3 \times 0.33) + (0.8 \times 0.33) = 0.033 + 0.099 + 0.264 = 0.396
\]

### Compute Posterior Probabilities using Bayes' Rule
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

- **Business Administration**:
\[
P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{(0.1 \times 0.33)}{0.396} = \frac{0.033}{0.396} \approx 0.083
\]

- **Computer Science**:
\[
P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{(0.3 \times 0.33)}{0.396} = \frac{0.099}{0.396} \approx 0.250
\]

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[
P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{(0.8 \times 0.33)}{0.396} = \frac{0.264}{0.396} \approx 0.667
\]

### Final Answer
\[
\{
  "business administration": 0.083,
  "computer science": 0.250,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.667
\}
\]
