To solve this problem using Bayes' theorem, we need to compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence (personality sketch) given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence given that Adam is not enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the evidence, which can be computed by using the law of total probability.

For simplification, let's assume we don't have the exact numbers and are making educated estimates based on observations of typical students in each field.

### Computer Science

- \( P(H) \): Given the breadth of fields, we can assume the prior \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \) (or 20%).
- \( P(E|H) \): It is less likely for a computer science student to have a deep empathy and love for animals, but they could be highly curious and good at solving puzzles. Let's say \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 1 - P(E|H) = 0.7 \).

### Business Administration

- \( P(H) \): Again, without other field-specific details, let's estimate \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \) (or 20%).
- \( P(E|H) \): Business students may have empathy but the other traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals) are less aligned. So, let's say \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 1 - P(E|H) = 0.9 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- \( P(H) \): Let's assume the prior \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \) (or 10%).
- \( P(E|H) \): This field aligns well with empathy, curiosity about nature, love for animals, and dedication, which fits Adam's profile strongly. So, \( P(E|H) \approx 0.7 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 1 - P(E|H) = 0.3 \).

Now, we need to normalize these values to compute \( P(E) \). For simplicity, let's assume \( P(E) \) is an average (but in reality it would depend more directly on \( P(E|H) \) and our priors).

Since we don't have exact values for \( P(E) \), we'll proceed with estimated relative scores:

- **Computer Science:**

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{(0.3) \cdot (0.2)}{P(E)} \approx 0.06 \]

- **Business Administration:**

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{(0.1) \cdot (0.2)}{P(E)} \approx 0.02 \]

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{(0.7) \cdot (0.1)}{P(E)} \approx 0.07 \]

Therefore, the approximate probabilities would be:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.06,
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.07
}
