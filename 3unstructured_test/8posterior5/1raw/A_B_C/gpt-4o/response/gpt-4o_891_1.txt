To evaluate the probabilities using Bayes' rule, we follow these steps:

1. **Base Rate Probability (P(H)):** The initial probability that Adam enrolled in each field without any additional information.
2. **Likelihood (P(E|H)):** The probability of observing personality sketch E (Adam's personality traits) given that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
3. **Marginal Probability (P(E|¬H)):** The probability of observing the personality sketch E across other fields combined.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) \) can be derived from:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

### Assumptions and Reasoning:

1. **Base Rate Probabilities (P(H)):**
   - **computer science:** Generally, a common field, so let's assume P(H) = 0.20.
   - **business administration:** Another common field, assume P(H) = 0.20.
   - **agricultural and veterinary science:** Less common, assume P(H) = 0.10.

2. **Likelihood (P(E|H)):** 
   - **computer science:** Traits of curiosity, intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts fit well. Estimate high likelihood: P(E|H) = 0.70.
   - **business administration:** Traits like empathy and appreciation for dedication are good fits, but less focus on nature. P(E|H) = 0.40.
   - **agricultural and veterinary science:** Traits are an almost perfect match. P(E|H) = 0.90.

3. **Marginal Probability (P(E|¬H)):**
   - Probability of these personality traits across all other fields outside the given three (denoted as ¬H). Given other fields could likely include psychology, biology, etc., estimating an averaged probability: P(E|¬H) ≈ 0.30.

Let’s use these values to calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \):

### Posterior Calculations:

1. **Computer Science:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.70 \cdot 0.20}{0.70 \cdot 0.20 + 0.40 \cdot 0.20 + 0.90 \cdot 0.10 + 0.30 \cdot 0.50} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.14}{0.14 + 0.08 + 0.09 + 0.15} = \frac{0.14}{0.46} = 0.304 \]

2. **Business Administration:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.40 \cdot 0.20}{0.46} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.46} = 0.174 \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.90 \cdot 0.10}{0.46} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.46} = 0.196 \]

Here, these are specific probabilities for the three fields using plausible initial assumptions. 

Given these probabilities (and allowing for other fields):

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.304",
  "business administration": "0.174",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.196"
}
```

These are rounded values and represent the degrees to which Adam’s personality traits match each field, given the sketch and assumptions laid out. Note that the total does not sum to 1, since we only considered three fields out of many possible graduate fields of study.
