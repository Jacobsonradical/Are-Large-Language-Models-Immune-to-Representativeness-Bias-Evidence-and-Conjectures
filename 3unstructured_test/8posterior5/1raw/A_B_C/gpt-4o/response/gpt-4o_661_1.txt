Sure, let's proceed step by step for each field using Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not in that field.
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch.

Let's make reasoned estimates for each value:

1. **Business Administration (BA)**
    - \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration. Assume this is a relatively common field. Let's set it to 0.2.
    - \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): Given Adam's personality sketch, how likely is it that a student in Business Administration would match this sketch? Business Administration students may not typically have a strong affinity for nature, animals, and abstract concepts as described. Let's set this to 0.05.
    - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \): The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch if he is not in Business Administration. This could be spread across many other fields, but for simplification, let's set it to 0.15.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS)**
    - \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Let's set it to 0.1, assuming it's less common than Business Administration.
    - \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \): Adam’s personality sketch is highly consistent with someone in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Let's set this to 0.8.
    - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \): If he is not in AVS, considering how unique his attributes are to this field, let's set this to 0.1.

3. **Computer Science (CS)**
    - \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Computer Science. Let's assume this is a common field, perhaps set it to 0.2.
    - \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): Given Adam's personality sketch, how likely is it that a student in Computer Science would match this sketch? Computer Science students often deal with abstract concepts and puzzles, but the affinity for nature and animals is less typical. Let's set this to 0.3.
    - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \): If he is not in Computer Science, depending on other fields fitting better, let's set this to 0.1.

We will need the value of \( P(E) \) for normalization, but as we are working with relative probabilities, we can compare \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) directly for each hypothesis. 

Now, for computing \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.05 \cdot 0.2 = 0.01 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.3 \cdot 0.2 = 0.06 \]

Now we normalize these values to get the probabilities:

\[ \sum P(H|E) = 0.01 + 0.08 + 0.06 = 0.15 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.15} \approx 0.0667 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.15} \approx 0.5333 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.15} \approx 0.4 \]

So, the resulting probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.067,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.533,
  "computer science": 0.400
}
```
