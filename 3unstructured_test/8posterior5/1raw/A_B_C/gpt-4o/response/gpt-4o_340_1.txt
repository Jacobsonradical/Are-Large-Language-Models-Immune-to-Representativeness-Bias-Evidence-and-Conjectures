To evaluate the probabilities, we will use Bayes' rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam is in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam is not in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the evidence \( E \), which can be derived from the law of total probability.

We don't have specific data for these probabilities, so we'll assign values based on reasonable assumptions.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **Prior Probability (P(H))**:
   - Let's assume the prior probability that any random graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science is low but not negligible.
   - Let's assign \( P(H) = 0.05 \).

2. **Likelihood (P(E|H))**:
   - Given the strong match between Adam’s love for nature, plants, animals, and this field, we can assume it's quite likely.
   - Let's assign \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

3. **Likelihood of Evidence Given Not H (P(E|\neg H))**:
   - Considering a random graduate student not in this field, the likelihood of matching Adam’s profile is lower.
   - Let's assign \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

### Business Administration
1. **Prior Probability (P(H))**:
   - Business administration is a common field, so the prior could be higher.
   - Let's assign \( P(H) = 0.15 \).

2. **Likelihood (P(E|H))**:
   - Given Adam's interests and personality, the match seems poor.
   - Let's assign \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

3. **Likelihood of Evidence Given Not H (P(E|\neg H))**:
   - Given the general mismatch, the likelihood of matching Adam’s profile if not in this field is fairly high.
   - Let's assign \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

### Computer Science
1. **Prior Probability (P(H))**:
   - Computer science is also a common field.
   - Let's assign \( P(H) = 0.15 \).

2. **Likelihood (P(E|H))**:
   - Given his interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence in abstract concepts, there is a reasonable match.
   - Let's assign \( P(E|H) = 0.5 \).

3. **Likelihood of Evidence Given Not H (P(E|\neg H))**:
   - If not in computer science, the likelihood of matching Adam’s interest in puzzles and abstract concepts is moderate.
   - Let's assign \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

### Calculating Posterior Probabilities (P(H|E))

To simplify calculations, we assume \( P(E) \) is equal across fields for comparative purposes. Thus:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.05 = 0.04 \]

#### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.15 = 0.015 \]

#### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.5 \times 0.15 = 0.075 \]

Given the comparisons relative to these fields, the final values are normalized to make meaningful comparative values assuming they don't need to add up to one in this context.

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.04,
  "business administration": 0.015,
  "computer science": 0.075
}

Feel free to adjust these probabilities based on more specialized data if available!
