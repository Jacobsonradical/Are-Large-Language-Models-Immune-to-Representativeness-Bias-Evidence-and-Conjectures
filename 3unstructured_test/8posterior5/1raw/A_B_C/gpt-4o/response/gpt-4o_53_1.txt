To apply Bayes' Rule and calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \), we'll need to estimate the following:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The general likelihood that a graduate student is enrolled in each field.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is enrolled in each specific field.
3. **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is not enrolled in the specific field.

Let's work through the calculations for each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H)** (prior):
   - Since this is a fairly specialized field, let's assume the prior probability is moderate.
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.10 \)
   
2. **P(E|H)** (likelihood):
   - Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align well with this field.
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.70 \)
   
3. **P(E|\neg H)** (complement likelihood):
   - Given that these traits could be found in individuals outside this field but are perhaps less likely.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.30 \)
   
Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant, we focus on the numerator for relative comparison:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H)P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.70 \times 0.10 = 0.07 \]

### Computer Science
1. **P(H)** (prior):
   - This is a popular graduate field, so assume a higher prior probability.
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.25 \)
   
2. **P(E|H)** (likelihood):
   - Adam's high intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles align with computer science.
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.50 \)
   
3. **P(E|\neg H)** (complement likelihood):
   - These traits are not uncommon outside this field.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.50 \)

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H)P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.50 \times 0.25 = 0.125 \]

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)** (prior):
   - This is also a common graduate field, assume moderate prior probability.
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.20 \)
   
2. **P(E|H)** (likelihood):
   - Adam's personality traits, except for his appreciation for hard work, do not strongly align with business.
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.20 \)
   
3. **P(E|\neg H)** (complement likelihood):
   - His traits are likely more common outside this field.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.60 \)

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H)P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.20 \times 0.20 = 0.04 \]

### Normalizing the Results
To provide better insight, let's make the factors more intuitive by scaling them relative to the highest value (Computer Science in this case):

\[ 
\text{agricultural and veterinary science} = \frac{0.07}{0.125} \approx 0.56 
\]
\[ 
\text{computer science} = \frac{0.125}{0.125} = 1 
\]
\[ 
\text{business administration} = \frac{0.04}{0.125} \approx 0.32 
\]

### Final Results
These scaled values help in comparing the fields relative to each other:

  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.56,
  "computer science": 1,
  "business administration": 0.32
