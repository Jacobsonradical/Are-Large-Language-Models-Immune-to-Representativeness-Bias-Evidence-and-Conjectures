To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field. Here is a step-by-step outline:

1. \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the field.
2. \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in the field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in the field.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be computed as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

Given the values above:
- \( P(H) \) is a subjective probability based on how common it is for a graduate student to be enrolled in each respective field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is a subjective probability based on the fit between Adam's personality sketch and the characteristics typically associated with each respective field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of his personality sketch given he is studying any other field than the one considered, which requires a general sense of how likely such characteristics are among average students.

Let's analyze each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - \( P(H) \) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science (assuming it is less common): ≈ 0.10
   - \( P(E|H) \) for Adam's traits fitting this field: High, ≈ 0.60 (interest in nature, animals, dedication)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \):  ≈ 0.20 (traits less common, among other fields)

2. **Computer Science**
   - \( P(H) \) for Computer Science (assuming it is more common): ≈ 0.30
   - \( P(E|H) \) for Adam's traits fitting this field: Low to Moderate, ≈ 0.30 (intelligence, puzzle-solving fit, but less on nature/animals)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \):  ≈ 0.40 (many students share intelligence and puzzle-solving)

3. **Business Administration**
   - \( P(H) \) for Business Administration (moderately common): ≈ 0.20
   - \( P(E|H) \) for Adam's traits fitting this field: Low to Very Low, ≈ 0.10 (less fit with nature, animals traits)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): ≈ 0.40 (traits of intelligence and empathy shared with others, not specific)

Now, we use these to compute \( P(H|E) \):

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.60 \times 0.10}{(0.60 \times 0.10) + (0.20 \times 0.90)} = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.18} = \frac{0.06}{0.24} = 0.25 \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.30 \times 0.30}{(0.30 \times 0.30) + (0.40 \times 0.70)} = \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.28} = \frac{0.09}{0.37} \approx 0.24 \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.10 \times 0.20}{(0.10 \times 0.20) + (0.40 \times 0.80)} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.32} = \frac{0.02}{0.34} \approx 0.06 \]

So the answers in the requested format are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.25,
  "computer science": 0.24,
  "business administration": 0.06
}
