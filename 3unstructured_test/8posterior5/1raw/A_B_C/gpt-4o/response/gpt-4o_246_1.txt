First, let's consider the application of Bayes' Theorem, which is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the nature of the problem, we'll make some assumptions based on the provided personality sketch (E) and general knowledge about these fields.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: Given Adam's curiosity about nature and love for animals, the prior probability that he was enrolled in this field seems moderately high. Let's assume **P(H) = 0.3**.
- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing the personality traits (E) given that Adam is in this field is very high, say **P(E|H) = 0.8**.
- **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood of observing these traits given that Adam is NOT in this field would be lower but not negligible, considering he may still have these interests and values regardless of his field. Let's assume **P(E|¬H) = 0.2**.

### Computer Science
- **P(H)**: Given Adam's intelligence and love of solving puzzles, the prior probability that he was enrolled in this field is moderately high. Let's assume **P(H) = 0.25**.
- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing the personality traits (E) given that Adam is in this field is moderate yet lower than the previous field as the direct connection to nature and animals isn't as clear. Let's assume **P(E|H) = 0.4**.
- **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood of having these traits in someone not in this field is more or less similar to the general population, let's assume **P(E|¬H) = 0.45**.

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: This field seems less likely for Adam considering his personality sketch. Let's assume **P(H) = 0.1**.
- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing the personality traits (E) given that Adam is in this field is low compared to the other fields, say **P(E|H) = 0.3**.
- **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood of these traits for someone not in this field is higher, considering business management doesn't typically align with Adam's traits. Let's assume **P(E|¬H) = 0.6**.

To find \(P(E)\), we sum over all possible fields (though we know it's not exhaustive here, it lets us normalize within our scope):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_1)P(H_1) + P(E|H_2)P(H_2) + P(E|H_3)P(H_3) \]

Where \( H_1 \) is Agricultural and Veterinary Science, \( H_2 \) is Computer Science, and \( H_3 \) is Business Administration.
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \times 0.3 + 0.4 \times 0.25 + 0.3 \times 0.1 = 0.24 + 0.1 + 0.03 = 0.37 \]

Now using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1)P(H_1)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.3}{0.37} \approx 0.65 \]
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2)P(H_2)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \times 0.25}{0.37} \approx 0.27 \]
\[ P(H_3|E) = \frac{P(E|H_3)P(H_3)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \times 0.1}{0.37} \approx 0.081 \]

These results should therefore be:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.65,
  "computer science": 0.27,
  "business administration": 0.081
}
```
