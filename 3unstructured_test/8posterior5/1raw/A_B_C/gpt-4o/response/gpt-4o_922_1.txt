To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) for the given fields using Bayes' rule, we will consider \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). We assume that all fields have equal prior likelihood, meaning \( P(H) \) is the same for all three fields and less specific priors for other likely fields are not considered.

Given:
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in a specific field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given he is not in that specific field.
- Let \( P(H) = 0.33 \) for equal priors, simplifying without more information.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - \( P(H) \approx 0.33 \)
    - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \): High probability given his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation of hard work.
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \): Moderate, given that these traits can be found in other fields but to a lesser extent.

    Using Bayes' rule:
    \[
    P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
    \]
    \[
    P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.33}{(0.9 \cdot 0.33) + (0.3 \cdot 0.67)} \approx 0.60
    \]

2. **Business Administration**:
    - \( P(H) \approx 0.33 \)
    - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \): Low, given the less direct correlation with Adam’s traits like love for animals and curiosity about nature.
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \): Higher, since other fields might share more commonality with Adam’s traits.

    Using Bayes' rule:
    \[
    P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.33}{(0.1 \cdot 0.33) + (0.5 \cdot 0.67)} \approx 0.09
    \]

3. **Computer Science**:
    - \( P(H) \approx 0.33 \)
    - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.4 \): Moderately likely due to high intelligence and abstract concept understanding, yet less related to nature and animals.
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \): Similar to since these traits are more broadly descriptive.

    Using Bayes' rule:
    \[
    P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.33}{(0.4 \cdot 0.33) + (0.4 \cdot 0.67)} \approx 0.33
    \]

Summarizing:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.60,
  "business administration": 0.09,
  "computer science": 0.33
}
```

These values, while approximations given the general nature of the data, follow from our assumptions and the application of Bayes' rule.
