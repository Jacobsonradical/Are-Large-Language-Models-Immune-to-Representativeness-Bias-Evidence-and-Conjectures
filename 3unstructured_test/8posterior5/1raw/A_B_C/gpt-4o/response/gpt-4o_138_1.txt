To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Rule, we first need to specify our estimated values for:

1. \( P(H) \) - The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
2. \( P(E|H) \) - The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.

Bayes' Rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we are comparing relative probabilities, we don't need the exact value of \( P(E) \) itself, as it is common across all hypotheses. We just need to focus on the numerators for comparison.

Let's estimate these probabilities based on the given description:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): Business administration is a common graduate field but less likely for someone with Adam's described interests.
     - \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \)
   - \( P(E|H) \): The personality sketch doesn't strongly align with business administration traits.
     - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of having such an empathetic, nature-loving and intelligent profile outside business administration is reasonably high.
     - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.7 \)

2. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Computer Science is a popular field and could be a plausible fit for someone intelligent and good at abstract thinking.
     - \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \)
   - \( P(E|H) \): The personality sketch fits reasonably with a computer science student, though not perfectly.
     - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.5 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of having such a profile outside computer science is also relatively high.
     - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.7 \)

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Not as common as Computer Science, but the interests align well with this field.
     - \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \)
   - \( P(E|H) \): The personality sketch fits very well with someone in agricultural and veterinary sciences.
     - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of having such a profile outside this field is lower.
     - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \)

Now, we compute the relative values for \( P(H|E) \):

1. **Business Administration**:
   \[
   P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \times 0.1 = 0.02
   \]

2. **Computer Science**:
   \[
   P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.5 \times 0.3 = 0.15
   \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[
   P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.9 \times 0.2 = 0.18
   \]

Now letâ€™s normalize these values to sum them to 1 (for clearer comparison), although the relative magnitudes are what's essential:

Total = \( 0.02 + 0.15 + 0.18 = 0.35 \)

Normalized probabilities:

\[
P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} = \frac{0.02}{0.35} \approx 0.057
\]

\[
P(H|E)_{\text{computer science}} = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \approx 0.429
\]

\[
P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} = \frac{0.18}{0.35} \approx 0.514
\]

Therefore, the relative probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": 0.057,
  "computer science": 0.429,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.514
}
