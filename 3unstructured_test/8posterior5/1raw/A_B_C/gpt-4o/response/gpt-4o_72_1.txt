To calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis, we'll use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence.

Assumptions:
- Since the task doesn't provide specific numeric values, I'll make reasonable assumptions for the sake of calculation.
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 1 - P(E|H) \) as a reasonable estimate for the relative comparison.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- \( P(H) \): Considering all possible graduate fields, let's assume the prior probability for this field is moderate. Say \( 0.15 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): The evidence provided (interest in nature, plants, animals, empathy) strongly aligns with this field. Let's assume a high value, \( 0.8 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): This would be much lower since the characteristics match less with other fields. Say, \( 0.3 \).

### Business Administration:
- \( P(H) \): A common graduate field, but doesn’t align well with Adam’s characteristics. Let's assume \( 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): The evidence poorly matches this field. Say, \( 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): This should be relatively high, as Adam's characteristics are more likely to be found in other fields. Say, \( 0.7 \).

### Computer Science:
- \( P(H) \): Popular field. Assume \( 0.25 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Adam likes solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which fits well, so fairly high. Say, \( 0.6 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): High, as Adam’s traits could match many fields. Say, \( 0.5 \).

### Calculations:
We need to compute \( P(E) \) for each, but without specific values, it suffices to present proportional comparisons. So we normalize our results to get relative values.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.6} = 0.2 \] (normalized later)

### Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.14} = 0.014 \] (normalized later)

### Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} = 0.5 \] (normalized later)

### Normalization:
We'll normalize the above posterior probabilities for relative comparison:
\[ \text{Sum} = 0.2 + 0.014 + 0.5 = 0.714 \]
\[ \text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science} = \frac{0.2}{0.714} \approx 0.28 \]
\[ \text{Business Administration} = \frac{0.014}{0.714} \approx 0.02 \]
\[ \text{Computer Science} = \frac{0.5}{0.714} \approx 0.70 \]

Therefore, the normalized posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.28,
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.70
}
```
