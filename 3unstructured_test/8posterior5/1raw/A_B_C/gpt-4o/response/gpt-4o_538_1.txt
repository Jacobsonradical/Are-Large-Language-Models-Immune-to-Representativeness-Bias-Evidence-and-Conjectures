To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis is false \( P(E|\neg H) \). The Bayes' rule formula is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) \) can be expanded as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's make reasonable assumptions for each of the prior probabilities and likelihoods for each field.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **Prior Probability, \(P(H)\)**: Given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, there's a good chance he would be in this field. Let's estimate \( P(H) = 0.3 \).
   - **Likelihood, \(P(E|H)\)**: The evidence fits very well with this field. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
   - **Likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis is false, \(P(E|\neg H)\)**: The evidence could still somewhat fit other fields, so we can estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

2. **Computer Science**:
   - **Prior Probability, \(P(H)\)**: While computer science is a common field for intelligent people interested in problem-solving, the connection to nature and animals is weaker. Let's estimate \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
   - **Likelihood, \(P(E|H)\)**: The evidence is somewhat fitting for computer science due to his intelligence and problem-solving skills. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \).
   - **Likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis is false, \(P(E|\neg H)\)**: The evidence might still fit somewhat, so we can estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

3. **Business Administration**:
   - **Prior Probability, \(P(H)\)**: Adamâ€™s personality sketch does not strongly suggest an inclination towards business administration. Let's estimate \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
   - **Likelihood, \(P(E|H)\)**: The evidence fits less well with business administration. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).
   - **Likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis is false, \(P(E|\neg H)\)**: The evidence is more likely to fit alternative fields, so we can estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

Using Bayes' rule, we calculate the posterior probabilities for each field:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  \[
  P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.3}{(0.8 \times 0.3) + (0.2 \times 0.7)} = \frac{0.24}{0.24 + 0.14} = \frac{0.24}{0.38} \approx 0.632
  \]

- **Computer Science**:
  \[
  P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.2}{(0.4 \times 0.2) + (0.3 \times 0.8)} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.24} = \frac{0.08}{0.32} = 0.25
  \]

- **Business Administration**:
  \[
  P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{(0.2 \times 0.1) + (0.4 \times 0.9)} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.36} = \frac{0.02}{0.38} \approx 0.053
  \]

Thus, the computed posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.632,
  "computer science": 0.25,
  "business administration": 0.053
}
