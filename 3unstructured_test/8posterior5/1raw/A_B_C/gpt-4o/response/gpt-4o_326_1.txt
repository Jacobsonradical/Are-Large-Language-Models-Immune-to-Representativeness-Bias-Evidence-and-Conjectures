To apply Bayes' rule for calculating the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field given Adam's personality sketch, we need to make judgments about the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the marginal likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \). Here is one way to approach this:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being in each field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam having the given personality sketch if he is in that field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of Adam having the given personality sketch if he is not in that field.

### Judgments:
#### Computer Science
- **P(H)**: This is a fairly common field, so let's assign a moderate prior.
- **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's intelligence and enjoyment of puzzles, this could be moderately high.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: This would be his likelihood of having such a personality if not in computer science.

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: This is less common relative to more general fields but matches his curiosity about nature.
- **P(E|H)**: Given his love for animals and nature, this is very high.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: This would include other fields and is likely lower than if he were in agricultural and veterinary science.

#### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: This is a very common field.
- **P(E|H)**: Less likely given his personality, especially the nature-focused and animal-loving traits.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: As a common field unrelated to his interests, this might be lower than other fields.

### Estimated Values:
Let's assign estimated values for these probabilities:
- **Computer Science:**
  - \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.2 \)
  - \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.5 \)
  - \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.1 \)

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
  - \( P(H_{Ag}) = 0.1 \)
  - \( P(E|H_{Ag}) = 0.9 \)
  - \( P(E|\neg H_{Ag}) = 0.1 \)

- **Business Administration:**
  - \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.3 \)
  - \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.2 \)
  - \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.1 \)

### Calculations using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \(P(E)\) can be represented using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|H_{Ag}) \cdot P(H_{Ag}) + P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) \]

Let's first compute \(P(E)\):

\[ 
P(E) = (0.5 \times 0.2) + (0.9 \times 0.1) + (0.2 \times 0.3) 
      = 0.1 + 0.09 + 0.06
      = 0.25 
\]

Now calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

- **Computer Science:**
\[ 
P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} 
            = \frac{0.5 \times 0.2}{0.25} 
            = \frac{0.1}{0.25} 
            = 0.4 
\]

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ 
P(H_{Ag}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{Ag}) \cdot P(H_{Ag})}{P(E)} 
            = \frac{0.9 \times 0.1}{0.25} 
            = \frac{0.09}{0.25} 
            = 0.36 
\]

- **Business Administration:**
\[ 
P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} 
            = \frac{0.2 \times 0.3}{0.25} 
            = \frac{0.06}{0.25} 
            = 0.24 
\]

### Result:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.36,
  "business administration": 0.24
}
```

These values represent the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) given Adam's personality sketch for each of the fields.
