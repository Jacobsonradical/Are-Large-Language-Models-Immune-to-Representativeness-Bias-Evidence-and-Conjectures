To estimate the probabilities using Bayes' rule, we need to start with some initial estimates for each component:

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the evidence (E) given that Adam is in the field (H).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the evidence (E) given that Adam is NOT in the field (H).

For the purpose of this exercise, the prior probabilities can be assumed to be equal across fields if we have no other information. Let's set \( P(H) \) to be 1/3 for each field since there are three fields considered.

Next, we evaluate \( P(E|H) \) for each field based on how well the personality sketch of Adam matches the typical attributes of students in that field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - Students in this field are often interested in nature, plants, and animals.
    - Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy align well with this field.
    - Let's assume \( P(E|H) \) for this field is relatively high, say 0.8.

2. **Business Administration**:
    - This field often involves skills like leadership, economics, finance, and management.
    - The personality traits described do not strongly align with the typical interests and attributes of this field.
    - Let's assume \( P(E|H) \) for this field is relatively low, say 0.1.

3. **Computer Science**:
    - This field often involves problem-solving and understanding abstract concepts.
    - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is of high intelligence, which aligns with some traits of computer science students.
    - Let's assume \( P(E|H) \) for this field is moderate, say 0.5.

For \( P(E|\neg H) \), we need to estimate the likelihood of the evidence given that Adam is not in each field. This is difficult without additional context, but we can approximate:

- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( P(E|\neg H) \) is influenced by Adam's traits which might still fit some other fields but less strongly. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) to be 0.4.
- Business Administration: Given the mismatch, \( P(E|\neg H) \) might be higher because Adam's traits fit many fields better than business administration. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) to be 0.8.
- Computer Science: Given some alignment, but also competing fields, let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) to be 0.5.

We now apply Bayes' rule to calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant ensuring all probabilities sum to 1, but we can skip the normalization if we only need relative probabilities.

Let's compute each:

1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 0.267 \]

2. Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 0.033 \]

3. Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.5 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 0.167 \]

So, the relative probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.267",
  "business administration": "0.033",
  "computer science": "0.167"
}

These values are relative and should be normalized if exact probabilities are needed.
