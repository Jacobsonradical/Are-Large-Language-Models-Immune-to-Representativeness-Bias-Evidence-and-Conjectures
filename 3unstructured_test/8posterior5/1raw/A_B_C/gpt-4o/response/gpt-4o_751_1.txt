To estimate the probabilities using Bayes' rule, we need the following:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is in each field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is not in each field.
4. **P(E)**: The overall probability of observing the personality sketch E.

Although we might not have exact numeric values, we can make reasonable estimates based on general knowledge and then normalize the results.

Let's start with some assumptions:

- Assume P(H) for each field is roughly equal since without specific data, we can assume an equal distribution initially.
- Estimate P(E|H) based on how well Adam's characteristics match typical students in each field.
- P(E|\neg H) is more complicated, but we will assume the general population of graduate students for simplicity.

1. **P(H)** – Prior Probability:
   - Since we consider three different fields and assume an equal chance initially:
   ```json
   {
     "business administration": 1/3,
     "computer science": 1/3,
     "agricultural and veterinary science": 1/3
   }
   ```

2. **P(E|H)** – Likelihood of observing E given H:
   - Business administration students may not have a strong connection to nature, puzzles, empathy, or animals but could be hard-working and intelligent.
   - Computer science students could enjoy puzzles and be intelligent; however, nature and animals might not be as prominent in this field.
   - Agricultural and veterinary science students would likely have a genuine curiosity about nature and a deep love for animals, fitting Adam's sketch closely.

   ```json
   {
     "business administration": 0.1,
     "computer science": 0.2,
     "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
   }
   ```

3. **P(E|\neg H)** – Likelihood of observing E given not H:
   This might be the average probability of the characteristics across all graduate students outside each field.
   ```json
   {
     "business administration": 0.2,
     "computer science": 0.3,
     "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4
   }
   ```
   
Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
While \( P(E) \) is the normalization factor, we can compare relative values:

4. Compute unnormalized P(H|E) for each field:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1 * (1/3) = 0.0333,
  "computer science": 0.2 * (1/3) = 0.0667,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7 * (1/3) = 0.2333
}
```

5. Normalize these to get probabilities that sum to 1:
Total = \( 0.0333 + 0.0667 + 0.2333 = 0.3333 \)
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0333 / 0.3333 = 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.0667 / 0.3333 = 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.2333 / 0.3333 = 0.7
}
```

Final probabilities:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```
