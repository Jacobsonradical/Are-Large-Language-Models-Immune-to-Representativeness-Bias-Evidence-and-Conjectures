Sure, let's start by defining the prior probabilities \(P(H)\), the likelihoods \(P(E|H)\), and the evidence \(P(E)\). 

For each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
    - \(P(H)\): This is the prior probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in this field. Given the subjectâ€™s interests, let's assume a slightly higher baseline probability for this field, say 0.2.
    - \(P(E|H)\): Given that Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and animals, it seems highly likely (say 0.85) that he would be in this field if he displays those traits.
    - \(P(E|\neg H)\): This is the probability of Adam displaying these traits if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. This includes all other fields and may be lower, say 0.1.

2. **Business Administration**
    - \(P(H)\): Let's assume a baseline probability for graduate students in business administration, say 0.15.
    - \(P(E|H)\): Given Adam's traits (love for nature, animals, quiet, puzzles), it's less likely (say 0.05) that he would be in business administration if he displays those traits.
    - \(P(E|\neg H)\): This might be the same as for other fields where the traits don't match well, so let's assume 0.3.

3. **Computer Science**
    - \(P(H)\): Let's assume a baseline probability for graduate students in computer science, say 0.3.
    - \(P(E|H)\): Adam enjoys solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, which are traits suitable for computer science. However, his empathy and love for animals are not directly relevant. Let's say it's moderately likely, around 0.4.
    - \(P(E|\neg H)\): This might be similar or moderately lower than the prior for computer science, say 0.2.

Now, using Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

We approximate \(P(E)\) using the law of total probability:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)
\]

Let's calculate \( P(E) \):

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[
P(E) = (0.85 \times 0.2) + (0.1 \times 0.8) = 0.17 + 0.08 = 0.25
\]

For **Business Administration**:
\[
P(E) = (0.05 \times 0.15) + (0.3 \times 0.85) = 0.0075 + 0.255 = 0.2625
\]

For **Computer Science**:
\[
P(E) = (0.4 \times 0.3) + (0.2 \times 0.7) = 0.12 + 0.14 = 0.26
\]

Finally, applying Bayes' rule:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.85 \times 0.2}{0.25} = \frac{0.17}{0.25} = 0.68
\]

2. **Business Administration**:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.15}{0.2625} = \frac{0.0075}{0.2625} \approx 0.0286
\]

3. **Computer Science**:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.3}{0.26} = \frac{0.12}{0.26} = 0.4615
\]

So, the posterior probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.68,
  "business administration": 0.0286,
  "computer science": 0.4615
}
