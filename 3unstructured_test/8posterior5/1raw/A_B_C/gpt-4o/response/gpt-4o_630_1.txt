To calculate \( P(H|E) \) through Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following components for each field hypothesis \( H \):

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam would be enrolled in that field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is not enrolled in that field.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we do not have exact numerical values and must make some qualitative assessments, I'll provide reasonable estimates based on Adam's personality sketch.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): Moderate, as this field aligns well with Adam's deep love for animals and curiosity about nature.
- \( P(E|H) \): High, given the field's relevance to his traits like empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Moderate, as the personality traits could also fit into other fields but are more aligned with this one.
- Using these qualitative assessments, \( P(H|E) \) will be relatively high.

### Computer Science
- \( P(H) \): Moderate to low, as this field is quite broad and encompasses a range of personality types.
- \( P(E|H) \): Moderate, since intelligence and puzzle-solving skills are traits valued in computer science, though the empathy and love for animals are less directly relevant.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Moderate, given these traits can fit other fields but are not specifically indicative of computer science.
- So, \( P(H|E) \) will be modest but reasonable given his intelligence and puzzle-solving abilities.

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): Low, as Adam's traits do not strongly align with typical personality aspects valued in this field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Low, because empathy and love for animals are not primary traits needed for business administration.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Higher, given that his traits are less commonly associated with business administration fields.
- Consequently, \( P(H|E) \) will be quite low.

Now, provide qualitative relative values for \( P(H|E) \):

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These values reflect the likelihoods based on Adam's personality traits and how well they fit with each field of study.
