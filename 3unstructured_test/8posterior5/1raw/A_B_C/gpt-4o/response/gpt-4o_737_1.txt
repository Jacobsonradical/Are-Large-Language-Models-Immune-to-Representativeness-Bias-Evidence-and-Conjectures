To solve this problem using Bayesian inference, we need to judge the probabilities P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|¬H) for each hypothesis H.

Let's break it down for each field.

1. **Computer Science**
   - P(H): Let's consider the proportion of students enrolled in Computer Science. We'll assume it's moderately high given the popularity of the field. Let's assign a rough estimate of this probability as 0.25.
   - P(E|H): The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch matches a typical Computer Science student. While computer science students are often intelligent and good at solving puzzles (a match for Adam), the love for nature, plants, and animals isn't a strong fit. Let's set this moderately low at 0.2.
   - P(E|¬H): The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch is true if he's not in Computer Science. Given the broad range of fields Adam could be studying, and his interests aligning well with several other fields, let's set this to 0.8.

   Using Bayes' Rule: P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|¬H) * P(¬H)]
   P(H|E) = (0.2 * 0.25) / (0.2 * 0.25 + 0.8 * 0.75)
           = 0.05 / (0.05 + 0.6)
           = 0.05 / 0.65
           = 0.077

2. **Business Administration**
   - P(H): Business Administration might be less popular among students who deeply love nature and animals. Let's give it a lower estimate, say 0.15.
   - P(E|H): A Business Administration student might occasionally have Adam's personality traits, but it's less likely than some other fields. Let’s assign a low estimate of 0.1.
   - P(E|¬H): Given the many other fields, we'll keep this at 0.8 for consistency.

   Using Bayes' Rule:
   P(H|E) = (0.1 * 0.15) / (0.1 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85)
           = 0.015 / (0.015 + 0.68)
           = 0.015 / 0.695
           = 0.0216

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - P(H): Though often less chosen than some other fields, it is highly relevant to Adam’s interests. Let's assign 0.15 for simplicity.
   - P(E|H): The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch matches an Agricultural and Veterinary Science student is very high. Let's set this as high as 0.9.
   - P(E|¬H): The likelihood of Adam having this personality sketch in other fields, keeping it at 0.8.

   Using Bayes' Rule:
   P(H|E) = (0.9 * 0.15) / (0.9 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85)
           = 0.135 / (0.135 + 0.68)
           = 0.135 / 0.815
           = 0.165

Here are the resultant probabilities derived from Bayesian inference:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.077,
  "business administration": 0.0216,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.165 
}
