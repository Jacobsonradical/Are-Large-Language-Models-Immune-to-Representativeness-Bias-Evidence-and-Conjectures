To estimate \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to reason about the relevant probabilities involved. Here is a structured approach to compute the values.

### Step-by-Step Process for Each Field:
1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: This is the initial estimate of how likely Adam is to be enrolled in each field before considering his personality sketch.
2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: This is how likely the personality sketch \( E \) is, given that Adam is enrolled in the field \( H \).
3. **Marginal Probability, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is how likely the personality sketch \( E \) is among students who are not in the field \( H \).
4. **Posterior Probability, \( P(H|E) \)**: This is what we want to compute, the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in the field \( H \) given the personality sketch \( E \):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

### Let's Assume Reasonable Values for Calculation

#### Business Administration
1. **Prior, \( P(H) \)**: Graduate students in business administration are relatively common— let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: A curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, empathy, and love for animals are not common traits among business administration students— let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
3. **Marginal, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Students who aren't in business administration might still have such personality traits, given the wide variety of fields— let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.5} = 0.04
\]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **Prior, \( P(H) \)**: Fewer graduate students are in agricultural and veterinary science; let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).
2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: Strong interest in nature, empathy, and love for animals fit very well with this field— let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
3. **Marginal, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: These traits are less common in other fields but still present. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.3} = 0.1333
\]

#### Computer Science
1. **Prior, \( P(H) \)**: Graduate students in computer science are quite common— let's assume \( P(H) = 0.25 \).
2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: Interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence fit well, but empathy and love for animals are less central— let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \).
3. **Marginal, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Similar to others, these traits are somewhat less common but still present in non-computer science fields— let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.25}{0.5} = 0.2
\]

### Summary

\[
{
  "business administration": 0.04,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.1333,
  "computer science": 0.2
}
\]

These estimates are based on reasonable assumptions about the priors, likelihoods, and marginals. Adjustments can be made with more precise data.
