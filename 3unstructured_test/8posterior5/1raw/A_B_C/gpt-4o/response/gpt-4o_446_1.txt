Sure, let's proceed step by step using Bayes' theorem. To compute \( P(H|E) \), we use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of my approach:

1. **Prior Probability** (\( P(H) \)): The initial guess of Adam being enrolled in a particular field, based on general probabilities without specific data about Adam.
 
2. **Likelihood** (\( P(E|H) \)): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he were actually enrolled in the specific field.

3. **Marginal Likelihood** (\( P(E) \)): The overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch, regardless of the field.

4. **Inverse Likelihood** \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he were **not** enrolled in the specific field.

### Assumptions

- **General priors for each field**:
  - Business Administration: \( P(H)_{BA} = 0.3 \)
  - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( P(H)_{AVS} = 0.1 \)
  - Computer Science: \( P(H)_{CS} = 0.2 \)

(Note: These are just sample values as prior values would generally be based on actual data, such as the popularity of each field among graduates.)

- **Likelihood based on personality sketch**:
  - Business Administration:
    - \( P(E|H)_{BA} = 0.1 \)  (Less likely, as empathy and love for nature seem less central)
  - Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
    - \( P(E|H)_{AVS} = 0.7 \)  (More likely, as empathy, love for animals, and nature fit well)
  - Computer Science:
    - \( P(E|H)_{CS} = 0.5 \)  (Neutral, as high intelligence and abstract concepts fit, but less so the love for animals and nature)

- **Marginal Probability** \( P(E) \): Calculated as the sum of the intersection probabilities with the priors:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H)_{BA} \times P(H)_{BA} + P(E|H)_{AVS} \times P(H)_{AVS} + P(E|H)_{CS} \times P(H)_{CS} + P(E|\neg H)_{Other} \times P(H)_{Other} \]

Given \( P(E|\neg H)_{Other} \) can be treated as an average across other fields.

### Calculation

- Marginal Probability \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.3) + (0.7 \times 0.1) + (0.5 \times 0.2) = 0.03 + 0.07 + 0.1 = 0.2 \]

### Applying Bayes' Theorem

1. **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{P(E|H)_{BA} \times P(H)_{BA}}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.3}{0.2} = 0.15 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E)_{AVS} = \frac{P(E|H)_{AVS} \times P(H)_{AVS}}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \times 0.1}{0.2} = 0.35 \]

3. **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{P(E|H)_{CS} \times P(H)_{CS}}{P(E)} = \frac{0.5 \times 0.2}{0.2} = 0.5 \]

### Result

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.15,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.35,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```

These are calculated based on our given assumptions and initial priors, which may be adjusted with more specific data.
