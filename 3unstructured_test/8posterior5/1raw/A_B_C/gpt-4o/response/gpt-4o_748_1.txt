To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' Rule, which allows us to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) given the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \).

To make the calculations simpler, let's follow this procedure:

1. Assign rough estimates for prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field.
2. Estimate the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of having the personality sketch E given each field.
3. Estimate the likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \), i.e., the probability of having the personality sketch E given it's not that field.
4. Apply Bayes' Rule: \[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant and does not impact the relative comparison between fields, we'll ignore it for this comparison and focus on computing the numerator \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

### Estimations:

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- **P(H)**: Moderate prior probability. Let's assume \( 0.2 \) (since it's a specialized field).
- **P(E|H)**: High, since E matches well with the field (interest in nature, plants, and animals). Assume \( 0.8 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Moderate, since these traits could be somewhat common in other fields too. Assume \( 0.4 \).

#### Business Administration:
- **P(H)**: Moderate prior probability, more common field. Let's assume \( 0.3 \).
- **P(E|H)**: Low, since E matches less well with business administration. Assume \( 0.1 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Higher than for Agri & Vet science but less than Computer Science. Assume \( 0.5 \).

#### Computer Science:
- **P(H)**: High prior probability, very common field. Let's assume \( 0.4 \).
- **P(E|H)**: Moderate, given the high intelligence and abstract reasoning, but less alignment with his other personality traits. Assume \( 0.3 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Assume a value around \( 0.6 \).

### Applying Bayesâ€™ Rule:

To simplify, \( P(E) \) drops out as a normalizing constant across comparisons:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.2 = 0.16 \]

2. **Business Administration**:
   \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.3 = 0.03 \]

3. **Computer Science**:
   \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.3 \cdot 0.4 = 0.12 \]

After the computations, we normalize the results to a comparable scale:

\[
\text{Sum for normalization} = 0.16 + 0.03 + 0.12 = 0.31
\]

\[
P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science} | E) = \frac{0.16}{0.31} \approx 0.516
\]
\[
P(\text{Business Administration} | E) = \frac{0.03}{0.31} \approx 0.097
\]
\[
P(\text{Computer Science} | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.31} \approx 0.387
\]

The final posterior probabilities (in percentages) are, without normalization to sum to 1 due to the format request:
