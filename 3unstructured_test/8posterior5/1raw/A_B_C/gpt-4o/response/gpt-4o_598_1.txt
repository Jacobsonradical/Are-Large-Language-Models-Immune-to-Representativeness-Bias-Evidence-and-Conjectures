To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \), we will use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we are only looking at the relative likelihoods and not the absolute values, we can ignore the denominator \( P(E) \) because it will be constant for all hypotheses. Therefore, we will compute the relative likelihoods:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given the information about Adam's personality traits, strengths, and interests, we will make reasonable estimates for the probabilities for each field:

**Computer Science:**
- \( P(H) \): Assuming a relatively high base rate as computer science is a popular field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Moderate. Adam's intelligence and problem-solving skills fit, but his strong empathy and love for nature are less consistent.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Relatively high, as other fields may fit his traits better than computer science.

**Business Administration:**
- \( P(H) \): Average base rate as it is a common field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Low. Adam's interests and personality traits don't strongly align with typical business administration skills.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): High, since other fields might fit his personality better.

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- \( P(H) \): Lower base rate compared to computer science and business, but still notable.
- \( P(E|H) \): High. Aligns well with his love for nature, empathy, and love for animals.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Lower, as other fields might not fit his personal interests as well.

Given these qualitative assessments, let's assign some hypothetical numerical values to illustrate:

**Computer Science:**
- \( P(H) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \)

**Business Administration:**
- \( P(H) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.9 \)

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- \( P(H) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \)

Using Bayes' Rule proportionately:

- **Computer Science:**
  \[ P(H|E) \propto 0.4 \times 0.3 = 0.12 \]

- **Business Administration:**
  \[ P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02 \]

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
  \[ P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \]

To convert these to probabilities, we normalize them:

- Total \( P(H|E) \) = 0.12 + 0.02 + 0.08 = 0.22

- **Normalized Computer Science:**
  \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.22} = 0.545 \]

- **Normalized Business Administration:**
  \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.22} = 0.091 \]

- **Normalized Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
  \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.22} = 0.364 \]

So, our normalized proportions would be:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.545,
  "business administration": 0.091,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.364
}
