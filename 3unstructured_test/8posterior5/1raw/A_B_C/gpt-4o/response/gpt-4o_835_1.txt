Let's evaluate each field based on the given personality sketch and use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probabilities.

### Step-by-Step Calculation

1. **Define Probabilities:**

   - \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specified field.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood that Adam's personality sketch fits a student enrolled in the specified field.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability that Adam's personality sketch fits a student not enrolled in the specified field.
   - \( P(H|E) \): Posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in the specified field given his personality sketch.

2. **Assumptions:**
   - For \( P(H) \), we'll assume a uniform prior distribution across all fields.

3. **Estimates for Likelihoods:**

   - \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \): Low, since the personality traits don't strongly align with typical business administration interests.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): High, since his love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly align with this field.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \): Medium, since his intelligence and abstract thinking align with computer science, but his nature-oriented traits do not.

### Estimates:
   
- \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \approx 0.33 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \approx 0.33 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) \approx 0.33 \)

### Conditional Probabilities:

- \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \approx 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \approx 0.7 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \approx 0.4 \)

### Likelihood of Non-H:

- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business administration}}) \approx 0.5 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \approx 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{computer science}}) \approx 0.4 \)

### Bayes' Rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Since \( P(E) \) remains constant for comparison purposes, let's focus on the numerators for each field and then normalize them.

\[
P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.1 \times 0.33 = 0.033
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.7 \times 0.33 = 0.231
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.4 \times 0.33 = 0.132
\]

Normalize by the sum:

\[
\text{Sum} = 0.033 + 0.231 + 0.132 = 0.396
\]

\[
P(H|E_{\text{business administration}}) = \frac{0.033}{0.396} \approx 0.0833
\]

\[
P(H|E_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = \frac{0.231}{0.396} \approx 0.5833
\]

\[
P(H|E_{\text{computer science}}) = \frac{0.132}{0.396} \approx 0.3334
\]

### Final Answer:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0833,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5833,
  "computer science": 0.3334
}
```
These values represent the normalized posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) given Adam's personality sketch.
