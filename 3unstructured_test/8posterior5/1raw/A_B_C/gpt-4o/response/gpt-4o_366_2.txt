To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Rule, we need to estimate:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each specific field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam’s personality sketch given that he was enrolled in the specific field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam’s personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in the specific field.

Bayes' Rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the limited information, we will need to make educated guesses about these probabilities. We can assume that \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant, but for the purpose of comparison we will consider it constant across different fields.

Here are the steps with the assumed values:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H_{\text{business}}) \): Moderately common graduate field, let's say \( 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \): Less likely to fit his profile of caring for nature, animals, and puzzles. Let's say \( 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}}) \): More likely given his profile. Let's say \( 0.7 \).

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H_{\text{agriculture}}) \): Less common field, let's say \( 0.1 \).
   -  \( P(E|H_{\text{agriculture}}) \): Highly likely to align with his interest in nature and animals. Let's say \( 0.8 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agriculture}}) \): Less likely. Let's say \( 0.3 \).

3. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H_{\text{computer}}) \): Very common graduate field, let's say \( 0.3 \).
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{computer}}) \): Likely given his puzzle-solving and intelligence in abstract concepts. Let's say \( 0.6 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{computer}}) \): Fairly likely but less so than for computer scientists. Let's say \( 0.5 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:

For **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{k} \]

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H_{\text{agriculture}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agriculture}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agriculture}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agriculture}}|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{k} \]

For **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H_{\text{computer}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{computer}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{computer}}|E) \approx \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.3}{k} \]

We can normalize these to sum them up and get relative probabilities. Let’s compute as follows:
\[ P(H_{\text{business}} | E) = \frac{0.02}{k} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agriculture}} | E) = \frac{0.08}{k} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{computer}} | E) = \frac{0.18}{k} \]

Let:
\[ k = 0.02 + 0.08 + 0.18 = 0.28 \]

Normalizing each:

\[ P(H_{\text{business}} | E) = \frac{0.02}{0.28} \approx 0.0714 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agriculture}} | E) = \frac{0.08}{0.28} \approx 0.2857 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{computer}} | E) = \frac{0.18}{0.28} \approx 0.6429 \]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0714,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.2857,
  "computer science": 0.6429
}
