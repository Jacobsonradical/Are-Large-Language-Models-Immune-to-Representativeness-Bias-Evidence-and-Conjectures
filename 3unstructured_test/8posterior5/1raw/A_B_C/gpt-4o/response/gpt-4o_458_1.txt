To assess the probability of Adam being enrolled in each of the given fields based on his personality sketch, we'll use Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.

Assumptions:
- \( P(H) \) is primarily based on general enrollment distributions.
- \( P(E|H) \) considers how well the personality sketch fits the prototypical attributes of someone in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) considers the average probability of the personality sketch among all other graduate fields.

Let's fill in the specifics for each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- \( P(H_{agri}) \): Given that it’s a specialized field, let's assume it's moderate, say 0.15.
- \( P(E|H_{agri}) \): Adam's interests in nature, plants, animals, and empathy align well, so it's high, say 0.8.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{agri}) \): Given that only some graduate fields fit Adam's traits, let's estimate it at 0.3.
  
### Business Administration

- \( P(H_{biz}) \): This field has a substantial number of graduates, let's assume 0.25.
- \( P(E|H_{biz}) \): Adam’s traits do not align strongly with typical business traits, so it is low, say 0.1.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{biz}) \): Considering other non-business fields may match Adam’s traits, let's keep 0.4.

### Computer Science

- \( P(H_{cs}) \): This is a popular field, so let’s assume 0.25.
- \( P(E|H_{cs}) \): Interests in puzzles and intelligence fit; however, other traits less so, say 0.4.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{cs}) \): Considering non-CS fields' similarity, let’s use 0.4.

Using Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H_{field}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{field}) \cdot P(H_{field})}{P(E)} \]

The denominator \( P(E) \) is a constant across fields, so we can compute it proportionally:

\[
\begin{aligned}
P(H_{agri}|E) & \propto P(E|H_{agri}) \cdot P(H_{agri}) = 0.8 \times 0.15 = 0.12, \\
P(H_{biz}|E) & \propto P(E|H_{biz}) \cdot P(H_{biz}) = 0.1 \times 0.25 = 0.025, \\
P(H_{cs}|E) & \propto P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs}) = 0.4 \times 0.25 = 0.1.
\end{aligned}
\]

These values can be normalized but for this calculation, we'll keep the proportional approach.

\[
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.12,
  "business administration": 0.025,
  "computer science": 0.10
}
\]

Therefore, the updated probabilities reflect Adam's alignment with each field given his personality sketch. The actual numerical values are meant to be illustrative of the process rather than precise.
