To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). Bayes' rule is given by:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Since we are comparing multiple hypotheses, we can ignore \( P(E) \) because it will cancel out in the normalization process. We will estimate \( P(E|H) \) based on the likelihood of the personality sketch matching the field, and we will use educated guesses for \( P(H) \).

### Computer Science:
- \( P(H) \): Somewhat common graduate field, let's say \( P(H) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|H) \): Adam's intelligence and love for solving puzzles fit well, but less so his love for nature. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): This would be the average probability of observing \( E \) in any other field, not just the ones we're considering. As a rough average, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \)

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- \( P(H) \): Less common but fits Adam’s love for nature and animals; let's say \( P(H) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|H) \): Strong match with Adam's personality; let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Still assuming an average of \( 0.2 \) for fields outside this one.

### Business Administration:
- \( P(H) \): Common field, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|H) \): Doesn’t fit Adam's love for nature and animals as closely, though intelligence and understanding abstract concepts could fit. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Again, using \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \)

Now we compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

\[
P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science})}{P(E)}
= \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)}
\]

\[
P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{Agricultural}) \cdot P(\text{Agricultural})}{P(E)}
= \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)}
\]

\[
P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{Business}) \cdot P(\text{Business})}{P(E)}
= \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)}
\]

Normalizing these probabilities (i.e., dividing each by the sum of all three results):

\[
P(E) = 0.4 \cdot 0.3 + 0.8 \cdot 0.2 + 0.2 \cdot 0.2 = 0.12 + 0.16 + 0.04 = 0.32
\]

Finally:

\[
P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.32} \approx 0.375
\]

\[
P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) = \frac{0.16}{0.32} = 0.5
\]

\[
P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.32} \approx 0.125
\]

So the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.375,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.125
}
```
