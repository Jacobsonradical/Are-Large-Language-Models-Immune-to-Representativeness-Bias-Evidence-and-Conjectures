Let's start by denoting \( E \) as the personality sketch of Adam. To calculate the probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Rule, we need to estimate the priors \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the complement likelihoods \( P(E|\neg H) \). However, without detailed statistical data, we can only make reasonable assumptions based on Adam's characteristics and common characteristics of students in various fields.

### Assumptions:

1. **Probability of Enrollment (P(H)):**
    - \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.1 \): Agriculture and veterinary programs have fewer students on average.
    - \( P(\text{business administration}) \approx 0.2 \): Business programs are quite common.
    - \( P(\text{computer science}) \approx 0.2 \): Computer science is also a popular field.

2. **Likelihood of Fitting the Personality Sketch (P(E|H)):**
    - \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.8 \): This field closely aligns with Adam's curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals.
    - \( P(E|\text{business administration}) \approx 0.1 \): Adam's characteristics don't strongly align with typical business administration students.
    - \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \approx 0.4 \): His intelligence and puzzle-solving skills fit well here, but not all of his traits align perfectly.

3. **Likelihood of Fitting the Personality Sketch if Not in the Given Field (P(E|\neg H)):**
    - This value might be around 0.2 if we average across all other potential fields.

### Applying Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) \) (the total probability of the evidence) can be calculated as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) + P(E|H_3) \cdot P(H_3) + ... \]

But since we have limited our calculations to three fields, we estimate \( P(E) \) for simplicity:

\[ P(E) \approx P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) + \]
\[ P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) + \]
\[ P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) \]

\[ P(E) \approx (0.8 \times 0.1) + (0.1 \times 0.2) + (0.4 \times 0.2) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.08 + 0.02 + 0.08 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.18 \]

Now, we compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.18} \approx 0.444 \]

2. **Business Administration:**
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.18} \approx 0.111 \]

3. **Computer Science:**
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.2}{0.18} \approx 0.444 \]

### Summary:
\[ \{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.444,
  "business administration": 0.111,
  "computer science": 0.444
\} \]

These values suggest that based on Adam's personality sketch, he is equally likely to be enrolled in either agricultural and veterinary science or computer science, and less likely to be in business administration.
