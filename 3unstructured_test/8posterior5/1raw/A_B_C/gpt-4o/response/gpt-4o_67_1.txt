To begin judging \( P(H) \) for each field, we generally assume equal prior probabilities for each hypothesis unless specific information suggests otherwise. Since no such information is provided, we will assume equal priors for simplicity. Given that there are numerous possible fields, we'll assign a relatively low prior probability.

For the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), we assess how likely Adam’s personality matches with typical students in each field. 

For the likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \), we consider how likely Adam's personality sketch is among graduate students not in that specific field.

We'll then use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \).

Bayes' Rule: 
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

However, since we are only comparing relative likelihoods, we can omit the normalizing factor \( P(E) \), focusing on the product of \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(H) \).

Let’s estimate the values:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

   - \( P(H) \): Assuming equal priors and numerous fields, we might set this at \( 0.05 \) considering the vast array of possible graduate study fields.
   
   - \( P(E|H) \): High because Adam's interest in nature and animals fits well with agricultural and veterinary science. Let’s set this at \( 0.7 \).
   
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): We need an estimate for the likelihood of Adam’s personality traits existing in other fields. Given his specific traits, we’ll set this lower, perhaps \( 0.2 \).

   Using Bayes' rule approximate:
   \[
   P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.7 \times 0.05 = 0.035
   \]

2. **Computer Science**

   - \( P(H) \): Equal priors, \( 0.05 \).
   
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam’s puzzle-solving skills and high intelligence fit, but his love for nature and animals does not directly correlate. Let's set this at \( 0.3 \).
   
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Considering computer science lacks the direct nature and animal affinity, we estimate this higher among non-computer science peers, maybe \( 0.5 \).

   Using Bayes' rule approximate:
   \[
   P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.3 \times 0.05 = 0.015
   \]

3. **Business Administration**

   - \( P(H) \): Equal priors, \( 0.05 \).
   
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam’s traits overlap less well with evaluating and leading businesses, and appreciation for nature is less relevant. Set \( 0.2 \).
   
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given the variety of other fields and their possible alignment, this could be \( 0.6 \).

   Using Bayes' rule approximate:
   \[
   P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \times 0.05 = 0.01
   \]

The normalization factor is omitted because we are comparing relative values, not computing absolute probabilities.

Resulting posterior estimates:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.035,
  "computer science": 0.015,
  "business administration": 0.01
}
```
These values suggest that Adam is most likely enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science based on his personality sketch.
