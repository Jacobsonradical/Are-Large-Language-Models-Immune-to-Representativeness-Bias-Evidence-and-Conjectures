Sure, let's break this down for each field using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field of study \( H \), \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in \( H \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch given Adam was not enrolled in \( H \). 

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant, we'll focus on calculating \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for each field. For simplicity, let's assume:

* \( P(H) \) for each field is equally likely before considering the personality sketch, so each has a prior of \( \frac{1}{3} \).
* \( P(E) \) can be considered as a constant normalization factor, so we'll just compare \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) across the fields. 

Let's assign heuristic values to \( P(E|H) \) based on how well Adam's personality sketch aligns with typical characteristics required or commonly found in each field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
*Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and a deep love for animals, which align well with this field.*
- \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{1}{3} \)

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.9 \cdot \frac{1}{3} \]

### Computer Science
*Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is of high intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts, which fit this field too.*
- \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{1}{3} \)

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.7 \cdot \frac{1}{3} \]

### Business Administration
*Adam's characteristics don't particularly align well with the nature-centered personality aspect needed in this field.*
- \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.7 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{1}{3} \)

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.2 \cdot \frac{1}{3} \]

### Normalizing

To calculate the actual posterior probabilities, we need to normalize these values:

\[
\text{Normalization factor} = 0.9 \cdot \frac{1}{3} + 0.7 \cdot \frac{1}{3} + 0.2 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 0.6 
\]

\[
P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.6} = \frac{0.3}{0.6} = 0.5
\]

\[
P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.6} = \frac{0.233}{0.6} \approx 0.388
\]

\[
P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.6} = \frac{0.067}{0.6} \approx 0.112
\]

So our final answer would be:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5,
  "computer science": 0.388,
  "business administration": 0.112
}
```
