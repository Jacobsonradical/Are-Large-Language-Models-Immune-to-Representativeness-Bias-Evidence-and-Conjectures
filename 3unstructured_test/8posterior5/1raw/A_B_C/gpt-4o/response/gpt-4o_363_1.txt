Sure, let's start by estimating the probabilities required to apply Bayes' theorem. Specifically, we'll estimate \(P(H)\), \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E|\neg H)\) for each given field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \) (The probability that Adam was enrolled in this field)**
   - A reasonable estimate might be the proportion of graduate students enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This is a niche field, so let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \) (The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch if he was enrolled in this field)**
   - Given Adam's love for nature, animals, and empathy, there's a high chance he could be in this field. We can estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \) (The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch if he was not enrolled in this field)**
   - While Adam’s traits are quite specific to this field, it's necessary to consider other fields unrelated to nature and animals. Let’s estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

### Computer Science
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**
   - Computer science is a popular field, so let's assume \( P(H) = 0.3 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**
   - The traits of intelligence and abstract reasoning fit, but other traits do not. Estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**
   - Many fields require intelligence and problem-solving, even if not computer science. Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

### Business Administration
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**
   - Business administration is common, so let’s assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**
   - Adam’s love for nature and animals does not fit well with business administration. Estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**
   - There are many other fields unrelated to business administration. Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

Let's apply Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior probabilities:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

For normalization, \( P(E) \) can be estimated as:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{Agri}}) \times P(H_{\text{Agri}}) + P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \times P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \times P(H_{\text{BA}})
\]

Where the terms represent the fields Agricultural and Veterinary Science, Computer Science, and Business Administration respectively.

Let's calculate:

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[
P(E)_{\text{Agri}} = 0.8 \times 0.05 + 0.3 \times 0.3 + 0.1 \times 0.2 
                     = 0.04 + 0.09 + 0.02 
                     = 0.15 
\]

So for Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[
P(H|E)_{\text{Agri}} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.15} = \frac{0.04}{0.15} \approx 0.267
\]

For Computer Science:
\[
P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} = \frac{0.3 \times 0.3}{0.15} = \frac{0.09}{0.15} \approx 0.6
\]

For Business Administration:
\[
P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.15} = \frac{0.02}{0.15} \approx 0.133
\]

So in the requested format:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.267,
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.133
}
```

These estimates suggest that based on the given personality sketch, Adam has the highest posterior probability of being enrolled in Computer Science, followed by Agricultural and Veterinary Science, and finally Business Administration.
