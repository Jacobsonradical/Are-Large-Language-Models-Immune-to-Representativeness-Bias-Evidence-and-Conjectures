Let's break down the required probabilities before calculating \( P(H|E) \).

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the evidence (personality sketch E) given that Adam is in the field H.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the evidence (E) given that Adam is not in the field H.

Given Adam's interests and personality sketch, we can make some educated estimates.

### Business Administration
**P(H)**: Given that many graduate students are in business administration, but perhaps fewer with Adam's strong empathy and love for animals, let's assume a moderately low prior.  
**P(E|H)**: The traits described in E do not strongly align with typical personality traits of business administration students but are not impossible.  
**P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of having these traits if not in business administration is moderately high.

Assumed values:
- \( P(H)_{BA} \approx 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H)_{BA} \approx 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H)_{BA} \approx 0.4 \)

### Computer Science
**P(H)**: Computer science is a popular field with many graduate students, and the problem-solving aspect fits Adam well.  
**P(E|H)**: Given Adam's intelligence and problem-solving interest, this probability is relatively high.  
**P(E|\neg H)**: Students with Adam's traits may be in other fields as well but to a lesser extent.

Assumed values:
- \( P(H)_{CS} \approx 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|H)_{CS} \approx 0.6 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H)_{CS} \approx 0.4 \)

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
**P(H)**: Given Adam’s strong empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature, this field seems very fitting.  
**P(E|H)**: These traits are highly consistent with students in this field.  
**P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood is lower if he isn't in this field because the sketch is quite specific to these interests.

Assumed values:
- \( P(H)_{AVS} \approx 0.05 \)
- \( P(E|H)_{AVS} \approx 0.9 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H)_{AVS} \approx 0.3 \)

### Calculation Using Bayes' Rule
Bayes’ Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be calculated as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Since we are comparing probabilities, we can simplify the relative comparisons without calculating \( P(E) \) directly.

Now, calculating \( P(H|E) \):

**Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} \propto P(E|H)_{BA} \cdot P(H)_{BA} = 0.2 \times 0.1 = 0.02 \]

**Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} \propto P(E|H)_{CS} \cdot P(H)_{CS} = 0.6 \times 0.3 = 0.18 \]

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E)_{AVS} \propto P(E|H)_{AVS} \cdot P(H)_{AVS} = 0.9 \times 0.05 = 0.045 \]

Finally, we normalize these probabilities to sum to 1.

\[ P(E) \approx 0.02 + 0.18 + 0.045 = 0.245 \]

Normalized Values:
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.02}{0.245} \approx 0.0816 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.18}{0.245} \approx 0.7347 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{AVS} = \frac{0.045}{0.245} \approx 0.1837 \]

So the final answers in the given format are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0816,
  "computer science": 0.7347,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.1837
}
```
