Sure, let's approach the calculation for the probabilities.

1. We start by assessing the prior probability \( P(H) \) for each field. Since we don't have specific data, we'll assume they are somewhat comparable, but some might be slightly more common. We might assume:
   - Computer science: relatively common.
   - Agricultural and veterinary science: less common.
   - Business administration: quite common.

2. Next, we evaluate \( P(E|H) \), the probability of Adam's personality features given the field:
   - Computer science: Adam's interest in puzzles and high intelligence fit well, but his strong empathy, warm heart, and love for nature and animals are somewhat less typical.
   - Agricultural and veterinary science: This field aligns strongly with Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy.
   - Business administration: The traits of intelligence and understanding are a fit, but love for nature, animals, and empathy are less relevant.

3. Finally, \( P(E|\neg H) \) would be general traits one might expect in other fields, which might vary. 

We use Bayes’ rule to compute \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]
For simplicity, as \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant and the same for all fields, we'll focus on the numerator \( P(E|H) \times P(H) \).

Let's assume specific values to express these assessments:

### Assumptions for Calculation:

- **Computer Science**:
  - \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \) (somewhat common).
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \) (moderately fits).
  
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  - \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \) (less common).
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \) (strongly fits).
  
- **Business Administration**:
  - \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \) (common).
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \) (less fits).

For \( P(E|\neg H) \), assuming a rough equal distribution among other fields with less specific information:
  - Let’s say \( 0.25 \) (average fit for other fields without specific fit).

By multiplying and normalizing (using Bayes' rule), we compute the approximate \( P(H|E) \) values:

### Calculation:

\[ P(H|E) =  \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

But without \( P(E) \), we'll simply rank them based on \( P(E|H) \times P(H) \):

- **Computer Science**:
  - \( P(E|H) \times P(H) = 0.2 \times 0.3 = 0.06 \)

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  - \( P(E|H) \times P(H) = 0.9 \times 0.1 = 0.09 \)

- **Business Administration**:
  - \( P(E|H) \times P(H) = 0.1 \times 0.3 = 0.03 \)

Ultimately, after normalization for the purpose of comparison:

### Final Probability (Normalized):

{
  "computer science": 0.06,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.09,
  "business administration": 0.03
}

These values reflect the relative likelihood of Adam being enrolled in each field, given his personality sketch.
