To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we'll use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant that ensures probabilities sum to 1. Let's consider the qualitative assessments for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each of the fields.

1. **Business administration:**
   - \( P(H) \): Business administration is a common field; assume moderate a priori probability.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's characteristics (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy) are less typical for business administration.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Higher, as Adam's traits align better with non-business fields.

2. **Agricultural and veterinary science:**
   - \( P(H) \): Likely lower than some fields but relevant given Adam's love for animals and nature.
   - \( P(E|H) \): High, because Adam fits well with this field.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Lower, as these traits are more specific to this field.

3. **Computer science:**
   - \( P(H) \): Quite common among graduate students.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Moderate, considering his intelligence and problem-solving enjoyment, though not aligned with empathy and nature.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Reasonably high, given the abstract thinking and intelligence fits multiple fields.

Let's assign some estimated values:

### Business administration
- \( P(H) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \)

### Agricultural and veterinary science
- \( P(H) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \)

### Computer science
- \( P(H) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \)

Now apply Bayes' theorem. We can combine the \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) values within Bayes' equation framework, simplifying by doing comparisons, as \( P(E) \) within each can normalize.

\[
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) P(H)
\]

For each field:

1. Business administration:
   \[
   P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02
   \]
   
2. Agricultural and veterinary science:
   \[
   P(H|E) \propto 0.7 \times 0.1 = 0.07
   \]

3. Computer science:
   \[
   P(H|E) \propto 0.4 \times 0.3 = 0.12
   \]

Normalize these:
\[
\text{Sum} = 0.02 + 0.07 + 0.12 = 0.21
\]

\[
P(H|E \text{ for business administration}) = \frac{0.02}{0.21} \approx 0.095
\]
\[
P(H|E \text{ for agricultural and veterinary science}) = \frac{0.07}{0.21} \approx 0.333
\]
\[
P(H|E \text{ for computer science}) = \frac{0.12}{0.21} \approx 0.571
\]
