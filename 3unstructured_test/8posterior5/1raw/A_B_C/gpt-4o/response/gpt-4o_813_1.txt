To solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem, we need to calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each of the given fields, where \( H \) is the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in that field and \( E \) is the given personality sketch. 

Bayes' Theorem can be expressed as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to estimate the following:
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood of observing the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likelihood of observing the evidence given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.

Let's make some reasonable assumptions for the prior probabilities based on general graduate enrollment data and typical personality profiles for each field:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H_{cs}) \): Prior probability of enrolling in computer science. Computer Science is a popular field.
     - Let's assume \( P(H_{cs}) = 0.25 \)
   - \( P(E|H_{cs}) \): Likelihood of observing the personality sketch given enrollment in computer science. Given Adam's personality (warm-hearted, love of nature, animals, and good at abstract concepts), it somewhat aligns but not strongly.
     - Let's assume \( P(E|H_{cs}) = 0.2 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{cs}) \): Likelihood of observing the personality sketch given enrollment in other fields. Since his characteristics might align more with other fields like agricultural and veterinary science, this should be relatively high.
     - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{cs}) = 0.8 \)

2. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H_{ba}) \): Prior probability of enrolling in business administration. Business Administration is also a common field.
     - Let's assume \( P(H_{ba}) = 0.2 \)
   - \( P(E|H_{ba}) \): Likelihood of the personality sketch given enrollment in business administration. Adam's personality does not align well with the typical business administration profile.
     - Let's assume \( P(E|H_{ba}) = 0.1 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{ba}) \): Likelihood of observing the personality sketch given enrollment in other fields. Considering better alignment with other fields.
     - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{ba}) = 0.9 \)

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H_{avs}) \): Prior probability of enrolling in agricultural and veterinary science. This field is less common than computer science and business administration but fits Adam's characteristics well.
     - Let's assume \( P(H_{avs}) = 0.1 \)
   - \( P(E|H_{avs}) \): Likelihood of the personality sketch given enrollment in agricultural and veterinary science. Adam's characteristics strongly align with this field.
     - Let's assume \( P(E|H_{avs}) = 0.7 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{avs}) \): Likelihood of observing the personality sketch given enrollment in other fields.
     - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{avs}) = 0.6 \)

To compute \( P(E) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{cs})P(H_{cs}) + P(E|H_{ba})P(H_{ba}) + P(E|H_{avs})P(H_{avs}) + P(E|\neg H_{cs} \cap \neg H_{ba} \cap \neg H_{avs})P(\neg H_{cs} \cap \neg H_{ba} \cap \neg H_{avs}) \]
Assume for simplicity \( P(E) \approx P(E|H_{cs})P(H_{cs}) + P(E|H_{ba})P(H_{ba}) + P(E|H_{avs})P(H_{avs}) \)

Calculations:
\[ P(E) \approx (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.7 \cdot 0.1) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.05 + 0.02 + 0.07 = 0.14 \]

Now, using Bayes' Theorem for each field:

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{(0.2 \cdot 0.25)}{0.14} = \frac{0.05}{0.14} \approx 0.357 \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{(0.1 \cdot 0.2)}{0.14} = \frac{0.02}{0.14} \approx 0.143 \]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_{avs}|E) = \frac{(0.7 \cdot 0.1)}{0.14} = \frac{0.07}{0.14} \approx 0.5 \]

Final Results:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.357,
  "business administration": 0.143,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5
}
