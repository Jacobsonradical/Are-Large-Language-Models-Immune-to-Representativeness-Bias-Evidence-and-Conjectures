Let's evaluate the probabilities step by step for each field:

**1. Computer Science:**
- **P(H), the prior probability:** Let's assume that the probability Adam is enrolled in computer science is fairly high, as computer science is a common graduate field, say P(H) = 0.2.
- **P(E|H), the probability of the evidence given this hypothesis:** Given Adam's personality sketch, characteristics like high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts do somewhat align with computer science, even though it doesn't directly match his love for nature and animals. Let's say P(E|H) = 0.2.
- **P(E|¬H), the probability of the evidence given the negation of this hypothesis:** Given how much Adam's traits align with other fields that cater to nature and animals, let's assume P(E|¬H) is lower, say 0.1.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We don't have \( P(E) \) directly, but it can be inferred from:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]
\[ P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.2) + (0.1 \cdot 0.8) = 0.04 + 0.08 = 0.12 \]

Then,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.12} = \frac{0.04}{0.12} = 0.333 \]

**2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- **P(H), the prior probability:** Given Adam's affinity for nature, plants, and animals, let's assume P(H) = 0.1.
- **P(E|H), the probability of the evidence given this hypothesis:** This field aligns well with his personality sketch, so let's set P(E|H) = 0.8.
- **P(E|¬H), the probability of the evidence given the negation of this hypothesis:** Considering this field aligns very well with the traits, let's assume P(E|¬H) is lower in this case, say 0.1.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]
\[ P(¬H) = 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.1 \cdot 0.9) = 0.08 + 0.09 = 0.17 \]

Then,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.17} = \frac{0.08}{0.17} = 0.471 \]

**3. Business Administration:**
- **P(H), the prior probability:** Let's assume this is a common field, so P(H) = 0.2.
- **P(E|H), the probability of the evidence given this hypothesis:** This field doesn't align particularly well with the traits. Let's say P(E|H) = 0.05.
- **P(E|¬H), the probability of the evidence given the negation of this hypothesis:** Assuming it could align better with non-business fields, let P(E|¬H) = 0.1.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]
\[ P(¬H) = 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = (0.05 \cdot 0.2) + (0.1 \cdot 0.8) = 0.01 + 0.08 = 0.09 \]

Then,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.2}{0.09} = \frac{0.01}{0.09} = 0.111 \]

Combining the results:

{
  "computer science": 0.333,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.471,
  "business administration": 0.111
