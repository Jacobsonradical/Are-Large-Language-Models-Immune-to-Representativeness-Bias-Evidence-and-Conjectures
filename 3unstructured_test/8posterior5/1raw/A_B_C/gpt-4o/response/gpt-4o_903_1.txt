To apply Bayes' theorem, we need to consider prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each hypothesis, the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood of the evidence given that the hypothesis is not true \( P(E|\neg H) \). Then, Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we are comparing across three fields, we can assume that the total probability \( P(E) \) will be the same for all of them, allowing us to compare relative probabilities directly.

Let's assign:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch fits each field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch does not fit each field.

For simplicity, let's use some reasonable assumptions based on Adam's personality sketch.

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: Business administration is a common graduate field, but his personality traits do not strongly align with this field. Hence, let \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \).
2. **P(E|H)**: His traits like empathy and love for animals are less common in business administration. Let \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: His traits are more likely in other fields. Let \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.7 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: This field aligns well with his curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals. Graduate students in this field may share similar interests. Let \( P(H) \approx 0.4 \).
2. **P(E|H)**: His personality traits strongly align with this field. Let \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: His traits are less likely to align with other fields as closely. Let \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \).

### Computer Science

1. **P(H)**: A common field for highly intelligent individuals but not specifically aligned with his love for animals and nature. Let \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \).
2. **P(E|H)**: His quiet nature and intelligence might fit, but other traits like empathy and love for animals are less typical. Let \( P(E|H) \approx 0.4 \).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: More likely to align with other fields. Let \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.6 \).

Using Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probabilities:

1. For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.1 / 0.7 = 0.02857 \]

2. For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.4 \cdot 0.8 / 0.4 = 0.8 \]

3. For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.3 \cdot 0.4 / 0.6 = 0.2 \]

Now normalize these values to convert them into probabilities:

\[ P(H|E)_{Business Admin} = \frac{0.02857}{0.02857 + 0.8 + 0.2} = 0.02857 / 1.02857 \approx 0.0278 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{Agri & Vet Science} = \frac{0.8}{0.02857 + 0.8 + 0.2} = 0.8 / 1.02857 \approx 0.777 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{Computer Science} = \frac{0.2}{0.02857 + 0.8 + 0.2} = 0.2 / 1.02857 \approx 0.1946 \]
