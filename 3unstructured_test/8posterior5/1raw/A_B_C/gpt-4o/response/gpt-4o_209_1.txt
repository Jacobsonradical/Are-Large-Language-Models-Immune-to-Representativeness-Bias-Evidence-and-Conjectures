Let's apply Bayes' rule to determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields based on his personality sketch (E).

Bayes' Rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We can qualitatively estimate the values of \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field, and then use these to compute \( P(H|E) \).

1. **Prior Probability (\( P(H) \))**:
   - \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field.
   - Let's assume the three fields are equally likely before considering his personality: \( P(H) \approx 1/3 \) for each field. However, to differentiate, we might consider the general popularity and enrollment sizes of each field:
     - Computer Science (CS): \(0.4\)
     - Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS): \(0.1\)
     - Business Administration (BA): \(0.2\)

2. **Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \))**:
   - This reflects how likely the personality sketch (E) is given enrollment in a specific field (H).
     - Computer Science: Higher intelligence and problem-solving suggest a decent fit, but less alignment with nature/animals.
       - \( P(E|CS) \approx 0.4 \)
     - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Strong alignment with nature, plants, and animals.
       - \( P(E|AVS) \approx 0.9 \)
     - Business Administration: Less alignment with abstract concepts and nature, but empathy could align with modern business leadership values.
       - \( P(E|BA) \approx 0.3 \)

3. **Likelihood of the complement (\( P(E|\neg H) \))**:
   - This reflects how likely the personality sketch (E) is given that Adam was not enrolled in a specific field.
     - General personality characteristics suggest moderate instead of extreme likelihood for all other fields in absence of specific knowledge:
       - \( P(E|\neg CS) \approx 0.6 \)
       - \( P(E|\neg AVS) \approx 0.2 \)
       - \( P(E|\neg BA) \approx 0.7 \)

Now we determine \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(E|AVS) \cdot P(AVS) + P(E|BA) \cdot P(BA) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.4 \cdot 0.4 + 0.9 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.2 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.16 + 0.09 + 0.06 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.31 \]

Finally, we calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

- For Computer Science:
  \[ P(CS|E) = \frac{P(E|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(E)} \]
  \[ P(CS|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.4}{0.31} \]
  \[ P(CS|E) \approx 0.516 \]

- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
  \[ P(AVS|E) = \frac{P(E|AVS) \cdot P(AVS)}{P(E)} \]
  \[ P(AVS|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{0.31} \]
  \[ P(AVS|E) \approx 0.290 \]

- For Business Administration:
  \[ P(BA|E) = \frac{P(E|BA) \cdot P(BA)}{P(E)} \]
  \[ P(BA|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.31} \]
  \[ P(BA|E) \approx 0.194 \]

So, the computed probabilities \( P(H|E) \) are:

{
  "computer science": "0.516",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.290",
  "business administration": "0.194"
