To compute the probabilities, we will use Bayesian inference. Let's start by assigning reasonable estimates for the prior probabilities (P(H)), the likelihoods (P(E|H)), and the complementary likelihoods (P(E|¬H)) for each field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that a random graduate student is studying agricultural and veterinary science. Assuming all fields are equally likely beforehand, we might start with an estimate around 0.1.
- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood that Adam, given he is studying agricultural and veterinary science, would have the personality traits in E. Because Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals aligns well with this field, we estimate this to be high, let's say 0.8.
- **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood that Adam would have the personality traits in E, given he is not studying this field. We might estimate this to be lower, around 0.2, as his traits are more specific to this field compared to others.

### Computer Science
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that a random graduate student is studying computer science. Given the popularity of computer science, we could assume this to be higher, about 0.3.
- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood that Adam, given he is studying computer science, would have the personality traits in E. His interest in puzzles and abstract concepts fits, but not the nature and animal aspects. We estimate this to be moderate, around 0.4.
- **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood that Adam would have the personality traits in E, given he is not studying computer science. We might estimate this similarly, around 0.5.

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that a random graduate student is studying business administration. Assuming it's a common field, we might estimate about 0.2.
- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood that Adam, given he is studying business administration, would have the personality traits in E. His traits do not align well with this field, so let's estimate this to be low, around 0.1.
- **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood that Adam would have the personality traits in E, given he is not studying business administration. This might be quite high, around 0.7.

Now, we will calculate the posterior probabilities P(H|E) using Bayes' rule: 

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{ P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9} \approx \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.18} \approx \frac{0.08}{0.26} \approx 0.308 \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{0.4 \cdot 0.3 + 0.5 \cdot 0.7} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.35} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.47} \approx 0.255 \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.7 \cdot 0.8} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.56} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.58} \approx 0.034 \]

Hence, the probabilities are as follows:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.308,
  "computer science": 0.255,
  "business administration": 0.034
}
