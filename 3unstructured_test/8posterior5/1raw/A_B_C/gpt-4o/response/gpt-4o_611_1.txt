Let's first break down how we can use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

While \( P(E) \) can be complex to determine without detailed statistics, we can use a comparison method by looking at the relative probabilities of \( P(H|E) \) for different fields of study.

1. **Computer Science**
   - \( P(H) \): Let's assume the general proportion of graduate students enrolled in computer science is moderate; we'll estimate \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's strong understanding of abstract concepts and high intelligence, there is a reasonable likelihood he fits the profile of a computer science student, but his strong empathy and love for animals are less aligned; estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Assuming that overall, Adam would generally fit less well into fields other than those strongly aligned with his personality, we might estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.1 \).

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - \( P(H) \): The general proportion of students enrolled in this field is potentially lower than in computer science; we'll estimate \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's love for animals, nature, and plants, as well as his appreciation for hard work and dedication, fit this field very well; estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.6 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The overall match with fields outside this domain might be lower due to Adam's specific interests; estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.05 \).

3. **Business Administration**
   - \( P(H) \): Business administration enrolls a considerable number of graduate students, perhaps comparable to computer science; we'll estimate \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's description lacks a direct connection to typical traits of business administration students, such as interest in finance or corporate strategy; estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam fitting moderately well into other fields can be kept similar for non-aligned interests; \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.1 \).

Now applying Bayes' rule for each:

### Computer Science
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.06}{P(E)} \]
### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(\text{AgVet}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{AgVet}) \cdot P(\text{AgVet})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.06}{P(E)} \]
### Business Administration
\[ P(\text{BusAdmin}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{BusAdmin}) \cdot P(\text{BusAdmin})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.02}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same across all comparisons, our relative probabilities (unnormalized) are:

- Computer Science: 0.06
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.06
- Business Administration: 0.02

Normalized:

Given this, the relative likelihoods \( P(H|E) \) should be recalculated:

### Normalized calculation
\[
\sum P(H|E) = 0.06 + 0.06 + 0.02 = 0.14
\]

So the normalized probabilities:

\[
\text{Computer Science}: \frac{0.06}{0.14} \approx 0.43
\]
\[
\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}: \frac{0.06}{0.14} \approx 0.43
\]
\[
\text{Business Administration}: \frac{0.02}{0.14} \approx 0.14
\]

{
  "computer science": 0.43,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.43,
  "business administration": 0.14
}
