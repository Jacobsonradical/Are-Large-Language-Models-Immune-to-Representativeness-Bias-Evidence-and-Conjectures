To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each of the given fields. Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We will assume that the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field are equal, as we don't have specific prior information. Therefore, we simplify the estimation using the proportional relationship:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Let's assign the estimates for each field and then apply Bayes' rule:

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \) (prior probability): It's less likely, given Adam's interest in nature and animals.
  \[
  P(H) \approx 0.2
  \]
- \( P(E|H) \) (likelihood): Low, business administration doesn't align well with his personality sketch.
  \[
  P(E|H) \approx 0.1
  \]
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) (complement likelihood): Moderate to reflect the average likelihood for other fields.
  \[
  P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4
  \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): More likely given his genuine curiosity about nature and animals.
  \[
  P(H) \approx 0.3
  \]
- \( P(E|H) \): Very high, as his personality closely aligns with the characteristics typical for this field.
  \[
  P(E|H) \approx 0.8
  \]
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Lower, since many other fields don't match his personality as well.
  \[
  P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3
  \]

### Computer Science
- \( P(H) \): Likely, considering his interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts.
  \[
  P(H) \approx 0.3
  \]
- \( P(E|H) \): High, given his traits like high intelligence and enjoyment in solving puzzles.
  \[
  P(E|H) \approx 0.6
  \]
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Moderate, reflecting the diverse nature of many fields.
  \[
  P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4
  \]

Now we use these estimates to compute \( P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \):

For Business Administration:
\[
P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02
\]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[
P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24
\]

For Computer Science:
\[
P(H|E) \propto 0.6 \times 0.3 = 0.18
\]

Normalizing (though not strictly necessary here since the problem allows for totals not summing to 1):

\[
P(H|E)_{normalized} = \frac{Value}{TotalValue}
\]

The TotalValue here is \( 0.02 + 0.24 + 0.18 = 0.44 \).

Here are the normalized results:
\[
{
  "business administration": \frac{0.02}{0.44} \approx 0.045,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \frac{0.24}{0.44} \approx 0.545,
  "computer science": \frac{0.18}{0.44} \approx 0.409
}
\]

But, as you requested the values without summing to 1, here are the unnormalized values:
\[
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.24,
  "computer science": 0.18
}
\]

If the equivalents were adjusted to sum to 1 (optional):
\[
{
  "business administration": 0.045,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.545,
  "computer science": 0.409
}
\]
