To calculate the probabilities, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Estimate the Prior Probabilities (\(P(H)\)):**
   - Let's assume the prior probabilities are based on the general distribution of graduate students across fields.
     - **Computer Science:** ~20% (\(P(H_{CS}) = 0.20\))
     - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** ~5% (\(P(H_{AV}) = 0.05\))
     - **Business Administration:** ~10% (\(P(H_{BA}) = 0.10\))

2. **Estimate the Likelihoods (\(P(E \mid H)\)):**
   - How well does E (Adam's personality) fit each field?
     - **Computer Science:** Curiosity, intelligence, love for puzzles fit well. Let's say \(P(E \mid H_{CS}) = 0.70\)
     - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy fit very well. Let's say \(P(E \mid H_{AV}) = 0.90\)
     - **Business Administration:** Warm heart and empathy might partially fit, but curiosity about nature and puzzles don't. Let's say \(P(E \mid H_{BA}) = 0.30\)

3. **Estimate the Complement Likelihoods (\(P(E \mid \neg H)\)):**
   - Considering the fields not specified:
     - \(P(E \mid \neg H_{CS})\): Other fields (non-CS) combined might partially fit Adam, let's say \(P(E \mid \neg H_{CS}) = 0.50\)
     - \(P(E \mid \neg H_{AV})\): Other fields (non-AV) combined might partially fit Adam, let's say \(P(E \mid \neg H_{AV}) = 0.60\)
     - \(P(E \mid \neg H_{BA})\): Other fields (non-BA) combined might fit Adam better, let's say \(P(E \mid \neg H_{BA}) = 0.80\)

4. **Compute Posterior Probabilities (\(P(H \mid E)\)):**
   - Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

   Where \(P(E)\) is the total probability of E:

\[
P(E) = P(E \mid H_{CS}) \times P(H_{CS}) + P(E \mid H_{AV}) \times P(H_{AV}) + P(E \mid H_{BA}) \times P(H_{BA}) + P(E \mid \neg H_{CS} \wedge \neg H_{AV} \wedge \neg H_{BA}) \times P(\neg H_{CS} \wedge \neg H_{AV} \wedge \neg H_{BA})
\]

For simplicity in our specific comparison:

\[
P(E) \approx P(E \mid H_{CS}) \times P(H_{CS}) + P(E \mid H_{AV}) \times P(H_{AV}) + P(E \mid H_{BA}) \times P(H_{BA})
\]

Let's calculate these probabilities:

\[
P(E) \approx (0.70 \times 0.20) + (0.90 \times 0.05) + (0.30 \times 0.10)
\]

\[
P(E) \approx 0.14 + 0.045 + 0.03 = 0.215
\]

Now, apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(H_{CS} \mid E) = \frac{0.70 \times 0.20}{0.215} \approx 0.651
\]

\[
P(H_{AV} \mid E) = \frac{0.90 \times 0.05}{0.215} \approx 0.209
\]

\[
P(H_{BA} \mid E) = \frac{0.30 \times 0.10}{0.215} \approx 0.140
\]

Final answer in the required format:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.651,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.209,
  "business administration": 0.140
}
```

Note: These probabilities are rounded and approximate. In reality, estimating priors and likelihoods often involves more granular data and expert knowledge.
