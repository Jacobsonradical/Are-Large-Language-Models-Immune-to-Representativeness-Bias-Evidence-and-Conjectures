To calculate \( P(H|E) \), we'll use Bayes' theorem, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood that the personality sketch \( E \) fits if Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likelihood that the personality sketch \( E \) fits if Adam is not enrolled in that field.

Let's assume some reasonable values for each:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H) \) (the prior probability of any random graduate student being in this field): Suppose this is lower than common fields like computer science, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \) (the probability of the personality sketch given this field): Given Adam's love for nature, animals, and empathy, this is a good fit. Let's say \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \) (the probability of the personality sketch given not this field): Since this sketch could also fit other scientific or empathetic fields, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

2. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): This is a common field for graduate students, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.3 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam fits certain aspects like intelligence and abstract thinking, but it's less likely considering his love for nature and animals. Let’s say \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Since there are other fields where the sketch fits better, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

3. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H) \): Another common field but less fit for Adam’s sketch, let’s assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The personality sketch doesn't align well with this field given Adam's traits. Let’s say \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): More likely due to the broader field options, let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

Given these assumptions, let’s calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** 
   - Using Bayes' theorem:
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
   - First, estimate \( P(E) \) (total probability of the sketch \( E \)):
   \[ P(E) \approx P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H)) \]
   - For simplicity, updates based on each hypothesis are:
   \[ P(E) \approx (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) = 0.08 + 0.27 = 0.35 \]
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.35} \approx 0.23 \]

2. **Computer Science:**
   - Estimate \( P(E) \):
   \[ P(E) \approx (0.4 \cdot 0.3) + (0.5 \cdot 0.7) = 0.12 + 0.35 = 0.47 \]
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{0.47} \approx 0.26 \]

3. **Business Administration:**
   - Estimate \( P(E) \):
   \[ P(E) \approx (0.2 \cdot 0.2) + (0.5 \cdot 0.8) = 0.04 + 0.4 = 0.44 \]
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.44} \approx 0.09 \]

So, the final probabilities would be:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.23,
  "computer science": 0.26,
  "business administration": 0.09
}
```
