Let's denote:

- \( P(H) \) as the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \) as the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) as the likelihood of observing Adam’s personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H|E) \) as the posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch.

We use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we don't have the exact data for these probabilities, we'll make informed estimates:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Prior probability might be moderate given its popularity, let's set it at 0.2.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given the personality sketch, it isn't highly characteristic of computer science, but it isn't impossible, let's set it at 0.1.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing such a personality in another field, let's estimate 0.3.

\[ P(H|E)_{cs} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

2. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): Prior probability is also quite common, set it at 0.2.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The personality described is somewhat less common in business administration, let's set it at 0.05.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of such a personality in another field, estimate 0.3.

\[ P(H|E)_{ba} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Less common field, but highly relevant to the personality sketch, set it at 0.1.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The personality sketch fits very well, set it at 0.7.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of such a personality in another field, estimate 0.3.

\[ P(H|E)_{avs} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

We don’t have \( P(E) \), but since we only want to compare them relatively, we can simplify our calculations by normalizing:

Simplified:
\[
\text{computer science} = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02
\]
\[
\text{business administration} = 0.05 \cdot 0.2 = 0.01
\]
\[
\text{agricultural and veterinary science} = 0.7 \cdot 0.1 = 0.07
\]

Relative probabilities considering normalization:
- Computer Science: 0.02
- Business Administration: 0.01
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.07

Finally, we normalize these values so their sum equals 1:

Normalization factor: \( 0.02 + 0.01 + 0.07 = 0.10 \)

Normalized probabilities:

\[
\text{computer science} = \frac{0.02}{0.10} = 0.2
\]
\[
\text{business administration} = \frac{0.01}{0.10} = 0.1
\]
\[
\text{agricultural and veterinary science} = \frac{0.07}{0.10} = 0.7
\]

So, the final output is:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```
