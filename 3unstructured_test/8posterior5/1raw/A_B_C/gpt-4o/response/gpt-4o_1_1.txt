To evaluate the probabilities using Bayes' Rule, we need the following components:
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field (H).
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing the personality sketch (E) given that Adam is enrolled in that field (H).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of observing the personality sketch (E) given that Adam is not enrolled in that field (H).

**Bayes' Rule** states:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Given that we do not have exact numerical values, we'll need to estimate based on the description provided.

### Estimates Based on the Personality Sketch (E)

**E:** Adam is quiet, enjoys nature, solving puzzles, has empathy, loves animals, high intelligence, and appreciates hard work.

**Assumptions:**
1. **P(E)** is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch in the general population of graduate students.

### Evaluating Each Field

#### Computer Science:
- **P(H)**: The prior probability of a graduate student being in computer science. Assuming computer science is a popular field, we can give it a moderate prior probability, say **0.2**.
- **P(E|H)**: The personality traits related to empathy, love for animals, and nature might be less common in computer science students, while high intelligence and problem-solving skills are quite relevant. We can estimate this to be moderate, say **0.4**.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of the personality sketch among non-computer science students. Given the specific traits, it might be higher than among computer science students due to the nature-oriented and empathetic traits, say **0.6**.

#### Business Administration:
- **P(H)**: The prior probability of a graduate student being in business administration. This may be lower than computer science, say **0.15**.
- **P(E|H)**: The specific traits like love for animals and nature aren't strongly aligned with business, but intelligence and appreciation for hard work are. Estimate this to be moderate, say **0.3**.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Same as before, the likelihood among non-business administration, say **0.65**.

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- **P(H)**: The prior for agricultural and veterinary science might be smaller due to fewer students in this field, say **0.1**.
- **P(E|H)**: Personality traits are a very good match, considering empathy, love for nature and animals are direct fits. This should be high, say **0.8**.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Very general among non-agricultural and veterinary students, say **0.5**.

### Calculating Posterior Probabilities

For each field:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

However, since we don't have the exact P(E), we'll focus on comparing the relative values:

### Computer Science:
\[
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.4 \times 0.2 = 0.08
\]

### Business Administration:
\[
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.3 \times 0.15 = 0.045
\]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08
\]

Relative values:
- Computer Science: **0.08**
- Business Administration: **0.045**
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: **0.08**

### Normalizing (optional step for better comparison):

Since P(E) will normalize these, let's just use our calculated values directly for simplicity. Probabilities should not exceed 1:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.08,
  "business administration": 0.045,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08
}
```
