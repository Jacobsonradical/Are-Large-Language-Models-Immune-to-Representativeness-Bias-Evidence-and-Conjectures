To calculate the probability of Adam's enrollment in specific fields given his personality sketch \(E\), we will use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to estimate \(P(H)\) (the prior probability of Adam being in a specific field), \(P(E|H)\) (the likelihood of the personality sketch given the field), and \(P(E| \neg H)\) (the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is in other fields).

**Assumptions:**

1. Let's assume typical university programs' distribution, where a larger proportion of students is enrolled in Business Administration compared to Agricultural and Veterinary Science or Computer Science. Hence, the prior \(P(H)\) might be relatively lower for Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
2. Based on Adam's interests and characteristics described in his personality sketch, he is less likely suited for Business Administration and more likely for Agricultural and Veterinary Science or Computer Science.

Given this, let's make the following estimations:

### Business Administration

- \(P(H)\): Moderate, let's assume \(0.3\) (reflecting that many students enroll in business but Adam's interests do not align well)
- \(P(E|H)\): Low, let's assume \(0.1\) (Adam's personality and interests are not typically aligned with business administration)
- \(P(E| \neg H)\): Higher, let's assume \(0.25\) (reflecting general fit with broader fields excluding business administration)

Using these values:

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \times 0.3}{0.25} = \frac{0.03}{0.25} = 0.12 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- \(P(H)\): Lower, let's assume \(0.1\) (fewer students enroll in this field generally)
- \(P(E|H)\): High, let's assume \(0.8\) (Adam's interests align very well with this field)
- \(P(E| \neg H)\): Moderate, let's assume \(0.2\) (certain degrees of alignment with other fields exist)

Using these values:

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.2} = \frac{0.08}{0.2} = 0.40 \]

### Computer Science

- \(P(H)\): Moderate, let's assume \(0.2\) (reflecting a good number of students enrolling but not as much as business administration)
- \(P(E|H)\): Moderate, let's assume \(0.4\) (Adam's intelligence and abstract thinking fit well here, though not as well as agricultural science)
- \(P(E| \neg H)\): Higher, let's assume \(0.25\) (reflecting general alignment with broader fields excluding computer science)

Using these values:

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.4 \times 0.2}{0.25} = \frac{0.08}{0.25} = 0.32 \]

Given these calculations, we can summarize as:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.12,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.40,
  "computer science": 0.32
}
```

These probabilities reflect that, given Adam's personality sketch, he is most likely to be enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, followed by Computer Science and then Business Administration.
