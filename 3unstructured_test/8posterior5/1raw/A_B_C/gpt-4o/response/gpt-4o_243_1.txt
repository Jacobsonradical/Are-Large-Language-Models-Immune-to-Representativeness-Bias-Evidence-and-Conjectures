To apply Bayes' rule to compute the probability P(H|E) for each field, we first need the prior probability P(H), the likelihood P(E|H), and the background probability P(E|¬H).

Given that Adam has attributes that are more aligned with certain fields (particularly those involving nature, animals, and abstract problem-solving), we assign subjective probabilities to the hypotheses. These are rough estimates, as accurate priors would require specific statistical data.

1. Computer Science:
   - P(H): Assume computer science is a common graduate field.
     \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \)
   - P(E|H): Probability that Adam has these traits if he is in computer science.
     \( P(E|H) \approx 0.4 \) (he is intelligent and likes solving puzzles).
   - P(E|¬H): Probability that Adam has these traits if he is not in computer science. This reflects the general population of graduate fields.
     \( P(E|¬H) \approx 0.1 \)

2. Business Administration:
   - P(H): Assume business administration is another common graduate field.
     \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \)
   - P(E|H): Probability that Adam has these traits if he is in business administration.
     \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \) (his traits are less relevant to business administration).
   - P(E|¬H): Probability that Adam has these traits if he is not in business administration.
     \( P(E|¬H) \approx 0.1 \)

3. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
   - P(H): Assume agricultural and veterinary science is a less common but relevant graduate field.
     \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \)
   - P(E|H): Probability that Adam has these traits if he is in agricultural and veterinary science.
     \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \) (his traits fit very well with this field).
   - P(E|¬H): Probability that Adam has these traits if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science.
     \( P(E|¬H) \approx 0.1 \)

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) + ... + P(E|H_n) \cdot P(H_n) \]

Assume only the given fields contribute to the probability:
\[ P(E) \approx (0.4 \cdot 0.2) + (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.8 \cdot 0.1) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.08 + 0.02 + 0.08 = 0.18 \]

Now for each field:
1. Computer Science:
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.18} \approx 0.44
   \]

2. Business Administration:
   \[
   P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.18} \approx 0.11
   \]

3. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
   \[
   P(\text{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.18} \approx 0.44
   \]

So the probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": 0.44,
  "business administration": 0.11,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.44
}
