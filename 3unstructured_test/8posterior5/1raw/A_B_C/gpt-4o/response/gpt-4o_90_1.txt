To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis using Bayes' Rule, we need to determine the following:

1. \( P(H) \) - The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \) - The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in each field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in each specific field.

Given that the probabilities should reflect the fit of Adam's personality sketch (E) with the nature of each field (H), let's make some reasoned estimations:

**Estimation of Probabilities:**

### Computer Science
- **\( P(H) \)**: Relatively high, as computer science is a popular graduate field. Suppose \( P(H) = 0.25 \).
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: For someone in computer science, Adam's personality (curiosity, intelligence, abstract thinking) fits reasonably well, though his strong empathy and love for animals might be less aligned. Suppose \( P(E|H) = 0.5 \).
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of observing this personality sketch among non-computer science fields. Suppose \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

### Business Administration
- **\( P(H) \)**: Another common graduate field, but may not fit Adam's personality traits as closely. Suppose \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: The fit is less strong. Business administration typically values traits like leadership and strategic thinking over curiosity about nature and empathy for animals. Suppose \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This would be similar to the general probability among all other fields. Suppose \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.25 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **\( P(H) \)**: Less common than the previous fields but aligns very well with Adam's personality traits, especially his empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature. Suppose \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: Very high, as Adam's personality is a strong fit. Suppose \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Lower, given the unique fit to this field. Suppose \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.15 \).

### Applying Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be calculated as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

We can approximate \( P(E) \) based on each case but since the denominator \( P(E) \) is the same for all cases, we focus on the numerators for relative comparison.

### Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.25}{P(E)} = \frac{0.125}{P(E)} \]

### Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.06}{P(E)} \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.09}{P(E)} \]

### Relative Comparison:
By normalizing these values relative to one another, we get:

\[
\text{Total} = 0.125 + 0.06 + 0.09 = 0.275 
\]
\[
P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.125}{0.275} \approx 0.454
\]
\[
P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.275} \approx 0.218 
\]
\[
P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.275} \approx 0.327 
\]

### Final Values:
\[
{
  "computer science": 0.454,
  "business administration": 0.218,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.327
}
\]

This should give a reasonable estimation given the current information.
