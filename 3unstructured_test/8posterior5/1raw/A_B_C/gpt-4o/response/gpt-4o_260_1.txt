To answer this question, let's break it down systematically to calculate the conditional probabilities using Bayes' Rule.

We start with known values:
- P(H): the prior probability of Adam being in each respective field.
- P(E|H): the likelihood that the personality sketch of Adam would be observed if he is in that specific field.
- P(E|¬H): the likelihood of the personality sketch of Adam being observed if he is not in that specific field.
- P(H|E): the posterior probability that Adam is in the field given his personality sketch.

Let's make reasonable assumptions for these probabilities:
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - P(H): This field is specific but plausible, and many students might be involved in it. Let’s assume this has moderate prior probability (~0.2).
   - P(E|H): The personality sketch seems to fit well with this field given his love for nature, plants, and animals. Let’s assign it a high likelihood of 0.8.
   - P(E|¬H): The chance that a person outside this field has a similar personality sketch is lower but not negligible. Let’s assume 0.4.

2. **Business Administration**
   - P(H): Many students go into Business, making the field populous. Let’s assume a high prior probability (~0.3).
   - P(E|H): The given personality sketch does not seem particularly aligned with typical business administration traits. Let’s assign it a low likelihood of 0.1.
   - P(E|¬H): The chance of a person outside business administration having this personality is more likely, let’s assume 0.5.

3. **Computer Science**
   - P(H): Computer Science is a popular field with many students. Let’s assume a high prior probability (~0.3).
   - P(E|H): The personality sketch somewhat fits with abstract thinking and intelligence, but not necessarily with empathy and love for nature. Let’s assign it a moderate likelihood of 0.3.
   - P(E|¬H): Similar to others, let’s assume the likelihood outside of Computer Science with the same traits, let’s assume 0.5.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since P(E) is the same for all fields, we can evaluate the numerator and use it for relative comparison.

### Calculations
1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
   - Numerator: P(E|H) * P(H) = 0.8 * 0.2 = 0.16

2. Business Administration
   - Numerator: P(E|H) * P(H) = 0.1 * 0.3 = 0.03

3. Computer Science
   - Numerator: P(E|H) * P(H) = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09

Now, we normalize the values:

Sum of Numerators = 0.16 + 0.03 + 0.09 = 0.28

### Posterior Probabilities
1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
   - P(H|E) = 0.16 / 0.28 ≈ 0.571

2. Business Administration
   - P(H|E) = 0.03 / 0.28 ≈ 0.107

3. Computer Science
   - P(H|E) = 0.09 / 0.28 ≈ 0.321

So, the probabilities for each field are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.571,
  "business administration": 0.107,
  "computer science": 0.321
}
