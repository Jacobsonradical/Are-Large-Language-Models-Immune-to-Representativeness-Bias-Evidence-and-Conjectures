Sure, let's go through each field systematically.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **P(H)** (the prior probability he is enrolled in this field): Given Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, along with his love for animals, the probability seems higher compared to fields like business administration.
   - **P(E|H)** (the probability of the sketch given he's in this field): Adam's personality sketch fits very well with someone in this field. 
   - **P(E|\neg H)** (the probability of the sketch given he's not in this field): This could be lower given how well the sketch matches this specific field.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - **P(H)**: Generally, many students are in computer science, but Adam's traits don't particularly align strongly with typical computer science interests.
   - **P(E|H)**: The personality sketch doesn't strongly fit someone in computer science, as there is less focus on nature and animals.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: Given the personality sketch, we would expect lower odds if he were not in computer science compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

3. **Business Administration**:
   - **P(H)**: Adam's personality doesn't closely fit the stereotype of a business administration student, but it is a broad field.
   - **P(E|H)**: Again, the personality sketch doesn't strongly fit this field.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: Personality traits like empathy and a love for animals would make it less likely that he is in business administration.

Using Bayesian inference, we update P(H) based on how well Adam's personality sketch (E) fits each hypothesis:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where \(P(E)\) is the normalizing constant to ensure the probabilities sum up to 1. We will assume, for simplicity, similar values where applicable.

**Assumptions for estimates**:
- For agricultural and veterinary science, let's assume \(P(H) = 0.2\), \(P(E|H) = 0.8\), \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.2\).
- For computer science, let's assume \(P(H) = 0.3\), \(P(E|H) = 0.2\), \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.3\).
- For business administration, let's assume \(P(H) = 0.2\), \(P(E|H) = 0.1\), \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.3\).

Now, let's calculate approximate values:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  \[
  P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.16}{P(E)}
  \]

- **Computer Science**:
  \[
  P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.06}{P(E)}
  \]

- **Business Administration**:
  \[
  P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.02}{P(E)}
  \]

The exact normalizing constant \(P(E)\) isn't required to provide rough relative likelihoods. Consequently:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.16,
  "computer science": 0.06,
  "business administration": 0.02
}

These values express relative likelihoods based on the given assumptions and personality sketch.
