To compute the probabilities using Bayes' rule, we need to define the following terms clearly:

- P(H): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field.
- P(E|H): The probability of the evidence (Adam's personality sketch) given that he is in that field.
- P(E|\neg H): The probability of the evidence given that he is not in that field.
- P(H|E): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field given the evidence.

We use Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Since calculating \( P(E) \) can be complex without more data, we will use the relative probabilities and assume it to be constant for simplification purposes.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   
   - P(H): This field aligns well with Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, and his deep love for animals.
     \[ P(H) = 0.2 \]
   
   - P(E|H): Given that Adam is in this field, it is highly likely that the personality sketch matches.
     \[ P(E|H) = 0.9 \]
   
   - P(E|\neg H): Even if Adam was not enrolled in this field, someone with similar interests might still have a somewhat overlapping personality sketch.
     \[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \]
   
2. **Computer Science**
   
   - P(H): Computer Science is widespread among graduate fields, but does not particularly align with Adam's personality sketch.
     \[ P(H) = 0.3 \]
   
   - P(E|H): Given that Adam is in this field, it's somewhat less likely that the sketch matches.
     \[ P(E|H) = 0.4 \]
   
   - P(E|\neg H): Given he is not in this field, the likelihood that others share a personality sketch like Adam's might still be there, but not that high considering his empathy and interest in nature.
     \[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \]
   
3. **Business Administration**
   
   - P(H): Business Administration doesn't explicitly align with the personality sketch provided.
     \[ P(H) = 0.1 \]
   
   - P(E|H): Given Adam is in Business Administration, it is less likely that his personality sketch matches this field.
     \[ P(E|H) = 0.2 \]
   
   - P(E|\neg H): Similar to Computer Science, it might be even lower in this case.
     \[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.7 \]

Now, we calculate P(H|E) for each field using Bayes' rule: 
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

- Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
  \[
  P(H|E) \propto 0.9 \times 0.2 = 0.18
  \]

- Computer Science:
  \[
  P(H|E) \propto 0.4 \times 0.3 = 0.12
  \]

- Business Administration:
  \[
  P(H|E) \propto 0.2 \times 0.1 = 0.02
  \]

Normalizing these probabilities so that they are comparable (sum should be 1 if these are only possibilities, but they are not the only possibilities, so simple relative comparison is appropriate here):

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.18,
  "computer science": 0.12,
  "business administration": 0.02
}
