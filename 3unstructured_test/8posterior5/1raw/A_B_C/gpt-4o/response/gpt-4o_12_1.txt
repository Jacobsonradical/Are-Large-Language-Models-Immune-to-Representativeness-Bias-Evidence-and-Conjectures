Let's start by discussing each field in the context of given probabilities and the personality sketch.

### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is not very high, given the variety of fields available. Let's assume it to be around 0.05.
- **P(E|H)**: The personality sketch of Adam highly matches with someone in agricultural and veterinary science due to his love for nature, plants, and animals. Thus, this probability is high, say 0.7.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of having such a personality sketch in fields other than agricultural and veterinary science is lower. Let's assume it to be around 0.2.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]
\[ = 0.7 \times 0.05 + 0.2 \times 0.95 = 0.035 + 0.19 = 0.225 \]

So:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.05}{0.225} \approx 0.156 \]

### 2. Business Administration

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that a graduate student is in business administration is somewhat moderate, let’s assume 0.15.
- **P(E|H)**: The personality sketch doesn't strongly match typical business administration traits. Let's assume it to be around 0.1.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of having such a personality sketch in fields other than business administration is reasonably the same, let’s assume 0.225 (the same as general probability).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]
\[ = 0.1 \times 0.15 + 0.225 \times 0.85 = 0.015 + 0.19125 = 0.20625 \]

So:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.15}{0.20625} \approx 0.0727 \]

### 3. Computer Science

- **P(H)**: The prior probability of a graduate student being in computer science is relatively high. Let’s assume 0.2.
- **P(E|H)**: The personality sketch shows strong intelligence and abstract thinking, which fits well with computer science. But his love for nature might not be as directly connected, giving it a moderate probability of 0.5.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of this personality sketch occurring outside computer science is similar to our general assumption, around 0.225.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]
\[ = 0.5 \times 0.2 + 0.225 \times 0.8 = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \]

So:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \times 0.2}{0.28} \approx 0.357 \]

Now we can summarize the results as:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.156,
  "business administration": 0.0727,
  "computer science": 0.357
}
```

These probabilistic values indicate Adam's likelihood of being enrolled in each of these fields based on his personality sketch.
