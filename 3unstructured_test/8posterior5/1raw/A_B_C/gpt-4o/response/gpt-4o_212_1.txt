Given the information provided and using Bayes' theorem, we can estimate the probabilities of Adam being enrolled in the specified fields based on his personality sketch E.

Let's denote:
- \(P(H)\) as the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field.
- \(P(E|H)\) as the probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\) as the probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was not enrolled in the field.
- \(P(H|E)\) as the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field given his personality sketch E.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

We need to make some assumptions about prior probabilities and conditional probabilities based on the given personality sketch of Adam. Here's a rough estimation:

### Prior Probabilities \(P(H)\):
- Assume the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in any of these fields is somewhat uniform, but we can give a slight preference based on the commonality of each field among graduate students.
  - \(P(\text{computer science}) = 0.3\)
  - \(P(\text{business administration}) = 0.3\)
  - \(P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.4\)

### Conditional Probabilities \(P(E|H)\) and \(P(E|\neg H)\):
- Based on Adam's profile, we can estimate how likely it is for someone with those characteristics to be in each field.
  - For Computer Science:
    - \(P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.2\) (high intelligence fits, but other traits less so)
  - For Business Administration:
    - \(P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.1\) (traits less aligned with typical business administration students)
  - For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
    - \(P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.6\) (high alignment with love for animals, nature, and warm heart)

### Calculating \(P(E)\):
- \(P(E)\): the overall probability of observing the personality sketch \(E\).
  \[
  P(E) = P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) + P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) + P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})
  \]
  \[
  P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.3 + 0.1 \cdot 0.3 + 0.6 \cdot 0.4 = 0.06 + 0.03 + 0.24 = 0.33
  \]

### Posterior Probabilities \(P(H|E)\):
- Using Bayes' theorem:
  \[
  P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
  \]

- For Computer Science:
  \[
  P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{0.33} \approx 0.1818
  \]

- For Business Administration:
  \[
  P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.3}{0.33} \approx 0.0909
  \]

- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
  \[
  P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.4}{0.33} \approx 0.7273
  \]

So the final answers are:

{
  "computer science": 0.1818,
  "business administration": 0.0909,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7273
}
