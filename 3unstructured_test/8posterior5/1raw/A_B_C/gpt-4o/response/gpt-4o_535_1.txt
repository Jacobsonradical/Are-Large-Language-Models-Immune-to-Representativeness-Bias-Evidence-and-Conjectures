Let’s start by determining the values of \(P(H)\), \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E|\neg H)\) for each field. Since we need to make judgments based on Adam’s described personality traits and interests, we’ll use reasonable estimates.

### Computer Science
- **P(H) (Prior Probability)**: Let's assume the prior probability of Adam being in computer science (CS) is moderate. There are many graduate students in CS in the U.S.
- **P(E|H) (Likelihood if in CS)**: Adam’s traits of high intelligence and liking for solving puzzles might align well with CS.
- **P(E|¬H) (Likelihood if not in CS)**: The likelihood of Adam's traits given he is in another field might still be significant, but not as much compared to being exactly in CS.

### Business Administration
- **P(H) (Prior Probability)**: Let's assume the prior probability of Adam being in business administration is low, considering his specific interests.
- **P(E|H) (Likelihood if in Business Administration)**: Adam's personality traits don't strongly align with typical business administration characteristics.
- **P(E|¬H) (Likelihood if not in Business Administration)**: The likelihood of his traits in non-business fields could be higher than in business administration.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H) (Prior Probability)**: Prior probability of Adam being in agricultural and veterinary science (AVS) could be moderate, given there are fewer people in this field compared to CS.
- **P(E|H) (Likelihood if in AVS)**: Adam’s appreciation for nature, plants, animals, and empathy aligns very well with AVS.
- **P(E|¬H) (Likelihood if not in AVS)**: Adam’s traits are less likely in non-AVS fields, given how closely they align with AVS specifics.

### Assigning Values
Let’s assign hypothetical values while keeping the total probabilities meaningful and plausible.

#### For Computer Science
- **P(H) = 0.3**: Moderate likelihood of being in CS.
- **P(E|H) = 0.5**: High alignment with traits.
- **P(E|¬H) = 0.2**: Moderate likelihood his traits could belong to someone in other fields.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|{\neg H}) \times P({\neg H})} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.5 \times 0.3}{0.5 \times 0.3 + 0.2 \times 0.7} \approx 0.517 \]

#### For Business Administration
- **P(H) = 0.1**: Low likelihood of being in Business Administration.
- **P(E|H) = 0.1**: Poor alignment with traits.
- **P(E|¬H) = 0.35**: Likelihood traits fit better in non-business fields.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.1}{0.1 \times 0.1 + 0.35 \times 0.9} \approx 0.031 \]

#### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H) = 0.3**: Moderate likelihood in AVS.
- **P(E|H) = 0.7**: Strong alignment with traits.
- **P(E|¬H) = 0.15**: Unlikely traits fit as well in non-AVS fields.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E)_{AVS} = \frac{0.7 \times 0.3}{0.7 \times 0.3 + 0.15 \times 0.7} \approx 0.667 \]

### Final Estimates

Based on the above calculations:

  "computer science": 0.517,
