To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we first need to estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each specific field of study. Here are the estimates and subsequent calculations:

1. **Business Administration**

   - \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in this field. This is assumed to be quite low, around 0.1, given his described interests and characteristics.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Probability of the evidence given that Adam is in this field. Likely low, around 0.2, because people in business administration are generally more interested in human organizations rather than nature and animals.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of the evidence given that Adam is not in this field. Higher than \( P(E|H) \), estimated around 0.3.

   \( P(H|E) \propto P(H) \cdot P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \)

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

   - \( P(H) \): Prior probability is moderate, say 0.3, because this field closely aligns with Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals.
   - \( P(E|H) \): High probability, around 0.8, given that this field strongly correlates with his personality and interests.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Lower in this context, estimated around 0.2 as other fields might not align as closely.

   \( P(H|E) \propto P(H) \cdot P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \cdot 0.8 = 0.24 \)

3. **Computer Science**

   - \( P(H) \): Prior probability is also moderate, estimated around 0.3 since Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is good at understanding abstract concepts.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Probability of evidence given that Adam is in computer science, which is moderate, around 0.5. This aligns with his intelligence and puzzle-solving but not necessarily his love for nature and animals.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Also moderate, around 0.3, reflecting the likelihood given a broad array of other fields that could align with his propensity for abstract thinking and intelligence.

   \( P(H|E) \propto P(H) \cdot P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \cdot 0.5 = 0.15 \)

Now, normalizing these to sum to 1 for comparison:

\[
\text{Total} = 0.02 + 0.24 + 0.15 = 0.41
\]

\[
P(H|E) \text{(normalized)} = \frac{P(H|E) \text{(raw)}}{\text{Total}}
\]

\[
P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.41} \approx 0.049
\]

\[
P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) = \frac{0.24}{0.41} \approx 0.585
\]

\[
P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.15}{0.41} \approx 0.366
\]

Therefore, the probabilities normalized do not add up to 1 as you have accounted for other fields not listed here:

\[
{
  "business administration": 0.049,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.585,
  "computer science": 0.366
}
\]
