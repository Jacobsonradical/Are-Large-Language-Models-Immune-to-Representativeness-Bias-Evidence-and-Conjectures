To evaluate the probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given the provided personality sketch \( E \), we can use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll assume some initial probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field based on general graduate enrollment statistics. For simplicity, we can use rough averages from the U.S. higher education context:

- Computer Science: 0.2 (20%)
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.1 (10%)
- Business Administration: 0.25 (25%)

Now, we'll assess \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \) based on how well Adam's personality sketch fits each field.

### Computer Science

- \( P(H) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|H) \): The personality sketch mentions high intelligence and an aptitude for abstract concepts, which fits well with computer science, but the love for nature and animals is less relevant. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given the general consideration of people with such traits across other fields, we might estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- \( P(H) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H) \): This field fits very well with his love for animals, plants, nature, and his empathetic disposition. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given the specificities, people outside this field might less frequently embody these exact traits. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

### Business Administration

- \( P(H) = 0.25 \)
- \( P(E|H) \): Empathy and understanding hard work can be relevant, but business administration is less about nature, plants, and animals. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given that many other fields also don’t directly relate to his traits, let’s estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.15 \).

### Applying Bayes' Rule

To simplify, let’s assume \( P(E) \) is the same across all fields, allowing us to compare \( P(H|E) \) relatively without needing \( P(E) \). 

1. **Computer Science**: 
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.4 \times 0.2 = 0.08 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: 
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.7 \times 0.1 = 0.07 \]

3. **Business Administration**: 
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \times 0.25 = 0.05 \]

### Normalizing

To make the probabilities more comparable, sum the proportional values and divide each by the sum:

Sum = 0.08 + 0.07 + 0.05 = 0.20

Now divide each by 0.20:

1. **Computer Science**: \( \frac{0.08}{0.20} = 0.4 \)

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: \( \frac{0.07}{0.20} = 0.35 \)

3. **Business Administration**: \( \frac{0.05}{0.20} = 0.25 \)

The resultant probabilities (to keep consistency despite the assumption simplifications):

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.35,
  "business administration": 0.25
}
```

Note that while approximate, these values show relative likelihoods based on the given personality sketch and general assumptions on distribution and relevance.
