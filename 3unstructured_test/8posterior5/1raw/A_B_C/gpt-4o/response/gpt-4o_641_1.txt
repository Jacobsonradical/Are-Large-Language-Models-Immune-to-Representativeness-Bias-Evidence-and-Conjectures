Given Adam's personality sketch \(E\), we can calculate the posterior probabilities for each field using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where \(P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)\).

### Assumptions
1. \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field.
2. \(P(E|H)\) is the probability of Adam's personality sketch if he is in a given field.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\) is the probability of Adam's personality sketch if he is not in a given field.

### Estimations
1. **Computer Science**
- \(P(H)_{\text{CS}}\): Assume a moderately high prior, say 0.3, since CS is a popular field.
- \(P(E|H)_{\text{CS}}\): Low, say 0.1, as his traits do not strongly match typical CS students.
- \(P(E|\neg H)_{\text{CS}}\): Higher, say 0.6, as his traits could fit many other fields.

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.3}{0.1 \times 0.3 + 0.6 \times 0.7} \approx 0.067 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
- \(P(H)_{\text{AgSci}}\): Lower prior, say 0.1, as fewer students enroll in this field.
- \(P(E|H)_{\text{AgSci}}\): High, say 0.8, as his love for nature and animals fits this field well.
- \(P(E|\neg H)_{\text{AgSci}}\): Lower, say 0.4.

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{AgSci}} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.8 \times 0.1 + 0.4 \times 0.9} \approx 0.182 \]

3. **Business Administration**
- \(P(H)_{\text{BA}}\): Moderate prior, say 0.2, since Business is fairly popular.
- \(P(E|H)_{\text{BA}}\): Low, say 0.2, since his traits are not typical for business students.
- \(P(E|\neg H)_{\text{BA}}\): Higher, say 0.5.

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} = \frac{0.2 \times 0.2}{0.2 \times 0.2 + 0.5 \times 0.8} \approx 0.091 \]

### Summary

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.067,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.182,
  "business administration": 0.091
}
```

These values indicate the posterior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each specific field based on his personality sketch \(E\).
