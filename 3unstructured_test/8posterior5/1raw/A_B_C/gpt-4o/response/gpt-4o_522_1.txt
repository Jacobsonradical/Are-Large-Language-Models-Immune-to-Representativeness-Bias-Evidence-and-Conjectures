To compute \(P(H|E)\), we utilize Bayes' Rule, which states:

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

We need to estimate the following values for each hypothesis \( H \):

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in a particular field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in that particular field.
4. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch (summing up contributions from all possible fields, but we can approximate this as normalization factor).

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: Let's assume a general probability that a student could be in this field. Typically, business majors might have a different personality profile than described, so let's estimate \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
- **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's traits, a personality with a strong interest in nature and animals, and empathy might be less common in business administration. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of such a personality sketch existing in fields other than business administration might be higher. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

### Computer Science
- **P(H)**: This is a frequently chosen field for graduate studies with a decent probability. Let's estimate \( P(H) = 0.3 \).
- **P(E|H)**: Computer science might attract individuals who enjoy solving puzzles and have high intelligence, but the love for nature and animals might be less characteristic. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of such a personality sketch existing outside CS might be slightly higher given the broad array of other subjects. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: This field likely has fewer overall students compared to the other fields but represents those interested in nature and animals. Let's estimate \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
- **P(E|H)**: Given the strong alignment of Adam's traits with this field, we can assign a higher likelihood of matching his personality. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Given Adam's traits, the probability of this personality in other fields might be lower. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

Now, let's calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E)_{business\ administration} = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{computer\ science} = 0.3 \cdot 0.3 = 0.09 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{agricultural\ and\ veterinary\ science} = 0.7 \cdot 0.1 = 0.07 \]

To ensure they are normalized (though not required since total isn't needed to add up to 1):

Sum = \( 0.02 + 0.09 + 0.07 = 0.18 \)

Finally, the approximate \( P(H|E) \) after normalization:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02 / 0.18 ≈ 0.111,
  "computer science": 0.09 / 0.18 ≈ 0.5,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.07 / 0.18 ≈ 0.389
}
```

So, the final values are approximated as:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.111,
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.389
}
```
