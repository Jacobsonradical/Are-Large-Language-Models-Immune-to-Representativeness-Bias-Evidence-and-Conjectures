To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since P(E) is the same across all hypotheses, we only need to compare the numerators across different fields. We need estimates for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

### Business Administration

- \( P(H) \) (prior probability of being enrolled in business administration)
  Let's assume that among all possible graduate fields, a reasonable proportion of graduate students might be enrolled in business administration. We can assume a default prior, such as 0.1.
- \( P(E|H) \) (probability of having his personality sketch given that he is enrolled in business administration)
  Adam's traits do not strongly align with typical business administration traits. We might give this a low value, such as 0.1.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) (probability of having his personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in business administration)
  Given he has traits that suggest alignment with other fields, this would also be around 0.2.

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.1 = 0.01 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- \( P(H) \) (prior probability of being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science)
  Let's assume a reasonable proportion of graduate students might be in agricultural and veterinary science. Again, we can assume a default prior, such as 0.1.
- \( P(E|H) \) (probability of having his personality sketch given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science)
  Adam's traits strongly align with this field (curiosity about nature, love for animals, appreciation for hard work). We might give it a high value, such as 0.8.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) (probability of having his personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science)
  Given he has traits that suggest alignment with this field, this would be lower, around 0.2.

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]

### Computer Science

- \( P(H) \) (prior probability of being enrolled in computer science)
  Let's assume a similar prior for computer science, such as 0.1.
- \( P(E|H) \) (probability of having his personality sketch given that he is enrolled in computer science)
  Adam's intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles align with computer science. We might give this an intermediate value, such as 0.4.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) (probability of having his personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in computer science)
  Given his traits align with other fields more strongly, we can assume around 0.2.

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.4 \cdot 0.1 = 0.04 \]

### Result

Here are the probabilities, normalized for comparison:

{
  "business administration": 0.01,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08,
  "computer science": 0.04
}

Note: The values for \( P(H), P(E|H), \text{ and } P(E|\neg H) \) are assumptions for demonstration purposes. Different assumptions may yield different results. Adjust accordingly to refine the probabilities.
