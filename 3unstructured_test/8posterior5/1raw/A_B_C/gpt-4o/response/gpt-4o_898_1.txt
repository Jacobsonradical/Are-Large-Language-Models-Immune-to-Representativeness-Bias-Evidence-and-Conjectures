To apply Bayes' rule, we need to compute the posterior probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for each field based on the given personality sketch \(E\).

Bayes' rule is stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To simplify, we can calculate the proportionality:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given the three fields of study: business administration, computer science, and agricultural and veterinary science, we need to make educated guesses regarding:

1. \(P(H)\): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field.
2. \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood of Adam having the described personality sketches given that he is in each field.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): The likelihood of Adam having the described personality sketches given that he is not in each field.

Since the values of these probabilities are not given, we need to make reasonable estimations based on common knowledge and the provided information. Here’s an estimated approach:

**1. Business Administration**
- \(P(H)\): Moderate, as it is a common field of study but less typical given his personality.
- \(P(E|H)\): Low, since business administration is generally associated with less emphasis on nature, animals, and empathy.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): Higher, since these traits might be more commonly associated with other fields.

Given these:
- \(P(H) \approx 0.2\)
- \(P(E|H) \approx 0.1\)
- \(P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3\)

**2. Computer Science**
- \(P(H)\): Moderate, as it’s a popular and broad field.
- \(P(E|H)\): Moderate, because good understanding of abstract concepts and solving puzzles aligns with computer science.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): Moderate, as abstract thinking and intelligence apply to many fields.

Given these:
- \(P(H) \approx 0.2\)
- \(P(E|H) \approx 0.4\)
- \(P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3\)

**3. Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
- \(P(H)\): Lower, as fewer students enroll in this field compared to the others.
- \(P(E|H)\): High, since love for nature, plants, animals, and empathy fits well with agricultural and veterinary science.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): Lower, as these specific attributes are less likely in other fields.

Given these:
- \(P(H) \approx 0.1\)
- \(P(E|H) \approx 0.8\)
- \(P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3\)

Using these estimates, we compute proportional values for \(P(H|E)\):

**Business Administration:**
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.2 \times 0.1 \approx 0.02 \]

**Computer Science:**
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.2 \times 0.4 \approx 0.08 \]

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.8 \approx 0.08 \]

Now, normalize these values:

Total = 0.02 + 0.08 + 0.08 = 0.18

Normalized values:
- Business Administration: \( \frac{0.02}{0.18} \approx 0.11 \)
- Computer Science: \( \frac{0.08}{0.18} \approx 0.44 \)
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( \frac{0.08}{0.18} \approx 0.44 \)

So, the final probabilities for these fields, given the personality sketch, are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.11,
  "computer science": 0.44,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.44
}
