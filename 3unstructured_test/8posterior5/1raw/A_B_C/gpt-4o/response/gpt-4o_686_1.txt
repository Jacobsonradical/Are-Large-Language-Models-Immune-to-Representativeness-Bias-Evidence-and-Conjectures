To solve this problem using Bayes' Rule, we need to use the given probabilities:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in the field.

Finally, we use Bayes' Rule to calculate:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the information from the prompt, let’s make some educated guesses on the probabilities:

### Computer Science
1. **P(H)**: Given that computer science is a popular field among graduate students, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
2. **P(E|H)**: Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts may suit computer science, but his strong empathy and love for nature and animals don’t strongly align. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Let's assume the probability of having those same characteristics if Adam is not in Computer Science is moderate. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)**: Business administration is relatively common among graduate students as well. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
2. **P(E|H)**: Adam’s personality traits do not strongly align with typical traits for business administration students. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.05 \).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H)**: This field is less common in comparison to others. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).
2. **P(E|H)**: Adam’s love for nature, empathy, and animals strongly aligns with this field. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

Now, we calculate \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For simplicity, we'll assume \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) \approx 0.85 \) (thus simplifying the math as well).

Now, let's calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

### Computer Science
\[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.2 + 0.1 \cdot (1 - 0.2) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.08 = 0.12 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.12} =  \frac{0.04}{0.12} = 0.3333 \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(E) = 0.05 \cdot 0.15 + 0.1 \cdot (1 - 0.15) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.0075 + 0.085 = 0.0925 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.15}{0.0925} = \frac{0.0075}{0.0925} = 0.0811 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.1 \cdot (1 - 0.05) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.095 = 0.135 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.135} = \frac{0.04}{0.135} = 0.2963 \]

So the final probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3333,
  "business administration": 0.0811,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.2963
}
```

These values are rough estimates based on assumed probabilities and could be fine-tuned with more precise data.
