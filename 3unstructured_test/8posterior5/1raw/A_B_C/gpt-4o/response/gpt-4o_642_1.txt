To solve this problem using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in each field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in the specific field.
4. \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in each field given his personality sketch.

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be computed as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

For simplicity, let's assume that the probability of Adam being enrolled in each field before knowing his personality sketch is equally likely (i.e., \( P(H) = 1/3 \)). We'll also assume that the probability of Adam not being enrolled in a specific field (\( \neg H \)) to be \( 2/3 \).

Now we need to estimate \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \):

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and love for animals, it is very likely that he is enrolled in this field.

   - \( P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) \approx 0.9 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agri}}) \approx 0.2 \) (since not all other fields will fit his personality as closely)

2. **Computer Science**: Adam's problem-solving skills and high intelligence could fit computer science, but his empathy and love for nature and animals are less directly relevant.

   - \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \approx 0.5 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}}) \approx 0.4 \) 

3. **Business Administration**: This field is less likely to require strong empathy, love for nature and animals, making it less of a fit for Adam.

   - \( P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) \approx 0.2 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{ba}}) \approx 0.5 \)

Given these assumptions, we can use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probabilities:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's compute the denominator \( P(E) \) for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{agri}})P(H_{\text{agri}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{agri}})P(\neg H_{\text{agri}}) \]
   \[ P(E) = (0.9 \times \frac{1}{3}) + (0.2 \times \frac{2}{3}) = 0.3 + 0.133 = 0.433 \]

   Then,
   \[ P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) = \frac{0.9 \times \frac{1}{3}}{0.433} = \frac{0.3}{0.433} \approx 0.692 \]

2. **Computer Science**:
   \[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{cs}})P(H_{\text{cs}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}})P(\neg H_{\text{cs}}) \]
   \[ P(E) = (0.5 \times \frac{1}{3}) + (0.4 \times \frac{2}{3}) = 0.167 + 0.267 = 0.433 \]

   Then,
   \[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{0.5 \times \frac{1}{3}}{0.433} = \frac{0.167}{0.433} \approx 0.385 \]

3. **Business Administration**:
   \[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{ba}})P(H_{\text{ba}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{ba}})P(\neg H_{\text{ba}}) \]
   \[ P(E) = (0.2 \times \frac{1}{3}) + (0.5 \times \frac{2}{3}) = 0.067 + 0.333 = 0.4 \]

   Then,
   \[ P(H_{\text{ba}}|E) = \frac{0.2 \times \frac{1}{3}}{0.4} = \frac{0.067}{0.4} \approx 0.167 \]

Consolidating these results, we get:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.692,
  "computer science": 0.385,
  "business administration": 0.167
}
