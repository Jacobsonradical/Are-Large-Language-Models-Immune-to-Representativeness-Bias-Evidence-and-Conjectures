Sure, let's consider each field and apply Bayes' rule to compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in each field given his personality sketch.

### Step 1: Estimate Prior Probabilities, P(H)
- **Agricultural and veterinary science**: Considering Adam's interests in nature and animals, the prior probability \( P(H) \) that he is in this field might be relatively higher.
- **Computer science**: Given Adam's intelligence and enjoyment of puzzles, we can assign a moderate prior probability.
- **Business administration**: This field does not closely align with the characteristics described, so we assign a lower prior probability.

### Step 2: Estimate Likelihood, P(E|H)
- **Agricultural and veterinary science**: Considering Adam's characteristics, it's quite likely that someone like him would fit well in this field.
- **Computer science**: While not directly related to nature, his intelligence and interest in puzzles fit well with computer science.
- **Business administration**: The characteristics described are less relevant to this field, so the likelihood is lower.

### Step 3: Estimate Complementary Likelihood, P(E|¬H)
- For all fields, this is the likelihood that someone not in the field would have Adam's characteristics. Since there are many fields and Adam's characteristics are somewhat specific to certain fields, we could consider this generally low for fields outside his likely interests.

### Step 4: Compute Posterior Probabilities, P(H|E)
Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{ P(E|H) \cdot P(H) }{ P(E) } \]

We assume \( P(E) \) is constant for all fields since we are not given specific values. Therefore, we will compare the values relative to each other without normalizing.

Let's denote raw scores to compare:

Given Reasoning:
\{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": P(H) = 0.4, P(E|H) = 0.9, P(E|\neg H) = 0.1, so (P(H|E) ∝ 0.4 * 0.9) = 0.36,
  "computer science": P(H) = 0.3, P(E|H) = 0.7, P(E|\neg H) = 0.1, so (P(H|E) ∝ 0.3 * 0.7) = 0.21,
  "business administration": P(H) = 0.1, P(E|H) = 0.2, P(E|\neg H) = 0.1, so (P(H|E) ∝ 0.1 * 0.2) = 0.02
\}

Therefore, normalizing these relative scores would yield the final probabilities.

Here are the estimated probabilities:

\{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.36 / (0.36 + 0.21 + 0.02) ≈ 0.59,
  "computer science": 0.21 / (0.36 + 0.21 + 0.02) ≈ 0.34,
  "business administration": 0.02 / (0.36 + 0.21 + 0.02) ≈ 0.03
\}

After normalization, the probabilities remain between 0 and 1:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.59,
  "computer science": 0.34,
  "business administration": 0.03
}
