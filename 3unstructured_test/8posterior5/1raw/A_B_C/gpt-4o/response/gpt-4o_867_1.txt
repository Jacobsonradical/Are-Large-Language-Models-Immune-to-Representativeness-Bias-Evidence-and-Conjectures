Sure, let's approach this using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll estimate the probabilities for each of these graduate fields.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that a graduate student is in this field. Let's assume around 10% of graduates are in this field.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is in this field. Since his traits align closely with this field (curiosity about nature, love for animals), assign this a high probability, say 0.8.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in this field. Assume around 0.2 since his traits could apply to other fields too, but not strongly.

### Computer Science
- **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that a graduate student is in this field. Let's assume around 20% (since this field is popular).
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is in this field. Since he enjoys solving puzzles and is intelligent, but no direct link to nature or animals, assign this a lower probability, say 0.3.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Assume around 0.2 as before.

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that a graduate student is in this field, let's say 15%.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is in this field. Given the traits do not align closely with business (not typically involving nature, animals), assign a lower probability, say 0.2.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Assume around 0.2 as before.

Now, compute \(P(H|E)\) for each field using these values.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.08}{P(E)} \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.06}{P(E)} \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} = \frac{0.03}{P(E)} \]

### Normalize these values (since these ratios directly compare the relative likelihoods given E)
\[
\text{Normalization factor} = 0.08 + 0.06 + 0.03 = 0.17
\]

### Final Probabilities
\[
P(H|E, \text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) = \frac{0.08}{0.17} \approx 0.47
\]
\[
P(H|E, \text{Computer Science}) = \frac{0.06}{0.17} \approx 0.35
\]
\[
P(H|E, \text{Business Administration}) = \frac{0.03}{0.17} \approx 0.18
\]

Thus, the results are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.47,
  "computer science": 0.35,
  "business administration": 0.18
}
