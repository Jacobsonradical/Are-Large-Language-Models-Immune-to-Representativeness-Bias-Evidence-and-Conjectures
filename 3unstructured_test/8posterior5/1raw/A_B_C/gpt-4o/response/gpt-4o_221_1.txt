To compute \( P(H \mid E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to express it as follows:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E \mid H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of the personality sketch, which is constant across all fields for comparison and thus cancels out when comparing relative probabilities.

Now we'll assess the values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E \mid H) \), and \( P(E \mid \neg H) \) for each field.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - \( P(H) \): The natural curiosity about nature and plants, deep love for animals, and appreciation for hard work suggest a higher likelihood. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
    - \( P(E \mid H) \): Given the characteristics match well, \( P(E \mid H) \) can be assumed to be high, let's say 0.9.
    - \( P(E \mid \neg H) \): The characteristics are less likely outside of this field, so maybe \( P(E \mid \neg H) = 0.4 \).

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

2. **Computer Science**:
    - \( P(H) \): High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts fit, but less emphasis on nature and animals. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
    - \( P(E \mid H) \): Moderate match, so \( P(E \mid H) = 0.5 \).
    - \( P(E \mid \neg H) \): Less likely outside this field, so maybe \( P(E \mid \neg H) = 0.4 \).

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \]

3. **Business Administration**:
    - \( P(H) \): Traits less directly aligned, though empathy and understanding hard work might fit. Assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
    - \( P(E \mid H) \): Moderate match, \( P(E \mid H) = 0.3 \).
    - \( P(E \mid \neg H) \): Even less relevant, so \( P(E \mid \neg H) = 0.3 \).

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

Now, to create a normalized comparison of relative likelihoods among these fields, we'll assume \( P(E) \) is constant and focus on the numerators:

\[
P(H \mid E) \text{ for Agricultural and Veterinary Science} = 0.9 \cdot 0.2 = 0.18
\]

\[
P(H \mid E) \text{ for Computer Science} = 0.5 \cdot 0.15 = 0.075
\]

\[
P(H \mid E) \text{ for Business Administration} = 0.3 \cdot 0.1 = 0.03
\]

Finally, normalizing these values by their sum (0.285) to get relative probabilities:

\{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{0.18}{0.285} \approx 0.632 \),
  "computer science": \( \frac{0.075}{0.285} \approx 0.263 \),
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.03}{0.285} \approx 0.105 \)
\}
