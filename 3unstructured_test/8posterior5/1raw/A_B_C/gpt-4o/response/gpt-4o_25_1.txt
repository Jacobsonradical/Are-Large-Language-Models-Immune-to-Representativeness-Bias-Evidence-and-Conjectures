To calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study (computer science, agricultural and veterinary science, and business administration), we need to consider three elements according to Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To simplify our calculation, let's assume that all P(H) values are equal, since we don't have specific prior probabilities. Thus, let's use:

\[ P(H) = 1/3 \]

Next, we need to estimate:
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the evidence given the hypothesis is not true.

And then we use these to compute \( P(H|E) \).

### Computer Science
- **P(H):** 0.33
- **P(E|H):** Low probability; although solving puzzles and high intelligence can fit, empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature are less characteristic of the typical computer science student.
  - Let's approximate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \)
- **P(E|\neg H):** Assuming that non-computer science fields are more likely to encompass Adam's traits.
  - Let's approximate \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.8 \)

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H):** 0.33
- **P(E|H):** High probability; curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy are strongly aligned with this field.
  - Let's approximate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \)
- **P(E|\neg H):** The other fields are less likely to align as well with these characteristics.
  - Let's approximate \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \)

### Business Administration
- **P(H):** 0.33
- **P(E|H):** Low probability; empathy and solving puzzles might fit, but the curiosity about nature and love for animals are less characteristic.
  - Let's approximate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \)
- **P(E|\neg H):** The other fields might still fit better with Adam's personality.
  - Let's approximate \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.7 \)

To find \( P(H|E) \), we use the approximation that \( P(E) \) can be derived from the sum of all \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{CS}})P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}})P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) + P(E|H_{\text{BA}})P(H_{\text{BA}}) \]

### Calculation
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.33) + (0.9 \cdot 0.33) + (0.3 \cdot 0.33) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.066 + 0.297 + 0.099 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.462 \]

### Posterior Probabilities
#### Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.33}{0.462} \approx 0.143 \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{AgVet}}|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.33}{0.462} \approx 0.643 \]

#### Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.33}{0.462} \approx 0.214 \]

### Final Answer
