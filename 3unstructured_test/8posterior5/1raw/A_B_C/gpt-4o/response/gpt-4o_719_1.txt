To apply Bayes' Rule to compute \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis \( H \) (field of study), we need the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): Probability of the evidence (personality sketch) given that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of the evidence given that Adam is not enrolled in that specific field.

To compute \( P(H|E) \), we use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for all hypotheses, we can use a simplified form:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

### business administration
1. \( P(H_{BA}) \) (prior probability): Let's assume a prior probability, say 0.1 (since business is a common graduate field but not dominant in this context).
2. \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): The evidence suggests a strong interest in nature, animals, and puzzles, which is less aligned with business administration. Therefore, let's set this low, around 0.05.
3. \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \): This is the probability of the evidence if Adam is not in business administration. It would be relatively high because the evidence aligns more with other technical or science fields. We'll estimate this at around 0.85.

Using these values:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto 0.05 \cdot 0.1 = 0.005 \]

### computer science
1. \( P(H_{CS}) \) (prior probability): Let's assume this is moderate, say 0.3 (computer science is a popular field).
2. \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): The evidence of problem-solving skills and high intelligence fits well with computer science, though the interest in nature and animals is less aligned. So we might set this around 0.4.
3. \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \): This is the probability of the evidence if Adam is not in computer science. Given the sketch, it's moderately high, around 0.7.

Using these values:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto 0.4 \cdot 0.3 = 0.12 \]

### agricultural and veterinary science
1. \( P(H_{AVS}) \) (prior probability): Let's assume this is lower, say 0.1 (a less common field but more aligned with the personality sketch).
2. \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \): The evidence strongly fits with this field given the interest in nature, animals, and empathy. So let's set this high, around 0.8.
3. \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \): This is the probability of the evidence if Adam is not in this field. Given the strong alignment, it's lower, around 0.2.

Using these values:
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]

Combining and normalizing these for comparison:

{
  "business administration": 0.005,
  "computer science": 0.12,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08
}

We can see that the probability (or unnormalized likelihood) is highest for computer science, followed by agricultural and veterinary science.
