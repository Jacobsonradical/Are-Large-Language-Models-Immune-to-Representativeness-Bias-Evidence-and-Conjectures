To calculate the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we'll use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the evidence \( E \), which can be expanded using the law of total probability as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}}) + P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) + P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}}) + \ldots \]

Given that we are dealing with multiple hypotheses, let's assume plausible initial values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \):

- \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration. Let's assume it to be 0.2 (20%).
- \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume it to be 0.1 (10%).
- \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science. Let's assume it to be 0.25 (25%).

Next, let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) for each hypothesis:

- \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \): Adam's personality doesn't strongly align with typical attributes for business administration. Let's estimate it as 0.1.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, and animals aligns well with this field. Let's estimate it as 0.8.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \): Adam's interest in solving puzzles and intelligence fits well within computer science. Let's estimate it as 0.5.

Now, let's calculate the likelihood of \( E \) given \(\neg H\):

- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business administration}}) \): Considering that business administration doesn't strongly attract individuals with Adam's personality sketch, let's estimate it as 0.3.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): Individuals not in this field could still have similar attributes, but less likely. Let's estimate it as 0.4.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{computer science}}) \): Given the abstract problem-solving skills, this might be somewhat aligned but lower. Let's assume it to be 0.4.

We can now estimate the posterior probabilities, \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}})}{P(E)} \]

Using the values:

\[
P(E) \approx P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}}) + P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) + P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}})
\]

\[
P(E) \approx (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.5 \cdot 0.25) = 0.02 + 0.08 + 0.125 = 0.225
\]

Now, calculating each \( P(H|E) \):

\[
P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.225} = \frac{0.02}{0.225} \approx 0.089
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.225} = \frac{0.08}{0.225} \approx 0.356
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) \approx \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.25}{0.225} = \frac{0.125}{0.225} \approx 0.556
\]

Thus, the calculated posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) are:

{
  "business administration": "0.089",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.356",
  "computer science": "0.556"
}
