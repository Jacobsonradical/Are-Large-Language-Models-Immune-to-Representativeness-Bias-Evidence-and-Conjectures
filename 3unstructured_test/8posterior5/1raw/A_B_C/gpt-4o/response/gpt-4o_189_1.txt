To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch \( E \), we'll use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Estimate \( P(H) \)**: The base rate probability that any graduate student is enrolled in a particular field.
2. **Estimate \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability that a student in that field would have the personality sketch \( E \).
3. **Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability that a student not in that field would have the personality sketch \( E \).

We'll assume \( P(E) \) to remain constant across fields for normalization purposes.

### Field: Business Administration

**Estimates**:
- \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): Let's assume the base rate probability of students in business administration programs is \( 0.15 \).
- \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): The probability that a business administration student has the personality traits described. Given Adam's traits align more with empathy, animals, and curiosity about nature rather than business, let's estimate this as \( 0.05 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \): The probability that a non-business administration student has these traits. Considering a broader percentage might have a curiosity about nature, let's estimate this as \( 0.2 \).

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \approx \frac{0.05 \times 0.15}{0.2} = 0.0375 \]

### Field: Agricultural and Veterinary Science

**Estimates**:
- \( P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) \): Let's assume the base rate probability for agricultural and veterinary science is \( 0.05 \).
- \( P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \): The probability that a student in this field has these traits is likely very high, given the love for animals and nature. Let's estimate this as \( 0.9 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AgVet}}) \): The same broader non-agricultural base, let's keep this at \( 0.2 \).

\[ P(H_{\text{AgVet}}|E) \approx \frac{0.9 \times 0.05}{0.2} = 0.225 \]

### Field: Computer Science

**Estimates**:
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): Let's assume the probability that a student is in computer science is \( 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): Someone in computer science might have traits like puzzle-solving and high intelligence. Given the overlap with some of Adam's traits but not others, let's estimate this as \( 0.3 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \): Keeping this as \( 0.2 \).

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{0.2} = 0.3 \]

### Summary

Here are the results:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0375,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.225,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

Each probability is contingent upon the estimates and assumptions used. These values indicate the relative likelihoods without summing to 1, taking into account the other possible fields of specialization.
