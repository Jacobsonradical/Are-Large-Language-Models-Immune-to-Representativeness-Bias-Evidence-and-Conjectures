Let's break this down step-by-step using Bayes' Theorem:

\( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \)

where:

- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch (E).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is in a specific field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the normalizing constant (probability of the evidence).

**Assumptions:**

1. **Prior Probabilities (\( P(H) \))**: We'll assume equal prior probabilities for simplicity, as we don't have specific data otherwise. Hence, for each of the fields, \( P(H) = 1/3 \).

2. **Likelihoods (\( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \))**:
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \): Personality traits related to curiosity, intelligence, and puzzle-solving match moderate well with computer science. However, empathy and love for animals may not be as relevant. Let's assume 0.3.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): This field strongly matches with curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work. Let's assume 0.7.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \): Traits such as intelligence and understanding of concepts apply, but less directly match curiosity about nature and animals. Let's assume 0.2.

   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): This would generally be the summation of probabilities for all other fields, simplified here due to lack of precise data. Let's assume:

     - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{computer science}}) = \frac{(0.7 + 0.2)}{2} = 0.45 \)
     - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = \frac{(0.3 + 0.2)}{2} = 0.25 \)
     - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business administration}}) = \frac{(0.3 + 0.7)}{2} = 0.5 \)

3. **Normalizing constant (\( P(E) \))**: Required for Bayesian computation, but here we express as relative likelihoods which simplify it out.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**:

- \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}})}{P(E)} \)
- \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})}{P(E)} \)
- \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}})}{P(E)} \)

Given the prior probabilities of 1/3 each and dropping out the normalizing constant \( P(E) \):

Relative likelihood:

- \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) \propto 0.3 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 0.1 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) \propto 0.7 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 0.233 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) \propto 0.2 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 0.0667 \)

Normalizing so they sum to 1, we get:

- \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.1 + 0.233 + 0.0667} = \frac{0.1}{0.3997} \approx 0.250 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{0.233}{0.3997} \approx 0.583 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{0.0667}{0.3997} \approx 0.167 \)

Thus, we have the results:

{
  "computer science": 0.250,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.583,
  "business administration": 0.167
}
