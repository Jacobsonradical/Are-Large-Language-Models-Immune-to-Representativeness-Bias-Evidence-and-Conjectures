Sure, let's start by defining and estimating the required probabilities for each hypothesis \( H \):

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1)**
2. **Computer Science (H2)**
3. **Business Administration (H3)**

### Probabilities

#### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

- **P(H1)**: Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Let's assume a moderate value since this fits well with his interest in nature and animals, perhaps \(0.2\).

- **P(E|H1)**: The probability of observing personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given his interests and traits, this is quite high, let's say \(0.8\).

- **P(E|\neg H1)**: The probability of observing personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam is **not** enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. This is less likely, but not impossible, let's assume \(0.4\).

#### 2. Computer Science:

- **P(H2)**: Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Computer Science. Given the popularity of the discipline and the fact he enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, let's assign \(0.3\).

- **P(E|H2)**: The probability of observing personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam is enrolled in Computer Science. Given his logical and puzzle-solving skills but weaker fit with nature and animal interests, maybe \(0.6\).

- **P(E|\neg H2)**: The probability of observing personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam is **not** enrolled in Computer Science. The probability could be the same as for Agricultural and Veterinary Science, \(0.4\).

#### 3. Business Administration:

- **P(H3)**: Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration. This doesn't fit as well, let's assume \(0.1\).

- **P(E|H3)**: The probability of observing personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration. This is less likely given his interests, so \(0.3\).

- **P(E|\neg H3)**: The probability of observing personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam is **not** enrolled in Business Administration. This could be higher since Business Administration doesn't strongly align with his described traits, maybe \(0.5\).

### Applying Bayes' Rule:

Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1) + P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2) + P(E|H3) \cdot P(H3) + P(E|\neg H1 \cup \neg H2 \cup \neg H3) \cdot P(\neg H1 \cup \neg H2 \cup \neg H3) \]

For simplification, assume \( P(\neg H1 \cup \neg H2 \cup \neg H3) = 1 - (P(H1) + P(H2) + P(H3)) = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4 \).

Let's calculate \(P(E)\):

\[ P(E) = 0.8 * 0.2 + 0.6 * 0.3 + 0.3 * 0.1 + 0.4 * 0.4 \]

\[ P(E) = 0.16 + 0.18 + 0.03 + 0.16 = 0.53 \]

Now calculate each posterior probability:

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{0.53} = \frac{0.16}{0.53} \approx 0.30 \]

#### Computer Science:
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.3}{0.53} = \frac{0.18}{0.53} \approx 0.34 \]

#### Business Administration:
\[ P(H3|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.53} = \frac{0.03}{0.53} \approx 0.06 \]

### Final Results:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.30,
  "computer science": 0.34,
  "business administration": 0.06
}
```
These values provide the posterior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field given his personality sketch \(E\).
