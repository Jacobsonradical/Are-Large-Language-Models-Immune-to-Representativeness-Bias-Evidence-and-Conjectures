To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study using Bayes' theorem, we need to estimate the following:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in the given field.

We then use these values to compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule: 

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for all fields, we can compare their relative values without knowing \( P(E) \).

### Computer Science

- \( P(H) \): The overall prior probability a graduate student might be enrolled in computer science could be moderate, let's say around 0.2.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability that a computer science student has Adam's personality traits (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, understanding abstract concepts) is relatively lower, let's say around 0.1.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability that a student not enrolled in computer science has these traits could be higher, let's say 0.4 because it encompasses a wider range of fields.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability a graduate student might be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science might be lower, let's estimate around 0.1.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability that a student in this field has Adam's traits is quite high, let's use 0.8.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability that other students have these traits might be lower, let's say 0.3.

### Business Administration

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability a graduate student might be enrolled in business administration could be quite high, let's estimate around 0.3.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability that a business administration student has Adam's traits is low, let's use 0.05.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability for other fields might be somewhat moderate, let's say 0.35.

Let's normalize these values to get a sense of relative probabilities:

1. For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

2. For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]

3. For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.05 \cdot 0.3 = 0.015 \]

Now let's compare these relative probabilities. To better see the proportions, we can divide each by the sum of the calculated values:

Sum = \( 0.02 + 0.08 + 0.015 = 0.115 \)

Normalized probabilities:
1. Computer Science:
\[ \frac{0.02}{0.115} \approx 0.174 \]

2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ \frac{0.08}{0.115} \approx 0.696 \]

3. Business Administration:
\[ \frac{0.015}{0.115} \approx 0.130 \]

So the probabilities are approximately:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.174,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.696,
  "business administration": 0.130
}
```

These values reflect the estimation we made based on Adam's personality sketch and the likelihood of each respective field given his traits.
