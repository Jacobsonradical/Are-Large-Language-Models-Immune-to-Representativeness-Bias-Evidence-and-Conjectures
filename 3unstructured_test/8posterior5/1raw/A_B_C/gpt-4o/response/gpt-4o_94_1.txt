In order to apply Bayes' theorem, we need to use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence E given the hypothesis H.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of observing the evidence E, computed as \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Although we don't have exact statistical data, we can make reasonable qualitative assessments for these probabilities.

We make the following assumptions:

1. **P(H)**: This represents the prior likelihood that Adam was enrolled in a particular field. We assume a general equality, given no specific context:
   - Let's denote each **P(H)** for the three fields at 0.33 (since other fields exist, we distribute it equally for this calculation).

2. **P(E|H)**: This represents the likelihood of observing evidence E given H.
   - For Agricultural and Veterinary Science, Adam's interests and personality traits align strongly.
   - For Computer Science, his intelligence and puzzle-solving skills fit, but his empathy and love for nature might not be fully represented.
   - For Business Administration, his traits of empathy and understanding nature seem less relevant.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: This represents the probability of observing evidence E given that H is not true.
   - We roughly consider the broader implications and general student fitting scenarios.

For simplicity in this analysis, let's use the following qualitative approximations:

\[ P(E|H_{\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}}) = 0.7 \]
\[ P(E|H_{\text{Computer Science}}) = 0.5 \]
\[ P(E|H_{\text{Business Administration}}) = 0.2 \]

\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}}) = 0.2 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{Computer Science}}) = 0.3 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{Business Administration}}) = 0.5 \]

Given the above categorical evaluations, let's calculate \( P(H|E) \):

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H) = 0.33 \]
\[ P(E|H) = 0.7 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \]

\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.33) + (0.2 \cdot 0.67) = 0.231 + 0.134 = 0.365 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.33}{0.365} \approx 0.632 \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(H) = 0.33 \]
\[ P(E|H) = 0.5 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \]

\[ P(E) = (0.5 \cdot 0.33) + (0.3 \cdot 0.67) = 0.165 + 0.201 = 0.366 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{Computer Science}} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.33}{0.366} \approx 0.45 \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(H) = 0.33 \]
\[ P(E|H) = 0.2 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \]

\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.33) + (0.5 \cdot 0.67) = 0.066 + 0.335 = 0.401 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{Business Administration}} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.33}{0.401} \approx 0.165 \]

So, the results are:

{
  "business administration": 0.165,
  "computer science": 0.45,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.632
}

These calculations suggest that based on the given personality sketch, it is most likely that Adam was enrolled in "Agricultural and Veterinary Science" in 2021.
