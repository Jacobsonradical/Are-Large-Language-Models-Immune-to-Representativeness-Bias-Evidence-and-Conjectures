To calculate the probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each of the given fields, we'll use Bayes' theorem which is formulated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For comparative purposes, it's sufficient to consider the relative values of \(P(H|E)\) for each field, rather than their absolute sum.

First, we make an initial assessment of the prior probability \(P(H)\) for each field. Then, we estimate the likelihood \(P(E|H)\) which is the probability of observing Adam's personality (E) given that he is in each field. We also estimate \(P(E|\neg H)\), which is the probability of observing Adam's personality given that he is not in each field.

To simplify, assume \(P(E)\) (the total probability of observing Adam's personality across all potential fields) is a constant denominator in all fields and will cancel out in our comparative assessment.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \(P(H):\) Likelihood of a graduate student being in Agricultural and Veterinary Science: assuming it is not one of the most common fields, let’s assign a moderate value. 
  - Say \(P(H) = 0.15\).

- \(P(E|H):\) High match with Adam's characteristics (love for nature, plants, and animals):
  - Say \(P(E|H) = 0.8\).

- \(P(E|\neg H):\) Sort of the average of how likely personality E could be observed if not in this field:
  - Say \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.2\).

### Computer Science
- \(P(H):\) Likelihood of a graduate student being in Computer Science: higher due to popularity.
  - Say \(P(H) = 0.30\).

- \(P(E|H):\) Moderate match with Adam's characteristics (enjoys solving puzzles, high intelligence):
  - Say \(P(E|H) = 0.4\).

- \(P(E|\neg H):\) Similar to above:
  - Say \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.3\).

### Business Administration
- \(P(H):\) Likelihood of a graduate student being in Business Administration: moderate to high.
  - Say \(P(H) = 0.25\).

- \(P(E|H):\) Lower match with Adam's characteristics (less emphasis on nature, animals, etc.):
  - Say \(P(E|H) = 0.2\).

- \(P(E|\neg H):\) Assumed similar average:
  - Say \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.3\).

### Calculations
Using Bayes' theorem:

- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
  \[
  P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \times 0.15 = 0.12
  \]

- For Computer Science:
  \[
  P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.4 \times 0.30 = 0.12
  \]

- For Business Administration:
  \[
  P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \times 0.25 = 0.05
  \]

Finally, we normalize them for comparative purposes:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.12,
  "computer science": 0.12,
  "business administration": 0.05
}

Given these approximations and understanding of Adam’s personality, he is equally likely to be in Agricultural and Veterinary Science or Computer Science, and less likely to be in Business Administration.
