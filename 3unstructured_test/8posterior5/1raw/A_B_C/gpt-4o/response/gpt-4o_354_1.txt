To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We can break down the problem using the following steps:

1. **Estimate \( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the given field.
2. **Estimate \( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood that Adam's characteristics match given that he is in the specified field.
3. **Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The likelihood that Adam's characteristics match any field other than the specified one.
4. **Normalize**: Using Bayes' Rule to calculate \( P(H|E) \).

Given the nature of Adam's interests and characteristics, we can make reasonable estimates:

### Computer Science
- \( P(H) \): Moderate, since Computer Science is a popular graduate field, but might not be the best fit given Adam's interest in nature, animals, and empathy. Let's estimate it at 0.2.
- \( P(E|H) \): Lower for Computer Science, given the emphasis on abstract concepts in CS but less on nature and animals. Let’s estimate it at 0.2.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Higher, as most other fields might better match Adam's interests. Let’s estimate it at 0.8.

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.2 \times 0.2 / 0.8 = \frac{0.04}{0.8} = 0.05 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): Lower overall number of students in this field, but it fits Adam's interests well. Let’s estimate it at 0.1.
- \( P(E|H) \): Very high, since Adam's characteristics strongly match this field. Let’s estimate it at 0.9.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Lower, since Adam's characteristics fit better with this specific field. Let’s estimate it at 0.2.

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.9 / 0.2 = \frac{0.09}{0.2} = 0.45 \]

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): Moderate, as Business Administration is a common graduate field. Let’s estimate it at 0.2.
- \( P(E|H) \): Low, since Adam's characteristics do not strongly align with typical business administration interests. Let’s estimate it at 0.1.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Higher, since Adam's characteristics fit other fields better. Let’s estimate it at 0.8.

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.2 \times 0.1 / 0.8 = \frac{0.02}{0.8} = 0.025 \]

Combining these results, we get:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.45,
  "business administration": 0.025
}
