To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis \( H \) (agricultural and veterinary science, business administration, computer science), we need to use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of each field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given the field \( H \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of \( E \) given not \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the personality sketch \( E \).

For simplicity, we'll assume that the priors \( P(H) \) are equally likely among the given fields. Therefore, \( P(H) = \frac{1}{3} \) for each. We will also assume \( P(E|\neg H) \) considers the personality sketch across other disciplines not listed here.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
#### Estimations:
- **\( P(H) \)**: Since we're assuming equal priors, \( P(H) = \frac{1}{3} \).
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: The personality sketch strongly aligns with attributes related to agricultural and veterinary science (interest in nature, plants, animals). This probability is reasonably high, say \( 0.8 \).
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Given that the sketch is specific to nature and animals, the likelihood of these traits appearing in students from non-related fields can be lower, let's assume \( 0.2 \).

### Business Administration
#### Estimations:
- **\( P(H) \)**: \( P(H) = \frac{1}{3} \).
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: The personality sketch is not particularly indicative of traits necessary or highly relevant to business administration (not focused on abstract concepts, empathy, etc.)—low probability, say \( 0.2 \).
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Many other disciplines also do not strongly align with these traits; assume \( 0.4 \).

### Computer Science
#### Estimations:
- **\( P(H) \)**: \( P(H) = \frac{1}{3} \).
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: Interest in puzzles and abstract concepts align somewhat with computer science, but there is less here about nature and animals—moderate probability, say \( 0.5 \).
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Similar considerations to above—assume \( 0.5 \).

### Calculations:
To calculate \( P(H|E) \):

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{P(E)} \]
2. **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{P(E)} \]
3. **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.5 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{P(E)} \]

### Normalize:
The probabilities should be normalized, but since ratios should suffice:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{agric}) \cdot P(H_{agric}) + P(E|H_{business}) \cdot P(H_{business}) + P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot \frac{1}{3}) + (0.2 \cdot \frac{1}{3}) + (0.5 \cdot \frac{1}{3}) = \frac{0.8 + 0.2 + 0.5}{3} = \frac{1.5}{3} = 0.5 \]

Thus:
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.5} = \frac{0.2667}{0.5} = 0.5333 \]

2. **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.5} = \frac{0.0667}{0.5} = 0.1333 \]

3. **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.5} = \frac{0.1667}{0.5} = 0.3333 \]

Final answers:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.5333",
  "business administration": "0.1333",
  "computer science": "0.3333"
