To address this problem, let's start by evaluating the probabilities for Adam being enrolled in each of the given fields based on the described personality sketch \( E \).

1. **Prior Probability: \( P(H) \)**

Without specific information about the distribution of graduate students among different fields, we'll assume equal priors for simplicity:
\[ P(H) = \frac{1}{N} \]
where \( N \) is the number of hypotheses (3 in this case). So,
\[ P(H) = \frac{1}{3} = 0.33 \]

2. **Likelihood: \( P(E|H) \)**

- **Computer Science:**
  - Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts align with this field.
  - His empathy, love for nature, and animals make it less fitting.
  - \( P(E|\text{Computer Science}) \) might reflect only part of his personality traits, thus moderate:
  - \( P(E|\text{Computer Science}) = 0.4 \)

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
  - Strong alignment with Adamâ€™s genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work.
  - Most closely matches his personality sketch.
  - \( P(E|\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) = 0.9 \)

- **Business Administration:**
  - Adam's traits like empathy and understanding abstract concepts have modest relevance here.
  - Traits like deep love for nature and animals are less fitting for this field.
  - \( P(E|\text{Business Administration}) = 0.2 \)

3. **Complementary Likelihood: \( P(E|\neg H) \)**

- Since there are many other fields apart from the three given, evaluating \( P(E|\neg H) \) might be complex:
  - Assume here it reflects the general match of his traits across other fields, which might moderately correspond:
  - \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \) (a balancing value, reasonable given the variance of fields).

Now we can use Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H)) \).

Calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

- **Computer Science:**
  \[ P(E|\text{Computer Science}) = 0.4, \, P(H) = 0.33 \]
  \[ P(E) = 0.4 \cdot 0.33 + 0.5 \cdot 0.67 \approx 0.46 \]
  \[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.33}{0.46} \approx 0.29 \]

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
  \[ P(E|\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) = 0.9, \, P(H) = 0.33 \]
  \[ P(E) = 0.9 \cdot 0.33 + 0.5 \cdot 0.67 \approx 0.6 \]
  \[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.33}{0.6} \approx 0.50 \]

- **Business Administration:**
  \[ P(E|\text{Business Administration}) = 0.2, \, P(H) = 0.33 \]
  \[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.33 + 0.5 \cdot 0.67 \approx 0.40 \]
  \[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.33}{0.40} \approx 0.17 \]

Combining results:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.29,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.50,
  "business administration": 0.17
}
