To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' theorem, we need to estimate the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam having the personality sketch \( E \) given that he is enrolled in the field \( H \).
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam having the personality sketch \( E \) given that he is not enrolled in the field \( H \).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assuming that the overall proportion of graduate students in these fields mirrors some general distribution:
- Computer science: roughly 25%
- Agricultural and veterinary science: 10%
- Business administration: 15%

Based on Adam's personality sketch, reviewing his traits and their relevance to each field, we'll qualitatively evaluate \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

1. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.25 \)
   - \( P(E|H) \) should be low to moderate. While intelligence and puzzle-solving align, empathy and love for nature are less directly related.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \) is probably moderate as these traits are more common outside computer science.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.10 \)
   - \( P(E|H) \) should be high. The personality traits strongly match someone in this field.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \) is likely lower because those outside this field are less likely to have this particular mix of strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature.

3. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.15 \)
   - \( P(E|H) \) should be low. Traits like strong empathy and a deep love for animals/nature are less characteristic.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \) is likely higher than in agricultural science but lower than in computer science.

Let's make some rough numerical estimates:

For **Computer Science**:
- \( P(H = \text{CS}) = 0.25 \)
- \( P(E|\text{CS}) \approx 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|\neg \text{CS}) \approx 0.3 \)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.25}{0.2 \times 0.25 + 0.3 \times 0.75} = \frac{0.05}{0.275} \approx 0.18 \]

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
- \( P(H = \text{AVS}) = 0.10 \)
- \( P(E|\text{AVS}) \approx 0.8 \)
- \( P(E|\neg \text{AVS}) \approx 0.2 \)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.8 \times 0.1 + 0.2 \times 0.9} = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \approx 0.31 \]

For **Business Administration**:
- \( P(H = \text{BA}) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(E|\text{BA}) \approx 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|\neg \text{BA}) \approx 0.4 \)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.15}{0.1 \times 0.15 + 0.4 \times 0.85} = \frac{0.015}{0.355} \approx 0.04 \]

Thus, the estimates for \( P(H|E) \) are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.18,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.31,
  "business administration": 0.04
}
```

Note: These are rough estimates and not precise calculations. They are informed by qualitative reasoning about the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) and the distribution of graduate student fields.
