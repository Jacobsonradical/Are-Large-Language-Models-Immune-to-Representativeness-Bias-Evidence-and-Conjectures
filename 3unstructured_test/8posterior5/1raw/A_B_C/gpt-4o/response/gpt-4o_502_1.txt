To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to calculate the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the normalization factor involving the marginal likelihood.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assumptions:
1. We don't have precise prior probabilities, so we will assume equal priors for simplicity.
2. The personality sketch E significantly matches some fields more than others, affecting \( P(E|H) \).

### Hypothesis 1: Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): Let's assume the prior probability \( P(H) \) is roughly equal for all three fields.
- \( P(E|H) \): The sketch E matches poorly for business administration as it doesn't describe traits strongly associated with it. Let's assign a lower likelihood here.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Prior probability of sketch E occurring given Adam is not in business admin. Since there's some overlap in traits like intelligence, it could be moderately high.

### Hypothesis 2: Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): Same equal prior probability assumption.
- \( P(E|H) \): The traits in the sketch E (love for nature, plants, animals, empathy) strongly fit this field, so we assign a higher likelihood.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): While sketch E might still arise under other fields, the specificity to agricultural and veterinary sciences should make this lower compared to \( P(E|H) \).

### Hypothesis 3: Computer Science
- \( P(H) \): Same equal prior probability assumption.
- \( P(E|H) \): While abstract thinking and high intelligence fit computer science, other traits like love for nature and animals donâ€™t. We assign a moderate likelihood.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given the sketch E can apply to other fields with intellectual demands, this likelihood might be moderate-high.

### Assigning Values:
- \( P(H) = 1/3 \) for each hypothesis under equal prior assumption.
- \( P(E|H) \) will be low for business administration, high for agricultural and veterinary science, and moderate for computer science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) will reflect the general applicability of traits (medium-high).

### Estimations:
- For the sake of calculation, we can assume rough values for these probabilities.

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.2"
}
```

These estimations are conceptual and based on the fit of the personality sketch against typical associations with each field. The actual calculation would require explicit quantitative probabilities for a precise Bayesian analysis.
