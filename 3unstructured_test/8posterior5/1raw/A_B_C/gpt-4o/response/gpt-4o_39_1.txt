Sure, let's break this down using Bayes' Rule.

Bayes' Rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis is true.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis is false.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of evidence, which can be computed as \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Since this problem requires subjective estimations, I'll make reasonable assumptions based on Adam's personality sketch and the likely fit for each field:

1. **Business Administration**
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
3. **Computer Science**

Let's estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \):

1. **Business Administration**
   - \( P(H) \) (The probability that a random graduate student is in business administration): let's assume \( 0.20 \)
   - \( P(E|H) \) (Given Adam's personality, the probability he is in Business Administration): low, as his interests seem to lean towards nature and empathy rather than business: let's say \( 0.05 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \) (The probability Adam has his personality given he is not in Business Administration): might be higher due to broader fit in other fields: let's assume \( 0.25 \)

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - \( P(H) \): let's assume \( 0.15 \) (not very common but fits his personality closely)
   - \( P(E|H) \): High, as Adam's interests in nature, plants, and animals strongly align: let's say \( 0.80 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): might be lower, as other fields may not fit as closely: let's assume \( 0.10 \)

3. **Computer Science**
   - \( P(H) \): let's assume \( 0.20 \)
   - \( P(E|H) \): Medium, as his intelligence and abstract problem-solving might correlate but not as closely as Veterinary Science: let's say \( 0.30 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Medium, broader fit: let's assume \( 0.20 \)

Now let's compute using Bayes' Rule:

- For **Business Administration**:
\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.20}{P(E)} \]

- For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \]

- For **Computer Science**:
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.30 \cdot 0.20}{P(E)} \]

Let's assume \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|\text{Business Administration}) \cdot P(\text{Business Administration}) + P(E|\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) \cdot P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) + P(E|\text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.05 \cdot 0.20) + (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.30 \cdot 0.20) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.01 + 0.12 + 0.06 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.19 \]

Now calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.20}{0.19} \approx 0.053 \]
\[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.19} \approx 0.632 \]
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.30 \cdot 0.20}{0.19} \approx 0.316 \]

Hence, the final probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.053,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.632,
  "computer science": 0.316
}
```
