Let's break this problem down step-by-step using Bayesian inference.

1. Identify prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field. Since no specific information about the likelihood of Adam being in each field is provided, we will assume they are equal as a prior.
2. Determine \( P(E|H) \): the probability of the evidence (personality sketch) given enrollment in each field.
3. Determine \( P(E|\neg H) \): the probability of the evidence (personality sketch) given enrollment in other fields not under consideration.

Let's assume equal priors:
\[ P(H) = 1/3 \]

Next, let's assess:
\[ P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \]
Adam's curiosity about nature, warm heart, love for animals, and understanding of hard work fit well with this field:
\[ P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.9 \]

\[ P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \]
While Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is good at understanding abstract concepts fitting well in computer science, other traits such as a love for animals and nature curiosity don't align as well:
\[ P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.4 \]

\[ P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \]
Adam’s traits such as empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature don’t strongly align with business administration:
\[ P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.1 \]

\[ P(E|\neg H) \]
This probability considers the evidence given enrollment in other fields not under consideration. Let's assume this is an average of probabilities:
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.47 \]

Now, applying Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) = (P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H) + P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H) + P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H)) \]
Since \(P(H) = 1/3\) for all \(H\),

\[ P(E) = \frac{1}{3}(0.9 + 0.4 + 0.1) = \frac{1.4}{3} \]

Thus:
\[ P(H|E_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{1.4/3} = \frac{0.9}{1.4} \approx 0.643 \] 

\[ P(H|E_{\text{computer science}}) = \frac{0.4 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{1.4/3} = \frac{0.4}{1.4} \approx 0.286 \] 

\[ P(H|E_{\text{business administration}}) = \frac{0.1 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{1.4/3} = \frac{0.1}{1.4} \approx 0.071 \] 

So the final results are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.643,
  "computer science": 0.286,
  "business administration": 0.071
}
