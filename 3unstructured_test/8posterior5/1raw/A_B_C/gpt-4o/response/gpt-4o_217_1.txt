Let's break this down step-by-step using Bayes' theorem:

Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of \( H \) (before knowing \( E \)).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing \( E \) given that \( H \) is true.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing \( E \) given that \( H \) is not true.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing \( E \).

To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Let's assume a moderate prior probability for Adam enrolling in this field based on typical graduate enrollment distributions, say 0.1.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam’s interest in nature, plants, and animals, this probability would be high, say 0.8.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given the specificity of Adam's interests which fit well within agricultural and veterinary science, it could be significantly lower, say 0.2.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Moderate to high prior probability due to the popularity of this field, say 0.2.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given his high intelligence and abstract thinking, but less specific alignment with his love for nature, plants, and animals, this could be lower, say 0.3.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of having such E regardless of field would be about mid-range, say 0.5.

3. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): Similar to computer science, moderate to high prior probability based on common graduate fields, say 0.2.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given that E doesn’t particularly align with typical business interests, this could be lower, say 0.2.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given Adam’s specific interests, this would remain mid-range, say 0.5.

For these calculations, \( P(E) \) would be a constant that normalizes the outcome and doesn't need explicit calculation for comparison among the options.

We can compute \( P(H|E) \) proportionally for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[
   P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08
   \]

2. **Computer Science**:
   \[
   P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.3 \times 0.2 = 0.06
   \]

3. **Business Administration**:
   \[
   P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \times 0.2 = 0.04
   \]

The relative probabilities are as follows:
\[
\text{{agricultural and veterinary science}} = 0.08
\]
\[
\text{{computer science}} = 0.06
\]
\[
\text{{business administration}} = 0.04
\]

Thus, the output would be:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.4
}
```
