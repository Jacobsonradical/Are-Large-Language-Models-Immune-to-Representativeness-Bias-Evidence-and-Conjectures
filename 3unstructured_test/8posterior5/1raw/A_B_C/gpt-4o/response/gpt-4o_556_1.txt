To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we follow these steps:

1. Estimate \( P(H) \): the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field.
2. Estimate \( P(E|H) \): the probability of Adam having the personality traits given that he is enrolled in the field.
3. Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \): the probability of Adam having the personality traits given that he is not enrolled in the field.
4. Use Bayes' rule: \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \)

For simplicity, let's assume \( P(E) \) is constant across all fields and can be ignored when comparing the probabilities.

Let's estimate the quantities for each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): Moderate likelihood, given the number of students enrolled in this field. Let's assume a value of 0.1.
- \( P(E|H) \): High, as the traits line up extremely well with this field (interest in nature, plants, animals). Let's assume a value of 0.8.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Lower than \( P(E|H) \), but let's assume it’s somewhat likely because empathy and love for animals can overlap with other fields. Let's assume a value of 0.2.

### Computer Science
- \( P(H) \): High likelihood due to the popularity of this field. Let's assume a value of 0.3.
- \( P(E|H) \): Moderate, as problem-solving skills are a good match, but there's less direct connection to nature and animals. Let's assume a value of 0.4.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likely higher, as problem-solving and high intelligence apply to many students not in this field. Let's assume a value of 0.4.

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): Also reasonably high due to popularity. Let's assume a value of 0.2.
- \( P(E|H) \): Lower as the traits have less direct connection to this field. Let's assume a value of 0.2.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Higher, as empathy and abstract thinking are useful in many fields. Let's assume a value of 0.5.

Now we compute \( P(H|E) \):

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{P(E)} = 0.08 / P(E) \)

### Computer Science
\( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \times 0.3}{P(E)} = 0.12 / P(E) \)

### Business Administration
\( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \times 0.2}{P(E)} = 0.04 / P(E) \)

In the ratio form:
- We see \( 0.08/P(E) \) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science as baseline.
- \( 0.12/P(E) \) for Computer Science.
- \( 0.04/P(E) \) for Business Administration.

We convert these ratios back to get a proportional scale, where \(P(E)\) is a common constant.

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08,
  "computer science": 0.12,
  "business administration": 0.04
}
```

In sum, given Adam’s personality sketch, he is most likely to be enrolled in Computer Science, followed by Agricultural and Veterinary Science, and least likely in Business Administration.
