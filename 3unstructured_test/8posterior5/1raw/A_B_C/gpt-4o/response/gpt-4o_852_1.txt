To calculate the probability \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis (specific field of study given Adam's personality sketch), we will use Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we aren't given specific values for \( P(H) \) and \( P(E) \), we may consider logical estimates:
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Probability of observing Adam's characteristics given he is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of observing Adam's characteristics given he is NOT enrolled in that field.

### Business Administration:

- **\( P(H) \)**: Business Administration is a common field, so let's say \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

- **\( P(E|H) \)**: The given personality traits don't strongly align with typical traits associated with Business Administration. Adam's empathy, love for animals, and quiet demeanor are less likely to be primary traits for someone in Business Administration. Let's say \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This would be the probability that Adam has these personality traits while not being in Business Administration. Given that these traits are not strongly indicative of Business Administration, let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.9 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

- **\( P(H) \)**: This is a more specialized field, so let's say \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

- **\( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's traits such as a deep love for animals and genuine curiosity about nature fit very well with this field. Let's say \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of having these specific personality traits without being in Agricultural and Veterinary Science might be lower compared to those in the field. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \]

### Computer Science:

- **\( P(H) \)**: Computer Science is relatively widespread, so let's say \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

- **\( P(E|H) \)**: High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying puzzles align fairly well with typical traits for Computer Science. Let's say \( P(E|H) = 0.5 \).

- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of having these traits while not being in Computer Science might be moderate. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.5 \times 0.2 = 0.1 \]


Thus, the final values for each field would be:

{
  "business administration": "0.02",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.08",
  "computer science": "0.1"
