To determine the fields Adam is most likely to have been enrolled in, we can use Bayes' Rule, which is stated as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in the field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of Adam having the personality sketch provided that he was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(H) \) is the probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of having that personality sketch (which is the same for all the fields in comparison but difficult to determine accurately).

For simplicity, we will make educated guesses for these probabilities.

1. **P(H)**: Since these probabilities are relative and there are many possible graduate fields, assume they are common graduate fields.
2. **P(E|H)**: Based on the personality sketch, guess how likely someone in each field would fit the description.

Given that these are guesses and might have personal bias, interpret values cautiously.

### Computer Science
- **P(H)**: Let's assume a reasonably common rate for graduate enrollment in computer science: 0.25.
- **P(E|H)**: High intelligence and affinity for solving puzzles support this field: 0.4.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Personality sketch would be averagely common outside the field: 0.25.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.4 * 0.25}{P(E)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.1}{P(E)} \]

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: Slightly less common for someone with such a specific personality: 0.15.
- **P(E|H)**: Less fitting of the personality, but not impossible: 0.1.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Personality sketch less relevant: 0.25.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.1 * 0.15}{P(E)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.015}{P(E)} \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: A niche but fitting field for such a personality: 0.1.
- **P(E|H)**: Fits very well with empathy for animals and curiosity about plants: 0.5.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Sketch would be somewhat less common outside the field: 0.25.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.5 * 0.1}{P(E)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.05}{P(E)} \]

Now, normalizing these to create relative probabilities, we ignore the exact \(P(E)\).

\[
{
  "computer science": \frac{0.1}{0.1 + 0.015 + 0.05} \approx 0.588,
  "business administration": \frac{0.015}{0.1 + 0.015 + 0.05} \approx 0.088,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \frac{0.05}{0.1 + 0.015 + 0.05} \approx 0.294
}
\]

These values yield a comparative sense of likelihood:

\[
{
  "computer science": 0.588,
  "business administration": 0.088,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.294
}
\]

Note that these values are approximate and based on assumed likelihoods. For more precise results, you would need actual statistical data on graduate field enrollments and typical personality profiles of students in those fields.
