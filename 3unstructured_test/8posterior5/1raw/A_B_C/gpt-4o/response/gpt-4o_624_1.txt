Certainly! To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we'll consider the following:

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in the field.

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

We start by making reasonable estimates for each of these quantities based on the personality sketch provided.

**Computer Science:**
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): Assuming a general prior, let's say 0.15, given the popularity of computer science programs.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): Given the personality sketch emphasizing high intelligence and abstract thinking, assume this to be 0.65.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \): For those not in CS but having such traits, let's estimate 0.3.

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.65 \cdot 0.15}{0.65 \cdot 0.15 + 0.3 \cdot 0.85} \approx \frac{0.0975}{0.0975 + 0.255} \approx \frac{0.0975}{0.3525} \approx 0.276 \]

**Business Administration:**
- \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): Assuming this field is also popular, let's use a prior of 0.1.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): Business administration students may not typically have the deep love for animals or focus on nature, so let’s estimate this as 0.1.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \): Let's estimate the same prior probability for those not in business administration, 0.3.

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.1 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9} \approx \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.27} \approx \frac{0.01}{0.28} \approx 0.0357 \]

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- \( P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) \): Given the specific nature of this field, assume a lower prior, such as 0.05.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \): Given Adam’s love for nature, animals, and high empathy, estimate this as 0.8.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AgVet}}) \): Those not in this field having the traits might be less likely, so let’s say 0.2.

\[ P(H_{\text{AgVet}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.95} \approx \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.19} \approx \frac{0.04}{0.23} \approx 0.1739 \]

Based on these calculations:
{
  "computer science": 0.276,
  "business administration": 0.0357,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.1739
