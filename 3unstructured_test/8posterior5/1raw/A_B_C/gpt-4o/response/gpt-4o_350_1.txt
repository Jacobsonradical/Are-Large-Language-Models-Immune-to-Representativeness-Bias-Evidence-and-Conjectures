To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to determine the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the marginal likelihood \( P(E) \). We won't explicitly compute \( P(E) \) because we are looking at the relative probabilities for the given fields.

Bayes' Rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's assign some sensible estimates for the probabilities. Although these are hypothetical values and not based on actual data, let’s ensure they make logical sense given Adam's personality sketch and the fields.

### Field: Computer Science

- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The general prior probability of someone enrolling in computer science graduate programs. Given the wide interest in this field, let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.4 \).
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This represents how probable the personality sketch \( E \) is for someone in this field. Someone in computer science may have empathy and intelligence, but the focus on nature and love for animals is less consistent. So let's assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \).
- **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This represents how probable the personality sketch is if someone is not in the computer science field. Given Adam's specific interests in nature and animals, we can assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.6 \).

### Field: Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This field is less populated compared to computer science. Assume \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \).
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam’s interests in nature, plants, and animals strongly align with this field. Assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \).
- **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of the personality sketch if not in agricultural and veterinary science would include broad fields. Assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \).

### Field: Business Administration

- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Business administration is a fairly popular graduate field. Assume \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \).
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The personality sketch does not strongly align with typical business administration traits (e.g., curiosity about nature and love for animals). Assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \).
- **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: As before, among fields that are not business administration, the sketch is more likely. Assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.6 \).

Now, we can compute the posterior probabilities using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll ignore the denominator \( P(E) \) since it's a constant factor across all calculations and focus on the numerator for relative comparisons.

1. **Computer Science:**
   \[ P(H|E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \times 0.4 = 0.08 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   \[ P(H|E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.9 \times 0.1 = 0.09 \]

3. **Business Administration:**
   \[ P(H|E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \times 0.3 = 0.03 \]

Combining these, we get the following relative probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.08,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.09,
  "business administration": 0.03
}
```

These values reflect the relative plausibility of Adam being enrolled in each field given his personality sketch, emphasizing that agricultural and veterinary science is the most likely field given his interests and traits.
