Sure, let's evaluate the fields based on the given personality sketch of Adam.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: The probability of being in this field given no other information. Let's assume it's reasonably high due to the general variety of fields, say, 0.1.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given Adam is in agricultural/veterinary science. Given his deep love for animals and curiosity about nature and plants, this seems very fitting. Let's use 0.8.
- **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given Adam is not in this field. This would be lower, as not many other fields would align with his interests and personality to this degree, say, 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant and equal for all fields:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agriculture}} \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: The probability of being in this field given no other information. Let's assume it's fairly common but less likely given the sketch, say, 0.15.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given Adam is in business administration. His personality does not strongly match typical interests in this field, say, 0.1.
- **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given Adam is not in this field. This might vary widely, but let's assume it's moderate, say, 0.5.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{business}} \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.15 = 0.015 \]

### Computer Science
- **P(H)**: The probability of being in this field given no other information. Let’s assume this is fairly high due to the general popularity of the field, say, 0.2.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given Adam is in computer science. His intelligence and puzzle-solving skills fit well, but his love for nature and animals isn’t very characteristic, say, 0.5.
- **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given Adam is not in this field. This could be lower because computer science does attract problem-solvers, say, 0.4.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{cs}} \propto 0.5 \cdot 0.2 = 0.1 \]

Now, normalize these probabilities:

\[
\text{Total} = 0.08 + 0.015 + 0.1 = 0.195 
\]
\[
P(H|E)_{\text{agriculture}} = \frac{0.08}{0.195} \approx 0.41 
\]
\[
P(H|E)_{\text{business}} = \frac{0.015}{0.195} \approx 0.077 
\]
\[
P(H|E)_{\text{cs}} = \frac{0.1}{0.195} \approx 0.51 
\]

So the probabilities are roughly:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.41,
  "business administration": 0.077,
  "computer science": 0.51
}
```
