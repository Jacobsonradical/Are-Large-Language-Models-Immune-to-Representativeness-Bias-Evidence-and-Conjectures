To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each hypothesis \( H \). 

Let's consider each field in turn:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
    - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in this field.
        - Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, this field seems fairly likely. Let's assume \( P(H) \) = 0.10 (10%).
    - \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given that he is enrolled in this field.
        - Adam's traits align closely with this field, so \( P(E|H) \) should be high. Let's assume \( P(E|H) \) = 0.9 (90%).
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in this field.
        - While Adam’s characteristics could fit other fields, they are somewhat aligned with agriculture and veterinary science. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) \) = 0.3 (30%).

    Using Bayes’ rule:
    \[
    P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} 
    \]
    Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

    \[
    P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) = 0.09 + 0.27 = 0.36
    \]

    Therefore,

    \[
    P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{0.36} = \frac{0.09}{0.36} = 0.25
    \]

2. **Business Administration**
    - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in this field.
        - This field seems less likely given Adam's characteristics. Let’s assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \) (5%).
    - \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given that he is enrolled in this field.
        - Adam’s personality traits aren’t strongly aligned with business administration. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \) (20%).
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in this field.
        - This remains the same as before. Let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \) (30%).

    Using Bayes’ rule:

    \[
    P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.05) + (0.3 \cdot 0.95) = 0.01 + 0.285 = 0.295
    \]

    Therefore,

    \[
    P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.05}{0.295} = \frac{0.01}{0.295} \approx 0.0339
    \]

3. **Computer Science**
    - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in this field.
        - Considering Adam’s high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, and interest in puzzles, this field seems plausible. Let’s assume \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15%).
    - \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given that he is enrolled in this field.
        - Adam’s personality sketch aligns reasonably well but not perfectly with computer science. Let’s assume \( P(E|H) = 0.5 \) (50%).
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in this field.
        - This remains the same as before. Let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \) (30%).

    Using Bayes’ rule:

    \[
    P(E) = (0.5 \cdot 0.15) + (0.3 \cdot 0.85) = 0.075 + 0.255 = 0.33
    \]

    Therefore,

    \[
    P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.15}{0.33} = \frac{0.075}{0.33} \approx 0.227
    \]

These calculations yield the following results:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.25,
  "business administration": 0.0339,
  "computer science": 0.227
}
