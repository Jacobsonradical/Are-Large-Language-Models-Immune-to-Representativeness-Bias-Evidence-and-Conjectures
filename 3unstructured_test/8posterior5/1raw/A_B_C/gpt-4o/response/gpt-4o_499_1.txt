To apply Bayes' rule, we need three values for each hypothesis H: the prior probability \(P(H)\), the likelihood \(P(E|H)\), and the probability of the evidence under the negation of the hypothesis \(P(E|\neg H)\). Here, \(E\) is the personality sketch.

First, let's state some assumptions:

1. \(P(H)\): The prior probability of Adam being in each field.
  - Agricultural and veterinary science: Given Adam's deep love for animals and nature, we'll assume a relatively higher prior probability. Let's say \(P(H) = 0.15\).
  - Computer science: Given Adam enjoys solving puzzles and understands abstract concepts well, we'll assume an average prior probability for this field. Let's say \(P(H) = 0.1\).
  - Business administration: Given no strong clues linking Adam directly to business concepts, we'll assume a lower prior probability. Let's say \(P(H) = 0.05\).

2. \(P(E|H)\): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is in that field:
  - Agricultural and veterinary science: Adam's love for animals and nature makes this field very likely. So, let's assume \(P(E|H) = 0.8\).
  - Computer science: His intelligence, love for puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts make it quite likely, but not as much as for the agricultural field. So, letâ€™s assume \(P(E|H) = 0.3\).
  - Business administration: There's little in Adam's personality sketch pointing directly to business admin. Let's assume \(P(E|H) = 0.1\).

3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in that field.
  - Agricultural and veterinary science: Assuming he is not in agricultural and veterinary science, we need to account for the remaining students in other fields exhibiting such traits. Let's say \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.2\).
  - Computer science: Given he is not in computer science, let's assume students in non-computer fields exhibiting such traits at about \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.4\).
  - Business administration: For non-business students, the probability reflecting Adam's traits might be about \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.5\).

Now we can use Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where,
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Since calculating \(P(E)\) exactly would require summing over all possible fields (which we don't need to do for relative probabilities), we compute relative values directly:

**Agricultural and veterinary science:**
\[ P(H|E)_{agriculture} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{(P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1-P(H)))} \]
\[ = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85} \]
\[ = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.17} \]
\[ = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.414 \]

**Computer science:**
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{(P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1-P(H)))} \]
\[ = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.3 \cdot 0.1 + 0.4 \cdot 0.9} \]
\[ = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.36} \]
\[ = \frac{0.03}{0.39} \approx 0.077 \]

**Business administration:**
\[ P(H|E)_{business} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{(P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1-P(H)))} \]
\[ = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.05}{0.1 \cdot 0.05 + 0.5 \cdot 0.95} \]
\[ = \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.475} \]
\[ = \frac{0.005}{0.48} \approx 0.010 \]

So, the results are:
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.414,
  "computer science": 0.077,
  "business administration": 0.010
