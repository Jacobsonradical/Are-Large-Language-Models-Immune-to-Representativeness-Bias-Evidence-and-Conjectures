Sure, I will use a simplified approach to estimate these probabilities. Note that these probabilities are subjective and not based on specific data but on the described personality sketch of Adam.

Let's define:
- \(H_1\): Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \(H_2\): Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \(H_3\): Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \(E\): The personality sketch of Adam.

Let's estimate the probabilities.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **Prior Probability, \(P(H_1)\)**: Let's estimate this as \(0.1\) since it's a relatively less common field among graduate students.
- **Likelihood, \(P(E|H_1)\)**: High given his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy. Let's estimate it as \(0.8\).
- **Probability of Evidence, \(P(E|\neg H_1)\)**: This includes all other fields. Considering he might not fit very well in most of them, let's put \(P(E|\neg H_1)\) at \(0.3\).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.3} \approx 0.267 \]

### Computer Science

- **Prior Probability, \(P(H_2)\)**: Common among graduate students, so let's say \(0.3\).
- **Likelihood, \(P(E|H_2)\)**: Lower because while he is good at solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, the other personality traits don't align well. Let's estimate \(P(E|H_2)\) at \(0.4\).
- **Probability of Evidence, \(P(E|\neg H_2)\)**: Assuming the same \(0.3\).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{0.3} \approx 0.4 \]

### Business Administration

- **Prior Probability, \(P(H_3)\)**: Also common, let's assume \(0.3\).
- **Likelihood, \(P(E|H_3)\)**: Low, as the traits described don't align well with typical business administration interests. Let's say \(0.2\).
- **Probability of Evidence, \(P(E|\neg H_3)\)**: \(0.3\).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_3|E) = \frac{P(E|H_3) \cdot P(H_3)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_3|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{0.3} \approx 0.2 \]

The final probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.267,
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

Again, these values are rough estimates based on subjective analysis. Real probabilities would require more specific data and a more rigorous statistical approach.
