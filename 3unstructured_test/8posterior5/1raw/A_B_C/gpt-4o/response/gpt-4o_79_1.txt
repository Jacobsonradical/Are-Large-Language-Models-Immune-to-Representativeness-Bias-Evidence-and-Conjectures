To deduce the probabilities for each field based on Adam's personality sketch, we'll use Bayes' rule. Let's denote the fields as follows:
- H_cs: Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- H_ba: Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- H_ag: Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

The Bayes' theorem equation we'll use:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, and his empathy, it seems logical that agricultural and veterinary science would have a higher conditional probability, whereas business administration and computer science might not align as closely. 

Assume some typical base rates (prior probabilities \( P(H) \)) for U.S. graduate programs, given their typical popularity:
- P(H_cs) = 0.2 (20% for computer science)
- P(H_ba) = 0.15 (15% for business administration)
- P(H_ag) = 0.10 (10% for agricultural and veterinary science)

Now, let's consider the conditional probabilities \( P(E|H) \):
- P(E|H_cs): Since Adam's traits about animals and nature do not strongly align with computer science, this might be low, say 0.1.
- P(E|H_ba): The business field seems even less likely given his interest in nature and empathy; let's assume 0.05.
- P(E|H_ag): Agricultural and veterinary science seems very fitting given his love for nature and animals; we'll set this to 0.7.

For \(P(E|\neg H)\) (e.g., all other fields not including the one being considered):
- This will vary, but considering that there are many other fields as well, say around 0.12 on average.

Lastly, \(P(E)\) is a normalizing constant, which would ideally be calculated as a part of all possible fields, but here we'll work with our primary fields.

Using Bayes' Rule:
1. Computer Science:
\[ P(H_cs|E) = \frac{P(E|H_cs) \cdot P(H_cs)}{P(E)}
= \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \approx 0.02/P(E) \]

2. Business Administration:
\[ P(H_ba|E) = \frac{P(E|H_ba) \cdot P(H_ba)}{P(E)}
= \frac{0.05 \times 0.15}{P(E)} \approx 0.0075/P(E) \]

3. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_ag|E) = \frac{P(E|H_ag) \cdot P(H_ag)}{P(E)}
= \frac{0.7 \times 0.10}{P(E)} \approx 0.07/P(E) \]

So relatively scaling these to make sense within the scope of these fields:
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science indeed seems the most likely if we skip the exact normalization constant, deciding ratios probability-wise:

{
  "computer science": "0.02",
  "business administration": "0.0075",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.07"
}
