To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each of the fields given Adam's personality sketch \( E \), we need to consider the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), and the marginal likelihood \( P(E) \). We will use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the evidence.

Here are some carefully reasoned estimates for the required probabilities:

1. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a graduate student is in business administration might be moderate, say 0.15.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam’s personality, it is less likely that he would be in business administration based on his love for nature, animals, and strong empathy, so this might be low, say 0.1.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): This is the probability of observing Adam's characteristics given that he is not in business administration. It's tricky to estimate, but let's assume it to be moderate, say 0.5.

   Plugging in these values:
   \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \)

2. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a graduate student is in computer science might be higher than business administration, say 0.25.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given that Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is good at understanding abstract concepts, it is somewhat consistent with computer science, so let's consider it to be moderate, say 0.5.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Again assuming a moderate probability, let's estimate it at 0.5.

   Plugging in these values:
   \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.25}{P(E)} \)

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a graduate student is in this field might be lower compared to the other two, say 0.1.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam’s love for animals, nature, and understanding hard work, it's highly likely he would be in this field, so this might be high, say 0.8.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): This is tricky but again, assuming a moderate probability, let's estimate it at 0.5.

   Plugging in these values:
   \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \)

We still need \( P(E) \) (total probability of observing the evidence). For simplicity, it can be assumed to normalize the resulting values, considering it's hard to determine precisely.

Here’s the calculation:

For business administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} = \frac{0.015}{P(E)} \]

For computer science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.25}{P(E)} = \frac{0.125}{P(E)} \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.08}{P(E)} \]

Given that we do not have a specific value for \( P(E) \), let's assume a relative scale to signify the estimation:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.015,
  "computer science": 0.125,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08
}
```

This setup provides an estimate relative to each other, showing that based on the given sketch, Adam is more likely to be in computer science, followed by agricultural and veterinary science, and least likely to be in business administration.
