To evaluate the probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields, we will go through the following steps:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field without knowing his personality (E). Since we are not given specific prior information about the distribution of graduate students among these fields, we might consider them equal for simplicity.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in a specific field.

3. **Marginal Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in the specific field.

4. **Posterior Probability \( P(H|E) \)**: This is the probability that Adam is in a specific field given his personality sketch. We use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for all hypotheses, we can use the proportional form for comparison:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

We will evaluate these terms qualitatively, as precise numerical values are not provided.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Let's assume a uniform prior, \( P(H) = \frac{1}{3} \).
   
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: High, because Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align well with this field.
   
3. **Marginal Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Lower, because not many other fields align this well with his personality traits.

### Business Administration

1. **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Let's assume a uniform prior, \( P(H) = \frac{1}{3} \).
   
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Low, as his personality traits do not strongly align with typical characteristics of business administration students.
   
3. **Marginal Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Higher than the likelihood for agricultural and veterinary science.

### Computer Science

1. **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Let's assume a uniform prior, \( P(H) = \frac{1}{3} \).
   
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Moderate, because Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence for abstract concepts, but this does not encompass his love for nature and animals as well.
   
3. **Marginal Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Comparable or slightly higher.

Given that we can calculate these posterior probabilities proportionally, they do not require the exact form due to the use of same priors and considering the same marginal likelihood \( P(E) \). The final values are qualitative assessments rather than precise calculations. But for simplicity, let's estimate them as follows:


```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These values represent the likelihood that Adam is enrolled in each respective field given his personality sketch.
