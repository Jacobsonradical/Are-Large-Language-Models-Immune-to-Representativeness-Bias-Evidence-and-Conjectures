To apply Bayes' rule for each field, we'll use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we're asked to consider several fields, we'll apply this rule for each one separately:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - **P(H)**: This is the initial probability that Adam was enrolled in this field. Since this field is closely related to his personality traits such as a genuine curiosity about nature, a deep love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, we will assign a moderately high value, say 0.3.
   - **P(E|H)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given that his traits align very well with this field, we will set this high, at around 0.8.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in this field. This trait could align with several fields, so we estimate it reasonably high, at around 0.5.
   - **P(E)**: This is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch, considering all fields. We won't compute this explicitly, as it is identical for all calculations.

2. **Computer Science**
   - **P(H)**: The initial probability he was enrolled in this field. We'll set it moderately because computer science is a common field among graduate students. We can set it at 0.3.
   - **P(E|H)**: Given that computer science requires high intelligence and abstract thinking, which Adam possesses, but isn't as connected with nature and animals, we can set it moderately, at around 0.5.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: This is given that he is not in computer science but has his traits. Because he fits in various fields, we can set it at 0.6.

3. **Business Administration**
   - **P(H)**: Initial probability for business administration. Considering itâ€™s quite common for graduate students, we set it at 0.2.
   - **P(E|H)**: Given that business administration doesn't particularly align with Adam's love for nature, animals, or puzzle-solving, we set it low, at around 0.2.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: Since he could still have these traits without being in business administration, we set it at 0.7.

Now, we apply Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.3}{0.8 \cdot 0.3 + 0.5 \cdot 0.7} \approx 0.4 \]

**Computer Science**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.3}{0.5 \cdot 0.3 + 0.6 \cdot 0.7} \approx 0.2 \]

**Business Administration**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.2 \cdot 0.2 + 0.7 \cdot 0.8} \approx 0.04 \]

Hence, the computed values are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4,
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.04
}
```
