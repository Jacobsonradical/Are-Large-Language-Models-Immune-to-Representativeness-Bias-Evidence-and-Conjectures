To evaluate \(P(H|E)\) for each field using Bayes' Rule, we need to first estimate:

1. \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
2. \(P(E|H)\): The probability that Adam has the described personality traits given that he was enrolled in that field.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability that Adam has the described personality traits given that he was not enrolled in that field.

### Estimating the Probabilities

1. **Prior Probability, \(P(H)\):**
   - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Relatively less common than fields like business and computer science.
   - **Computer Science:** A very common graduate field.
   - **Business Administration:** Also a very common graduate field.

   We might estimate:
   - \(P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) = 0.1\)
   - \(P(\text{Computer Science}) = 0.5\)
   - \(P(\text{Business Administration}) = 0.4\)

2. **Likelihood, \(P(E|H)\):**
   - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Fits well with Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, empathy, and love for animals.
   - **Computer Science:** Fits well with Adam's intelligence and ability to solve puzzles, but less so with his love for nature and animals.
   - **Business Administration:** Fits with Adam's intelligence and hard work appreciation, but less with his love for nature and animals.

   We might estimate:
   - \(P(E|\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) = 0.8\)
   - \(P(E|\text{Computer Science}) = 0.5\)
   - \(P(E|\text{Business Administration}) = 0.3\)

3. **Complement Likelihood, \(P(E|\neg H)\):**
   - The probability that Adam has the described traits, given that he is not enrolled in that field. For the sake of simplicity, we'll assume some average values for these estimations.

   We might estimate:
   - \(P(E|\neg \text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) = 0.3\)
   - \(P(E|\neg \text{Computer Science}) = 0.4\)
   - \(P(E|\neg \text{Business Administration}) = 0.5\)

### Applying Bayes' Rule

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \(P(E)\) is the same for all computations, we can ignore it for comparison purposes and compute the relative likelihoods.

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

\[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) \cdot P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]

#### Computer Science

\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) \propto 0.5 \cdot 0.5 = 0.25 \]

#### Business Administration

\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{Business Administration}) \cdot P(\text{Business Administration})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) \propto 0.3 \cdot 0.4 = 0.12 \]

### Normalizing

To normalize these values, we sum them:

\[ 0.08 + 0.25 + 0.12 = 0.45 \]

Then we can divide each by the total to get the final probabilities:

\[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.45} = 0.178 \]
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.25}{0.45} = 0.556 \]
\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.45} = 0.267 \]

### Summary

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.178,
  "computer science": 0.556,
  "business administration": 0.267
}
```
These values represent the relative probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field given his described personality traits.
