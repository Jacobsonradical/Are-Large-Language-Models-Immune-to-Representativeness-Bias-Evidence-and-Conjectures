To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule for each field, we need to estimate the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in each field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in each field.

Then we can apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant that's the same for all hypotheses, we can ignore it for relative comparisons.

By making some reasoned approximations:

1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
   - \( P(H) \): This is likely quite low, as it's a niche field compared to the general population of graduate students.
   - \( P(E|H) \): High, since Adam's love for nature, plants, animals, and empathy aligns well.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Medium; Adam's traits are valuable in other fields but less correlated.

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \approx 0.9 \cdot 0.05 \approx 0.045 \]

2. Business Administration:
   - \( P(H) \): Likely higher than for agricultural science due to more students enrolling.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Low, as Adam's traits don't align particularly well with business.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Medium to high due to the diversity of other graduate fields where his traits align better.

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \approx 0.2 \cdot 0.15 \approx 0.03 \]

3. Computer Science:
   - \( P(H) \): Fairly high, given the field's popularity.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Moderate, as puzzle-solving and intelligence fit, but the strong empathy and nature interest are less matching.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Medium to high for the same reason as business administration.

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \approx 0.5 \cdot 0.2 \approx 0.1  \]

Now, normalizing them:

\[
\text{Total} = 0.045 + 0.03 + 0.1 = 0.175
\]

\[
P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) \approx \frac{0.045}{0.175} \approx 0.257
\]
\[
P(\text{Business Administration}|E) \approx \frac{0.03}{0.175} \approx 0.171
\]
\[
P(\text{Computer Science}|E) \approx \frac{0.1}{0.175} \approx 0.571
\]

Final answer:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.257,
  "business administration": 0.171,
  "computer science": 0.571
}
