Let's go through the process step-by-step.

**Bayes' Rule:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, we need to estimate for each field:
1. **P(H)**: Prior probability of Adam being in that field.
2. **P(E|H)**: Probability of E given H.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability of E given not H.

We'll start by giving rough estimates for each of these probabilities.

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that a random graduate student is studying business administration can be roughly estimated. Let's assume it's moderate given the general popularity of MBAs. Let's say \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.20 \).
- **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam's personality aligns with someone studying business administration. Given his love for nature, animals, empathy, etc., this is relatively low. Let’s say \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.05 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of E given not H. This is a measure of how likely Adam's personality traits are in the general graduate student population. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.10 \).

### Computer Science
- **P(H)**: The prior probability for computer science graduates. This field is quite common, so let’s assume a moderate estimate. Let's say \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.20 \).
- **P(E|H)**: Adam's traits include abstract thinking and solving puzzles, which align well with computer science but not perfectly given his love for nature and animals. Let’s say \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.20 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of E given not H. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.10 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: This field reflects Adam's love of nature and animals closely, though it's less common than the other two. Let's say \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.10 \).
- **P(E|H)**: Given Adam’s curiosity about nature, animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work, this matches closely. Let’s say \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.90 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of E given not H would be lower, say \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.05 \).

#### Applying Bayes' Rule:

Let's assume \( P(E) = \sum P(E|H_i) P(H_i) \) for simplicity, which would still affect the proportional comparisons among the fields.

1. **Business Administration:**
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.05 \times 0.20}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.01}{P(E)} \]

2. **Computer Science:**
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.20 \times 0.20}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.04}{P(E)} \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.90 \times 0.10}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.09}{P(E)} \]

Even though \( P(E) \) is unknown, comparisons of these ratios can provide insight into the most probable field.

### Probabilistic Estimate:

Given these ratios:

\[ 0.01 : 0.04 : 0.09 \]

tells us that Agricultural and Veterinary Science is most likely, followed by Computer Science, and then Business Administration.

Thus, the posterior probabilities up to a comparative scale and ignoring exact normalization yield:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5
}
``` 

These values estimate the likelihood of Adam's enrollment in each field of study given his personality sketch.
