To perform Bayesian analysis, we'll need to evaluate several probabilities. We will use the following notations:
- P(H) = Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field
- P(E|H) = Probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam is enrolled in the specific field
- P(E|¬H) = Probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam is not enrolled in the specific field
- P(H|E) = Posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in the specific field given the personality sketch

For the sake of simplicity, let's assume prior probabilities (P(H)) are equal for each field since no prior information is given.
So, P(H) for each field = 1/3.

Let's make educated guesses for P(E|H) and P(E|¬H) based on the information provided in the personality sketch E:

### Business Administration
P(E|H) for Business Administration can be low because the personality traits (interest in nature, love for animals, empathy) don't strongly align with typical traits associated with business administration.
P(E|¬H) for Business Administration could be relatively higher.

→ P(E|H) ≈ 0.1
→ P(E|¬H) ≈ 0.5

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
P(E|H) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science can be high because traits like a love for animals and interest in nature align well with this field.
P(E|¬H) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science could be relatively lower.

→ P(E|H) ≈ 0.8
→ P(E|¬H) ≈ 0.2

### Computer Science
P(E|H) for Computer Science can be moderate due to Adam's high intelligence and interest in solving puzzles, but other traits (like love for animals) are not typically associated with this field.
P(E|¬H) for Computer Science could be higher.

→ P(E|H) ≈ 0.4
→ P(E|¬H) ≈ 0.3

Now we use Bayes' Rule: \(P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\)

We assume P(E) is the sum of all possible conditional probabilities, weighted by their prior probabilities:
\[P(E) = P(E | H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E | H_{\text{AgVet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) + P(E | H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})\]
\[P(E) = 0.1 \cdot \frac{1}{3} + 0.8 \cdot \frac{1}{3} + 0.4 \cdot \frac{1}{3}\]
\[P(E) = \frac{0.1 + 0.8 + 0.4}{3} = \frac{1.3}{3} = 0.4333\]

Compute the posterior probabilities P(H|E):

### Business Administration
\[P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.4333} = \frac{0.1}{1.3} \approx 0.077\]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[P(H_{\text{AgVet}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.4333} = \frac{0.8}{1.3} \approx 0.615\]

### Computer Science
\[P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.4333} = \frac{0.4}{1.3} \approx 0.308\]

So the results we get are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.077,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.615,
  "computer science": 0.308
}
```
