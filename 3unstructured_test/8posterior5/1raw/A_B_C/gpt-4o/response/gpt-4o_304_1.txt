To estimate \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in that field. Since we do not have specific prior knowledge, we might assume equal probability for each field, say \( P(H) = \frac{1}{\text{total number of graduate fields}} \). Without loss of generality, we can assume \( P(H) \) to be equal among the given fields.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that the personality traits \( E \) are observed if Adam is enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that the personality traits \( E \) are observed if Adam is not enrolled in that field.
4. \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \): The total probability of observing \( E \).

Given that we don't have specific prior information about the magnitudes of these probabilities, we must make reasonable assumptions based on the descriptions provided:

### Analysis for Each Field

#### Computer Science
- \( P(H) \): Assume a prior probability for simplicity, say 1/3 considering three fields.
- \( P(E|H) \): This might be moderate because a love for puzzles and high intelligence align with computer science characteristics. Let's assume 0.3.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of these traits given Adam is not in computer science might still be moderate considering other fields. Let’s assume 0.5 since these traits can apply broadly.

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): Again, assume 1/3.
- \( P(E|H) \): This is high, as his personality traits closely align with an affinity for nature, plants, and animals. Let's assume 0.7.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Other fields might still see some of these traits, but less so. Assume 0.3.

#### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): Assume 1/3.
- \( P(E|H) \): This is lower because the traits described don't align typically with business administration. Let’s say 0.1.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likely higher than in H since many grad fields align somewhat. Assume 0.45.

### Applying Bayes' Theorem

Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{CS})P(H_{CS}) + P(E|H_{Ag})P(H_{Ag}) + P(E|H_{BA})P(H_{BA}) \]

For simplification, assume equal prior probabilities given our lack of specific priors:
\[ P(H_{CS}) = P(H_{Ag}) = P(H_{BA}) = \frac{1}{3} \]

\[ P(E) = (0.3 \times \frac{1}{3}) + (0.7 \times \frac{1}{3}) + (0.1 \times \frac{1}{3}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.1 + 0.233 + 0.033 = 0.367 \]

### Calculations

- **Computer Science**: 
  \[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.367} = \frac{0.1}{0.367} \approx 0.273 \]

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: 
  \[ P(H_{Ag}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.367} = \frac{0.233}{0.367} \approx 0.635 \]

- **Business Administration**: 
  \[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.367} = \frac{0.033}{0.367} \approx 0.090 \]

### Final Answer
