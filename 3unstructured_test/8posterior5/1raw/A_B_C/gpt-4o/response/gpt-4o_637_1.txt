To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that \( P(E) \) is constant for each hypothesis, it will cancel out during normalization. We'll focus initially on estimating \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for each field. Here’s my reasoning:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - **P(H)** (Prior Probability): Given Adam's love for nature and animals, it's moderately likely that he might have chosen this field. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.3 \).
    - **P(E|H)** (Likelihood): His interest in plants and animals fits well with this field. Let's assign a high value like 0.9.
    - **P(E|\neg H)** (Complement Likelihood): There are other fields where his traits may also somewhat align, so we might give this a moderate value, like 0.6.

\[ P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.9 \times 0.3 = 0.27 \]

2. **Business Administration**:
    - **P(H)** (Prior Probability): Adam's interests do not directly align with business administration. Let's give it a lower prior, say 0.1.
    - **P(E|H)** (Likelihood): His empathy and intelligence might contribute, but it’s not a strong match. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).
    - **P(E|\neg H)** (Complement Likelihood): His personality aligns poorly with business administration, so this value could be lower, say 0.4.

\[ P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \times 0.1 = 0.02 \]

3. **Computer Science**:
    - **P(H)** (Prior Probability): Given his intelligence and enjoyment of puzzles, it's reasonable to assume he might pursue this. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.25 \).
    - **P(E|H)** (Likelihood): While problem-solving skills are relevant, the direct alignment with nature and animals is less clear. Let's say \( P(E|H) = 0.5 \).
    - **P(E|\neg H)** (Complement Likelihood): The alignment here is also moderate as some traits fit, but not entirely. Let's assume this is 0.5.

\[ P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.5 \times 0.25 = 0.125 \]

Normalizing these values:

\[ P(H|E) \text{ (Agricultural and Veterinary Science)} = \frac{0.27}{0.27 + 0.02 + 0.125} = \frac{0.27}{0.415} \approx 0.65 \]
\[ P(H|E) \text{ (Business Administration)} = \frac{0.02}{0.27 + 0.02 + 0.125} = \frac{0.02}{0.415} \approx 0.048 \]
\[ P(H|E) \text{ (Computer Science)} = \frac{0.125}{0.27 + 0.02 + 0.125} = \frac{0.125}{0.415} \approx 0.301 \]

Using these calculations, the final probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.65,
  "business administration": 0.048,
  "computer science": 0.301
}
