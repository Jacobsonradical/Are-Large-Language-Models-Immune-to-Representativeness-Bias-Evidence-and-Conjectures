To determine the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, let's go through the steps.

First, recall Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the negation of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence.

For simplicity, we can assume \( P(E) \) remains constant across different hypotheses as it would just normalize the probabilities. Therefore, we will focus on \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) to determine comparative values of \( P(H|E) \).

**Hypothesis 1: Business Administration**
- \( P(H) \) (prior): Business administration is a common graduate field, but it doesn't strongly correlate with Adam's characteristics. Let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|H) \) (likelihood): Adam's interests and personality traits (nature, animals, empathy, puzzles) are less likely aligned with business administration. Let's assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.05 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) (likelihood under negation): Given the broadness of graduate fields where Adam's traits might fit better, \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \).

**Hypothesis 2: Computer Science**
- \( P(H) \) (prior): Computer science is a common graduate field, and Adam's interest in puzzles and abstract concepts might align well. Let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.25 \).
- \( P(E|H) \) (likelihood): Given his traits, there's a moderate likelihood. Let's assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) (likelihood under negation): Similar fields might show higher alignment with his traits. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \).

**Hypothesis 3: Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
- \( P(H) \) (prior): Less common than business administration and computer science but highly aligned with Adam's love for animals and nature. Let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|H) \) (likelihood): Very high. Adam's traits strongly align. Let's assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) (likelihood under negation): Other fields less likely to align so strongly. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \).

Applying these assumptions to Bayes' rule:

### Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.05 \cdot 0.2 = 0.01 \]

### Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.3 \cdot 0.25 = 0.075 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]

Now, normalizing these values to reflect comparative probabilities:

Sum of all propensities:
\[0.01 + 0.075 + 0.08 = 0.165\]

Normalized probabilities:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.165} \approx 0.061 \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.075}{0.165} \approx 0.454 \]
\[ P(H_{AV}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.165} \approx 0.485 \]

Therefore, the comparative probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.061,
  "computer science": 0.454,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.485
}
```

Please note these values are normalized comparative probabilities based on the assumptions provided.
