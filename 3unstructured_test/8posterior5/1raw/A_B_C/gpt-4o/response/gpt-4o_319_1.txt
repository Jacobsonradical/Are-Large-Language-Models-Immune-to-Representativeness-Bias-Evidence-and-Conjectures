To calculate the probability \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis using Bayes' rule, we need to assign reasonable values to \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) based on the given personality sketch of Adam.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing evidence \( E \) (Adam's personality sketch) given the hypothesis \( H \) (Adam's field of study).
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the evidence \( E \).

Since we do not have exact statistical data, we will make reasoned estimates based on the sketch.

### 1. Computer Science

#### Judgements:
- \( P(H_{CS}) \) (Probability of a graduate student being in Computer Science): Let's assume \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.2 \) (20%) since Computer Science is a popular field.
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) (Probability of observing Adam's traits given he is in Computer Science): Adam's traits align somewhat with Computer Science (curiosity, intelligence, abstract thinking), let \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.4 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \) (Probability of observing Adam's traits given he's not in Computer Science): We need to adjust this considering the traits could fit other fields like Agricultural sciences or others. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.2 \).

### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

#### Judgements:
- \( P(H_{Agri}) \) (Probability of a graduate student being in Agricultural and Veterinary Science): Let’s assume \( P(H_{Agri}) = 0.1 \) (10%) as it is less common compared to fields like Computer Science.
- \( P(E|H_{Agri}) \) (Probability of observing Adam's traits given he is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science): Adam’s traits highly fit with this field (love for nature, plants, animals, empathy). Let \( P(E|H_{Agri}) = 0.8 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H_{Agri}) \) (Probability of observing Adam's traits given he's not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science): Similar to above, let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H_{Agri}) = 0.2 \).

### 3. Business Administration

#### Judgements:
- \( P(H_{BA}) \) (Probability of a graduate student being in Business Administration): Let’s assume \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.2 \) (20%), another popular field.
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \) (Probability of observing Adam's traits given he is in Business Administration): Adam’s traits are somewhat misaligned with business (not necessarily connected to empathy, animals, or nature). Let \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \) (Probability of observing Adam's traits given he's not in Business Administration): Similar to above, let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) = 0.25 \).

### Calculations using Bayes' Rule

Taking \( P(E) \) as a normalizing constant which isn't essential here as total probabilities just need to be relative:

**Computer Science:**
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \approx \frac{ 0.4 \cdot 0.2}{(0.4 \cdot 0.2) + (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.1 \cdot 0.2)} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.08 + 0.02} = \frac{0.08}{0.18} \approx 0.44 \]

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(H_{Agri}|E) \approx \frac{ 0.8 \cdot 0.1}{(0.4 \cdot 0.2) + (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.1 \cdot 0.2)} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.08 + 0.02} = \frac{0.08}{0.18} \approx 0.44 \]

**Business Administration:**
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx \frac{ 0.1 \cdot 0.2}{(0.4 \cdot 0.2) + (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.1 \cdot 0.2)} = \frac{0.02}{0.08 + 0.08 + 0.02} = \frac{0.02}{0.18} \approx 0.11 \]

### Final Results

Based on these calculations:

{
  "computer science": 0.44,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.44,
  "business administration": 0.11
}

Note: These probabilities are relative and should ideally add up to 1 when considering all potential fields. Here, they represent just relative likelihoods among the given fields.
