Let's denote:

- \( H_{\text{CS}} \) for the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( H_{\text{BA}} \) for the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( H_{\text{AVS}} \) for the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( E \) for the personality sketch given.
- \( \neg H \) for the negation of each of these hypotheses.

From Bayes' theorem, we know that:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

### 1. Computer Science (CS)

#### Judgments:
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): Let's assume a moderate prior probability that Adam is enrolled in CS. Around 0.2.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): Given his personality sketch, it isn't highly aligned with typical attributes one might associate with CS (like strong curiosity in nature, empathy, and love for animals). So, let's consider this value low: 0.1.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \): Among all other possible fields, a field more in line with his attributes (empathy, love for nature and animals) might absorb most of the probability. Let's say this is moderate: 0.3.

Then:

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

### 2. Business Administration (BA)

#### Judgments:
- \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): Let's assume a lower prior probability that Adam is enrolled in BA. Around 0.1.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): His personality sketch doesn't align well with typical attributes one might associate with BA (like a strong understanding of abstract concepts or empathy and a love for nature/animals). Moderate to low: 0.05.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \): This stays the same, moderate probability: 0.3.

Then:

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

### 3. Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS)

#### Judgments:
- \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \): Assuming a higher prior probability given his interest in nature, plants, and animals. Around 0.3.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \): His personality sketch aligns well with AVS, so let's consider this high: 0.7.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \): This stays the same, moderate probability: 0.3.

Then:

\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \]

### Normalizing and Final Conclusion

Since we are interested in the relative probabilities:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \]

\[ P(E) \approx (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.05 \cdot 0.1) + (0.7 \cdot 0.3) \approx 0.02 + 0.005 + 0.21 \approx 0.235 \]

And finally, using these individual probabilities:

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx \frac{0.02}{0.235} \approx 0.085 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \approx \frac{0.005}{0.235} \approx 0.021 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) \approx \frac{0.21}{0.235} \approx 0.894 \]

Thus:

{
  "computer science": "0.085",
  "business administration": "0.021",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.894"
