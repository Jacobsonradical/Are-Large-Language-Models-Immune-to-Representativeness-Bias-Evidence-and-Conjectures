To calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field \( H \), we need to apply Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field, \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is in that field, and \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the evidence. Since \( P(E) \) is the same for each field and we're comparing relative probabilities, we can ignore \( P(E) \) and compute relative terms for comparison.

Let's assume equal priors \( P(H) \) for all fields, meaning there's no prior reason to believe Adam is more likely to be in one specific field. Thus, \( P(H) = 1/3 \) for each field, because we are comparing among three fields in this context.

For \( P(E|H) \), we evaluate the personality sketch in relation to each field.

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Quiet, enjoys solving puzzles, has warm heart: somewhat relevant but not strongly indicative.
   - Genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, deep love for animals: not particularly relevant.
   - High intelligence, good at abstract concepts: somewhat relevant.
   - Strong appreciation for hard work: relevant.
   
   Overall, \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \) might be moderate.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Quiet, enjoys solving puzzles: highly relevant.
   - Genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, deep love for animals: not particularly relevant.
   - High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts: highly relevant.
   - Strong appreciation for hard work: relevant.

   Overall, \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \) is likely quite high.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants: highly relevant.
   - Strong empathy, warm heart, deep love for animals: highly relevant.
   - High intelligence, good at abstract concepts: somewhat relevant.
   - Strong appreciation for hard work: highly relevant.

   Overall, \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \) is likely very high.

For simplicity, we'll assume \( P(E|\neg H) \) (the probability of the evidence if Adam was not in the considered field) is roughly equal for all fields since we've evenly distributed the prior probabilities. The primary difference will come from \( P(E|H) \).

Assuming the following rough estimates based on our qualitative assessments:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.7 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.9 \)

The calculations for \( P(H|E) \) (ignoring \( P(E) \) for relative comparison) would then be:

\[ P(H|E) \approx P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

So:

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \approx 0.3 \times \frac{1}{3} = 0.1 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx 0.7 \times \frac{1}{3} = 0.233 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) \approx 0.9 \times \frac{1}{3} = 0.3 \]

Thus, the probabilities you are looking for are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.233,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3
}
