Let's denote the probabilities of interest as follows:

- P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- P(E|H): The probability of observing the given personality sketch (E) given that Adam is in that field.
- P(E|¬H): The probability of observing the given personality sketch (E) given that Adam is not in that field.

We'll assume the following prior probabilities (P(H)), which could be estimated from the typical distribution of graduate students in each field:

- P(H_computer science) = 0.2
- P(H_business administration) = 0.2
- P(H_agricultural and veterinary science) = 0.1

Given the personality sketch (E), we'll evaluate P(E|H) for each field:
- For computer science: Adam's personality sketch doesn't strongly align with the typical traits of a computer science graduate (e.g., not much about nature or animals). We might estimate P(E|H_computer_science) to be low, around 0.1.
- For business administration: Similarly, business administration doesn't seem to align well with Adam's interests in nature and animals. We might estimate P(E|H_business_administration) to be low too, around 0.05.
- For agricultural and veterinary science: His love for nature, plants, and animals heavily aligns with this field. So, we could estimate P(E|H_agri_vet_science) to be high, around 0.8.

Now, let's consider the probability of observing the given personality sketch (E) for someone enrolled in general (not field-specific):
- P(E|¬H) can be estimated based on how common the traits described are in the overall population of graduate students. Given the specific interests in nature, puzzles, and animals, we'll assign:
  - P(E|¬H_computer_science) ≈ 0.3
  - P(E|¬H_business_administration) ≈ 0.3
  - P(E|¬H_agri_vet_science) ≈ 0.2

Applying Bayes’ rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \)

Let's go ahead and apply these for each field:

### Computer Science:
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) = 0.02 + 0.24 = 0.26 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{cs} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.26} ≈ 0.0769 \]

### Business Administration:
\[ P(E) = (0.05 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) = 0.01 + 0.24 = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{ba} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.2}{0.25} = 0.04 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) = 0.08 + 0.18 = 0.26 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{agri_vet} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.26} ≈ 0.3077 \]

Hence the final probabilities given the personality sketch (E) for each field will be:

  "computer science": 0.0769,
  "business administration": 0.04,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3077
