To calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field, I will use Bayes' Theorem, which is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in the field.

We need to make some educated estimates about these probabilities since exact values are not available.

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): Let's assume the probability of any grad student being in business administration is around 0.2 (20%).
- \( P(E|H) \): The traits described in \( E \) (curiosity about nature, warm heart, love for animals, appreciation for hard work) don't strongly align with typical business admin students. I would estimate this to be low, around 0.01.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of a random grad student having these traits. Given these are somewhat general traits, I would put this at 0.05.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): Let's assume the probability of any grad student being in this field is around 0.1 (10%).
- \( P(E|H) \): The traits described in \( E \), especially the love for animals and nature, strongly align with students in this field. I would estimate this to be high, around 0.8.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Similar to above, we estimate 0.05 for the general population.

### Computer Science
- \( P(H) \): Let's assume the probability of any grad student being in computer science is around 0.3 (30%).
- \( P(E|H) \): While Adamâ€™s intelligence and love for solving puzzles fit the profile of a computer science student, his empathy and love for animals are less typical. I would estimate this moderately, around 0.2.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Again, let's assume 0.05 for the general population.

Now we calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field:
\[ P(E) \] can be seen as a normalization factor and doesn't affect the relative comparisons if we just want ratios, so we can ignore it for simplicity.

### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \Approx= \frac{0.01 \times 0.2}{0.05} = 0.04 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \Approx= \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.05} = 1.6 \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \Approx= \frac{0.2 \times 0.3}{0.05} = 1.2 \]

Therefore, the relative likelihoods are:

{
  "business administration": 0.04,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 1.6,
  "computer science": 1.2
