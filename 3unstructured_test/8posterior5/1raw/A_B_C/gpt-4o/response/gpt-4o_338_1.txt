To estimate the values of \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we first need to estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Bayes' rule states that:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in the field given the personality sketch.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field before considering the sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the personality sketch, which we can handle through normalization.

Since we are focusing on relative probabilities rather than absolute values, let's denote \( P(H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \) as uniform across different fields for simplicity. Our main differentiation will come from \( P(E|H) \).

### Estimations:

1. **Agroicultural and Veterinary Science**
   - \( P(H) \): Moderate, as it's a specialized but not uncommon field.
   - \( P(E|H) \): High, due to the subject’s curiosity about nature, plants, empathy, and love for animals.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Low to moderate, as empathy and curiosity are not exclusive to this field.

2. **Business Administration**
   - \( P(H) \): Moderate to high, as it’s a common graduate field.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Low, as the personality sketch does not strongly align with business administration qualities.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Moderate to high, given the general applicability of empathy and intelligence.

3. **Computer Science**
   - \( P(H) \): High, as it's a very common graduate field.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Moderate to high, considering the subject's high intelligence, love for puzzles and abstract concepts.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Moderate, as these traits can be common in many intellectual fields.

### Calculation:

We will assume \( P(H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \) are reasonably similar across fields for our relative comparison. Let’s estimate \( P(H|E) \):

Using Bayes' rule, we can compare their relative likelihoods:

\[
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H)P(H)
\]

Hence without the exact values for normalization in \( P(E) \):

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{High \times Moderate}{Normalization} \approx 0.6 \),
  "business administration": \( \frac{Low \times Moderate}{Normalization} \approx 0.1 \),
  "computer science": \( \frac{Moderate/High \times High}{Normalization} \approx 0.3 \)
}

Listing out final estimates:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

Remember, this estimation assumes relative who's likely based on the provided personality sketch and general expectations from the field characteristics.
