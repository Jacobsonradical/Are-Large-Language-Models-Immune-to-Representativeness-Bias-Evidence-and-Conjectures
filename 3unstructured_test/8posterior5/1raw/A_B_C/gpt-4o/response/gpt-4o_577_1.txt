To solve for the probability of Adam being enrolled in each of the given graduate fields of specialization given the personality sketch, we will use Bayes' Theorem. This theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:

- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field given the personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the personality sketch.

For this calculation, let's assume hypothetical values that seem reasonable based on Adam's personality sketch. Note that the exact values used in real situations would depend on empirical data, but we can proceed with estimations.

### Assumed Probabilities
- Prior probabilities (\(P(H)\)) of being enrolled in each field may be estimated based on statistical enrollment figures, but for this example, we will just assume equal likelihood for simplicity:
  - \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \approx 0.1 \)
  - \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) \approx 0.2 \)
  - \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \approx 0.2 \)
  
  Total remaining prior would go to other unspecified fields.

- \(P(E|H)\): Let's estimate how well Adam's personality fits each field:
  - For agricultural and veterinary science (high empathy, love for nature and animals):
    - \(P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \approx 0.8\)
  - For computer science (intelligent, enjoys puzzles, understands abstract concepts):
    - \(P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \approx 0.5\)
  - For business administration (appreciation for hard work and dedication):
    - \(P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \approx 0.3\)
    
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of the personality sketch given not being in the specific field, assumed to be an averaged estimate that retains unity across other fields.
  - \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.4\)
  - \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.4\)
  - \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.5\)
 
### Calculations
Using Bayes Rule, we compute \(P(H|E)\):

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})}{P(E)} \]
Approximating by assuming \(P(E)\) is normalized,
\[ \approx \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.8 \times 0.1 + 0.5 \times 0.2 + 0.3 \times 0.2 + 0.5 \times 0.5} \]
\[ \approx \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.1 + 0.06 + 0.25} \]
\[ \approx \frac{0.08}{0.49} \approx 0.163 \]

#### Computer Science
\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ \approx \frac{0.5 \times 0.2}{0.49} \]
\[ \approx \frac{0.1}{0.49} \approx 0.204 \]

#### Business Administration
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ \approx \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{0.49} \]
\[ \approx \frac{0.06}{0.49} \approx 0.122 \]

### Final Probabilities (approximations)
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.163,
  "computer science": 0.204,
  "business administration": 0.122
}
```
Note that these values are approximations and the exact probabilities would depend on more precise data.
