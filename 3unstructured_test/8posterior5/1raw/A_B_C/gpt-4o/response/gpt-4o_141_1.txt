To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific graduate field given his personality sketch (E), we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For each field:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of a student being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality traits given that the student is in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing these traits given the student is not in that field.
- \( P(E) \) (the total probability of observing the personality traits) can be computed as a weighted sum of all possible fields, but for simplicity, we often work with relative likelihoods.

### Estimation of Values
Given Adam's traits, let’s estimate \( P(E|H) \) for each field:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Given Adam's strong empathy for animals, love for nature, and appreciation for hard work, it is highly likely.
- **Business Administration:** Adam's traits seem less aligned with business administration’s typical focus on economic and corporate interests.
- **Computer Science:** His intelligence and enjoyment of puzzles make this plausible, but his love for nature and animals is less directly aligned.

### Assigning Probabilities
Let’s assign some approximate values for computation:
- **P(H) for each field**:
  - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.2
  - Business Administration: 0.5
  - Computer Science: 0.3

- **P(E|H) for each field**:
  - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.8
  - Business Administration: 0.1
  - Computer Science: 0.5

- **P(E|\neg H) for each field**: Let’s assume the average likelihood of a student having these traits across all other fields is:
  - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.3
  - Business Administration: 0.5
  - Computer Science: 0.4

### Compute P(H|E) for each field
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[ P(E) \approx (0.8 \cdot 0.2) + (0.1 \cdot 0.5) + (0.5 \cdot 0.3) \]
   \[ P(E) \approx 0.16 + 0.05 + 0.15 = 0.36 \]
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{0.36} \approx \frac{0.16}{0.36} \approx 0.444 \]

2. **Business Administration**:
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.5}{0.36} \approx \frac{0.05}{0.36} \approx 0.139 \]

3. **Computer Science**:
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.3}{0.36} \approx \frac{0.15}{0.36} \approx 0.417 \]

### Results
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.444,
  "business administration": 0.139,
  "computer science": 0.417
}
```
These probabilities indicate the relative likelihood that Adam was enrolled in each field given his personality traits.
