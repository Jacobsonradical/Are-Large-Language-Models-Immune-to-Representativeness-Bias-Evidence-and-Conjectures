Given the personality sketch of Adam and the fields provided, here's how we can approach the problem using Bayes' Rule:

Bayes' Rule states that:  
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) * P(H)}{P(E)} \]  
Where:  
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of Adam having the characteristics described in E given that he is in the field H.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of Adam having the characteristics described in E.

While \( P(E) \) is constant for all fields, we can focus on \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(H) \) to compare the relative probabilities.

### 1. Computer Science
- **P(H)**: In general, computer science is a common graduate field, so let's assume a moderate prior, say 0.3.
- **P(E|H)**: The description of Adam’s empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work are somewhat atypical for stereotypical computer science students, although the high intelligence and problem-solving skills fit well. Let's assign a medium probability, say 0.3.
- **P(E|¬H)**: If Adam is not in computer science, these traits are still somewhat likely given his interests. Let's assign a higher probability, say 0.7.

Using Bayes’ Rule:  
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) * P(H) = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09. \]

### 2. Business Administration
- **P(H)**: Business Administration is another common graduate field. Let's assume a moderate prior, say 0.2.
- **P(E|H)**: Traits like empathy and appreciation for hard work fit well, but the love for nature and animals, and curiosity about plants might not align perfectly. Let's assign a lower probability, say 0.2.
- **P(E|¬H)**: If Adam is not in Business Administration, the traits are more likely, say 0.8.

Using Bayes’ Rule:  
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) * P(H) = 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04. \]

### 3. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: This is a less common graduate field compared to the above two, so let’s assume a lower prior, say 0.1.
- **P(E|H)**: The traits described in E fit perfectly with Agricultural and Veterinary Science. High probability, say 0.8.
- **P(E|¬H)**: If Adam is not in this field, these specific traits are less likely. Let’s assign a lower probability, say 0.5.

Using Bayes’ Rule:  
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) * P(H) = 0.8 * 0.1 = 0.08. \]

### Normalizing the Values:
To make these comparable and possibly normalized (if needed):

- Sum of all calculated values: \( 0.09 + 0.04 + 0.08 = 0.21 \).

### Normalized Posterior Probabilities:
- **Computer Science:** \( 0.09 / 0.21 \approx 0.428 \).
- **Business Administration:** \( 0.04 / 0.21 \approx 0.190 \).
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** \( 0.08 / 0.21 \approx 0.381 \).

Ending up, the relative posterior probabilities after normalization would be:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.428,
  "business administration": 0.190,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.381
}
```

These percentages indicate that given the personality traits of Adam, he is most likely to be in the field of Computer Science, followed by Agricultural and Veterinary Science, and lastly Business Administration.
