To solve this problem using Bayes' theorem, we first need to understand the terms and how they relate to each other:

1. \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
2. \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in a specific field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in a specific field.
4. \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing Adam's personality sketch across all possible fields and can be computed using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]

Let's evaluate the quantities:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - **\( P(H) \):** This could be assigned based on typical enrollment figures, but let's assume it is reasonably high because it aligns well with Adam’s interests.
   - **\( P(E|H) \):** Very high, given Adam’s empathy, love for animals, appreciation of hard work, and curiosity about nature.
   - **\( P(E|\neg H) \):** Somewhat lower since not many other fields would match all these personality traits.

2. **Computer Science**
   - **\( P(H) \):** This field is quite common, so the prior is reasonable but general.
   - **\( P(E|H):** Moderate, given Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, but lower on empathy, love for animals, and nature which are not specifically aligned with computer science.
   - **\( P(E|\neg H) \):** Lower than agricultural science but not too low since abstract thinking and puzzle-solving are common in other fields too.

3. **Business Administration**
   - **\( P(H) \):** Reasonably common field but unlikely given Adam’s nature-oriented sketch.
   - **\( P(E|H):** Low, as the traits and values in the sketch do not align well with typical MBA profiles.
   - **\( P(E|\neg H):** Higher, because his personality traits are less likely to be seen in this field compared to the others.

Now, let's summarize each posterior probability by assuming relative values based on the above heuristic assessments. We'll normalize afterward for clarity:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.85,
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

Note: These approximations are intended to capture the relative likelihood of Adam’s personality fitting within each respective field. The real probabilities would depend on actual statistical data from graduate enrollment and personality trait distributions across fields.
