To apply Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E|\neg H) \). Let's step through this for each field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Graduate students are distributed over various fields, but agricultural and veterinary science is a common field relative to his interest in nature and love for animals.
   \[
   P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.2
   \]
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The personality sketch strongly aligns with traits beneficial for agricultural and veterinary science, such as a love for nature and animals.
   \[
   P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.8
   \]
3. **Evidence \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Traits like curiosity about nature and love for animals are less common in other fields.
   \[
   P(E|\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.1
   \]
   Now, we can apply Bayes' Rule:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   For simplicity, let us assume \( P(E) \) is constant for normalization purposes. Since other denominators share the same value \( P(E) \), comparing numerators is sufficient for relative comparisons:
   \[
   P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science} | E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.2 = 0.16
   \]

### Business Administration
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Business administration has many graduate students.
   \[
   P(\text{business administration}) = 0.3
   \]
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Less alignment with Adam's specific traits like love for animals and nature.
   \[
   P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.1
   \]
3. **Evidence \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Higher because business administration does not typically require an interest in nature or animals.
   \[
   P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) = 0.5
   \]
   Applying Bayes' Rule:
   \[
   P(\text{business administration} | E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.3 = 0.03
   \]

### Computer Science
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Computer science is very popular among graduate fields.
   \[
   P(\text{computer science}) = 0.4
   \]
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Moderate alignment because he enjoys solving puzzles and is of high intelligence (qualities consistent with a computer science background).
   \[
   P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.5
   \]
3. **Evidence \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Given diversity, students with different personalities can be part of it.
   \[
   P(E|\neg \text{computer science}) = 0.4
   \]
   Applying Bayes' Rule:
   \[
   P(\text{computer science} | E) \propto 0.5 \times 0.4 = 0.2
   \]

Now, normalize these to sum to 1 for direct comparison:
\[
\text{Total} = 0.16 + 0.03 + 0.2 = 0.39
\]

Thus, the combined probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for normalization:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \(\frac{0.16}{0.39} \approx 0.41\),
  "business administration": \(\frac{0.03}{0.39} \approx 0.08\),
  "computer science": \(\frac{0.2}{0.39} \approx 0.51\)
}
