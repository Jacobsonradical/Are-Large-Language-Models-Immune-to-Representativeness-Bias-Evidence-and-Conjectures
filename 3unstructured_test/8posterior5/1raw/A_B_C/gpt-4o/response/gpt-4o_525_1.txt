Let's approach this problem step by step.

First, we need to break down the process using Bayes' rule. Specifically, we need:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for all fields being compared, we can focus on the relative values of \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

### Assumptions:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in each field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch (E) would occur if he were enrolled in that field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality if he were not in that field.

We'll assume:
- The prior \( P(H) \) might be uniform across fields if we have no other information. 
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) decreases as the congruence between the field and personality sketch decreases.

Now let's estimate each probability for the specific fields:

---

### Business Administration:
- **P(H)**: Prior probability Adam is in business admin. Let's assume a lower probability due to mismatch with the personality sketch.
- **P(E|H)**: Likelihood that Adam's personality fits someone studying business admin. Likely low.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Likelihood of Adam's personality if not in business admin. High because there are better fits.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \text{low} \]

---

### Computer Science:
- **P(H)**: Prior probability Adam is in computer science. Mildly high due to traits of high intelligence and abstract reasoning.
- **P(E|H)**: Likelihood that Adam's personality fits computer science. Moderate but not highly conclusive; some traits match, but love for animals and nature is less congruent.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Likelihood of Adam's personality if not in computer science. Moderately high because other fields might fit better.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \text{moderate} \]

---

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- **P(H)**: Prior probability Adam is in ag/vet science. High due to high congruence with the personality sketch.
- **P(E|H)**: Likelihood that Adam’s personality matches someone in ag/vet science. Very high.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Likelihood of Adam’s personality if not in ag/vet science. Significantly lower.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \text{high} \]

### Final Estimates
Converting these qualitative assessments into numbers (0 to 1):

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

This result indicates that given Adam's personality sketch, it is most probable that he was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
