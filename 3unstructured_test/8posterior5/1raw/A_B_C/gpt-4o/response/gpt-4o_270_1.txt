To calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study, we need to use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.
- \( P(\neg H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is not enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in the field.

Since \( P(E) \) is constant for all cases (we're comparing relative probabilities), we don't need its explicit value for the comparison.

Let's make reasonable assumptions for priors and likelihoods based on the given sketch of Adam:

### Business Administration
Assumptions:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability could be considered low to moderate since business administration is a popular field, but it doesn't strongly align with Adam's interests.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood is relatively low because Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy are not strongly connected to business administration.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood is also relatively low since traits described are not predominantly associated with fields other than agricultural and veterinary science or computer science.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
Assumptions:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability could be considered low to medium since this field is less common, but Adam's interests align well with it.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood is high because Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals aligns well with agricultural and veterinary sciences.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood is low to moderate since Adam's traits do align more with this field compared to many others.

### Computer Science
Assumptions:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability is medium to high since computer science is a very popular graduate field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood is moderate because Adam's intelligence and puzzle-solving abilities align with this field, though his love for nature and animals is less relevant.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood is moderate since many fields could fit his personality traits, though not as well as agricultural and veterinary science.

Using these assumptions, let's estimate relative probabilities:

### Business Administration
\( P(H) \) = 0.2 (low to moderate prior)
\( P(E|H) \) = 0.1 (low likelihood)
\( P(E|\neg H) \) = 0.2 (low to moderate likelihood in other fields)

Using \( P(E) \) as a constant, roughly estimating:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\( P(H) \) = 0.1 (low to medium prior)
\( P(E|H) \) = 0.7 (high likelihood)
\( P(E|\neg H) \) = 0.2 (relatively low to moderate likelihood in other fields)

Using \( P(E) \) as a constant, roughly estimating:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.7 \times 0.1 = 0.07 \]

### Computer Science
\( P(H) \) = 0.3 (medium to high prior)
\( P(E|H) \) = 0.3 (moderate likelihood)
\( P(E|\neg H) \) = 0.2 (relatively low to moderate likelihood in other fields)

Using \( P(E) \) as a constant, roughly estimating:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09 \]

Therefore, the relative posterior probabilities might be:

{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.07,
  "computer science": 0.09
}

Note that these are rough estimates based on assumptions. In a real-world scenario, more precise data and calculations would be used.
