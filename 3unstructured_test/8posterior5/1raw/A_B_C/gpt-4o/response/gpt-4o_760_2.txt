To apply Bayes' Rule, we need to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \). Bayes' Rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here's a step-by-step breakdown for each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let’s assume an approximate value based on general knowledge about graduate field distributions (e.g., 5% or 0.05).
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) assuming that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his interest in nature, a warm heart, empathy, and love for animals, this probability seems quite high (e.g., 0.9).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) assuming Adam is **not** enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This is lower but non-zero because other fields may also align with his traits (e.g., 0.1).

Using Bayes' Rule, we get:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} \]

### Computer Science
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in computer science. Assume it's higher due to the popularity of the field (e.g., 25% or 0.25).
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) assuming that Adam is enrolled in computer science. Adam’s problem-solving skills and high intelligence are consistent, though his love for nature and animals is less typical (e.g., 0.4).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: This involves the other fields, adjusted for computer science being excluded. It would thus be slightly altered but not drastically different (e.g., 0.15).

Using Bayes' Rule, we get:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.25}{P(E)} \]

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: The prior probability of a student being enrolled in business administration. Let's assume a moderate value (e.g., 15% or 0.15).
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given Adam is studying business administration. His empathy and abstract understanding might fit, but his specific interests in nature and animals are less typical (e.g., 0.2).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: This probability adjusts slightly excluding business administration from consideration (e.g., 0.1).

Using Bayes' Rule, we get:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \]

Since the exact value of \( P(E) \) is the same across all scenarios and serves only as a normalizing constant, we can ignore it for the purpose of ranking the probabilities.

### Summary Results
After detailed evaluation, we get approximate values as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.45,
  "computer science": 0.10,
  "business administration": 0.03
}
```

**Note**: These values represent relative comparison relevance. For accurate absolute posterior probabilities, normalization using the total sum of these numerators should be considered:

\[ \sum P(H|E) = 0.45 + 0.10 + 0.03 + ... (other fields) \]

This result aligns well with Adam's traits, showing a significant likelihood for agricultural and veterinary science given the nature of the evidence provided.
