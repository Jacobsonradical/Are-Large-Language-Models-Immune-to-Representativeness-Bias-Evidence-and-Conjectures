To solve this, we need to calculate the probabilities according to Bayes' Rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific numerical values for these probabilities, we'll have to make reasonable qualitative assumptions.

### Assumptions:
- \( P(H) \): The base probability of a graduate student being in each field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he's in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he isn't in that field.
- \( P(E) \): The overall likelihood of Adam's personality characteristics, which can be considered constant across the different computations.

Based on Adam's interests and personality sketch (E):

1. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): This is generally a common field, so we assume it's moderately high.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Lower, as the personality traits related to nature, empathy, and animals are less typical for business students.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Moderately high since these qualities are generally present in other fields.
   
   Given the lower match with the personality sketch:
   
   \[
   P(H|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \text{ is relatively low.}
   \]

   Let's assign a value:

   \[
   \text{"business administration"}: 0.1
   \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Probably less common than business administration as a graduate field.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Very high, considering his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Lower, because these traits are very specific and align closely with this field.
   
   Given the strong alignment with the personality sketch:
   
   \[
   P(H|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \text{ is relatively high.}
   \]

   Let's assign a value:

   \[
   \text{"agricultural and veterinary science"}: 0.8
   \]

3. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): High, as computer science is a very common graduate field.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Moderately high, as high intelligence and puzzle-solving are valued, but less so empathy and love for nature.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Moderately high, but less so than for agricultural science.
   
   Given the partial alignment with the personality sketch:
   
   \[
   P(H|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \text{ is moderate.}
   \]

   Let's assign a value:

   \[
   \text{"computer science"}: 0.3
   \]

### Summary:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These values reflect the probabilities based on Adam's personality traits and the typical characteristics of students in each field.
