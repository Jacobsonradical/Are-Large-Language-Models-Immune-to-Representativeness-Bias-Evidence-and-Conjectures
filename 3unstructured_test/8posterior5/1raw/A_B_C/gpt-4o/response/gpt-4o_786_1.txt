To compute the probabilities, let's follow the steps you've indicated:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being in each particular field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the evidence given the hypothesis.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of the evidence given the hypothesis is false.
4. **P(H|E)**: The posterior probability using Bayes' rule.

Let's denote the fields of specialization as follows:
- A: agricultural and veterinary science
- B: business administration
- C: computer science

### Step 1: Estimate Prior Probabilities (P(H))

Assume that out of the general graduate student population:
- P(A): Let's say around 5% of graduate students are in agricultural and veterinary science.
- P(B): Around 15% of graduate students are in business administration.
- P(C): Around 20% of graduate students are in computer science.

For simplicity in estimation:
- P(A) = 0.05
- P(B) = 0.15
- P(C) = 0.20

### Step 2: Estimate P(E|H)

- **P(E|A)**: The likelihood that someone in agricultural and veterinary science has Adam's traits.
  Given Adam's interests, this seems very high, say 0.9.
  
- **P(E|B)**: The likelihood that someone in business administration has Adam's traits.
  Since this field doesn't align well with his traits, let's say itâ€™s low, around 0.03.
  
- **P(E|C)**: The likelihood that someone in computer science has Adam's traits.
  While there is some alignment (e.g., intelligence, problem-solving), it is not primary. Let's estimate it around 0.2.

### Step 3: Estimate P(E|\neg H)

This is the likelihood that someone in the general graduate population (not necessarily from agricultural and veterinary science, business administration, or computer science) has Adam's traits. This could realistically be around 0.1.

### Step 4: Calculate the Posterior Probability (P(H|E)) using Bayes' Rule

Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_1)P(H_1) + P(E|H_2)P(H_2) + P(E|H_3)P(H_3) + ... \]
For simplicity, we'll assume the selected fields are the only possibilities (even though they aren't), just to normalize it:

\[ P(E) = 0.9 \cdot 0.05 + 0.03 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.20 + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - 0.05 - 0.15 - 0.20) \]

Let's break this down:
\[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.05) + (0.03 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.20) + (0.1 \cdot 0.60) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.045 + 0.0045 + 0.04 + 0.06 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.1495 \]

Now let's compute the posterior probability for each hypothesis:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (A)**:
\[ P(A|E) = \frac{P(E|A)P(A)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.1495} \approx \frac{0.045}{0.1495} \approx 0.301 \]

- **Business Administration (B)**:
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B)P(B)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.03 \cdot 0.15}{0.1495} \approx \frac{0.0045}{0.1495} \approx 0.030 \]

- **Computer Science (C)**:
\[ P(C|E) = \frac{P(E|C)P(C)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.20}{0.1495} \approx \frac{0.04}{0.1495} \approx 0.267 \]

### Final Answers

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.301,
  "business administration": 0.030,
  "computer science": 0.267
}
```

These values suggest that Adam is most likely enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science followed by computer science, with business administration being the least likely.
