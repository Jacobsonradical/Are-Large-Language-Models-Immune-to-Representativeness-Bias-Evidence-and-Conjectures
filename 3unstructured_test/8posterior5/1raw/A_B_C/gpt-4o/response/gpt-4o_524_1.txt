To calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' theorem for each field, we need to determine the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihoods for the complement \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Bayes' Theorem is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll consider plausible values for each term to derive our final probabilities.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
    - \( P(H) \): This represents the general probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume there is a low but non-trivial percentage of graduate students in this field. Let's take \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \).
    - \( P(E|H) \): Given the description of Adam, his interests and traits closely align with those required in agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, \( P(E|H) \) is quite high, let's say \( 0.8 \).
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): This represents the probability of having Adam's personality sketch if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Given that there are many fields not matching Adam's interests as closely, let's say \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \).

2. **Business Administration**
    - \( P(H) \): Similarly, assume a moderate percentage, say \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \).
    - \( P(E|H) \): The traits described do not strongly align with business administration, where communication and leadership might be more critical. We can assume this is quite low, say \( 0.1 \).
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of having Adam's personality if he is not in business administration might be higher, as many fields match his description better. Let \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.6 \).

3. **Computer Science**
    - \( P(H) \): Assume a higher percentage due to the popularity of this field, say \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \).
    - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts can align well with computer science. Let's estimate \( 0.6 \).
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): This might be slightly less, considering there are specific fields better matching Adam's natural curiosity about nature and plants. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \).

Given \( P(E) \) is the same in all scenarios and acts as a normalizing constant, we don't need to precisely calculate it. The relative ratios in \( P(H|E) \) will suffice.

Let's plug in these numbers:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = 0.08 \]

2. **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = 0.02 \]

3. **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} = 0.18 \]

To provide these as values:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08,
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.18
}

These are proportional values representing the likelihoods given Adam's personality traits and interests.
