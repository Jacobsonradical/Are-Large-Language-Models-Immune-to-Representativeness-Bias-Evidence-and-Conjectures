First, let's define the necessary probabilities for each field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \(P(H)\): The general probability that any graduate student might be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume \(P(H) = 0.1\), given that it's a less common field compared to others.
- \(P(E|H)\): The probability that the personality sketch \(E\) matches if Adam is indeed studying agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, \(P(E|H) = 0.9\).
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability that the personality sketch \(E\) fits someone not in agricultural and veterinary science. While these traits could apply to other fields, they are less likely. Let's assume \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.3\).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \(P(E)\) is the total probability of the evidence, calculated as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.9 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.09 + 0.27 = 0.36 \]

Now, compute \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{0.36} \approx 0.25 \]

### Computer Science
- \(P(H)\): The general probability that any graduate student might be enrolled in computer science, a relatively common field. Let's assume \(P(H) = 0.2\).
- \(P(E|H)\): The probability that the personality sketch \(E\) matches if Adam is studying computer science. Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, so \(P(E|H) = 0.6\).
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability that the personality sketch \(E\) fits someone not in computer science. Assume this to be \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.35\).

Calculate \(P(E)\):
\[ P(E) = 0.6 \cdot 0.2 + 0.35 \cdot 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.28 = 0.4 \]

Now, compute \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{0.4} = 0.3 \]

### Business Administration
- \(P(H)\): The probability that any graduate student might be enrolled in business administration. Letâ€™s assume \(P(H) = 0.15\).
- \(P(E|H)\): The probability that the personality sketch \(E\) matches if Adam is studying business administration. His warm heart and strong empathy are somewhat relevant but not as directly aligned as with the other fields. Let's assume \(P(E|H) = 0.4\).
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability that the personality sketch \(E\) fits someone not in business administration. Assume \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.33\).

Calculate \(P(E)\):
\[ P(E) = 0.4 \cdot 0.15 + 0.33 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.06 + 0.2805 = 0.3405 \]

Now, compute \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.15}{0.3405} \approx 0.176 \]

### Summary
Given the above calculations, the posterior probabilities are approximately:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.25,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.176
}

These values indicate the likelihood that Adam is enrolled in each field based on his personality sketch.
