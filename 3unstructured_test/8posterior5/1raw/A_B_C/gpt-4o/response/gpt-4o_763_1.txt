To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to first judge the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood of the evidence given the complement of the hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H) \). 

Given the personality sketch, Adam's characteristics align better with fields involving nature, animals, and logical thinking, which should be reflected in our estimates for \( P(E|H) \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: Let's assume there's a moderate probability that Adam was enrolled in this field because of his love for nature and animals. Let's set \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
- **P(E|H)**: Given his interests, there's a high likelihood that the personality sketch fits someone in this field. Let's set it to \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that someone not in this field would still match this personality sketch is lower. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

Applying Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{(0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.4 \cdot 0.85)} = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.34} = \frac{0.12}{0.46} \approx 0.26 \]

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: Let's assume a lower probability that Adam was enrolled in this field given his personality sketch doesn't align strongly with typical traits valued in business administration. We'll set \( P(H) = 0.05 \).
- **P(E|H)**: It's less likely that someone with this personality would be in business administration. Letâ€™s set \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that someone not in this field would still match this personality sketch is higher. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

Applying Bayes' rule:
\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.95 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.05}{(0.2 \cdot 0.05) + (0.5 \cdot 0.95)} = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.475} = \frac{0.01}{0.485} \approx 0.021 \]

### Computer Science
- **P(H)**: Let's assume a moderate probability as Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts, all of which align with computer science. Let's set \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
- **P(E|H)**: It's likely that the personality match is reasonably high for someone in computer science. Let's set it to \( P(E|H) = 0.6 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that someone not in this field would still match the personality sketch could be moderate. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

Applying Bayes' rule:
\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.8 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{(0.6 \cdot 0.2) + (0.4 \cdot 0.8)} = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.32} = \frac{0.12}{0.44} \approx 0.273 \]

Putting these together, we get the following:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.26,
  "business administration": 0.021,
  "computer science": 0.273
}
