To compute the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field based on the given personality sketch, we can use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the information, let's make some reasonable assumptions:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field. Since we have no additional data about the popularity of each field, let's assume they are equally likely for our computations (though in reality, fields can vary greatly in popularity).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is enrolled in a specific field. This will vary based on how well the personality sketch matches typical students in each field.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is not enrolled in the specific field.

Using reasonable approximations for these probabilities, we can compute the posterior probabilities for each specific field.

### 1. Computer Science

- **P(H)**: Given equal prior probability, assume \(P(H) = 1/3\).
- **P(E|H)**: Adam's love for animals and nature is less common in computer science, but his intelligence and puzzle-solving abilities align. Let's say \(P(E|H) = 0.3\).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability of observing E if Adam is not in computer science. Given that E aligns more with fields like agricultural science, assume \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.7\).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.3 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 0.1 \]

### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)**: Given equal prior probability, assume \(P(H) = 1/3\).
- **P(E|H)**: This field fits very well with Adam's curiosity about nature and love for animals. Let's assign \(P(E|H) = 0.9\).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Excluding agricultural and veterinary science makes it less likely to fit E completely. Assign \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.2\).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.9 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 0.3 \]

### 3. Business Administration

- **P(H)**: Given equal prior probability, assume \(P(H) = 1/3\).
- **P(E|H)**: Business administration does not align closely with Adam's love for nature and animals but moderately fits his intelligence and appreciation for hard work. Letâ€™s assume \(P(E|H) = 0.2\).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Considering other fields, nature-related or those involving animals might still better fit E. Assign \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.8\).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 0.067 \]

The final proportional probabilities need to be normalized if they must add up to 1, but since we don't need this for the given problem, we can present the results directly.

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.067
}
```

These values suggest that Adam is most likely to be in agricultural and veterinary science, followed by computer science, and least likely in business administration based on his personality sketch.
