To compute \(P(H|E)\), we need to use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \(P(E)\) is the same for all fields and will act as a normalizing constant, we can compare the relative values without knowing the exact number of \(P(E)\). Here’s a step-by-step breakdown to estimate:

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**:
    - \(P(H)\) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the given field.
    - This probability can be estimated based on the general distribution of graduate students across different fields in the U.S.
    - For simplicity, let’s assume:
        - \(P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.05\)
        - \(P(\text{computer science}) = 0.20\)
        - \(P(\text{business administration}) = 0.15\)

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**:
    - This is the probability of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam is in the specified field \(H\).
    - Based on the description:
        - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: High because of the interest in nature and animals.
        - Computer Science: Moderate, understanding abstract concepts fit, but the empathy and love for nature and animals less so.
        - Business Administration: Low, less alignment with empathy and love for nature/animals.
    - Let’s approximate:
        - \(P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.8\)
        - \(P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.4\)
        - \(P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.1\)

3. **Complement Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)**:
    - This is the probability of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam is not in the specified field \(H\).
    - Let’s assume the average for other fields is moderate:
        - \(P(E|\neg\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.4\)
        - \(P(E|\neg\text{computer science}) = 0.6\)
        - \(P(E|\neg\text{business administration}) = 0.7\)

Using these estimates, we can apply Bayes' rule. However, because \(P(E)\) is consistent across our comparisons, we can focus on the numerator:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Now let's calculate these values:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[ P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04 \]

2. **Computer Science**:
   \[ P(H|E) \propto 0.4 \cdot 0.20 = 0.08 \]

3. **Business Administration**:
   \[ P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.15 = 0.015 \]

Now normalize these values so they sum up to 1 (for comparison purposes):

\[ \text{Total} = 0.04 + 0.08 + 0.015 = 0.135 \]

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.135} \approx 0.296 \]

\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.135} \approx 0.593 \]

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.015}{0.135} \approx 0.111 \]

So, the final probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.296,
  "computer science": 0.593,
  "business administration": 0.111
}
