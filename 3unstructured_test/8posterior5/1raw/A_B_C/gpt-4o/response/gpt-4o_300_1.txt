Sure, let's evaluate the probabilities step by step for each hypothesis.

1. Business Administration
- P(H): Let's assume the prior probability that Adam is a business administration student is relatively low because his interests do not align closely with business administration. Let's say P(H) = 0.1
- P(E|H): The probability that Adam, having a personality sketch like E, would be enrolled in business administration is also low because business administration does not typically require a deep love for nature or animals. Let's estimate P(E|H) = 0.2
- P(E|\neg H): The probability of Adam having that personality sketch if he is not a business administration student is higher. Let's say P(E|\neg H) = 0.7

Now we apply Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.7 \cdot 0.9} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.63} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.65} \approx 0.03 \]

2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- P(H): Because of Adam's interests and attributes, the prior probability that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is higher. Let's assume P(H) = 0.5
- P(E|H): The probability that a student in this field would have a personality sketch like E is high. Let's estimate P(E|H) = 0.8
- P(E|\neg H): The probability of Adam having that personality sketch if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science is lower. Let's say P(E|\neg H) = 0.3

Now we apply Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.8 \cdot 0.5 + 0.3 \cdot 0.5} \approx \frac{0.4}{0.4 + 0.15} \approx \frac{0.4}{0.55} \approx 0.73 \]

3. Computer Science
- P(H): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science is moderate because his intelligence and interest in puzzles align with this field. Let's assume P(H) = 0.3
- P(E|H): A computer science student could have such a personality sketch, especially with the interest in solving puzzles. Let's estimate P(E|H) = 0.5
- P(E|\neg H): The probability of Adam having this personality sketch if he is not in computer science is moderately high. Let's say P(E|\neg H) = 0.6

Now we apply Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.3}{0.5 \cdot 0.3 + 0.6 \cdot 0.7} \approx \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.42} \approx \frac{0.15}{0.57} \approx 0.26 \]

Putting it all together:

{
  "business administration": 0.03,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.73,
  "computer science": 0.26
