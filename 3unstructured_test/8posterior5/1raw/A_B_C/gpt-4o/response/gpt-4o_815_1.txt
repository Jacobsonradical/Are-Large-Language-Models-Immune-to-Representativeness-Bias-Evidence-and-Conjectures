To answer this question, we need to follow Bayes' Theorem: 

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(H|E)\) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given the personality sketch \(E\).
- \(P(E|H)\) is the probability of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam was enrolled in the specific field \(H\).
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in any given field (which we'll assume is a uniform distribution due to lack of other information).
- \(P(E)\) is the total probability of observing the personality sketch \(E\), which we will not calculate explicitly but can infer the relative probabilities.

Since \(P(E)\) is common to all fields, we can focus on the numerator \(P(E|H) \cdot P(H)\) for comparability.

Let's set prior probabilities \(P(H)\) based on their assumed popularity among graduate students, making it relatively uniform:

\[P(computer science) = 0.33\]
\[P(agricultural and veterinary science) = 0.33\]
\[P(business administration) = 0.33\]

Considering Adam's personality sketch \(E\), let's estimate \(P(E|H)\):
- Computer Science: Moderate probability since interests in puzzles and high intelligence might align.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: High probability since interests in nature, plants, animals, and empathy are strongly aligned.
- Business Administration: Low probability since the traits like deep love for animals and empathy are less typical.

\[P(E|Computer Science) \approx 0.4\]
\[P(E|Agricultural and Veterinary Science) \approx 0.7\]
\[P(E|Business Administration) \approx 0.2\]

Given these, we compare:

\[P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \times P(H)\]

Let's calculate:

1. **Computer Science**
\[P(H|E) \propto 0.4 \times 0.33 = 0.132\]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
\[P(H|E) \propto 0.7 \times 0.33 = 0.231\]

3. **Business Administration**
\[P(H|E) \propto 0.2 \times 0.33 = 0.066\]

Considering these values, we can normalize them by dividing each value by their sum (0.132 + 0.231 + 0.066 = 0.429):

1. Computer Science: \(\frac{0.132}{0.429} \approx 0.308\)
2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \(\frac{0.231}{0.429} \approx 0.538\)
3. Business Administration: \(\frac{0.066}{0.429} \approx 0.154\)

Thus, the relative probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.308,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.538,
  "business administration": 0.154
}
