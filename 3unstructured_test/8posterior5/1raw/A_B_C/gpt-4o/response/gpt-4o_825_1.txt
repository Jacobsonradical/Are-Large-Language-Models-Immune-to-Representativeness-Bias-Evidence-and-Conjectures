Let's denote:

- \( P(H) \) as the prior probability of Adam being in the specified field.
- \( P(E|H) \) as the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in the specified field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) as the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is *not* enrolled in the specified field.
- \( P(H|E) \) as the posterior probability of Adam being in the specified field given his personality sketch.

Let's make plausible assumptions about these probabilities based on the personality sketch provided:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - \( P(H) \): Assume the prior probability of a typical student being in this field among all possible graduate fields is moderate, say 0.1 (10%).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given his empathy, love for animals, genuine curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work, it is very likely that Adam fits in this field. Let's say 0.8 (80%).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given that most other fields would not align as closely with these characteristics, we can assume this to be low. Let's say 0.2 (20%).

2. **Business Administration**
   - \( P(H) \): Assume the prior probability of a typical student being in this field, say 0.1 (10%).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's personality traits, it is unlikely that he would be in a business administration field. Let's say 0.1 (10%).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given his traits, it's likely that he wouldn't fit into this field or many other non-aligned fields. So \( P(E|\neg H) \) could be approximately the same, say 0.2 (20%).

3. **Computer Science**
   - \( P(H) \): Assume the prior probability of a typical student being in this field, say 0.2 (20%).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts, it is plausible but not as strong as agricultural and veterinary science. Say 0.5 (50%).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Similarly, considering students not in this field have about the same disjointed traits with Adam, say 0.2 (20%).

Now applying Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Since we are only interested in comparisons and proportions, the denominator \( P(E) \) serves as a normalizing constant and can be omitted from the relative calculations.

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.1 = 0.01 \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.5 \cdot 0.2 = 0.1 \]

To get a normalizing constant:
\[ C = 0.08 + 0.01 + 0.1 = 0.19 \]

Normalized probabilities:

\[ P(H|E)_{agricultural \ and \ veterinary \ science} = 0.08 / 0.19 \approx 0.421 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{business \ administration} = 0.01 / 0.19 \approx 0.053 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{computer \ science} = 0.1 / 0.19 \approx 0.526 \]

Therefore, the output in the required format will be:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.42,
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.53
}
