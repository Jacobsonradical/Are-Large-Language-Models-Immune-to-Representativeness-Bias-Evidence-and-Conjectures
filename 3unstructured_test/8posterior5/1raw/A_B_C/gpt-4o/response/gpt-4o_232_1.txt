To apply Bayes' theorem and calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need conditional probabilities \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \), as well as the prior \( P(H) \). Let's assume some reasonable approximations for these probabilities based on typical characteristics of students in these fields and the personality sketch provided.

### Assumptions:

**P(H):** The prior probability of Adam being in each field. Let's assume a uniform distribution across a wide range of fields, for simplicity.
- \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.1 \)

**P(E|H):** The probability of Adam having the characteristics described if he is in each field.

1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
   - **P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}):** Likely high due to his interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy.
     - \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.9 \)
   
2. Business Administration:
   - **P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}):** Likely low because his characteristics (interest in nature, animals) are less aligned with typical business administration students.
     - \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.2 \)
   
3. Computer Science:
   - **P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}):** Moderate, considering his intelligence and interest in solving puzzles align well.
     - \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.6 \)

**P(E|\neg H):** The probability of Adam having these characteristics if he is not in the specified field. We approximate this based on the overall likelihood of such characteristics across all fields.
  
- Given the diversity of graduate fields, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \) for simplicity in each case.

### Calculations:

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H)) \]

1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
   \[
   P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) = 0.09 + 0.27 = 0.36
   \]
   \[
   P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{0.36} = \frac{0.09}{0.36} = 0.25
   \]

2. Business Administration:
   \[
   P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) = 0.02 + 0.27 = 0.29
   \]
   \[
   P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.29} = \frac{0.02}{0.29} \approx 0.07
   \]

3. Computer Science:
   \[
   P(E) = (0.6 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) = 0.06 + 0.27 = 0.33
   \]
   \[
   P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.1}{0.33} = \frac{0.06}{0.33} \approx 0.18
   \]

### Results:
\[
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.25,
  "business administration": 0.07,
  "computer science": 0.18
}
\]
