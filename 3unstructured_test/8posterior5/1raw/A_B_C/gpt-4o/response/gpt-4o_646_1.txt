Sure, let's break down the probabilities according to Bayes' rule and the given sketch.

Here’s a summary of the steps we need to take:
1. Assess \( P(H) \) – the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field.
2. Assess \( P(E|H) \) – the probability of observing E given that H is true.
3. Assess \( P(E|\neg H) \) – the probability of observing E given that H is false.
4. Use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \).

For simplicity, we'll make reasonable assumptions based on the description provided.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H)**: Graduate students in agricultural and veterinary science are relatively common but not overly so. Let's say \( P(H_{AV}) = 0.1 \) (10%).
2. **P(E|H)**: The personality sketch fits very well with agricultural and veterinary science (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciating hard work). Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{AV}) = 0.9 \).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The sketch strongly fits with agriculture and veterinary science, less so with the general population of all other graduate fields. Let's say \( P(E|\neg H_{AV}) = 0.2 \).

Using Bayes’ Rule:
\[ P(H_{AV}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AV}) \cdot P(H_{AV})}{P(E)} \]

Estimating \( P(E) \) (the normalizing constant):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{AV}) \cdot P(H_{AV}) + P(E|\neg H_{AV}) \cdot P(\neg H_{AV}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.9 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9 = 0.09 + 0.18 = 0.27 \]

Therefore:
\[ P(H_{AV}|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.1}{0.27} \approx 0.33 \]

### Computer Science
1. **P(H)**: Graduate students in computer science are quite common. Let's say \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.2 \) (20%).
2. **P(E|H)**: The personality sketch fits moderately well with computer science (high intelligence, solving puzzles). Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.4 \).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Given as 0.2 in the previous computation period.

Using Bayes’ Rule:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) \] is the same as before: 0.27.

Therefore:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.2}{0.27} \approx 0.30 \]

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)**: Graduate students in business administration are common. Let's say \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.2 \) (20%).
2. **P(E|H)**: The personality sketch fits less well with business administration (warm heart and empathy might fit, but not the rest). Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.2 \).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Same as before, 0.2.

Using Bayes’ Rule:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) \] is the same as before: 0.27.

Therefore:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.2}{0.27} \approx 0.15 \]

So, summarizing the results, we have:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.33,
  "computer science": 0.30,
  "business administration": 0.15
}

(Note: These values do not need to sum to 1 as stated in the prompt. They represent the relative probabilities given the provided evidence.)
