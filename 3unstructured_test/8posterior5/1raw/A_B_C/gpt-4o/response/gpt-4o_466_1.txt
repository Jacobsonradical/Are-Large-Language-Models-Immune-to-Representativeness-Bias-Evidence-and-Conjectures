To calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, we'll employ Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalization factor that remains constant across all fields, we'll focus on computing \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for each hypothesis and then we can compare relative values.

Let's analyze the probabilities for each field:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(H_{CS}) \): Prior probability of a graduate student being in computer science. Let's make an estimate and assume that 25% of graduate students are in computer science.
   - \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): The probability of Adam's characteristics given he's in computer science. High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts fit, but not as well as a strong nature curiosity or animal empathy. Let's estimate this at 0.2.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \): The probability of Adam's characteristics given he's not in computer science. Given the diverse range of other fields and not so specific tie to computer science, we can guess this at 0.8.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H_{AV}) \): Prior probability of a graduate student being in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's say 10%.
   - \( P(E|H_{AV}) \): The probability of Adam's characteristics given he's in agricultural and veterinary science. Strong fit with nature curiosity and empathy for animals. Let's estimate this at 0.9.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{AV}) \): The probability of Adam's characteristics given he's not in agricultural and veterinary science: 0.3.

3. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H_{BA}) \): Prior probability of a graduate student being in business administration. Assume 20%.
   - \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): The probability of Adam's characteristics given he's in business administration. Weak fit due to mismatch with nature curiosity, puzzles, and empathy for animals. Let’s say 0.1.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \): The probability of Adam's characteristics given he's not in business administration. Let's estimate this at 0.7.

Now let's compute the products \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for each field:

- Computer Science: \( 0.2 \times 0.25 = 0.05 \)
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( 0.9 \times 0.10 = 0.09 \)
- Business Administration: \( 0.1 \times 0.20 = 0.02 \)

These values represent the relative probabilities up to a normalization constant. To provide these as relative measures, we can normalize them so they sum up to 1:

- Sum of the values: \( 0.05 + 0.09 + 0.02 = 0.16 \)

Now we scale each value by dividing by 0.16:

- Computer Science: \( \frac{0.05}{0.16} \approx 0.3125 \)
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( \frac{0.09}{0.16} \approx 0.5625 \)
- Business Administration: \( \frac{0.02}{0.16} \approx 0.125 \)

Let’s express the result in the required format:

{
  "computer science": 0.3125,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5625,
  "business administration": 0.125
}
