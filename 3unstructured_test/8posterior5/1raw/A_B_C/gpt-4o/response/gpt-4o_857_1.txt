To begin the process, let's judge the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field. 

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   
   - **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given no additional information. Assuming equal distribution among possible fields, a general estimate might be around 0.1.
   - **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood of Adam having the characteristics described given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science seems high, as this field matches his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and quiet disposition that might fit research-related activities (0.8).
   - **Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of having the characteristics described given that Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Assuming there are many other fields, and considering that animals and nature are less relevant in many of them, I will estimate this to be around 0.2.

2. **Business Administration**
   
   - **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration is lower, given his personality sketch. Let's estimate it to be around 0.05.
   - **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood of Adam having the characteristics described given that he is in business administration seems lower (0.1), as it typically requires a different skill set and interests.
   - **Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Probability of having the characteristics described given that Adam is not in business administration might be slightly higher due to more matching alternative fields than the narrow business administration context. Let it be 0.3.

3. **Computer Science**

   - **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science might be around average among various fields, maybe around 0.15 given he is good at understanding abstract concepts and solving puzzles.
   - **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood of Adam having the characteristics described given that he is in computer science seems moderate (0.6).
   - **Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Given that computer science is a popular field and there are many other fitting fields, the probability of having the characteristics described but not being in computer science might be 0.4.

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Given \( P(\neg H) \) is the probability of not being in that field, which is approximately 1 minus \( P(H) \).

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) = 0.08 + 0.18 = 0.26 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.26} \approx 0.31 \]

**Business Administration:**

\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.05) + (0.3 \cdot 0.95) = 0.005 + 0.285 = 0.29 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.05}{0.29} \approx 0.017 \]

**Computer Science:**

\[ P(E) = (0.6 \cdot 0.15) + (0.4 \cdot 0.85) = 0.09 + 0.34 = 0.43 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.15}{0.43} \approx 0.209 \]

So, the probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.31,
  "business administration": 0.017,
  "computer science": 0.209
}
