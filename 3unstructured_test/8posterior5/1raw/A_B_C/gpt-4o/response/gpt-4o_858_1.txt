To apply Bayes' theorem, we need to estimate the conditional probabilities:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the fields.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability that the personality sketch E applies to Adam given that he is in each field.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability that the personality sketch E applies to Adam given that he is not in each field.

And then we compute:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant to ensure the probabilities sum to 1.

Let's provide reasonable values for each:

### Field: Computer Science

**P(H)** (Prior Probability): 
Let's assume the general distribution of graduate students across fields in the U.S. Computer Science is quite popular, but it's not the most common field.

\[ P(H)_{CS} \approx 0.2 \]

**P(E|H)** (Likelihood): 
Adam's personality sketch suggests a strong interest in nature and empathy, which are not typical characteristics of many computer science students.

\[ P(E|H)_{CS} \approx 0.1 \]

**P(E|¬H)** (Complement Likelihood): 
Given that Adam's traits are typical of students in other fields, let's set this to a moderate value.

\[ P(E|¬H)_{CS} \approx 0.6 \]

### Field: Business Administration

**P(H)** (Prior Probability): 
Business Administration is another popular field, likely with a comparable base rate to computer science.

\[ P(H)_{BA} \approx 0.2 \]

**P(E|H)** (Likelihood): 
Adam’s personality traits (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals) are not typical of many business administration students.

\[ P(E|H)_{BA} \approx 0.05 \]

**P(E|¬H)** (Complement Likelihood): 
The traits may be more common in other graduate programs.

\[ P(E|¬H)_{BA} \approx 0.65 \]

### Field: Agricultural and Veterinary Science

**P(H)** (Prior Probability): 
Agricultural and Veterinary Science is less common than other broad fields but fits Adam’s personality well.

\[ P(H)_{AVS} \approx 0.1 \]

**P(E|H)** (Likelihood): 
Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy align closely with the profiles of students in this field.

\[ P(E|H)_{AVS} \approx 0.9 \]

**P(E|¬H)** (Complement Likelihood): 
His traits are less common in other fields.

\[ P(E|¬H)_{AVS} \approx 0.3 \]

### Compute P(H|E) for Each Field

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We can disregard \( P(E) \) because we are interested in relative probabilities.

1. **Computer Science**:

\[ P(CS|E) \propto P(E|CS) \cdot P(CS) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

2. **Business Administration**:

\[ P(BA|E) \propto P(E|BA) \cdot P(BA) = 0.05 \cdot 0.2 = 0.01 \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:

\[ P(AVS|E) \propto P(E|AVS) \cdot P(AVS) = 0.9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.09 \]

Since we are only interested in the relative probabilities, we don't need to normalize. Thus, considering the contextual analysis, we get:

{
  "computer science": 0.02,
  "business administration": 0.01,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.09
}
