Given Adam's personality sketch and applying Bayesian analysis, we need to estimate \( P(H|E) \) for each graduate field \( H \) based on the given evidence \( E \):

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1)**
   - **P(H1)**: This field is relatively specialized, so the prior might be low.
     Let's assume \( P(H1) = 0.1 \)
   - **P(E|H1)**: Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals closely aligns with this field, making the evidence highly likely given this hypothesis.
     Let's assume \( P(E|H1) = 0.8 \)
   - **P(E|\neg H1)**: The probability of Adam having these traits without being in this field might be lower.
     Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H1) = 0.3 \)

2. **Business Administration (H2)**
   - **P(H2)**: This field is more common among graduate students, so the prior might be higher.
     Let's assume \( P(H2) = 0.2 \)
   - **P(E|H2)**: Adam's personality sketch does not strongly correlate with typical traits needed in business administration.
     Let's assume \( P(E|H2) = 0.2 \)
   - **P(E|\neg H2)**: The probability of Adam having these traits without being in this field might be higher.
     Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H2) = 0.5 \)

3. **Computer Science (H3)**
   - **P(H3)**: This field is also common among graduate students, so the prior might be higher.
     Let's assume \( P(H3) = 0.2 \)
   - **P(E|H3)**: Adam's intelligence and interest in abstract concepts somewhat align with this field.
     Let's assume \( P(E|H3) = 0.4 \)
   - **P(E|\neg H3)**: The probability of Adam having these traits without being in this field might be higher.
     Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H3) = 0.5 \)

Now we use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
\]

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[
P(H1|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.27} = \frac{0.08}{0.35} = \approx 0.229
\]

2. **Business Administration**:
\[
P(H2|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.2 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.4} = \frac{0.04}{0.44} = \approx 0.091
\]

3. **Computer Science**:
\[
P(H3|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.4} = \frac{0.08}{0.48} = \approx 0.167
\]

So, the computed probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.229,
  "business administration": 0.091,
  "computer science": 0.167
}
```
