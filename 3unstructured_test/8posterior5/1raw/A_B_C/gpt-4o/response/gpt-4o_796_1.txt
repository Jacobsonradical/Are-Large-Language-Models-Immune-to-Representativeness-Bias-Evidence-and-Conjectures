To apply Bayes' rule and compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need estimates for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Let's go through each field one by one.

### Computer Science
1. **\( P(H) \) (Prior probability)**: A general estimate for a graduate student being in computer science. Let's assume it's relatively popular: \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
2. **\( P(E|H) \) (Likelihood)**: Given Adam's personality sketch, how likely it is that he is enrolled in Computer Science? The curiosity, intelligence, and appreciation for puzzles align well, but empathy and love for animals might be less relevant. Let's assign \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).
3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \) (Likelihood of E given not H)**: Considering Adam's personality is a better fit for agricultural and veterinary science, we assign \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.02 \) (an explicitly common field aligning with his description).

Applying Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence and can be considered as a normalizing constant. We'll compute P(H|E) accounting for proportionality:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.3 \times 0.2 = 0.06 \]

### Business Administration
1. **\( P(H) \) Bo (Prior probability)**: A general estimate for a graduate student being in business administration. Let's assume: \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
2. **\( P(E|H) \) (Likelihood)**: Given Adam's personality sketch, how likely it is that he is enrolled in Business Administration? It's less probable except for the appreciation for hard work: \( P(E|H) = 0.05 \).
3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \) (Likelihood of E given not H)**: Again, we assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.02 \).

Applying Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.05 \times 0.1 = 0.005 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **\( P(H) \) (Prior probability)**: A general estimate for a graduate student being in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume it's less common: \( P(H) = 0.05 \).
2. **\( P(E|H) \) (Likelihood)**: Given Adam's love for nature, plants, animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work, this field seems like a strong fit: \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).
3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \) (Likelihood of E given not H)**: Assuming \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.02\).

Applying Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.9 \times 0.05 = 0.045 \]

Finally, let's compile the results:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.06,
  "business administration": 0.005,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.045
}
```

These values indicate the relative probabilities given the evidence without normalizing against other possibilities.
