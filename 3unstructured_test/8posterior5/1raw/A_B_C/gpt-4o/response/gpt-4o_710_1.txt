To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field, I'll use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the fields:

- Business Administration
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- Computer Science

and the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, we need to determine \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each case. For simplicity, I'll assume that all graduate specializations initially have equal prior probabilities. Without more specific information, let's assign \( P(H) = 0.33 \) for each.

**Assumptions**:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given that Adam has a deep love for nature and animals and enjoys solving puzzles, this does not align very closely with a stereotypical business administration student's interests. Let's estimate this as relatively low.
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 1 \) (assuming equal distribution of other fields as well)
   - Given the broad nature of \( \neg H \), let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \)

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam’s genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and love for animals align closely with this field. This likelihood is high.
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \) (since this matches a specific set of characteristics)

3. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts, aligning somewhat with computer science. However, his love for animals and nature is less aligned.
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.4 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \)

Now, calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule:

Let’s assume \( P(E) \approx P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \). Since our prior probabilities are equal, this simplifies our calculations.

**For Business Administration**:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.33}{0.1 \times 0.33 + 0.5 \times 0.67} \approx \frac{0.033}{0.033 + 0.335} \approx 0.089
\]

**For Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.33}{0.8 \times 0.33 + 0.2 \times 0.67} \approx \frac{0.264}{0.264 + 0.134} \approx 0.66
\]

**For Computer Science**:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \times 0.33}{0.4 \times 0.33 + 0.3 \times 0.67} \approx \frac{0.132}{0.132 + 0.201} \approx 0.396
\]

Therefore, based on these calculations, the probabilities that Adam is enrolled in each of the fields given his personality sketch are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.089,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.66,
  "computer science": 0.396
}
