Sure, we can use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probability, \( P(H|E) \), for each field given the personality sketch of Adam. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we do not have the exact values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \), I'll make reasonable assumptions based on Adam’s personality sketch to estimate these probabilities.

### Assumptions:
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field. We might assume a uniform probability for simplification, considering no field has inherently more probability without evidence.
   
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood that Adam’s personality sketch matches the typical profile of a student in each field.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood that Adam’s personality sketch matches the profile of a student not in each particular field.

### Estimations
- **Computer Science**: Adam is intelligent and good with abstract concepts, which aligns well with the field. However, his strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature are not typically strong indicators for computer science.
  - P(H) for Computer Science: 0.2
  - P(E|H) for Computer Science: 0.3
  - P(E|\neg H) for Computer Science: 0.1

- **Business Administration**: This field values intelligence and understanding abstract concepts, but Adam's warm heart, empathy, and love of animals do not particularly align with typical traits for this field.
  - P(H) for Business Administration: 0.2
  - P(E|H) for Business Administration: 0.1
  - P(E|\neg H) for Business Administration: 0.15

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam’s deep love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work and dedication align strongly with this field.
  - P(H) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.2
  - P(E|H) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.6
  - P(E|\neg H) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.05

### Calculations
We’ll use the estimations to compute \( P(H|E) \).

1. **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} = \frac{P(E|H)_{\text{CS}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{CS}}}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

2. **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} = \frac{P(E|H)_{\text{BA}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{BA}}}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{AVS}} = \frac{P(E|H)_{\text{AVS}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{AVS}}}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{AVS}} \approx \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

### Normalization
For a proper posterior probability, these estimates should ideally be normalized such that their sum is equal to 1. However, the question allows the total not to sum up to 1, we provide non-normalized values here:
