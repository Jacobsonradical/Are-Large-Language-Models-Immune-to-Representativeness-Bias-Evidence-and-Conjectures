To solve this problem, we will start by estimating the following probabilities for each field:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam having the described personality, given that he is enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam having the described personality, given that he is not enrolled in that specific field.

Then, we will use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \), the probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch \( E \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing \( E \) across all fields and can be considered a normalizing constant. Since we are only focusing on three specific fields and not normalizing the total to 1, we can compare the relative probabilities.

### Field: Computer Science
- **\( P(H) \)**: Prior probability for being in Computer Science. Let's estimate this at 0.30, considering it's a common field for graduates.
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: Probability of having the personality given Computer Science. This might be low because the personality traits suggest more of an affinity towards nature rather than computing; let's estimate this at 0.2.
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Probability of having the personality given not in Computer Science, considering a broad spectrum of other fields; let's estimate this at 0.8.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.30}{P(E)} \]

### Field: Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **\( P(H) \)**: Prior probability for being in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Let's estimate this at 0.10, considering it's a less common graduate field compared to others.
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: Probability of having the personality given Agricultural and Veterinary Science. High, since the personality traits match well; let's estimate this at 0.9.
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Probability of having the personality given not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science; let's estimate this at 0.6.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.10}{P(E)} \]

### Field: Business Administration
- **\( P(H) \)**: Prior probability for being in Business Administration. Let's estimate this at 0.25, considering it's also common for graduates.
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: Probability of having the personality given Business Administration. This may be moderate given the traits donâ€™t align strongly; let's estimate this at 0.3.
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Probability of having the personality given not in Business Administration; let's estimate this at 0.7.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.25}{P(E)} \]

Now, using Bayes' rule and the relative comparison of \( P(H|E) \):

{
  "computer science": \( \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.30}{P(E)} = 0.06 \),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.10}{P(E)} = 0.09 \),
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.25}{P(E)} = 0.075 \)
}

Since \( P(E) \) is the same across all cases for comparison purposes and we don't need to compute its exact value as we're comparing solely within these fields, the approximate ratios are:

{
  "computer science": 0.06,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.09,
  "business administration": 0.075
}
