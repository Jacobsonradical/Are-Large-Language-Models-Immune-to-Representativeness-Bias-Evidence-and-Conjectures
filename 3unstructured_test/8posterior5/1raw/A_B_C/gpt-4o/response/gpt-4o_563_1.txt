To apply Bayes' rule for each hypothesis \( H \) that Adam was enrolled in a particular field, we need to compute the following:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that particular field.
- \( P(E | H) \): The probability that Adam's personality sketch \( E \) would be observed given that he was enrolled in the specific field \( H \).
- \( P(E | \neg H) \): The probability that Adam's personality sketch \( E \) would be observed given that he was not enrolled in the specific field \( H \).

Then, using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where \( P(E) \) can be calculated as:

\[ P(E) = P(E | H) \cdot P(H) + P(E | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's estimate these probabilities for each field based on the information provided about Adam.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H_{\text{ag}}) \): Let's assume this is relatively low for the general population of graduate students, so let's say \( 0.05 \).
- \( P(E | H_{\text{ag}}) \): Based on Adam's love for nature, animals and appreciation for hard work, this seems very consistent, so let's assign a high value such as \( 0.9 \).
- \( P(E | \neg H_{\text{ag}}) \): A moderate value considering these traits might fit students in other fields as well, let's set it to \( 0.4 \).

### Computer Science
- \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) \): Higher probability compared to other fields given its popularity, let's say \( 0.2 \).
- \( P(E | H_{\text{cs}}) \): Traits like high intelligence and problem-solving fit well, but nature and animals less so, so let's assign a value of \( 0.3 \).
- \( P(E | \neg H_{\text{cs}}) \): Considering Adam's particular mix, it could be relatively common in other fields too, so let's set it to \( 0.6 \).

### Business Administration
- \( P(H_{\text{ba}}) \): Fairly common field, let's assign \( 0.15 \).
- \( P(E | H_{\text{ba}}) \): Less alignment with traits like love for nature and animals, so a lower value like \( 0.1 \).
- \( P(E | \neg H_{\text{ba}}) \): These traits are more likely found outside business fields, so \( 0.6 \).

Now, let's calculate \( P(H | E) \):

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(E) \approx (0.9 \cdot 0.05) + (0.4 \cdot 0.95) = 0.045 + 0.38 = 0.425 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{ag}} | E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.425} \approx 0.106 \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(E) \approx (0.3 \cdot 0.2) + (0.6 \cdot 0.8) = 0.06 + 0.48 = 0.54 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}} | E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.54} \approx 0.111 \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(E) \approx (0.1 \cdot 0.15) + (0.6 \cdot 0.85) = 0.015 + 0.51 = 0.525 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{ba}} | E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{0.525} \approx 0.029 \]

Hence, the resulting probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.106,
  "computer science": 0.111,
  "business administration": 0.029
}
