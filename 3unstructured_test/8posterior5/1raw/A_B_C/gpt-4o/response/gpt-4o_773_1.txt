To apply Bayes' Rule for this scenario, we use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's assume for simplicity and illustration purposes that we have the following somewhat subjective prior probabilities (P(H)):

- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: P(H) = 0.1
- Business Administration: P(H) = 0.3
- Computer Science: P(H) = 0.4

We also need to consider how well the personality sketch (E) fits each field (P(E|H)):

- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 
  - Adam's interest in nature and plants, empathy, and love for animals are very consistent with this field. So let's say P(E|H) = 0.9.
- Business Administration: 
  - While Adam has high intelligence and an appreciation for hard work, the personality sketch does not strongly align with business administration. So let's say P(E|H) = 0.2.
- Computer Science: 
  - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, which aligns relatively well with computer science. So let's say P(E|H) = 0.5.

Next, we estimate the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch overall (P(E)), but since we are dealing with relative probabilities and for simplicity, we don't need to calculate the exact value of P(E) as it will cancel out during the normalization. Instead, we will calculate the relative magnitudes.

Now, using Bayes' Rule, we calculate P(H|E) for each field:

1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

2. Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \]

3. Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.4}{P(E)} \]

Let's calculate these ratios without the normalization factor:

- Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = 0.09 / P(E) \]

- Business Administration:
\[ \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} = 0.06 / P(E) \]

- Computer Science:
\[ \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.4}{P(E)} = 0.2 / P(E) \]

Finally, we normalize these values. The normalization factor \(P(E)\) is the sum of these unnormalized probabilities:

\[ P(E) = 0.09 + 0.06 + 0.2 = 0.35 \]

Now, we normalize each:

- Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.35} \approx 0.257 \]

- Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.35} \approx 0.171 \]

- Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \approx 0.571 \]

So, the resulting posterior probabilities are as follows:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.257,
  "business administration": 0.171,
  "computer science": 0.571
}
