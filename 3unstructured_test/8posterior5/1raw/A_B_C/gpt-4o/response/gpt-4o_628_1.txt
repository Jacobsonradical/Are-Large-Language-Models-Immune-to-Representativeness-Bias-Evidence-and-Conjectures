Let's use Bayes' Rule to determine the probability of Adam being enrolled in each field given the personality sketch \( E \).

Bayes' Rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability of hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of evidence \( E \).

Since \( P(E) \) is constant across hypotheses, we'll focus on computing \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

### Assumptions and Calculations

We need to make some assumptions about the priors and likelihoods:

1. **Business Administration (H1):**
   - \( P(H1) \): Let’s assume a moderate prior probability, 0.2.
   - \( P(E|H1) \): Adam’s traits seem less likely to align well with business administration. Let’s say 0.1.
   - \( P(E|\neg H1) \): The probability of evidence given not business admin, let’s consider it reasonably high, 0.5.

2. **Computer Science (H2):**
   - \( P(H2) \): Given the growing interest in this field, 0.3.
   - \( P(E|H2) \): While Adam’s intelligence aligns, his curiosity about nature and love for animals might make this less likely. Let’s assume 0.2.
   - \( P(E|\neg H2) \): Assume this probability is moderately high as well, 0.5.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H3):**
   - \( P(H3) \): This seems most aligned with Adam's interests. Let’s give it a prior probability of 0.1.
   - \( P(E|H3) \): Given Adam's traits, this field would have a high likelihood. Let’s say 0.4.
   - \( P(E|\neg H3) \): Assume this to be fairly high, as his traits are generally favorable for other fields, 0.6.

### Computation

Using the above assumptions:

1. **Business Administration:**
   \[
   P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1)}{P(E)}
           = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)}
   \]

2. **Computer Science:**
   \[
   P(H2|E) = \frac{P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2)}{P(E)}
           = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)}
   \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   \[
   P(H3|E) = \frac{P(E|H3) \cdot P(H3)}{P(E)}
           = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)}
   \]

We note that \( P(E) \) is a constant normalizing factor.

### Relative Probabilities

We can simplify these calculations by only comparing the numerators of each fraction since the denominators are the same:

- Business Administration: \( 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \)
- Computer Science: \( 0.2 \cdot 0.3 = 0.06 \)
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( 0.4 \cdot 0.1 = 0.04 \)

The relative magnitudes are:
- \( \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.06 + 0.04} = \frac{0.02}{0.12} = \frac{1}{6} \approx 0.167 \)
- \( \frac{0.06}{0.12} = 0.5 \)
- \( \frac{0.04}{0.12} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.333 \)

### Final Values

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.167,
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.333
}
```

These values represent the relative probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field given his personality sketch.
