To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we'll use Bayes' rule. We need \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be expressed as \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

However, since we don't have specific values for \( P(H) \), we'll make educated guesses based on general knowledge and the information given in Adam's personality sketch.

### Business Administration

- **P(H)**: Business administration is a popular graduate field, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.10 \).
- **P(E|H)**: Adam's interest in nature, empathy, and warm heart does not strongly align with typical business administration traits, so let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.02 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Given general graduate population, many won't align with his personality, let's assume \( P(E| \neg H) = 0.05 \).

Now, we compute:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{(0.02) \cdot (0.10)}{(0.02 \cdot 0.10 + 0.05 \cdot 0.90)}
= \frac{0.002}{0.002 + 0.045} = \frac{0.002}{0.047} \approx 0.043
\]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)**: Less common than some other graduate fields, but aligned with Adam's personality, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).
- **P(E|H)**: Adam's interests and traits strongly fit this field, so let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.90 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Given the general population not aligning with these fields, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.01 \).

Now, we compute:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{(0.90) \cdot (0.05)}{(0.90 \cdot 0.05 + 0.01 \cdot 0.95)}
= \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.0095} = \frac{0.045}{0.0545} \approx 0.826
\]

### Computer Science

- **P(H)**: A very popular graduate field, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.20 \).
- **P(E|H)**: Adam is intelligent and enjoys solving puzzles, which fits computer science well, so let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.50 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: General population, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.05 \).

Now, we compute:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{(0.50) \cdot (0.20)}{(0.50 \cdot 0.20 + 0.05 \cdot 0.80)}
= \frac{0.10}{0.10 + 0.04} = \frac{0.10}{0.14} \approx 0.714
\]

Now, let's put the answers together:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.043,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.826,
  "computer science": 0.714
}
