To determine the probabilities, we will use Bayesian reasoning. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch, which can be considered the sum of \( P(E|H) \times P(H) \) for all hypotheses plus \( P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \).

We analyze the fields using the given personality characteristics:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, and his empathy, this field matches well.
2. **Business Administration**: Less likely given the characteristics, which don't align well with the typical traits valued in business.
3. **Computer Science**: Good fit for high intelligence and abstract thinking but not necessarily for his love of nature and animals.

We'll assume some prior probabilities based on general popularity and distribution of these majors among graduates:

- \( P(H) \) for each field.
- P(E|H): Likelihood of Adam's personality if in this field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likelihood of Adam's personality if not in this field.
- \( P(E) \) can be considered constant across each calculation for this exercise's scope.

Let's estimate these probabilities:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Relatively fewer students. Assume: 0.10
   - \( P(E|H) \): High alignment. Assume: 0.80
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Overall less likely still observing such traits. Assume: 0.05

2. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): Popular major. Assume: 0.30
   - \( P(E|H) \): Low alignment. Assume: 0.05
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Similar low chance to exhibit such traits. Assume: 0.05

3. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Popular and common. Assume: 0.30
   - \( P(E|H) \): Moderate alignment (intelligence fits, nature and animals do not). Assume: 0.50
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Overall less but better than business. Assume: 0.10

Now calculate:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.10}{0.80 \times 0.10 + 0.05 \times 0.90} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.045} = \frac{0.08}{0.125} \approx 0.64
   \]

2. **Business Administration**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.30}{0.05 \times 0.30 + 0.05 \times 0.70} = \frac{0.015}{0.015 + 0.035} = \frac{0.015}{0.05} = 0.30
   \]

3. **Computer Science**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.50 \times 0.30}{0.50 \times 0.30 + 0.10 \times 0.70} = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.07} = \frac{0.15}{0.22} \approx 0.68
   \]

So, our hypothesis evaluations are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.64,
  "business administration": 0.30,
  "computer science": 0.68
