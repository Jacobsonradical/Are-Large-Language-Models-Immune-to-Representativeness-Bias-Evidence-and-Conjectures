Let's begin by assigning and estimating the values for each field of study:

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\):**
   - **Computer Science (CS):** Considering the popularity and common enrollment in CS programs, we might assign this a moderate probability.
   - **Business Administration (BA):** Given its wide range of applications and high enrollment, this would also be moderate.
   - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS):** This is less common compared to CS and BA, but still an important field, especially given Adam's interests.

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\):** The probability of observing the traits mentioned in Adam's sketch if he were in each respective field.
   - Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, AGS is the most aligned.
   - CS is also plausible due to his high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts.
   - BA seems less aligned with his personality traits, particularly his empathy and love for animals.

3. **Marginal Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\):** The probability of observing the traits mentioned if Adam were not in each respective field.
   - This is more subjective but will be assumed with the below values.

Using these estimates, we can calculate the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \(P(E)\) is a normalizing constant that ensures the sum of the probabilities is 1, not strictly necessary for individual calculations but theoretically:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs}) + P(E|H_{ba}) \cdot P(H_{ba}) + P(E|H_{avs}) \cdot P(H_{avs}) \]

### Values

Let's assume reasonable values:
1. **Prior Probabilities \(P(H)\):**
   - \(P(H_{cs}) = 0.4\)
   - \(P(H_{ba}) = 0.3\)
   - \(P(H_{avs}) = 0.2\)

2. **Likelihoods \(P(E|H)\):**
   - \(P(E|H_{cs}) = 0.5\)
   - \(P(E|H_{ba}) = 0.2\)
   - \(P(E|H_{avs}) = 0.9\)

3. **Marginal Likelihoods \(P(E|\neg H)\):**
   - These are subjective and depend on the overall prevalence of such traits across other fields. Let's assume:
   - \(P(E|\neg H_{cs}) = 0.45\)
   - \(P(E|\neg H_{ba}) = 0.35\)
   - \(P(E|\neg H_{avs}) = 0.55\)

Now compute the posterior probabilities using Bayes' rule:

### Posterior Calculations
1. **Computer Science:**
   \[
   P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.4}{P(E)}
   \]

2. **Business Administration:**
   \[
   P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{ba}) \cdot P(H_{ba})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)}
   \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   \[
   P(H_{avs}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{avs}) \cdot P(H_{avs})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)}
   \]

To find \(P(E)\):
\[
P(E) = (0.5 \cdot 0.4) + (0.2 \cdot 0.3) + (0.9 \cdot 0.2) = 0.2 + 0.06 + 0.18 = 0.44
\]

Now, the calculations:

1. **Computer Science:**
   \[
   P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.4}{0.44} = \frac{0.2}{0.44} \approx 0.4545
   \]

2. **Business Administration:**
   \[
   P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{0.44} = \frac{0.06}{0.44} \approx 0.1364
   \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   \[
   P(H_{avs}|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.2}{0.44} = \frac{0.18}{0.44} \approx 0.4091
   \]

Final approximate posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4545,
  "business administration": 0.1364,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4091
}
