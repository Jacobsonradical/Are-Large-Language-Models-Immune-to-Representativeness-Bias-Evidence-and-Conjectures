Sure, let's break down the calculations step-by-step.

We start by assuming some reasonable values for the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E | \neg H) \):

1. \(\mathbf{P(E|H)}\) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in a specific field.
2. \(\mathbf{P(E|\neg H)}\) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in that specific field.
3. \(\mathbf{P(H)}\) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the specific field without any personality information.
4. \(\mathbf{P(H|E)}\) is the posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in the specific field given his personality sketch.

### Assumptions for Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \):
Given the wide variety of fields available for graduate studies, I would assume reasonable base rates for graduate students:

- \(P(H_\text{computer science}) = 0.2\) (20%)
- \(P(H_\text{business administration}) = 0.15\) (15%)
- \(P(H_\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.1\) (10%)

### Assumptions for Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \):
We now assess how likely Adam's personality is in each field:

- \(P(E|H_\text{computer science}) = 0.3\): Computer scientists often value solving puzzles and have high intelligence, but his deep love for animals and nature may be less common in this field.
- \(P(E|H_\text{business administration}) = 0.1\): Business administration students are less likely to exhibit such strong empathy and a deep love for animals and nature.
- \(P(E|H_\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.7\): This field aligns well with Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, and animals.

### Probability of Personality Sketch \( P(E|\neg H) \)
We use the average likelihood if he is not in the field:

- \(P(E|\neg H_\text{computer science})\) = weighted average likelihood across other fields = 0.7 * 0.1 + 0.1 * 0.15 + other contributions.
- \(P(E|\neg H_\text{business administration})\) = weighted average = 0.7 * 0.1 + 0.3 * 0.2 + other contributions.
- \(P(E|\neg H_\text{agricultural and veterinary science})\) = weighted average = 0.1 * 0.2 + 0.3 * 0.15 + other contributions.

To simplify, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \) for \( H_\text{computer science} \), \( 0.25 \) for \( H_\text{business administration} \), and \( 0.4 \) for \( H_\text{agricultural and veterinary science} \) with the understanding that true averages would be slightly complicated due to distribution weights.

### Using Bayes' Rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

For each field:

- **Computer Science**:

\[
P(H_\text{cs}|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{0.3} = 0.2
\]

- **Business Administration**:

\[
P(H_\text{ba}|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.15}{0.25} = 0.06
\]

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:

\[
P(H_\text{avs}|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.1}{0.4} = 0.175
\]

### Posterior Probabilities:

\[
P(H|E) \approx
\begin{cases}
0.2, & \text{computer science}\\
0.06, & \text{business administration}\\
0.175, & \text{agricultural and veterinary science}
\end{cases}
\]

Here is the answer presented in the requested format:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.06,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.175
}
```
