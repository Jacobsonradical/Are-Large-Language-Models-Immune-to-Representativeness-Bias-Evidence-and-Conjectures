To apply Bayes' rule, we need to estimate each of the probabilities involved. Here’s a step-by-step approach:

1. **P(H)**: The general probability of a graduate student enrolling in a specific field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam having the described personality traits if he is enrolled in the specific field.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of Adam having the described personality traits if he is not enrolled in the specific field.
4. **P(H|E)**: The posterior probability we are looking to compute.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since the value of \( P(E) \) will be common across all hypotheses and just works as a normalizing factor, we can ignore it for comparing across fields. We'll simply compare the numerators, which gives us:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Now, let's estimate each term:

### 1. Computer Science
**P(H)**: An approximate proportion of grad students in computer science, say 0.20.
**P(E|H)**: Lower since the traits (nature, plants, empathy, animals) don't align strongly with typical computer science traits, say 0.05.
**P(E|¬H)**: Higher since these traits might be more common in other fields, say 0.40.

### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
**P(H)**: An approximate proportion of grad students in this field, say 0.05.
**P(E|H)**: High since the traits align well with this field, say 0.70.
**P(E|¬H)**: Lower since these traits strongly suggest this field over others, say 0.15.

### 3. Business Administration
**P(H)**: An approximate proportion of grad students in business administration, say 0.15.
**P(E|H)**: Lower since the traits don’t align well with typical business administration traits, say 0.10.
**P(E|¬H)**: Higher as typical business students might not have these traits, say 0.30.

### Calculating Posterior Probabilities
We use the proportional relation \( P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \):

1. **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.05 \cdot 0.20 = 0.01 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.70 \cdot 0.05 = 0.035 \]

3. **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.10 \cdot 0.15 = 0.015 \]

Now we normalize (though exact normalization doesn't change the relative ordering):

\[ \text{Normalization factor} = 0.01 + 0.035 + 0.015 = 0.06 \]

So the probabilities become:

1. **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.06} \approx 0.167 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.035}{0.06} \approx 0.583 \]

3. **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.015}{0.06} \approx 0.250 \]

Therefore, the results are:

{
  "computer science": 0.167,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.583,
  "business administration": 0.250
}
