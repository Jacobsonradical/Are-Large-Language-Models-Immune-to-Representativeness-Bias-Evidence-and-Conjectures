To determine the probabilities P(H|E) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to have an intuition about the base probabilities P(H), the likelihoods P(E|H), and the likelihoods for the complement P(E|¬H). 

We can reasonably make some assumptions based on the personality sketch and field characteristics:

1. **P(H):** Prior probabilities of being enrolled in each field.
2. **P(E|H):** Probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in the specified field.
3. **P(E|¬H):** Probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in the specified field.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \)

Let's assume the base probabilities P(H) (just as an illustration):
- P(business administration): 0.25
- P(agricultural and veterinary science): 0.15
- P(computer science): 0.3

Given Adam's described characteristics, we make the following educated guesses:
- P(E|business administration): Moderate empathy and puzzle-solving, but less direct alignment with nature and animals.
- P(E|agricultural and veterinary science): High alignment with nature, animals, empathy.
- P(E|computer science): High puzzle-solving and abstract thinking, moderate empathy.

Let's assign:
- P(E|business administration): 0.2
- P(E|agricultural and veterinary science): 0.8
- P(E|computer science): 0.5

For P(E|¬H):
- \( P(E|¬\text{business administration}) \): This is everything except business administration, which might be moderate on average. Let's set it to 0.4.
- \( P(E|¬\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \): This is everything except agricultural and veterinary science, which might be lower. Let's set it to 0.3.
- \( P(E|¬\text{computer science}) \): This is everything except computer science. Let's set it to 0.4.

Now, let's calculate P(H|E) for each:

### Business Administration
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.2 \cdot 0.25 + 0.4 \cdot 0.75} \approx \frac{0.05}{0.35} \approx 0.143 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.3 \cdot 0.85} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.375} \approx 0.32 \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.3}{0.5 \cdot 0.3 + 0.4 \cdot 0.7} \approx \frac{0.15}{0.43} \approx 0.349 \]

### Conclusion
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.143,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.32,
  "computer science": 0.349
}
```

These numbers suggest that given Adam's traits and characteristics described, he is more likely to be in Computer Science or Agricultural and Veterinary Science than in Business Administration, with a preference towards Computer Science just slightly higher than Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
