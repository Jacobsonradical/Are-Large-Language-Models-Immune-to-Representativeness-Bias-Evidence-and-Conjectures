To compute the posterior probability P(H|E) for each of the fields given Adam's personality sketch (E), we need to evaluate:

- P(H): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field.
- P(E|H): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he was enrolled in that field.
- P(E|¬H): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he was not enrolled in that field.

We then apply Bayes' rule, which is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we won't compute P(E) directly because it will cancel out when comparing fields (since it's the same in the denominator for each field). Instead, we'll compute relative probabilities and rank them.

### Evaluating Each Field

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

**P(H):** Moderate Probability  
Agricultural and Veterinary Science is a common field but not the most common one out of all graduate programs.

**P(E|H):** High Probability  
Adam’s genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align very well with agricultural and veterinary science.

**P(E|¬H):** Low Probability  
Other fields are less likely to fit his personality sketch as well as agricultural and veterinary science does.

#### Business Administration

**P(H):** High Probability  
Business administration is a very common graduate field in the U.S.

**P(E|H):** Low Probability  
Adam’s personality sketch does not strongly align with the traits typically associated with business administration (e.g., leadership, management focus).

**P(E|¬H):** Higher Probability  
Given Adam’s traits, it seems more likely he would be found in a field that deals directly with nature, animals, or abstract concepts.

#### Computer Science

**P(H):** Moderate to High Probability  
Computer science is a widespread field with many graduate students.

**P(E|H):** Moderate Probability  
Adam’s intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts fit well with computer science, but his empathy and love for nature and animals are not a perfect match.

**P(E|¬H):** Moderate Probability  
Similar reasons as above, the fit is not perfect but plausible.

### Relative Posterior Probabilities

Now we can qualitatively rank the posterior probabilities using Bayes' rule sensibly considering the given probabilities.

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science** has a high fit with Adam's personality sketch.
- **Business Administration** has a low fit due to the mismatch between his traits and typical business skills.
- **Computer Science** has a moderate fit since intelligence and abstract concepts fit, but elements relating to nature and animals do not.
