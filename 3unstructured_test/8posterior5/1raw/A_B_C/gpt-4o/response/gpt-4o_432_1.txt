To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \), we'll use Bayes' theorem, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a certain field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in the field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \).

We're interested in comparing \( P(H|E) \) for different fields. Since \( P(E) \) is a constant for all fields in the comparison, we can use the fact that:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

We need to assess reasonable values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field.

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- \( P(H) \): Agricultural and veterinary science is less common but plausible for someone interested in nature and animals. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): High probability since the personality sketch aligns well with this field. Let's set \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of having this personality sketch if not in this field is moderate. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.9 \times 0.15 = 0.135 \]

#### Computer Science:
- \( P(H) \): Computer science is a commonly chosen field and plausible given the interest in puzzles and high intelligence. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.4 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Moderate probability since the curiosity about nature and love for animals are less aligned, but the intelligence and puzzle solving are relevant. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.5 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of having this personality sketch if not in this field is moderate. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.5 \times 0.4 = 0.2 \]

#### Business Administration:
- \( P(H) \): Business administration is also a common field, though it seems less aligned with Adam's interests. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Low to moderate probability since the interests and empathy do not strongly align with typical business administration traits. Let's set \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of having this personality sketch if not in this field is moderate. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.2 \times 0.2 = 0.04 \]

Combining these calculations, we can form a comparative sense of \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.135,
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.04
}
```

This indicates that, given the personality sketch, Adam is most likely to be enrolled in Computer Science, followed by Agricultural and Veterinary Science, with Business Administration being the least likely field.
