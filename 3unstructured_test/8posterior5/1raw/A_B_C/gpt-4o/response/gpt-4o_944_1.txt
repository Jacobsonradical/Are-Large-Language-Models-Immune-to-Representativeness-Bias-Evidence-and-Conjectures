To estimate the probabilities, we need to use Bayes' rule, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in the specific field \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the specific field \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \).

Since \( P(E) \) is constant for all fields, we can use the simplified form:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

We will assign rough estimates to these probabilities based on the information given. Note that this is a subjective estimation.

### Assigning Probabilities:

#### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam would be enrolled in business administration might not be particularly high given his described interests, but not negligible. Let's say \( 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Given the personality sketch, business administration doesn't seem to highly correlate with his love for nature, animals, or solving puzzles. So let's assign a low probability, say \( 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Roughly a baseline for other fields might be \( 0.5 \).

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02 \]

#### Computer Science
- \( P(H) \): Let's suppose the prior probability that a graduate student is in computer science is higher due to its popularity. Let's assume \( 0.3 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts fit well with computer science, as does an interest in solving puzzles, so this could be relatively high, say \( 0.6 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Again, a baseline for other fields might be \( 0.5 \).

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.6 \times 0.3 = 0.18 \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): Given his love for nature, plants, and animals, the prior probability that he might be enrolled in this field would be reasonably high. Let's use \( 0.3 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): The personality sketch perfectly matches this field, so assign a high value, say \( 0.8 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): A baseline for other fields might be \( 0.5 \).

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \]

Putting these together and normalizing if needed:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.02",
  "computer science": "0.18",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.24"
}
```

The values above give relative probabilities and align with the personality sketch provided.
