To calculate \(P(H|E)\) for each field, we will need to follow these steps:

1. Determine \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being in each field.
2. Determine \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is in each field.
3. Determine \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is not in the given field.
4. Use Bayes' rule to calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \).

For simplicity, let's assume:
- \( P(H) \) to be equal among the fields, let's say \( P(H) = 1/3 \) for each field since we don't have any other information on the prior probabilities.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \), the probability of Adam's traits occurring if he isn't in the field, will also be challenging to determine exactly, so we will have to make educated guesses based on how likely the traits are generally given a typical population of graduate students.

Given this:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) = 0.33 \)
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that someone in computer science shares Adam's traits. Given his empathic nature, love for animals, and curiosity about nature, these traits might be less typical but not absent in computer science students, let's guess \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam’s traits appearing in fields other than computer science, given the wide presence of people oriented towards animals and nature might be quite higher, so let's use \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \).

   Using Bayes' rule, we calculate \( P(H|E) \):

   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.33}{(0.3 \times 0.33) + (0.5 \times 0.67)} = \frac{0.099}{0.099 + 0.335} \approx 0.228 
   \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) = 0.33 \)
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam’s traits are highly aligned with this field, \( P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): For fields outside of agricultural and veterinary science, the traits might be less common, \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \).

   Using Bayes' rule:

   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.33}{(0.9 \times 0.33) + (0.2 \times 0.67)} = \frac{0.297}{0.297 + 0.134} \approx 0.689 
   \]

3. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) = 0.33 \)
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given that curiosity about nature, empathy, and a love for animals are less typical in business administration, let's guess \( P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): This remains as before, assuming the same as the computer science case, let's use \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \).

   Using Bayes' rule:

   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.33}{(0.2 \times 0.33) + (0.5 \times 0.67)} = \frac{0.066}{0.066 + 0.335} \approx 0.165 
   \]

Combining these calculations, we get:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.228,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.689,
  "business administration": 0.165
}
