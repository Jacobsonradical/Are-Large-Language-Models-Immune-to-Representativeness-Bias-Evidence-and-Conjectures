To calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to understand \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). These terms can be interpreted as follows:

1. \( P(H) \) - The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field.
2. \( P(E|H) \) - The probability that the characteristics described in \( E \) would be observed if Adam were enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - The probability that the characteristics described in \( E \) would be observed if Adam were not enrolled in that field.

Given the personality sketch and field descriptions, we can make some educated guesses about these probabilities.

### Estimations:

#### Business Administration:
* \( P(H) \): Business administration is a relatively common field.
  * \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \)

* \( P(E|H) \): The characteristics of Adam (curiosity about nature, empathy, etc.) aren't typically strongly linked with business administration.
  * \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \)

* \( P(E|\neg H) \): General likelihood of finding these traits, given he's not in business administration.
  * \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \)

#### Computer Science:
* \( P(H) \): Computer science is also a common field.
  * \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \)

* \( P(E|H) \): Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which aligns with computer science.
  * \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \)

* \( P(E|\neg H) \): General likelihood of finding these traits, given he's not in computer science.
  * \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \)

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
* \( P(H) \): Less common than business administration or computer science but still substantial.
  * \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \)

* \( P(E|H) \): Adam's love for animals and curiosity about nature strongly align with agricultural and veterinary science.
  * \( P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \)

* \( P(E|\neg H) \): General likelihood of finding these traits, given he's not in agricultural and veterinary science.
  * \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \)

Now applying Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

### Calculations:

#### Business Administration:
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.3) + (0.5 \cdot 0.7) = 0.03 + 0.35 = 0.38 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.3}{0.38} \approx 0.079 \]

#### Computer Science:
\[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.3) + (0.5 \cdot 0.7) = 0.09 + 0.35 = 0.44 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.3}{0.44} \approx 0.205 \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.2) + (0.4 \cdot 0.8) = 0.18 + 0.32 = 0.50 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.2}{0.50} = 0.36 \]

These calculations give us the estimated probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.079,
  "computer science": 0.205,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.36
