To estimate the probabilities P(H|E) for each field given Adam's personality sketch E, we can use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given he is in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given he is not in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality traits.

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for all computations, it effectively cancels out when we are comparing the relative probabilities. Therefore, we can focus on the numerator \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

### Computer Science
- P(H): Let's assume that the prior probability for each field is somewhat equal among various fields. This could be estimated in the range of 0.1 to 0.3.
- P(E|H): The traits such as high intelligence, curiosity, and being good at solving puzzles align well with Computer Science. Let's assign a high likelihood, around 0.7.
- P(E|\neg H): Traits that are not specifically aligned with Computer Science but common across various fields. Let's assign this likelihood as moderate, around 0.5.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- P(H): Assume the prior probability for this field is similar to others, 0.1 to 0.3.
- P(E|H): The traits such as a genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy align very well with Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Let's assign a higher likelihood, around 0.9.
- P(E|\neg H): Traits are not as aligned with other fields. Let's assign this likelihood as lower, around 0.4.

### Business Administration
- P(H): Similarly, assume the prior probability for this field is similar to others, 0.1 to 0.3.
- P(E|H): Traits such as intelligence and appreciation for hard work might have some alignment, but empathy and a love for nature do not align as strongly. Let's assign a lower likelihood, around 0.4.
- P(E|\neg H): Traits not specific to Business Administration, so this likelihood remains around 0.5.

Now, let's compute the posterior probabilities:

Normalizing constant for comparison:
\[ P(E) = k \]
where \( k \) is the same for all fields and ensures our comparisons are consistent. We can ignore this for relative comparison here.

### Compute Relative Probabilities:
Note: Since we don't have the exact overall probability \( P(E) \), we'll work with unnormalized posterior values and normalize them at the end.

- Computer Science: \( P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \approx 0.7 \cdot 0.2 = 0.14 \)
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \approx 0.9 \cdot 0.2 = 0.18 \)
- Business Administration: \( P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \approx 0.4 \cdot 0.2 = 0.08 \)

Normalize the proportions for comparison:
Total: \( 0.14 + 0.18 + 0.08 = 0.40 \)

- Computer Science: \( \frac{0.14}{0.40} = 0.35 \)
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( \frac{0.18}{0.40} = 0.45 \)
- Business Administration: \( \frac{0.08}{0.40} = 0.20 \)

Using these computations, the relative probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.35,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.45,
  "business administration": 0.20
}
