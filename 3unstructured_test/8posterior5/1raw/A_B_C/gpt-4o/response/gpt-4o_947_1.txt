Certainly! Let's analyze each field according to the given personality sketch of Adam and compute the probabilities using Bayes' rule.

First, let's define the probabilities:
- P(H) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
- P(E|H) is the likelihood of observing E (the personality sketch) given H (the field).
- P(E|\neg H) is the likelihood of observing E given Adam is not in that field.
- P(H|E) is the posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in the specific field given E.

Assumptions:
- P(H) is assumed to be uniform for all three fields because we don't have prior information about Adam's enrolment.
- P(E|H) and P(E|\neg H) are estimated based on the fit between the personality sketch and each field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- P(H): Assume a prior probability of 1/3 (as no prior information is given).
- P(E|H): High, as Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals fits well with this field. Let's assign a high value such as 0.8.
- P(E|\neg H): Moderate, as some other fields could also reasonably produce this personality sketch. Let's assign a value of 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let P(H) = 1/3 and P(\neg H) = 2/3 (since there are two other fields):
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot \frac{1}{3}) + (0.3 \cdot \frac{2}{3}) \]
\[ P(E) = \frac{0.8}{3} + \frac{0.6}{3} \]
\[ P(E) = \frac{1.4}{3} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{\frac{1.4}{3}} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8}{1.4} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.57 \]

### Business Administration
- P(H): Assume a prior probability of 1/3.
- P(E|H): Low, as Adam's interests and personality don't strongly align with business administration. Let's assign a value such as 0.2.
- P(E|\neg H): Moderate, so let's keep it at 0.3.

Calculating:
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot \frac{1}{3}) + (0.3 \cdot \frac{2}{3}) \]
\[ P(E) = \frac{0.2}{3} + \frac{0.6}{3} \]
\[ P(E) = \frac{0.8}{3} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{\frac{0.8}{3}} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2}{0.8} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.25 \]

### Computer Science
- P(H): Assume a prior probability of 1/3.
- P(E|H): Moderate to high, as Adam's high intelligence, curiosity, and problem-solving skills fit this field. Let's assign a value such as 0.5.
- P(E|\neg H): Moderate, let's keep it at 0.3.

Calculating:
\[ P(E) = (0.5 \cdot \frac{1}{3}) + (0.3 \cdot \frac{2}{3}) \]
\[ P(E) = \frac{0.5}{3} + \frac{0.6}{3} \]
\[ P(E) = \frac{1.1}{3} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{\frac{1.1}{3}} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5}{1.1} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.45 \]

So, the computed probabilities are:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.57,
  "business administration": 0.25,
  "computer science": 0.45
}
```
