To evaluate the probability of Adam being enrolled in each field given his personality sketch, we'll use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a certain field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.

Given that detailed quantitative data is not available, we'll make informed qualitative estimates based on Adam's personality sketch and common knowledge about these fields.

### Prior Probabilities (\( P(H) \))
- **Computer Science**: Computer Science is a popular field of study, hence a somewhat moderate prior probability.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Less common than computer science but fits well with Adam's deep interest in nature and animals, hence a lower but non-negligible prior.
- **Business Administration**: Also quite popular, although less directly aligned with the personality sketch.

### Likelihoods (\( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \))
- **Computer Science**: 
  - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's intelligence and puzzle-solving skills match well with CS. We'll assign a moderate likelihood.
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Considering the overall population of students outside CS, the personality traits may be less pronounced for CS majors.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  - \( P(E|H) \): Very high likelihood given Adam's interest and empathy for animals and nature.
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Lower likelihood as most fields wouldn't be expected to have such a strong correlation with these traits.
- **Business Administration**:
  - \( P(E|H) \): Lower likelihood as business typically does not strongly correlate with empathy for animals and nature.
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Higher likelihood comparatively but still lower than exact other fields.

We assume \( P(E) \) to be relatively similar across fields since it would be the average of \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

### Hypothesis Computations

Using some intuitive and qualitative reasoning, let's convert these into approximate values:

{
  "computer science": 0.25,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.65,
  "business administration": 0.10
}

These represent the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \), indicating that given Adam's personality sketch, he is most likely to be enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, followed by Computer Science, and least likely in Business Administration.
