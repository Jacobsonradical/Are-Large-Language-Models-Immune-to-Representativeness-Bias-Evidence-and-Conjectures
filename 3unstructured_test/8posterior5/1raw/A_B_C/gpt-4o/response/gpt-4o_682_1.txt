Sure, let's first break down the problem and apply Bayes' rule.

Bayes' rule states that:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For each field of specialization (H), we need to estimate:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in that specific field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in that field.
4. Using these values, compute \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in that field given his personality sketch.

### Hypotheses Evaluation:

#### Business Administration
- \( P(H_{BA}) \): Let's assume the proportion of graduate students in business administration is moderate. Estimating around 0.2.
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): Business administration is not highly correlated with a genuine curiosity about nature, plants, or empathy for animals, so let's estimate a low probability, around 0.1.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \): Estimating a moderate probability, around 0.5, given the personality could fit several other fields better.

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H_{AVS}) \): Given the sketch, it suggests a strong correlation with this field. Let's assume a prior probability of 0.1 since it is more specialized.
- \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \): High probability, given the characteristics align well. Estimating around 0.9.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \): Estimating a moderate probability, around 0.5, due to the personality sketch fitting this field well.

\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

#### Computer Science
- \( P(H_{CS}) \): Given the prevalence of graduate programs in computer science, let's assume a prior of around 0.2.
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Moderate probability since abstract concepts and puzzle-solving align well. Estimating around 0.5.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \): Estimating a moderate probability, around 0.5, since the personality characteristics can fit multiple fields.

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is identical in the denominators, we can simplify our task by focusing on the numerators to compare the posterior probabilities.

### Simplified Posterior Probabilities:

\[
\begin{align*}
P(H_{BA}|E) & \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \\
P(H_{AVS}|E) & \propto 0.9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.09 \\
P(H_{CS}|E) & \propto 0.5 \cdot 0.2 = 0.10 \\
\end{align*}
\]

Summarizing them and re-normalizing (scaling, though not strictly necessary for comparative purposes):

\[
\begin{align*}
P(H_{BA}|E) & \approx 0.02 \\
P(H_{AVS}|E) & \approx 0.09 \\
P(H_{CS}|E) & \approx 0.10 \\
\end{align*}
\]

So the final estimates (not normalized, valid for comparison):

{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.09,
  "computer science": 0.10
}
