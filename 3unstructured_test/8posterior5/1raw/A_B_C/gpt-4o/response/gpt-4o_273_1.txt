Sure, let's use Bayes' rule to estimate the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields based on his personality sketch.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (initial belief about how likely Adam is to be in a specific field).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis (how well Adam's personality fits with being in that field).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis (how well Adam's personality fits with not being in that field).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence (overall probability of observing Adam's personality).

To simplify:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Since we are comparing probabilities for the specific fields, we don't need the exact value of \( P(E) \).

Let's assign values based on typical assumptions and the information given:

1. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was in this field. Let's assume every field has an equal prior initially, say \( P(H) = 0.1 \) for each of 10 possible fields.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality given he is in Business Administration. Business Administration might not align perfectly with Adam's love for nature, animals, and empathy, so we can assume this is relatively low, say \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given that Adam could be in any of the other 9 fields, let's assume an average alignment with his personality. We could estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.1 = 0.01 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \) initially.
   - \( P(E|H) \): This field closely matches Adam's personality—his curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals—so let's set this high, say \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Again, assume the same average \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.7 \times 0.1 = 0.07 \]

3. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): Same initial probability \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The quiet nature, puzzle-solving ability, and high intelligence might match Computer Science, but it lacks the nature and animal aspect, so let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The average \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.3 \times 0.1 = 0.03 \]

Now, normalize these to ensure they reflect probability values (though we wouldn't necessarily sum to 1 due to other possible fields):

{
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.07 + 0.03} = 0.08 \),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{0.07}{0.01 + 0.07 + 0.03} = 0.64 \),
  "computer science": \( \frac{0.03}{0.01 + 0.07 + 0.03} = 0.28 \)
}

So, the values approximate:

{
  "business administration": 0.08,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.64,
  "computer science": 0.28
}

These results indicate that based on the personality sketch, Adam is most likely to have been a graduate student in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
