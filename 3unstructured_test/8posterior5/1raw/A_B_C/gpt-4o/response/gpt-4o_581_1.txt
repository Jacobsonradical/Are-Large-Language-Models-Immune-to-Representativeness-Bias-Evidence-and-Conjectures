To apply Bayes' theorem and calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we'll need to estimate the values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). 

### Assumptions:
1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in each field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in each field.

Given the limited information, we need to make reasonable assumptions based on common patterns:

- Business administration students may not necessarily need to have a deep curiosity in nature or a strong love for animals. Hence, the personality sketch isn't strongly indicative of this field.
- Computer science students often enjoy solving puzzles and may have high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts. However, the connection to nature and animals is weaker.
- Agricultural and veterinary science students are likely to have an appreciation for nature, a love for animals, and empathy, making the personality sketch highly indicative.

Below, I provide estimated values assuming these probabilities:

### Priors \( P(H) \):
- Business administration: 0.2 (assuming it is a common graduate field)
- Computer science: 0.3 (assuming it is a very common graduate field)
- Agricultural and veterinary science: 0.1 (assuming it is less common compared to computer science)

### Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \):
- Business administration: 0.1 (because the personality sketch doesn't strongly match this field)
- Computer science: 0.4 (because some traits match, but not all of them)
- Agricultural and veterinary science: 0.9 (because the personality sketch strongly matches this field)

### Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):
We'll use similar reasoning to estimate the general likelihood that a random student will have these traits.

- Business administration: 0.2
- Computer science: 0.3
- Agricultural and veterinary science: 0.4

Now, applying Bayes' theorem for each field:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We can infer \( P(E) \) by considering it as a sum of the likelihoods across these and other fields:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{business}})P(H_{\text{business}}) + P(E|H_{\text{CS}})P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|H_{\text{AgriVet}})P(H_{\text{AgriVet}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{all}})(\sum P(\neg H)) \]

However, since we don't have the complete information for other fields, we will simplify and only normalize the given options.

### Simplified Calculation (Focusing on Direct Comparison):
Let's denote \( k \) as the normalization constant:
\[ k = P(E_{\text{business}})P(H_{\text{business}}) + P(E_{\text{CS}})P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E_{\text{AgriVet}})P(H_{\text{AgriVet}}) \]

For practical purposes and comparison, the ratio of likelihoods will suffice:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H)P(H) \]

### Calculation:
Using the given priors and likelihoods:

1. Business administration:
\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02 \]

2. Computer science:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto 0.4 \times 0.3 = 0.12 \]

3. Agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H_{\text{AgriVet}}|E) \propto 0.9 \times 0.1 = 0.09 \]

Normalizing these to sum to 1:
\[ \text{Total} = 0.02 + 0.12 + 0.09 = 0.23 \]

Finally:
- Business administration:
\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.23} \approx 0.087 \]

- Computer science:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.23} \approx 0.522 \]

- Agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H_{\text{AgriVet}}|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.23} \approx 0.391 \]

Thus:

  "business administration": 0.087,

  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.391
