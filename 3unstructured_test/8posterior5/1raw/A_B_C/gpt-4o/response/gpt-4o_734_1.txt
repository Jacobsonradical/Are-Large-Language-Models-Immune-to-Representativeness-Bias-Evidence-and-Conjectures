To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) through Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant to ensure the probabilities sum to 1 across all possible hypotheses. However, it's not necessary to compute \( P(E) \) if we are only comparing the relative probabilities of the hypotheses. Instead, we can compare \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) directly.

Given Adam's personality traits and interests:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H):** Moderate, given this field involves nature and animals which align with Adam's interests.
- **P(E|H):** High, Adam's curiosity about nature and love for animals strongly match this field.
- **P(E|\neg H):** Lower compared to other fields due to the strong alignment between his interests and this field.

### Business Administration

- **P(H):** Moderate, considering this is a common field, but less likely based on Adam's specific interests.
- **P(E|H):** Low, the traits mentioned in Adam's personality sketch do not strongly align with typical interests in business administration.
- **P(E|\neg H):** Higher, as many other fields would still align better with his interests.

### Computer Science

- **P(H):** Moderate, the subject's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts may fit here.
- **P(E|H):** Moderate, Adam's problem-solving skills and intelligence are good indicators, but no direct mention of computers or technology.
- **P(E|\neg H):** Slightly higher, as his specific interests in nature and animals do not directly align with this field.

Now, let's compute the relative probabilities using the qualitative logic:

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \approx 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \approx 0.2 \cdot 0.3 = 0.06 \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \approx 0.5 \cdot 0.3 = 0.15 \]

Normalizing these (i.e., dividing by the sum of these values to get a probability):

Sum:\[ 0.24 + 0.06 + 0.15 = 0.45 \]

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \(\frac{0.24}{0.45} \approx 0.53\),
  "business administration": \(\frac{0.06}{0.45} \approx 0.13\),
  "computer science": \(\frac{0.15}{0.45} \approx 0.33\)
}

Thus, the posterior probabilities can be roughly estimated as follows:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.53,
  "business administration": 0.13,
  "computer science": 0.33
}
