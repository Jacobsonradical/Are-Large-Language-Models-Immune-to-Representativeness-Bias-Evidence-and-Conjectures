To solve this question, we'll apply Bayes' Theorem, which is formulated as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in a certain field given the evidence E.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood that the evidence E appears if Adam is in a certain field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is in a certain field before considering the evidence.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of observing the evidence E, which we can treat as a normalizing constant across our hypotheses.

Let's estimate each term for the three fields.

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- \( P(H) \): This field seems consistent with Adam's interests in nature, plants, and animals, so we'd give it a moderate prior probability, say 0.3.
- \( P(E|H) \): Given that Adam is in this field, the evidence of his personality sketch seems highly probable; let's estimate 0.8.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): For graduate students not in agricultural and veterinary science, Adam's personality sketch is less likely; say it's about 0.1.

**Computer Science:**
- \( P(H) \): While Adam is good at solving puzzles, it's less directly related to his love for nature and animals, so a lower prior probability might be reasonable; let's say 0.2.
- \( P(E|H) \): Given computer science, the evidence still fits, but not as strongly; let's estimate 0.4.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): If Adam is not in computer science, the probability of his personality fitting could be about the same as for the general population; say 0.4.

**Business Administration:**
- \( P(H) \): This field seems less aligned with Adam's personality sketch, so we might give it a lower prior; 0.1.
- \( P(E|H) \): The evidence is less likely if he's in business administration due to his nature-related interests; let's estimate 0.2.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): If Adam is not in business administration, the probability of his personality fitting remains low; let's say 0.1.

Given all these estimates, we compute \( P(E) \) as follows:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{ag}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ag}}) + P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}}) + P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ba}}) \]

\[
P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 + 0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.2 \cdot 0.1 \\
P(E) = 0.24 + 0.08 + 0.02 = 0.34
\]

Now, applying Bayes' rule for each field:

\[ P(H_{\text{ag}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{ag}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ag}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.3}{0.34} \approx 0.71 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.34} \approx 0.24 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{ba}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ba}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.34} \approx 0.06 \]

So, the probabilities for each field given the evidence E are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.71",
  "computer science": "0.24",
  "business administration": "0.06"
}

These values indicate that, given Adam's personality and interests, it is most likely that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, followed by computer science, and least likely in business administration.
