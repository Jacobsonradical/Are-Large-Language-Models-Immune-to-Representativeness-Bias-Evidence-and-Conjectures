Sure, let's break down the process of judging P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|¬H) for each of the three fields given Adam's personality sketch, and then compute P(H|E) using Bayes' rule.

To compute P(H|E), we use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since P(E) is constant for all fields (and we are interested in relative probabilities), we can disregard it in our relative comparison. Therefore,

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

We will estimate values for P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|¬H) based on reasonable assumptions given the sketch and available context.

### Computer Science

- **P(H_cs)** (prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science): Suppose this is 0.2, since computer science is a popular field but not necessarily likely based purely on the economy of graduate student choices.
- **P(E|H_cs)** (likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he's in computer science): Based on the interests and personality traits described (curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving), this could reasonably be 0.4.
- **P(E|¬H_cs)** (likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he's not in computer science): Because his traits are broad and applicable to many fields, we'll rate this at 0.7.

\[ P(H_{cs}|E) \propto 0.4 \times 0.2 = 0.08 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H_as)** (prior probability of being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science): Assume this is 0.15, considering it's a less common but still pertinent field.
- **P(E|H_as)** (likelihood of Adam’s personality sketch given he’s in this field): Given his love for nature, animals, empathy, and appreciation for dedication, let's set this as 0.8.
- **P(E|¬H_as)** (likelihood of Adam’s personality sketch given he’s not in this field): Typically broad, it remains high at 0.6.

\[ P(H_{as}|E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.15 = 0.12 \]

### Business Administration

- **P(H_ba)** (prior probability of being in business administration): Assume 0.2, similar in popularity to computer science.
- **P(E|H_ba)** (likelihood of Adam’s personality sketch given he’s in this field): Given his traits don't directly align with typical business attributes (though some may), let’s judge this at 0.2.
- **P(E|¬H_ba)** (likelihood of Adam’s personality sketch given he's not in this field): Remaining broadly plausible, let's use 0.7 again.

\[ P(H_{ba}|E) \propto 0.2 \times 0.2 = 0.04 \]

Finally, normalizing these relative probabilities may not be necessary here since the problem doesn’t require us to sum them to 1. Instead, let’s compare absolute values only:

{
  "computer science": 0.08,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.12,
  "business administration": 0.04
}

According to our calculations and assumptions, the most likely field for Adam based on his personality sketch is Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
