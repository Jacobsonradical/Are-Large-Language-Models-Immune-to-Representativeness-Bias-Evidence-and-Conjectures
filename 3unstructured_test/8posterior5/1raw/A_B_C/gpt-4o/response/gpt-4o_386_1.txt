To derive the probabilities, we need to utilize Bayes' theorem: 

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We will break it down for each field:
1. **Computer Science**
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
3. **Business Administration**

To proceed, we need to make educated guesses for:
- \( P(H) \): the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \): the likelihood that Adam's personality sketch is observed given that he is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): the likelihood that Adam's personality sketch is observed given that he is not enrolled in that field.

### 1. Computer Science:

- **P(H)**: Let's assume the prior probability that any graduate student is enrolled in computer science is moderate.
  - \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \)

- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood that a computer science student has Adam's personality traits is lower because genuine curiosity about nature and a deep love for animals are not typically dominant in computer science.
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \)

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in computer science might be more likely because it aligns more with other fields.
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.9 \)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]

### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

- **P(H)**: Suppose the prior probability for agricultural and veterinary science is lower because it's less common.
  - \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \)

- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood that Adam's personality matches a student in this field is high due to his curiosity about nature and love for animals.
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.7 \)

- **P(E|\neg H)**: If he's not in this field, his personality is less likely to perfectly match the traits we see.
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \]

### 3. Business Administration:

- **P(H)**: Let's assume there's a moderate to high prior probability for this field.
  - \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \)

- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood that a business administration student has Adam's traits is considered lower because the traits are more aligned with scientific or compassionate studies.
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \)

- **P(E|\neg H)**: If Adam is not in business administration, the likelihood of him having this personality sketch might be higher.
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.8 \)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.3}{P(E)} \]

Now we can combine our relative evaluations:

- For computer science:
  \[
  P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.02}{P(E)}
  \]

- For agricultural and veterinary science:
  \[
  P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.07}{P(E)}
  \]

- For business administration:
  \[
  P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.3}{P(E)} = \frac{0.06}{P(E)}
  \]

We can summarize the relative probabilities into manageable values (not necessarily normalized):

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.02,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.07,
  "business administration": 0.06
}
```

Note: For exact values, normalization would be required, but this provides a relative likelihood based on the assumed probabilities.
