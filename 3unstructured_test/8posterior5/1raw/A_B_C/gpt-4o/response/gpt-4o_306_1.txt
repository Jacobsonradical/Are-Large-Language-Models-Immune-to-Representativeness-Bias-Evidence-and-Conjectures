To calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in each field, we need to use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \).

Let's assume the following heuristic judgments for the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \):

1. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Let's assume the prior probability that Adam is a computer science student is moderate, around 0.2 (since computer science is a common graduate field, but Adam's traits suggest a broader set of interests).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that a computer science student has a personality sketch like Adam's can be considered moderate, say 0.3. He is intelligent and good at solving puzzles, which aligns with traits often seen in computer science students.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that someone who is not a computer science student has Adam's traits can also be deemed moderate, considering inquisitiveness and intelligence are not exclusive to this field. Let's set it at 0.6.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is an agricultural or veterinary science student is relatively low but plausible, say 0.1 (since it's less common than computer science but matches some of Adam's interests).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that an agricultural or veterinary science student has Adam's personality sketch is relatively high, say 0.7, given his love for nature, empathy, and animals.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that someone who is not an agricultural or veterinary science student has Adam's traits might be lower, say 0.5, considering the specific nature-oriented traits.

3. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is a business administration student is fairly low, say 0.1 (considering his traits do not strongly align with typical business administration students).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that a business administration student has Adam's personality sketch is quite low, say 0.1, considering his traits do not strongly align with business administration.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that someone who is not a business administration student has Adam's traits is moderate, say 0.6, as business administration students are a broad group and these traits are not common among them.

Now, let's compute the posterior probabilities using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(\text{computer science} | E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science} | E) = \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(\text{business administration} | E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} \]

To get the normalization constant \( P(E) \) we need to sum over all possibilities. But since we are not required to normalize them, we will leave it as is.

Here's how the calculations look:

\[ P(\text{computer science} | E) \propto 0.3 \cdot 0.2 = 0.06 \]

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science} | E) \propto 0.7 \cdot 0.1 = 0.07 \]

\[ P(\text{business administration} | E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.1 = 0.01 \]

Letâ€™s present these values in the required format:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.06,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.07,
  "business administration": 0.01
}
