To answer the question, we need to estimate the probability of Adam being enrolled in each field, given his personality sketch, using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the field.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given he's enrolled in that field.
- \(P(E)\) is the overall probability of the personality sketch.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\) is the probability of the personality sketch given that he is not in the specific field.

Let's judge \(P(H)\), \(P(E|H)\) and \(P(E|\neg H)\) for each field. Since exact probabilities are unknown, we will make reasonable assumptions based on the personality sketch provided.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - \(P(H)\): Assume this field accounts for a small percentage of graduate students, say \(0.05\).
   - \(P(E|H)\): High, given his deep love for nature, plants, and animals. Let's assume \(0.9\).
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\): Since many fields do not have direct relevance to his traits, assume moderate \(0.3\).

2. **Business Administration**
   - \(P(H)\): Assume this field has a relatively high representation among graduate students, say \(0.2\).
   - \(P(E|H)\): Low, as his traits don't align closely with typical business administration interests. Let's assume \(0.1\).
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\): Could be higher than those enrolled in business. Assume \(0.4\).

3. **Computer Science**
   - \(P(H)\): Assume this field is popular among graduate students, say \(0.15\).
   - \(P(E|H)\): Moderate due to problem-solving and intelligence but lack of direct indication of interest. Assume \(0.5\).
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\): Considerably lower as not all fields emphasize abstract concepts. Assume \(0.3\).

Now, we can compute \(P(H|E)\) for each field. Since \(P(E)\) is the same for all fields and is constant, we can focus on the numerator of the Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H)P(H) \]

Let's calculate for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.9 \times 0.05 = 0.045 \]

2. **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02 \]

3. **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.5 \times 0.15 = 0.075 \]

Normalize these to sum to 1 (or just use proportionally as they represent relative weights):

Normalize Factor:
\[ 0.045 + 0.02 + 0.075 = 0.14 \]

Normalized probabilities:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.14} \approx 0.321 \]

2. **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.14} \approx 0.143 \]

3. **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.075}{0.14} \approx 0.536 \]

Given the parameters above:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.321,
  "business administration": 0.143,
  "computer science": 0.536
