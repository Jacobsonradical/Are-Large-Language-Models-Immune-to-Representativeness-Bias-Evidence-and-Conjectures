Sure, let's proceed step-by-step. To calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since \( P(E) \) is the same in all cases and we only need relative values, we can rewrite it for each hypothesis \( H_i \) as:

\[ P(H_i|E) \propto P(E|H_i) \cdot P(H_i) \]

First, let's make some reasonable assumptions for the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field:

1. \( P(H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science: Let's assume this to be 0.15 given it's not a very common field but aligns with Adam's profile.
2. \( P(H) \) for business administration: Let's assume this to be 0.25 as it is a popular field of study.
3. \( P(H) \) for computer science: Again, let's assume this to be 0.25 given its popularity.

Next, we estimate the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) based on how well the personality sketch \( E \) fits each field:

1. \( P(E|H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science: Given Adam's interest in nature, animals, and appreciation for hard work, let's set this relatively high at 0.8.
2. \( P(E|H) \) for business administration: Given Adam's interest in nature and solving puzzles, this seems less likely, so let's set it at 0.1.
3. \( P(E|H) \) for computer science: Given Adam's intelligence and problem-solving skills, let's set this at 0.6.

Let's assume the complement likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \) is relatively consistent across fields:

1. \( P(E|\neg H) \): Let's set this to 0.3 across all fields for simplicity.

Now we can compute relative proportions for \( P(H|E) \):

1. For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.15 = 0.12 \]

2. For business administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.25 = 0.025 \]

3. For computer science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.6 \times 0.25 = 0.15 \]

To normalize these values:

\[ \text{Sum of proportions} = 0.12 + 0.025 + 0.15 = 0.295 \]

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.295} \approx 0.407 \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.025}{0.295} \approx 0.085 \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.15}{0.295} \approx 0.508 \]

So, the probabilities that Adam is enrolled in each field, given the personality sketch \( E \), are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.407,
  "business administration": 0.085,
  "computer science": 0.508
