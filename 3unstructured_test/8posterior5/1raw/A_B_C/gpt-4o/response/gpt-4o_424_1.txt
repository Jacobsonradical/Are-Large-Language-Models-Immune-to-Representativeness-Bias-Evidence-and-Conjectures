To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to consider several factors:
1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in each specific field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in the specific field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in the specific field.

Let's consider each field separately and estimate the probabilities:

### Computer Science
- **P(H):** The prior probability of a random graduate student being enrolled in computer science. Let's estimate this as moderately high, say 0.25.
- **P(E|H):** Adam's personality traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals) do not strongly align with typical computer science students. Let's estimate this as low, say 0.1.
- **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of these traits given that Adam is not in computer science would be higher than if he was in it, so let's estimate this as 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

### Business Administration
- **P(H):** The prior probability of a random graduate student being enrolled in business administration. Let's estimate this as moderate, say 0.2.
- **P(E|H):** Adam's traits do not strongly suggest business administration either. Let's estimate this as low, say 0.05.
- **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of these traits given that Adam is not in business administration would be higher again, so say 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H):** The prior probability of a random graduate student being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's estimate this as moderately low, say 0.15.
- **P(E|H):** Adam's personality traits strongly align with this field given his love for nature and animals. Let's estimate this as high, say 0.7.
- **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of these traits given that Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science would be lower, say 0.2.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Now, let's compute the relative probabilities without normalizing (just comparing the unnormalized posterior probabilities):

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.25 = 0.025 \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.05 \times 0.2 = 0.01 \]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.7 \times 0.15 = 0.105 \]

Given the relative values:
- The likelihood of Adam being enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is highest.
- Computer Science comes next but is significantly lower than Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
- Business Administration has the lowest probability.

Therefore, the normalized/inferred probabilities would be approximately:

{
  "computer science": 0.18,
  "business administration": 0.07,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75
