To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch E, we need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \). Though exact prior probabilities are unknown, we can estimate their relative values based on general trends and common sense.

### Estimations:

- **Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \):**

  - \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.3 \) 
  - \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.2 \)
  - \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.1 \)

  These are estimated considering the general popularity and availability of these graduate programs.

- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
  
  - **Computer Science:**
    - \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \): Moderate to low, given the nature of the sketch.
      - I'd estimate this at around 0.2.
  - **Business Administration:**
    - \( P(E|\text{business administration}) \): Low, the interests and traits do not align strongly.
      - Around 0.1.
  - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
    - \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \): Very high, strong correlation with interests and traits mentioned.
      - About 0.8.

- **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Distribution of E among other fields not listed can be speculated.
      - Assuming an average of 0.3 to simplify calculations.

### Applying Bayes Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \], but to avoid complex calculus (given we want total not sum up to 1 anyway), we use relative scales.

Let's calculate for each:

1. **Computer Science:**
   \[
   P(\text{Compute Science}|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.3}{(\text{ignore constant})}
   \]
   \[
   \approx 0.06
   \]

2. **Business Administration:**
   \[
   P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{(\text{ignore constant})}
   \]
   \[
   \approx 0.02
   \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   \[
   P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{(\text{ignore constant})}
   \]
   \[
   \approx 0.08
   \]

Thus, our results using proportional reasoning are:

{
  "computer science": 0.06,
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08
}

Note, these numbers should be normalized together with all other fields (not shown), but since normalization adjusts all proportionally by same constant, irrelevance here as output schema aligns direct relative proportional benefits.
