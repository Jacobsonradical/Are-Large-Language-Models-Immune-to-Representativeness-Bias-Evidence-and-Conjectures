Let's break down our hypothesis testing using Bayes' Rule. We will need the following estimates for each field:

1. P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field.
2. P(E|H): The probability of Adam's characteristics given that he is in each field.
3. P(E|\neg H): The probability of Adam's characteristics given that he is not in each field.
4. P(H|E): The posterior probability of each field given Adam's characteristics.

Let’s assume some reasonable estimates for illustrative purposes. 

**P(H) for each field**
- Agricultural and veterinary science: Let's estimate this at 0.1, given it is a specialized field.
- Computer science: This is a more common field, so let’s estimate this at 0.2.
- Business administration: This is also a common field, so let’s estimate this at 0.3.

**P(E|H) for each field**
- Agricultural and veterinary science: Adam's love for nature, plants, animals, and his empathy aligns well with this field. Let's estimate this at 0.7.
- Computer science: Adam's intelligence and abstract thinking are relevant, but nature and animal characteristics are less aligned. Let’s estimate this at 0.3.
- Business administration: While his intelligence and understanding of hard work could be relevant, the other personality traits are less aligned. Let’s estimate this at 0.2.

**P(E|\neg H)**
For simplicity, we will assume the same base rate of personality traits not aligning well with other fields.
- Agricultural and veterinary science: Since this field aligns well with Adam’s traits, \neg H has lower P(E), estimated at 0.2.
- Computer science: More general traits, so \neg H has relatively higher P(E), estimated at 0.5.
- Business administration: Also more general traits, so \neg H is also estimated at 0.5.

Now, applying Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
We will calculate P(E) assuming we only have these three fields for simplicity.

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) + P(E|H_3) \cdot P(H_3) \]

For each field, let's compute:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(E) = 0.7 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.2 \cdot 0.3 = 0.07 + 0.06 + 0.06 = 0.19 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.19} \approx 0.368 \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.19} \approx 0.316 \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H_3) \cdot P(H_3)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{0.19} \approx 0.316 \]

Therefore, the results are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.368,
  "computer science": 0.316,
  "business administration": 0.316
}
