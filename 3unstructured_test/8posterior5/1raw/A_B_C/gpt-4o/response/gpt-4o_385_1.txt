To determine the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we'll follow this methodology:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For the simplicity of calculations, we'll use relative values.

### Computer Science

#### Prior Probability \( P(H) \)
- **P(H)**: Given Adam's qualities, let's assume a moderate probability since computer science is a common grad field, but his personality seems less aligned.

#### Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)
- **P(E|H)**: A computer science student might still possess qualities like high intelligence and being good at understanding abstract concepts. We'll assume lower here.

#### Marginal Probability \( P(E|\neg H) \)
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Given Adam's specific qualities, \( P(E|\neg H) \) is higher, as there are fields that fit him better.

### Business Administration

#### Prior Probability \( P(H) \)
- **P(H)**: Less likely for Adam given his warmth, empathy, and love for animals.

#### Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)
- **P(E|H)**: The overlap between business administration traits and Adam's personality is less.

#### Marginal Probability \( P(E|\neg H) \)
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Higher since Adam's qualities are more typically found in other fields.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

#### Prior Probability \( P(H) \)
- **P(H)**: High, given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for dedication.

#### Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)
- **P(E|H)**: Very high as the field directly aligns with his qualities.

#### Marginal Probability \( P(E|\neg H) \)
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Lower since fewer other fields match Adam's personality as well.

### Calculations:
Since we don't have exact numerical values, we'll judge relative relationships.

{
  "computer science": 
    \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx 0.1 \)

  "business administration":
    \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx 0.05 \)

  "agricultural and veterinary science":
    \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx 0.85 \)
