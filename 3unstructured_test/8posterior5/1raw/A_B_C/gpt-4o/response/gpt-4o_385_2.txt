To answer this question, I'll need to make some assumptions about typical probabilities. Let's denote each of the probabilities:

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a certain field based on general knowledge.

- **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam has the described personality sketch given that he is in that field.

- **P(E|¬H)**: The probability that Adam has the described personality sketch given that he is NOT in that field.

From Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since the denominator, \( P(E) \), is the same for all fields, we essentially compare the numerators, \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

### Computer Science (CS):
- **P(H)**: Let's assume that the prior probability of someone being in computer science is reasonably high, say \( P(H) = 0.25 \).
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam having the described personality traits (interest in nature/plants, empathy, love for animals) given he is in CS might be relatively low, let's say \( P(E|H) = 0.05 \).
- **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of Adam having the described traits given he is not in CS might be higher, say \( P(E|¬H) = 0.3 \).

### Business Administration (BA):
- **P(H)**: Let's assume that the prior probability of someone being in business administration is moderate, say \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam having these traits while being in business administration might be low, let's say \( P(E|H) = 0.02 \).
- **P(E|¬H)**: The probability might be moderately higher given he is not in BA, say \( P(E|¬H) = 0.3 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS):
- **P(H)**: Let's assume the prior probability of someone being in agricultural and veterinary science is lower but specific to his traits, so let's say \( P(H) = 0.10 \).
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam having these traits while being in AVS is very high, let's say \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
- **P(E|¬H)**: The probability might be lower given he is not in AVS, let's say \( P(E|¬H) = 0.25 \).

Now we compute \( P(H|E) \):

1. **Computer Science**:
   \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.05 \cdot 0.25 = 0.0125 \]

2. **Business Administration**:
   \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.02 \cdot 0.15 = 0.003 \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]

Given these proportional values, we see that Agricultural and Veterinary Science has a significantly higher likelihood given Adam's personality sketch.

Thus:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.0125,
  "business administration": 0.003,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08
}
