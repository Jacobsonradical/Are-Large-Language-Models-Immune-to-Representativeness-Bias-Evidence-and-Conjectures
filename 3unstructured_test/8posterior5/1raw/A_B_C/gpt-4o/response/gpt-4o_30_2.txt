To calculate the probabilities using Bayes' rule, we need to assess and estimate the probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam is in a specific field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam is not in that specific field.

Given:
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch for each hypothesized field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch for all other fields combined.

Assumptions (for illustrative purposes, as actual data on graduate fields and probabilities are not provided):
- Let's consider that there are numerous graduate fields, so assigning a fairly consistent prior probability for each specialized field \(P(H)\).

Here are the steps and assumptions for each field:

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): Assuming a generic distribution among many fields, let's estimate \( P(H) \) for Business Administration as \( 0.10 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Adam's characteristics like strong empathy and appreciation for hard work might align somewhat with business administration but not perfectly with a significant focus on nature and animals. Estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.20 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Estimate, considering Adam's strong alignment with nature and science fields, that \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.30 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): This field appears to align closely with Adam's interests in nature and animals, so let's estimate \( P(H) = 0.10 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's personality sketch, which highly aligns with this field, estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.70 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likewise, this metric should consider other fields not aligning as strongly, so \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.30 \).

### Computer Science
- \( P(H) \): Assuming the presence of many CS students, estimate \( P(H) \) for Computer Science as \( 0.20 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Adam's puzzle-solving skills and intelligence could suit Computer Science, but less so his nature and animal inclinations. Estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.30 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Considering better alignment of Adam's profile with other fields than CS, \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.30 \).

Now, using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the lack of data on \( P(E) \), we can simplify to proportional reasoning to get a rough estimate.

### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.20 \times 0.10}{0.20 \times 0.10 + 0.70 \times 0.10 + 0.30 \times 0.20} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.02+0.07+0.06} = \frac{0.02}{0.15} \approx 0.13 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.70 \times 0.10}{0.20 \times 0.10 + 0.70 \times 0.10 + 0.30 \times 0.20} \approx \frac{0.07}{0.02+0.07+0.06} = \frac{0.07}{0.15} \approx 0.47 \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.30 \times 0.20}{0.20 \times 0.10 + 0.70 \times 0.10 + 0.30 \times 0.20} \approx \frac{0.06}{0.02+0.07+0.06} = \frac{0.06}{0.15} \approx 0.40 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.13,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.47,
  "computer science": 0.40
}
