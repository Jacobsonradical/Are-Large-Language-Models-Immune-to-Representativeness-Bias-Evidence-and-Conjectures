To calculate the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Rule, we need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihoods \( P(E|\neg H) \). Bayes' Rule tells us:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the fields of study:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
2. **Business Administration**
3. **Computer Science**

Based on Adam's personality sketch, let's analyze the components needed:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Since this field is not as common as business administration or computer science in general, let's assign it a prior of 0.1.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, interest in plants, love for animals, and empathy strongly align with agricultural and veterinary science. We'll give this a high value of 0.8.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of Adam having this personality sketch without being in agricultural and veterinary science is lower. Let's assign it a value of 0.2.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Business administration is a very common field, so let's assign it a prior of 0.4.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's traits do not particularly suggest a strong alignment with business administration. We'll give this a value of 0.2.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of Adam having this personality sketch and not being in business administration is more likely. Let’s assign it a value of 0.8.

3. **Computer Science**:
   - **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Computer science is also a common field, so let's assign it a prior of 0.4.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's intelligence and interest in solving puzzles align somewhat with computer science, though less than agricultural and veterinary science. Let's give it a value of 0.4.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of Adam having this personality sketch and not being in computer science is moderate. Let’s assign it a value of 0.6.

Now let's calculate each \( P(H|E) \):

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{P(E)}
   \]

2. **Business Administration**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \times 0.4}{P(E)}
   \]

3. **Computer Science**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \times 0.4}{P(E)}
   \]

To normalize these, we use the marginal probability \( P(E) \):
\[
P(E) = P(E|H_1)P(H_1) + P(E|H_2)P(H_2) + P(E|H_3)P(H_3) + ...  
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.8 \times 0.1 + 0.2 \times 0.4 + 0.4 \times 0.4 + P(E| ...) \times P(...)
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.08 + 0.08 + 0.16 = 0.32
\]

Now let's compute the normalized probabilities:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.32} = \frac{0.08}{0.32} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Business Administration**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.4}{0.32} = \frac{0.08}{0.32} = 0.25
   \]

3. **Computer Science**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.4}{0.32} = \frac{0.16}{0.32} = 0.5
   \]

Summarizing in the requested format:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.25,
  "business administration": 0.25,
  "computer science": 0.5
