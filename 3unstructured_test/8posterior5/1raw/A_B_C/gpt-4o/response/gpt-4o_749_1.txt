To determine the likelihood that Adam was enrolled in each of these fields based on his personality sketch, we'll use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence (personality sketch) given Adam is in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence given Adam is not in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the evidence.

Since we're comparing relative likelihoods, we can ignore \( P(E) \) because it will be constant across hypotheses.

1. **Business Administration**

   - \( P(H) \) for Business Administration: Since Business Administration is quite a common graduate field, let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \) for Business Administration: Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, along with his empathy and love for animals, doesn't align strongly with business administration. His preference for abstract concepts and puzzles might align moderately, so let's assign \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \) for Business Administration: Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \), reflecting the broad nature of his personality and the many other potential fields.

   Using Bayes' rule:
   \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

2. **Computer Science**

   - \( P(H) \) for Computer Science: Given the increasing popularity of computer science, let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \) for Computer Science: Strong abstract reasoning and problem-solving are hallmarks of the field. Let's assign \( P(E|H) \approx 0.4 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \) for Computer Science: Let's approximate \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.25 \).

   Using Bayes' rule:
   \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.4 \cdot 0.3 = 0.12 \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

   - \( P(H) \) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science: This is a more specialized field, so let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and animals fits well. Let's assign \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Assuming \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.15 \).

   Using Bayes' rule:
   \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]

Relative likelihoods (normalized within the scope of these three fields) would be:

{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.12,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08
}

So, normalizing for comparison:

\[
\text{sum} = 0.02 + 0.12 + 0.08 = 0.22
\]

{
  "business administration": 0.02 / 0.22 = 0.0909,
  "computer science": 0.12 / 0.22 = 0.5455,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08 / 0.22 = 0.3636
}

{
  "business administration": 0.091,
  "computer science": 0.546,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.364
}
