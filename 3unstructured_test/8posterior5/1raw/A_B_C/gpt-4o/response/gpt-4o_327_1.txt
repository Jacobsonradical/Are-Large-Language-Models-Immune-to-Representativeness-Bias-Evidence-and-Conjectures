Sure, let's go through the calculations using Bayes' Rule.

Bayes' Rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll estimate \( P(H) \), the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field, \( P(E|H) \), the likelihood of Adam having personality sketch \( E \) given each field \( H \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \), the likelihood of Adam having personality sketch \( E \) given he is not in field \( H \).

### Estimates:
1. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H) \): Generally, a common field, say 0.2 (20%).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's personality (quiet, love for animals, curiosity about nature, solving puzzles), it seems less likely compared to other fields. Let's assign a value of 0.1 (10%).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given there's a mix of other fields, we might assign 0.5 (50%) assuming average distribution among various fields.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): Less common but more aligned with Adamâ€™s interests. Say, 0.05 (5%).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Very high, considering his love for nature and animals, strong empathy. Let's assign 0.8 (80%).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Considering the sketch fits well, let's assign 0.4 (40%).

3. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): A relatively common field. Say 0.3 (30%).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Considering his intelligence and love for solving puzzles, moderately likely. Say 0.6 (60%).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Similar to business and overall average, let's assign 0.5 (50%).

Now to compute \( P(H|E) \):

### Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) \] is constant and we can consider normalization in practice.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.02}{P(E)} \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.04}{P(E)} \]

### Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.18}{P(E)} \]

Normalization constant \( P(E) \) will be the sum of all numerators, to keep the relative proportion intact:
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.04 + 0.18 = 0.24 \]

Now finalize the posteriors:

### Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.24} = 0.0833 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.24} = 0.1667 \]

### Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.18}{0.24} = 0.75 \]

So, the final results would be:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0833,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.1667,
  "computer science": 0.75
}
```

These are the relative probabilities based on the given personality sketch and the prior field distributions.
