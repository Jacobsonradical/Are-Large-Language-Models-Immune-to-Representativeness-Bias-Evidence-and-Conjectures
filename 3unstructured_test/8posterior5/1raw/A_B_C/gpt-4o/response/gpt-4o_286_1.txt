Let's briefly evaluate each hypothesis. 

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **P(H)**: The probability that any graduate student is enrolled in this field. Assume this value, as it's not specified, let's use 0.2 (assuming it's a less common field compared to others).
   - **P(E|H)**: The probability of E occurring if H is true. Adam's interests are highly aligned with this field (love for nature, plants, animals, empathy). Let's use 0.9.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of E occurring if H is false. This is more widely spread among other fields but less specific. Let's assume this to be 0.05.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - **P(H)**: The probability that any graduate student is enrolled in this field. Assume this value, as this field is quite common, let's use 0.4.
   - **P(E|H)**: The probability of E occurring if H is true. Adam's traits do not strongly correlate to this field (empathy may overlap but not nature and animals). So this might be low. Let's use 0.1.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of E occurring if H is false. Similar as above, let's assume this to be 0.05.

3. **Computer Science**:
   - **P(H)**: The probability that any graduate student is enrolled in this field. Assume this value, as it's a popular field, let's use 0.3.
   - **P(E|H)**: The probability of E occurring if H is true. Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence but less correlation to nature and animals. Let's use 0.3.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of E occurring if H is false. Similar as above, let's use 0.05.

Now let's use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for all fields and we are comparing relative likelihoods, we can use:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Normalize across the three fields to find final probabilities:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[ P(H|E) \propto 0.9 \cdot 0.2 = 0.18 \]

2. **Business Administration**:
   \[ P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.4 = 0.04 \]

3. **Computer Science**:
   \[ P(H|E) \propto 0.3 \cdot 0.3 = 0.09 \]

Sum of these proportions:
\[ 0.18 + 0.04 + 0.09 = 0.31 \]

Normalize:
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.18}{0.31} \approx 0.581 \]

2. **Business Administration**:
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.31} \approx 0.129 \]

3. **Computer Science**:
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.31} \approx 0.290 \]

Thus, the final approximate probabilities are:

  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.581,
  "business administration": 0.129,
  "computer science": 0.290
