Let's start by analyzing the given personality sketch \( E \) and then apply Bayes' rule to compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field. 

Bayes' rule states that:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the personality sketch \( E \).

Since \( P(E) \) is the sum of the probabilities of the personality sketch across all possible fields (including those not listed here), and it acts as a normalizing factor, it's not necessary to compute it for comparing probabilities across the given fields. We can work with the relative probabilities instead.

Given the preceding explanation, let's assume some reasonable numbers for the probabilities. Note that these are estimates based on the provided personality sketch and general knowledge about these fields:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): Prior probability of Adam being in Business Administration.
     - Since many students pursue an MBA or a related degree, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Based on the personality sketch, such as a love for nature and animals, solving puzzles, and empathy, it's less typical for Business Administration students. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): This is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in Business Administration. It's more likely across a broader set of fields, so let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

2. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Prior probability of Adam being in Computer Science.
     - Computer Science is quite common among graduate students, so let's assume \( P(H) = 0.3 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Solving puzzles and high intelligence align well with Computer Science. However, the strong empathy and love for nature may not be typical. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): This would be lower compared to those not in Computer Science. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \).

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Prior probability of Adam being in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
     - This field is less common but strongly aligns with the personality sketch. Letâ€™s assume a moderate \( P(H) = 0.2 \) due to its specific nature.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The personality sketch perfectly fits this field (love for animals, nature, and understanding hard work). Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): This would be broader and less likely as specific fields other than this might not strongly fit. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

Now, calculating the relative probabilities using Bayes' rule:

1. **Business Administration**:
   \[
   P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02
   \]

2. **Computer Science**:
   \[
   P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.3 \cdot 0.3 = 0.09
   \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[
   P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.9 \cdot 0.2 = 0.18
   \]

Normalizing these values (so they add up to the context given):

\[
\text{Total} = 0.02 + 0.09 + 0.18 = 0.29
\]

So, the relative normalized probabilities are:

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Business Administration} & = \frac{0.02}{0.29} \approx 0.069 \\
\text{Computer Science} & = \frac{0.09}{0.29} \approx 0.310 \\
\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science} & = \frac{0.18}{0.29} \approx 0.621 \\
\end{align*}
\]

Converting to a simple format:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.069,
  "computer science": 0.310,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.621
}
```
