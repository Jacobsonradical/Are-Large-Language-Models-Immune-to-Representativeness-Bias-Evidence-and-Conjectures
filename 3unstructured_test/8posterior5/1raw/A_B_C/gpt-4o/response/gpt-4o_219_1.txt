To calculate the probabilities using Bayes' rule, we need to follow these steps:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam having the described personality sketch given he was enrolled in the given field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam having the described personality sketch given he was not enrolled in the given field.
4. **P(E)**: The total probability of Adam having the described personality sketch.

We'll assume rough estimates of these probabilities. Let's assign roughly equal priors unless we have strong reason to think one field is more popular among graduate students in general.

For simplicity and based on reasonable assumptions:

- **P(H)** might be roughly equal for each field (e.g., 1/3 for simplicity).
- **P(E|H)** will vary based on how well the personality traits and 2021 graduate status fit the field.
- Considering that Adam's traits align well with certain fields (e.g., agricultural and veterinary science due to love for animals and nature), P(E|H) will be higher for those fields. 
- Conversely, **P(E|H)** will be lower for fields that don't align as well (e.g., business administration).

### Computer Science
- **P(H)**: Let's assume around 0.33
- **P(E|H)**: Given his traits, low correlation with computer science: 0.2
- **P(E|\neg H)**: 1 - 0.2 = 0.8

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: Let's assume around 0.33
- **P(E|H)**: Given his traits, very low correlation with business administration: 0.1
- **P(E|\neg H)**: 1 - 0.1 = 0.9

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: Let's assume around 0.33
- **P(E|H)**: Given his strong love for animals and nature, high correlation with agricultural and veterinary science: 0.9
- **P(E|\neg H)**: 1 - 0.9 = 0.1

Now we apply Bayes' rule to find **P(H|E)**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) * P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_1) * P(H_1) + P(E|H_2) * P(H_2) + P(E|H_3) * P(H_3) \]

### Calculate P(E):
\[ P(E) = (0.2 * 0.33) + (0.1 * 0.33) + (0.9 * 0.33) = 0.066 + 0.033 + 0.297 = 0.396 \]

### Now Calculate P(H|E) for each field:
- **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 * 0.33}{0.396} = 0.167 \]

- **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 * 0.33}{0.396} = 0.083 \]

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 * 0.33}{0.396} = 0.750 \]

So, the probabilities are as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.167,
  "business administration": 0.083,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.750
}
```
