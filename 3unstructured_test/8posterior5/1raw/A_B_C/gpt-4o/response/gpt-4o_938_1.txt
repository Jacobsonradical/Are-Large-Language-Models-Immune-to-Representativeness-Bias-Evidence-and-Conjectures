To compute the posterior probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for each field of study given Adam’s personality sketch \(E\), we use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\) is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in that field.
- \(P(E)\) can be derived from \(P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)\), but it is not necessary if we only need relative probabilities for comparison.

First, let's estimate the prior probabilities (\(P(H)\)) for each field based on general enrollment trends:

1. Business administration: Moderate probability (say, 0.3)
2. Computer science: High probability (say, 0.4)
3. Agricultural and veterinary science: Lower probability (say, 0.1)

Next, we estimate \(P(E|H)\) for each field based on Adam's personality:

1. Business administration:
   - \(P(E|H)\): Given Adam's personality doesn't closely match typical traits for business administration, we might set a lower probability (say, 0.2).

2. Computer science:
   - \(P(E|H)\): Adam's intelligence and enjoyment of puzzles match well, but empathy and love for animals less so (say, 0.5).

3. Agricultural and veterinary science:
   - \(P(E|H)\): Strong match with empathy, love for animals, curiosity about nature (say, 0.7).

Now we need to consider \(\neg H\), but for simplification, we assume it to be equally probable across other fields.

So:

\[ P(E|\neg H)\) \approx (0.2 + 0.5 + 0.7) / 3 = 0.4667 \]

Using Bayes’ rule for relative probabilities:
[Note: The \(P(E)\) value is identical in all calculations, so it cancels out when comparing ratios.]

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Thus, we calculate:

1. Business administration:
   \[
   P(H|E) \propto 0.2 \times 0.3 = 0.06
   \]

2. Computer science:
   \[
   P(H|E) \propto 0.5 \times 0.4 = 0.2
   \]

3. Agricultural and veterinary science:
   \[
   P(H|E) \propto 0.7 \times 0.1 = 0.07
   \]

These calculations give relative values:

Adjusting to make these into probabilities that add up:

Total = \(0.06 + 0.2 + 0.07 = 0.33\)

And normalizing:
\[
\text{Normalized values} = \frac{P(H|E)_{\text{each}}}{0.33}
\]

{
  "business administration": \(\frac{0.06}{0.33} \approx 0.182\),
  "computer science": \(\frac{0.2}{0.33} \approx 0.606\),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \(\frac{0.07}{0.33} \approx 0.212\)
}
Keeping in mind these are approximate values.

In conclusion:

{
  "business administration": 0.182,
  "computer science": 0.606,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.212
}
