To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we first need to estimate the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is enrolled in a given field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is not enrolled in a given field.

Here are the initial estimations for each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **\( P(H) \)**: Since this is a relatively specialized field, let's assume a lower prior probability of 0.05.
2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's love for nature, animals, and his empathetic nature, it seems highly probable that he could be in this field. We'll estimate this at 0.8.
3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of seeing this personality sketch in fields other than Agricultural and Veterinary Science would be lower. Let's estimate 0.2.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.95} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.19} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.23} \approx 0.174 \]

### Computer Science

1. **\( P(H) \)**: Computer Science is a popular field among graduate students. Let’s assume a prior probability of 0.2.
2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: While Adam's skills in understanding abstract concepts may be suited for Computer Science, his specific leanings toward nature and animals are less indicative. Let's estimate this at 0.3.
3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Since the personality sketch might still be plausible in many other fields, this value would be a bit higher. We'll estimate 0.5.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.8} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.4} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.46} \approx 0.131 \]

### Business Administration

1. **\( P(H) \)**: This is also a popular field, so let's assume a prior probability of 0.2.
2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's personality traits don't seem to align strongly with the typical attributes for a business administration student. Let’s estimate this at 0.1.
3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Given the personality sketch could apply to many other fields too, let’s estimate 0.55.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.55 \cdot 0.8} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.44} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.46} \approx 0.043 \]

Here’s the final estimation:
