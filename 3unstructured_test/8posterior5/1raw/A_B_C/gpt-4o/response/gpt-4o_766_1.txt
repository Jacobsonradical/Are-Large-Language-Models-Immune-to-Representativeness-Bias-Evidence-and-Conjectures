To apply Bayes' theorem, we need to use the following formula to compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (i.e., Adam being enrolled in a particular field).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence given the hypothesis (i.e., the chances of Adam's personality sketch being that way if he is indeed in that field).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence given that the hypothesis is not true.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence.

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for all fields, we can use the relative likelihood for comparison among the hypotheses.

Let us denote the values as follows:

- \( P(E) \) = General probability of the evidence (personality sketch of Adam).
- \( P(H|E) \) = Probability that Adam is in a specific field given his personality sketch.

  ### Computer Science
  
  - \( P(H) \): Assuming some prior belief that a random graduate student might be in computer science, let's assume \( P(H) \) = 0.2.
  - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's attributes (high intelligence, good at solving puzzles, understanding abstract concepts), there is a reasonable fit (0.5).
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \): This depends on Adam's personality and could be more common in other fields (assuming 0.3).

  Calculation: 
  \[
  P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.5 \times 0.2}{P(E)}
  \]

  ### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
  
  - \( P(H) \): Letâ€™s assume \( P(H) \) = 0.1.
  - \( P(E|H) \): This is quite a good fit considering his love for nature and animals (0.8).
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likely to be less common outside this field given these traits (assuming 0.3).

  Calculation: 
  \[
  P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{P(E)}
  \]

  ### Business Administration
  
  - \( P(H) \): Assuming \( P(H) \) = 0.3.
  - \( P(E|H) \): Less characteristic based on his profile (0.2).
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \): More common outside the business field given these traits (0.3).

  Calculation:
  \[
  P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.3}{P(E)}
  \]

Let's plug in these numbers proportionately without resolving for the precise denominator (as we are comparing probabilities relative to each other):

- For computer science:
  \[
  P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.5 \times 0.2}{P(E)} = 0.1/P(E)
  \]

- For agricultural and veterinary science:
  \[
  P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{P(E)} = 0.08/P(E)
  \]

- For business administration:
  \[
  P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.3}{P(E)} = 0.06/P(E)
  \]

Combining these results:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.1 / (0.1 + 0.08 + 0.06),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08 / (0.1 + 0.08 + 0.06),
  "business administration": 0.06 / (0.1 + 0.08 + 0.06)
}
```

That simplifies to approximately:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4348,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3478,
  "business administration": 0.2609
}
```

Multiplying by a common factor for better readability (not necessary as they sum, but for conventional presentation):

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.43,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.34,
  "business administration": 0.26
}
```
