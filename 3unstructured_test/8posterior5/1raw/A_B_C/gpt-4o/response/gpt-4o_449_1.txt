To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate the following components for each field:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.

Bayes' rule is given as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we are not given the exact values, we will make informed estimations based on the provided sketch of Adam and general knowledge about typical students in those fields. Note that \( P(E) \) is constant across all fields and can be omitted for the purpose of comparing relative probabilities.

### Field 1: Business Administration

**P(H) for Business Administration**: Typical enrollment in this field can be considered moderately common, so let's assume this as 0.1.
**P(E|H) for Business Administration**: Business Administration students may not typically share all the characteristics described in the personality sketch (e.g., strong interest in nature, plants, and animals), so let’s assume this as 0.05.
**P(E|¬H) for Business Administration**: This can be assumed to be moderate given the diverse interests of graduate students, let's say 0.1.

### Field 2: Computer Science

**P(H) for Computer Science**: This is also a common field, so assume 0.15.
**P(E|H) for Computer Science**: Computer Science students might not typically have a strong interest in nature and animals, but high intelligence and puzzle-solving align well, so let’s say 0.1.
**P(E|¬H) for Computer Science**: This can be assumed to be similar to the general student body, so 0.1.

### Field 3: Agricultural and Veterinary Science

**P(H) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Likely less common compared to the other fields, let's assume 0.05.
**P(E|H) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Highly likely given Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, so let’s say 0.4.
**P(E|¬H) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This can be assumed lower as fewer students generally fit this specific sketch, so let’s say 0.05.

Now, using Bayes' rule:

### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = 0.005 \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} = 0.015 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} = 0.02 \]

Factor out \( P(E) \) which affects all equally for relative comparison:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.005,
  "computer science": 0.015,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.02
}
```

The probability values suggest the personality sketch is relatively more aligned with Adam being in "Agricultural and Veterinary Science," but also not insignificant for "Computer Science."
