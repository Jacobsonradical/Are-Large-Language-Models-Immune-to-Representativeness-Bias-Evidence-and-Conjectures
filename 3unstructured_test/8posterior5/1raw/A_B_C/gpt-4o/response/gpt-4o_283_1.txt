To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For each field:
- **P(H)**: Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- **P(E|H)**: Likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was enrolled in that field.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was not enrolled in that field.
- **P(H|E)**: Posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field given his personality sketch.

Since we do not have exact numbers, we will use qualitative assessments.

1. **Business Administration**:
   - **P(H)**: Let's assume the prior probability is around 0.2, as business administration is a common field.
   - **P(E|H)**: The personality sketch does not strongly align with typical business administration characteristics. Let's assume P(E|H) is 0.1.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: Since there could be other fields that align well with the sketch, let's assume P(E|\neg H) around 0.5.

   Using Bayes' theorem:
   \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **P(H)**: Let’s assume the prior probability for this field is 0.1, as it's less common.
   - **P(E|H)**: The personality sketch strongly aligns with this field, so P(E|H) might be 0.9.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of the personality sketch fitting other fields less aligned might be around 0.5.

   Using Bayes’ theorem:
   \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.09 \]

3. **Computer Science**:
   - **P(H)**: This field is quite common, so let's assume the prior probability is 0.3.
   - **P(E|H)**: The personality sketch somewhat aligns with typical traits in computer science. Let’s assume P(E|H) is 0.4.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood for other fields is assumed around 0.5.

   Using Bayes' theorem:
   \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.4 \cdot 0.3 = 0.12 \]

Now, let's normalize these values to make their total add up to 1 for comparison purposes:

\[
P(H|E)_{\text{normalized}} = \frac{P(H|E)}{\sum P(H|E)} = \frac{P(H|E)}{0.02 + 0.09 + 0.12} = \frac{P(H|E)}{0.23}
\]

Thus, the probabilities become:
\[
\begin{aligned}
  P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} &= \frac{0.02}{0.23} \approx 0.087 \\
  P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} &= \frac{0.09}{0.23} \approx 0.391 \\
  P(H|E)_{\text{computer science}} &= \frac{0.12}{0.23} \approx 0.522 \\
\end{aligned}
\]

So the final results would probably look like:
{
  "business administration": 0.087,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.391,
  "computer science": 0.522
}
