To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Here's a structured approach:

1. **Estimating \( P(H) \)**: The base probability that Adam is in each field without any additional information.
2. **Estimating \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability that Adam has the personality traits mentioned if he is in the respective field.
3. **Estimating \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability that Adam has the personality traits given he is not in the specific field. For simplicity, we'll assume \( P(E|\neg H) \) to be the same for all fields since the traits given do not clearly favor any typical graduate field.

Given:
- \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \)

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant and the same across all fields, we can ignore it for relative comparison:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \times P(H) \]

Let's make reasonable estimates and perform the calculations:

### 1. Computer Science
- \( P(H_{CS}) \): Moderate base probability, let's say 0.25.
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Considering his traits like high intelligence and problem-solving skills, this seems fairly likely, let's say 0.6.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \): Base probability for having these traits in other fields, let's say 0.2.

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{CS}) \times P(H_{CS}) = 0.6 \times 0.25 = 0.15 \]

### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H_{AV}) \): Lower general probability compared to broader fields, let's assume 0.15.
- \( P(E|H_{AV}) \): Very high given his love for nature and animals, let's say 0.8.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{AV}) \): Same base as above, 0.2.

\[ P(H_{AV}|E) \propto P(E|H_{AV}) \times P(H_{AV}) = 0.8 \times 0.15 = 0.12 \]

### 3. Business Administration
- \( P(H_{BA}) \): Fairly common field, general moderate probability, let's say 0.2.
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): Lower considering his traits, which don't naturally align with business skills, let's say 0.2.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \): Same base as above, 0.2.

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto P(E|H_{BA}) \times P(H_{BA}) = 0.2 \times 0.2 = 0.04 \]

### Normalizing (for relative comparison)
Let's calculate the sum:

\[ \text{Sum} = 0.15 + 0.12 + 0.04 = 0.31 \]

We need to find the relative probabilities by dividing each by the sum:

\[
\begin{align*}
P(H_{CS}|E) &= \frac{0.15}{0.31} \approx 0.48 \\
P(H_{AV}|E) &= \frac{0.12}{0.31} \approx 0.39 \\
P(H_{BA}|E) &= \frac{0.04}{0.31} \approx 0.13 \\
\end{align*}
\]

### Final Results

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.48,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.39,
  "business administration": 0.13
}
```

These estimates suggest that given Adam's personality traits, it is most likely that he pursued Computer Science, followed by Agricultural and Veterinary Science, with Business Administration being the least likely.
