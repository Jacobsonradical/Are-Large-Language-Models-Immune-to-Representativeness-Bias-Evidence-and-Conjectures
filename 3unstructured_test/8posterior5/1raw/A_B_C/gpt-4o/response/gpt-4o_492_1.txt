To compute the probability of Adam being enrolled in each of the three fields, we will apply Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, we need to understand:

- \( P(H) \) = the base rate or prior probability of being enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) = the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch, given he is in a particular field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) = the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch, given he is not in that field.
- \( P(E) \) = the overall probability of Adam's personality sketch, which is a normalizing factor.

We involve assumptions based on common stereotypes and typical characteristics of people in these fields. We do not have exact data, so these are reasoned estimates for the probabilities.

### Assumptions:

1. **Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)**:
   - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: There are fewer students in these fields compared to others, so let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
   - Computer Science: One of the most popular fields, so let's assume \( P(H) = 0.4 \).
   - Business Administration: Another popular field, assume \( P(H) = 0.3 \).

2. **Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) (How well the personality sketch fits each field)**:
   - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals fits very well. Assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
   - Computer Science: Solving puzzles can fit well, but other aspects like a love for nature may not fit as well. Assume \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \).
   - Business Administration: Traits like empathy and understanding dedication fit moderately. Assume \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \) (How well the personality sketch fits if not in that field)**:
   - Let's assume that the personality profile is somewhat uncommon overall, making \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \) for simplification.

Given these constraints, the normalization factor \( P(E) \) can be calculated as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{AgriVet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AgriVet}}) + P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|H_{\text{BusAdm}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BusAdm}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{AgriVet}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{AgriVet}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{BusAdm}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{BusAdm}}) \]

We can simplify this to \( P(E) \approx \sum_{i} P(E|H_i) \cdot P(H_i) + P(E|\neg H_i) \cdot [1 - P(H_i)] \) because \( P(H) \) of each hypothesis sums to less than 1 due to the presence of other fields.

### Calculation:
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
\[ P(H_{\text{AgriVet}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AgriVet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AgriVet}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{\text{Normalization factor}} \approx 0.08 \]

2. **Computer Science**
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.4}{\text{Normalization factor}} \approx 0.16 \]

3. **Business Administration**
\[ P(H_{\text{BusAdm}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BusAdm}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BusAdm}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.3}{\text{Normalization factor}} \approx 0.09 \]

Finally, after calculating and normalizing, our probabilities in a simplified manner assuming that the normalization implicitly adjusted, and probabilities are recalculated.

### Final Estimates:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.32,
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.28
}
```

Note: These numbers are illustrative and depend on subjective estimates for some probabilities. A more accurate assessment would require detailed empirical data.
