To apply Bayes' theorem and update our beliefs about the field of study Adam is enrolled in, we need to compute the probabilities step by step. Given Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We can assume that the probability of seeing traits in personality sketch \(E\) generally for a field \(H\) represents how well they align with characteristics commonly seen in people from those fields. Letâ€™s break it down for each hypothesis.

1. **business administration**
   - **P(H)**: Assume equal prior probability for Adam being in any of the fields listed. Hence, let's say \(P(\text{business administration}) = 0.33\) (approximate assumption for simplicity given no specific prior knowledge).
   - **P(E|H)**: Traits like empathy, understanding abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work can be seen in business administration, but love for nature and animals is less aligned. Let's estimate \(P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.2\).
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: This term represents the probability of \(E\) given Adam is in any other field. Given other fields listed generally align more with the provided traits, let's estimate it as an average of \(P(E)\) for other fields. Let's say \(P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) = 0.6\).

2. **agricultural and veterinary science**
   - **P(H)**: Assume equal prior probability, 0.33.
   - **P(E|H)**: Traits like deep love for animals, curiosity about nature, and empathy are highly aligned. Let's estimate \(P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.9\).
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: This probability is computed similarly as before but will be lower due to higher alignment with the traits described earlier. Estimate \(P(E|\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.4\).

3. **computer science**
   - **P(H)**: Assume equal prior probability, 0.33.
   - **P(E|H)**: Traits like high intelligence and good at abstract concepts fit well, but interest in nature and animals is less common. Let's estimate \(P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.3\).
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: Similar to previous, but again with adjustment. Estimate \(P(E|\neg \text{computer science}) = 0.55\).

Using these, compute posterior probabilities:

1. business administration:
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.2 \times 0.33}{0.2 \times 0.33 + 0.9 \times 0.33 + 0.3 \times 0.33} \approx \frac{0.066}{0.297} \approx 0.22 \]

2. agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.9 \times 0.33}{0.2 \times 0.33 + 0.9 \times 0.33 + 0.3 \times 0.33} \approx \frac{0.297}{0.297} = 1 \]

3. computer science:
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.3 \times 0.33}{0.2 \times 0.33 + 0.9 \times 0.33 + 0.3 \times 0.33} \approx \frac{0.099}{0.297} \approx 0.33 \]

So the approximate posterior probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": 0.22,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 1.00,
  "computer science": 0.33
}
