To apply Bayes' theorem, we need to evaluate P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|\neg H) for each hypothesis. Here's an assessment for the three graduate fields of specialization:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Assuming a uniform distribution over a wide range of disciplines, let's consider this to be relatively low but non-negligible, say 0.1.
   - **P(E|H)**: This is the probability of Adam's characteristics given he is in agricultural and veterinary science. Since Adam has a deep love for animals, genuine curiosity about nature and its plants, and strong empathy, this seems like a good fit. Let's assign this a high value, say 0.8.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: This is the probability of Adam's characteristics given he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. While it’s possible these characteristics could be present in other domains, it's likely lower than P(E|H). Let's assume this value to be 0.2.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Although the exact P(E) is unknown, we can calculate it proportionally:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

We will normalize these values later.

2. **Computer Science**
   - **P(H)**: The prior probability of a student being in computer science is reasonably high considering the popularity of the field, say 0.2.
   - **P(E|H)**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is good at understanding abstract concepts, which are important in computer science. While not a perfect fit, it’s reasonable, say 0.5.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam’s characteristics given he is not in computer science might be proportionally similar to agricultural and veterinary science, say 0.2.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

Again, we will normalize these values.

3. **Business Administration**
   - **P(H)**: Business Administration is another common field, so let’s consider it at 0.2.
   - **P(E|H)**: Adam's characteristics do not strongly align with a typical business administration profile, particularly his deep love for nature and animals and strong empathy. It seems less likely, say 0.1.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam having these characteristics if he’s not in business administration remains similar, say 0.2.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

Now, let's combine and normalize these probabilities by dividing each by the sum of them:

\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.5 \cdot 0.2 + 0.1 \cdot 0.2 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.1 + 0.02 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.2 \]

Normalized probabilities:

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.2} = 0.4 \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.2} = 0.5 \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.2} = 0.1 \]

So the final probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4,
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```
