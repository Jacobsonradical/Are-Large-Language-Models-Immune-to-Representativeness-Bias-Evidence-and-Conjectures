To calculate the probability of Adam being enrolled in each field given his personality sketch \( E \), we use Bayes' theorem, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, let's notice that we mainly need relative probabilities, hence \( P(E) \) can be omitted as it is a common normalization factor for all three fields. Let's evaluate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's characteristics such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work align strongly with this field.

   \[
   \begin{align*}
   P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) & : \text{moderate base rate for graduate students} \rightarrow 0.1  \\
   P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) & : \text{very high} \rightarrow 0.9 \\
   P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) & : \text{lower, as other fields are less likely to match all traits} \rightarrow 0.3 \\
   \end{align*}
   \]

   \[
   P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.09
   \]

2. **Computer Science**: Adam's high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts fit, but other traits do not align strongly with this field.

   \[
   \begin{align*}
   P(H_{\text{computer science}}) & : \text{moderate to high base rate for graduate students} \rightarrow 0.2  \\
   P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) & : \text{moderate} \rightarrow 0.5 \\
   P(E|\neg H_{\text{computer science}}) & : \text{could be higher, given the mismatch for some traits} \rightarrow 0.35 \\
   \end{align*}
   \]

   \[
   P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.5 \cdot 0.2 = 0.1
   \]

3. **Business Administration**: This field doesn't align well with Adam's traits, especially his love for animals and nature.

   \[
   \begin{align*}
   P(H_{\text{business administration}}) & : \text{moderate to high base rate for graduate students} \rightarrow 0.2  \\
   P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) & : \text{low} \rightarrow 0.2 \\
   P(E|\neg H_{\text{business administration}}) & : \text{higher as other fields are more likely to fit} \rightarrow 0.4 \\
   \end{align*}
   \]

   \[
   P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \cdot 0.2 = 0.04
   \]

Given the values:

\[
\{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.09,
  "computer science": 0.1,
  "business administration": 0.04
\}
\]
