Sure, let's start by assigning some hypothetical probabilities to prior and conditional probabilities as accurately as possible given the description. Here are the designated values:

1. **Business Administration:**
   - \(P(H_{\text{BA}})\): Probability that Adam is in a business administration program. Let's assume this is quite low due to his love for nature and animals, so let's say 0.05.
   - \(P(E|H_{\text{BA}})\): Probability of Adam having the described characteristics given that he is in business administration. This is also pretty low; let's assume 0.1.
   - \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}})\): Probability of Adam having the described characteristics given that he is not in business administration. Let's assume this is relatively higher; let's say 0.5.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - \(P(H_{\text{CS}})\): Probability that Adam is in a computer science program. This is moderate considering his intelligence and puzzle-solving skills, so let's say 0.3.
   - \(P(E|H_{\text{CS}})\): Probability of Adam having the described characteristics given that he is in computer science. This is moderately likely, let's assume 0.2.
   - \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}})\): Probability of Adam having the described characteristics given that he is not in computer science. We'll give it a slightly higher value than the specific interest match, so let's say 0.4.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \(P(H_{\text{AgVet}})\): Probability that Adam is in an agricultural and veterinary science program. Given his love for nature and animals, this seems quite high, let's say 0.6.
   - \(P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}})\): Probability of Adam having the described characteristics given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science. This seems very high, let's assume 0.8.
   - \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{AgVet}})\): Probability of Adam having the described characteristics given that he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Given the specific fit, let's say 0.3.

Now, let's use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probabilities \(P(H|E)\):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) \]

Let's calculate \(P(E)\):

\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.3) + (0.8 \cdot 0.6) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.005 + 0.06 + 0.48 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.545 \]

Now we can compute the posterior probabilities:

1. **Business Administration:**

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.05}{0.545} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.545} \approx 0.0092 \]

2. **Computer Science:**

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{0.545} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.545} \approx 0.1101 \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

\[ P(H_{\text{AgVet}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AgVet}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.6}{0.545} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{AgVet}}|E) = \frac{0.48}{0.545} \approx 0.8807 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0092,
  "computer science": 0.1101,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8807
}
```
