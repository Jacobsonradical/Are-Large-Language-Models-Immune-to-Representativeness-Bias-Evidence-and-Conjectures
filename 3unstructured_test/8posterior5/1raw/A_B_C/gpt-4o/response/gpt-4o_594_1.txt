Let's go through the task of computing \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Rule. Bayes' Rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the nature of the problem and the characteristics of Adam, we will need to make some reasonable assumptions about the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and conditional probabilities \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

### 1. Business Administration
- **Prior Probability (P(H)):** Let's assume that the probability of any given student being enrolled in business administration is lower considering Adam's personality. Let's set \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
- **Likelihood (P(E|H)):** Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and interest in solving puzzles, these traits don't strongly align with business administration. Set \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
- **Prior Probability complement (P(\neg H)):** Since there are multiple other fields, let's just complement this. \( P(\neg H) = 0.9 \).
- **Complement Likelihood (P(E|\neg H)):** Given his characteristics, they are more likely to align outside of business administration. Let's set \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

Plugging into Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.1) + (0.4 \cdot 0.9) = 0.01 + 0.36 = 0.37 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.37} ≈ 0.027 \]

### 2. Computer Science
- **Prior Probability (P(H)):** Computer Science is a reasonably popular field, so let's set \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
- **Likelihood (P(E|H)):** Adam likes solving puzzles and understands abstract concepts well, which align well with computer science. Set \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).
- **Prior Probability complement (P(\neg H)):** Simply, \( P(\neg H) = 0.8 \).
- **Complement Likelihood (P(E|\neg H)):** Outside computer science, these traits are slightly less likely but common enough. Let's say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

Plugging into Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.2) + (0.5 \cdot 0.8) = 0.14 + 0.4 = 0.54 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.54} ≈ 0.259 \]

### 3. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **Prior Probability (P(H)):** Given Adam's love for animals, let's set \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
- **Likelihood (P(E|H)):** Adam's empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work suggest a strong fit. Set \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
- **Prior Probability complement (P(\neg H)):** There are many non-agricultural fields. \( P(\neg H) = 0.9 \).
- **Complement Likelihood (P(E|\neg H)):** These traits fit other fields moderately too. \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

Plugging into Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.5 \cdot 0.9) = 0.08 + 0.45 = 0.53 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.53} ≈ 0.151 \]

### Summary

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.027,
  "computer science": 0.259,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.151
}
```

These computed values provide insight into the likelihoods given Adam's personality. Note that these values assume reasonable estimates for the prior and likelihood probabilities.
