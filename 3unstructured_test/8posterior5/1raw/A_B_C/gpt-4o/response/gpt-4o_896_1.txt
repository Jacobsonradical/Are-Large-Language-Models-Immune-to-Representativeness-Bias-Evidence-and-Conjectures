To compute the probabilities, we need to make some assumptions and estimations for P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|¬H).

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field, which we'll assume is roughly the prevalence of each field among graduate students.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in the field.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in the field. 

Here are some educated guesses and assumptions to help set these values:

- **Business Administration**:
  - **P(H):** Business Administration is a fairly common field among graduate students, so let's estimate P(H) = 0.2.
  - **P(E|H):** Given the personality sketch, it's less likely that Adam is studying Business Administration since the sketch doesn't highlight typical interests or traits associated with that field. Let's estimate P(E|H) = 0.1.
  - **P(E|¬H):** For someone not in Business Administration, the probability of having such traits could be more common. Estimate P(E|¬H) = 0.3.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  - **P(H):** This is a less common field among graduate students, so let's estimate P(H) = 0.1.
  - **P(E|H):** Given Adam's traits like love for nature, plants, and animals, this field seems very fitting. Let's estimate P(E|H) = 0.6.
  - **P(E|¬H):** For someone not in this field, the personality sketch is less likely, given the specific interests. Estimate P(E|¬H) = 0.2.

- **Computer Science**:
  - **P(H):** Computer Science is a common field among graduate students. Let's estimate P(H) = 0.25.
  - **P(E|H):** While Computer Science students can be quiet and good at puzzles, the focus on nature and animals seems less typical. Let's estimate P(E|H) = 0.2.
  - **P(E|¬H):** For someone not in Computer Science, the probability of having such traits is not drastically different but a bit higher. Estimate P(E|¬H) = 0.3.

Using Bayes' Rule, \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \). Since the absolute value of \( P(E) \) can be tricky without full context, we simplify the comparison by essentially using relative numbers.

**Business Administration:**
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.6 \cdot 0.1 = 0.06 \]

**Computer Science:**
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \cdot 0.25 = 0.05 \]

Now normalizing these values to fall between 0 and 1 while maintaining their relative proportions:

* Sum of all proportional probabilities: 0.02 + 0.06 + 0.05 = 0.13
  * Normalize for each:
    * Business Administration: \( \frac{0.02}{0.13} \approx 0.15 \)
    * Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( \frac{0.06}{0.13} \approx 0.46 \)
    * Computer Science: \( \frac{0.05}{0.13} \approx 0.39 \)

Putting all this together:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.15,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.46,
  "computer science": 0.39
}
```

This analysis suggests that Adam is most likely to be enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science based on the personality sketch provided.
