Let's determine the probabilities step by step. 

### Prior Probabilities P(H)
The priors aren't specified, but we can use some reasonable assumptions based on general trends in graduate enrollment in the U.S.

- **P(Agri and Vet Science)**: Since this is a less common field compared to others, I'll assume a lower prior probability. Let's say 0.1.
- **P(Business Admin)**: This is a popular field for graduate students. Let's estimate it at 0.3.
- **P(Comp Sci)**: Another popular field. We'll also put this at 0.3.
- **P(Other Fields)**: The complement, which would be 1 - 0.1 - 0.3 - 0.3 = 0.3 for simplicity.

### Likelihood P(E|H)
Now, let's consider how likely Adam's personality sketch fits each field:

- **P(E|Agri and Vet Science)**: High, since he has a strong love for nature, animals, and empathy. Let's assign 0.8.
- **P(E|Business Admin)**: Moderate, since empathy can be a useful trait, but it doesn't directly align with other personality traits mentioned. Let's estimate 0.2.
- **P(E|Comp Sci)**: Moderate-high, because his love for puzzles, high intelligence, and abstract thinking align well with computer science. Let's assign 0.6.
- **P(E|Other Fields)**: Assume an average fit with P(E|Other Fields) = 0.4.

### Marginal Likelihood P(E)
P(E) is found by summing over all possible fields:
\[ P(E) = P(E|Agri) * P(Agri) + P(E|Bus) * P(Bus) + P(E|CompSci) * P(CompSci) + P(E|Other) * P(Other) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.8 * 0.1 + 0.2 * 0.3 + 0.6 * 0.3 + 0.4 * 0.3 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.06 + 0.18 + 0.12 = 0.44 \]

### Posterior Probabilities P(H|E)
Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{ P(E|H) * P(H) }{ P(E) } \]

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{ 0.8 * 0.1 }{ 0.44 } = \frac{ 0.08 }{ 0.44 } \approx 0.182 \]

- **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{ 0.2 * 0.3 }{ 0.44 } = \frac{ 0.06 }{ 0.44 } \approx 0.136 \]

- **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{ 0.6 * 0.3 }{ 0.44 } = \frac{ 0.18 }{ 0.44 } \approx 0.409 \]

Here's the result in the required format:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.182,
  "business administration": 0.136,
  "computer science": 0.409
}
```

Note: The probabilities don't need to add up to 1, as there are other possible fields of specialization.
