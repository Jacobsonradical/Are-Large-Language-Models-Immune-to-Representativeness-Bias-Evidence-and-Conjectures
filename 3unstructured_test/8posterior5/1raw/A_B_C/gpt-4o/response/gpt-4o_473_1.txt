To solve this problem, we will need to use Bayes' Theorem, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence.

Our goal is to compute \( P(H|E) \), the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.

Let's start with some rough estimations based on the personality sketch and the fields:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H_1) \): This field is somewhat common for someone with Adam's interest in nature and animals. Let's estimate it at 0.1.
   - \( P(E|H_1) \): Given Adam's characteristics, it's highly likely he would be in this field. Let's estimate 0.8.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_1) \): Given that Adam's traits are somewhat specific to this field, we'll estimate a lower likelihood. Let's estimate 0.2.
   
2. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H_2) \): Computer Science field is quite common. Let's estimate it at 0.3.
   - \( P(E|H_2) \): Given Adam's characteristics, it's somewhat likely he could be in this field due to the puzzle-solving trait. Let's estimate 0.5.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_2) \): Given that puzzle-solving is not uncommon in other fields either, we'll estimate a similar likelihood. Let's estimate 0.3.
   
3. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H_3) \): This is also a common field, but less likely given his traits. Let's estimate it at 0.15.
   - \( P(E|H_3) \): Given Adam's characteristics, it's less likely he would be in this field. Let's estimate 0.3.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_3) \): Given that his traits don't strongly align with this field, we'll estimate a lower likelihood. Let's estimate 0.15.

Now we'll compute \( P(H|E) \):

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[
   P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)}
   \]
   
2. **Computer Science**:
   \[
   P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)}
   \]
   
3. **Business Administration**:
   \[
   P(H_3|E) = \frac{P(E|H_3) \cdot P(H_3)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)}
   \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a common normalizing factor, we can exclude it for comparative purposes.

Comparatively calculating:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[
   P(H_1|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08
   \]

2. **Computer Science**:
   \[
   P(H_2|E) \propto 0.5 \cdot 0.3 = 0.15
   \]

3. **Business Administration**:
   \[
   P(H_3|E) \propto 0.3 \cdot 0.15 = 0.045
   \]

The approximate probabilities (normalized for comparison) would be:

\[
P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.15 + 0.045} = \frac{0.08}{0.275} \approx 0.291
\]
\[
P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.15}{0.08 + 0.15 + 0.045} = \frac{0.15}{0.275} \approx 0.545
\]
\[
P(H_3|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.08 + 0.15 + 0.045} = \frac{0.045}{0.275} \approx 0.164
\]

Thus, the estimates for the fields are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.291,
  "computer science": 0.545,
  "business administration": 0.164
}
