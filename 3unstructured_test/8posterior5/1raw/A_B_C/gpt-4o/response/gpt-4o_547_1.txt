Certainly! Let's break it down step-by-step for each field. 

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS)**
   - **P(H):** This is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given his strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, let's assign this a reasonably high prior probability, say, 0.3.
   - **P(E|H):** This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in AVS. Given his strong alignment with the traits often associated with AVS, such as a love for nature and animals, let's assign this a high probability, say, 0.9.
   - **P(E|¬H):** This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in AVS. Considering that these traits might not be as strongly associated with other fields, let's assign it a lower value, say, 0.4.

   Using Bayes' rule:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)}
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.3}{0.9 \times 0.3 + 0.4 \times 0.7} = \frac{0.27}{0.27 + 0.28} \approx 0.49
   \]

2. **Business Administration (BA)**
   - **P(H):** This is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration. Given his personality traits don't strongly align with typical attributes of business students, let's assign it a lower prior probability, say, 0.2.
   - **P(E|H):** This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in BA. Since the traits are less correlated with this field, let's assign this a lower value, say, 0.3.
   - **P(E|¬H):** This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in BA. Let's assign it a value considering he might be more likely in other related fields, say, 0.5.

   Using Bayes' rule:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)}
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{0.3 \times 0.2 + 0.5 \times 0.8} = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.4} \approx 0.13
   \]

3. **Computer Science (CS)**
   - **P(H):** This is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Computer Science. Given that he enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, his personality might align somewhat with this field. Let's assign a moderate prior probability, say, 0.25.
   - **P(E|H):** This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in CS. His traits (like problem-solving and intelligence) align well, but his interest in nature and animals less so. Let's assign this a moderate value, say, 0.6.
   - **P(E|¬H):** This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in CS. Considering he's likely in another field like AVS, let's assign a moderate value reflecting a mix of other fields, say, 0.5.

   Using Bayes' rule:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)}
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.25}{0.6 \times 0.25 + 0.5 \times 0.75} = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.375} \approx 0.29
   \]

Summarizing:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.49,
  "business administration": 0.13,
  "computer science": 0.29
}
```

These probabilities reflect how well Adam's personality sketch aligns with each field, given our assumptions.
