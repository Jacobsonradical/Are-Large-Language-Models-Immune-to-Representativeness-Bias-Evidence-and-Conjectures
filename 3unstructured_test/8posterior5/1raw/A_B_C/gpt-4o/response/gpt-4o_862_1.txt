To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in that field.

We employ Bayes' rule as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that \( P(E) \) is constant across all fields, we can focus on the numerator to rank the probabilities. We'll make reasonable assumptions about \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

### business administration
1. **P(H_business)**: Let's assume that the base rate of students in business administration is not particularly high for someone with Adam's interests.
   - **P(H)**: 0.1
2. **P(E|H_business)**: The likelihood that a business student has Adam's traits.
   - **P(E|H)**: 0.05
3. **P(E|\neg H_business)**: Given that he isn't in business administration, it's more likely for someone with Adam's traits to be in another field.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: 0.3

### computer science
1. **P(H_CS)**: Let's assume computer science is relatively popular among graduate students, but not necessarily fitting Adam's profile perfectly.
   - **P(H)**: 0.2
2. **P(E|H_CS)**: The likelihood that a computer science student has Adam's traits, given his love for puzzles and high intelligence.
   - **P(E|H)**: 0.3
3. **P(E|\neg H_CS)**: Given that he isn't in computer science, the likelihood of seeing Adam's traits might be slightly higher in other fields more aligned with nature and animals.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: 0.4

### agricultural and veterinary science
1. **P(H_agriculture)**: Considering Adam's traits, this field seems to align closely.
   - **P(H)**: 0.1
2. **P(E|H_agriculture)**: The likelihood that an agricultural/veterinary science student has Adam's traits.
   - **P(E|H)**: 0.8
3. **P(E|\neg H_agriculture)**: The likelihood of seeing Adam's traits, given that he is not in agricultural/veterinary science.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: 0.2

Now we use these values to compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ 
\begin{align*}
P(H_{\text{business}}|E) &\propto P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}}) \\
&= 0.05 \times 0.1 = 0.005 \\

P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) &\propto P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) \\
&= 0.3 \times 0.2 = 0.06 \\

P(H_{\text{agriculture}}|E) &\propto P(E|H_{\text{agriculture}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agriculture}}) \\
&= 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \\
\end{align*}
\]

The proportional chances without normalization are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.005,
  "computer science": 0.06,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08
}
```

This means that, based on the sketch provided, Adam is most likely enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, reasonably likely in computer science, and least likely in business administration.
