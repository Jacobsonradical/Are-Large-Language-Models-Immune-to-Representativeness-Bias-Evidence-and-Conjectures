To apply Bayes' Rule for each field of study, we need to evaluate the following probabilities:

1. P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
2. P(E|H): The likelihood of the personality sketch E given that Adam is in that field.
3. P(E|¬H): The likelihood of the personality sketch E given that Adam is NOT in that field.

Bayes' Rule states that:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, we can assume that P(H) is roughly equal for all three fields as a starting point, and P(E) remains constant and can be normalized across the fields.

Here is how we might assign values:

### Computer Science:
- **P(H)**: Let's assign a reasonable prior for grad students in CS, say 0.2 (20%).
- **P(E|H)**: Given the description, the fit isn’t perfect but acceptable due to the intelligence and abstract thinking traits. Say 0.4 (40%).
- **P(E|¬H)**: The general likelihood of someone fitting this personality sketch not in CS could be lower. Say 0.3 (30%).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- **P(H)**: Assume a lower prior than CS, say 0.1 (10%).
- **P(E|H)**: This seems like a perfect fit given Adam's interests, empathy, and love for animals. Say 0.8 (80%).
- **P(E|¬H)**: The description shares traits with other fields but not as much. Say 0.3 (30%).

### Business Administration:
- **P(H)**: Assume a lower prior considering typical backgrounds for this type, say 0.15 (15%).
- **P(E|H)**: The fit is not particularly strong since the traits do not align closely with typical MBA students. Say 0.2 (20%).
- **P(E|¬H)**: Similarly, the description does not fit well with non-MBA fields generally. Say 0.3 (30%).

Now apply Bayes' Rule:

- **Computer Science:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.08}{P(E)} \]

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.08}{P(E)} \]

- **Business Administration:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} = \frac{0.03}{P(E)} \]

Normalizing these, the total probability gotta sum up:
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.08 + 0.03 = 0.19\]

Therefore:

- **Computer Science:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.19} = 0.421 \]

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.19} = 0.421 \]

- **Business Administration:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.19} = 0.158 \]

So, finally the results are:
```
{
  "computer science": "0.421",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.421",
  "business administration": "0.158"
}
```
