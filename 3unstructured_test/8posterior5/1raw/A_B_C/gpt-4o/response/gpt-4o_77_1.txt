To use Bayes' rule to calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis, we need to judge the following probabilities:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in the specific field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adamâ€™s personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in the specific field.

We can then use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we're comparing the fields, we don't need the exact value of \( P(E) \). Instead, we'll compute the relative probabilities up to a proportionality constant.

### Assumptions:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.10 \) (A rough estimate given the various fields.)
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.90 \) (High likelihood given his curiosity about nature, plants, animals, and empathy.)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.20 \) (Less likely outside this field given the specific qualities.)

2. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.20 \) (A common field of study.)
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.70 \) (Moderately high likelihood given his intelligence and affinity for puzzles.)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.50 \) (More common to have such traits in other fields.)

3. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.15 \) (Another common field of study.)
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.30 \) (Lower likelihood given the mismatch between personality traits and business focuses.)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.70 \) (Many people outside business might have such traits.)

Now, using these estimates:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.90 \times 0.10 = 0.09 \]

2. **Computer Science:**
   \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.70 \times 0.20 = 0.14 \]

3. **Business Administration:**
   \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.30 \times 0.15 = 0.045 \]

Now, normalizing these to compare:

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \approx \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.14 + 0.045} = \frac{0.09}{0.275} \approx 0.327 \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) \approx \frac{0.14}{0.09 + 0.14 + 0.045} = \frac{0.14}{0.275} \approx 0.509 \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) \approx \frac{0.045}{0.09 + 0.14 + 0.045} = \frac{0.045}{0.275} \approx 0.164 \]

### Final Answer:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.327,
  "computer science": 0.509,
  "business administration": 0.164
}

These are the relative probabilities that Adam was in each of the specified fields, given his personality sketch.
