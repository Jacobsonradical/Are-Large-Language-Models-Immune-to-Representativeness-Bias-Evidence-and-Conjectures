### Estimations:

**1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

- **P(H)**: Agricultural and veterinary science is a specialized field, and the proportion of graduate students enrolled in it is relatively small compared to broader fields like business administration or computer science. Let's estimate it:
  - P(H) ≈ 0.1

- **P(E|H)**: Given the personality sketch, Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align very well with agricultural and veterinary science.
  - P(E|H) ≈ 0.8

- **P(E|¬H)**: The personality sketch is quite specific to traits aligning with agricultural and veterinary science. These traits might be less prevalent or relevant in other fields on average.
  - P(E|¬H) ≈ 0.3

- **P(H|E)**: Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's calculate an estimate for P(E):

\[ P(H|E) ≈ \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

Given \(P(E) = P(E \cap H_{agri}) + P(E \cap H_{bus}) + P(E \cap H_{comp}) + ... \approx 0.4\)

\[ P(H|E) ≈ \frac{0.08}{0.4} = 0.2 \]


**2. Business Administration**

- **P(H)**: Business administration tracks tend to have a higher enrollment rate compared to niche fields.
  - P(H) ≈ 0.25

- **P(E|H)**: Adam's traits like love for puzzles and high intelligence could be useful in business, but they directly indicate a less relevant alignment with business administration than agricultural science.
  - P(E|H) ≈ 0.2

- **P(E|¬H)**: Given that the traits do not clearly specify business administration and are less likely in business admin students.
  - P(E|¬H) ≈ 0.4

- **P(H|E)**: Using Bayes' rule.
  
\[ P(H|E) ≈ \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.4} = \frac{0.05}{0.4} = 0.125 \]

**3. Computer Science**

- **P(H)**: Computer Science is a popular graduate field with high enrollment rates.
  - P(H) ≈ 0.3

- **P(E|H)**: Adam’s high intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles strongly fit computer science traits, though less so his love for animals and nature.
  - P(E|H) ≈ 0.5

- **P(E|¬H)**: Still, since quite a few traits align well with computer science, it could mean the traits found in non-computer science students might be more common.
  - P(E|¬H) ≈ 0.3

- **P(H|E)**: Using Bayes' rule:
  
\[ P(H|E) ≈ \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.15}{0.4} = 0.375 \]

### Final Results:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.125,
  "computer science": 0.375
