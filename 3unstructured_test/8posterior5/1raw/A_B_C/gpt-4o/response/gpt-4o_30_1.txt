To compute the conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) through Bayes' rule, we need the following:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam having the described personality traits given he is in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam having the described personality traits given he is not in that field.

For Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same across all fields, we can focus on the numerator: \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \). We can normalize these products later to make them sum to 1 if needed, but that is not required for this exercise as stated.

I will estimate these values based on the description E.

### Field: Business Administration
- \( P(H_{\text{business}}) \): Moderate, since business administration is a common field.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \): Low, as business administration does not typically align strongly with empathy, love for animals, or curiosity about plants.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}}) \): Higher than \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \), as other fields could align better with Adam's interests and traits.

### Field: Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H_{\text{agricultural}}) \): Lower, as it's a more specialized field compared to business.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural}}) \): High, as Adam's traits align well with empathy for animals, curiosity about plants, and appreciation for nature and hard work.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural}}) \): Lower, as fewer other fields have such a strong alignment with Adam's personality sketch.

### Field: Computer Science
- \( P(H_{\text{comp_sci}}) \): Moderate, because computer science is a popular graduate field.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{comp_sci}}) \): Medium, as interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence fit, but empathy and love for animals might not.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{comp_sci}}) \): Similar or slightly lower, as there are fields more aligned with his empathy and nature interests.

### Calculating \( P(H|E) \)
To compute the likelihood, we'll assign some reasonable estimates to these probabilities and then apply Bayes' rule, disregarding the common factor \( P(E) \):

For Business Administration:
- \( P(H_{\text{business}}) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) = 0.1 \)
- Calculation: \( 0.3 \cdot 0.1 = 0.03 \)

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- \( P(H_{\text{agricultural}}) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural}}) = 0.8 \)
- Calculation: \( 0.1 \cdot 0.8 = 0.08 \)

For Computer Science:
- \( P(H_{\text{comp_sci}}) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{comp_sci}}) = 0.4 \)
- Calculation: \( 0.3 \cdot 0.4 = 0.12 \)

Normalize by the sum of the products for comparison only:
Sum of products = 0.03 + 0.08 + 0.12 = 0.23

### Final probabilities \( P(H|E) \):
{
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.03}{0.23} \approx 0.13 \),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{0.08}{0.23} \approx 0.35 \),
  "computer science": \( \frac{0.12}{0.23} \approx 0.52 \)
}

These are rough estimates intended for illustrative purposes. In an actual scenario, more precise data would be needed to generate accurate probabilities.
