Let's start by evaluating each field under consideration using Bayes' rule.

Bayes' rule states that:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we're considering three different fields, we need to judge the probabilities for each of them. We can assume that before analyzing the descriptions, each field might be equally likely. We can adjust these prior probabilities based on general knowledge and then use the personality sketch to update them.

### Prior Probabilities (P(H))
We will start with an educated guess for prior probabilities based on the prevalence of these fields in graduate programs and how they might fit generally with the personality sketch:

- \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.1 \)
- \( P(\text{business administration}) \approx 0.2 \)
- \( P(\text{computer science}) \approx 0.2 \)

### Likelihoods (P(E|H))
Next, we assess how well Adam's personality sketch fits each field:

- For agricultural and veterinary science:
  - Adam's interest in nature and animals fits this field very well.
  - \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.9 \)
  
- For business administration:
  - Adam’s interest in puzzles and abstract thinking fits moderately, but there’s a lack of direct connection with nature or animals.
  - \( P(E|\text{business administration}) \approx 0.2 \)
  
- For computer science:
  - Adam's high intelligence and abstract thinking fit well, but there's less direct connection to nature and animals.
  - \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \approx 0.5 \)

### Complement Probabilities (P(E|¬H))
To complete our calculations, we need to consider complementary probabilities:

- For fields other than agricultural and veterinary science (\(P(E|\neg \text{H})\)):
  - Since Adam’s interest and personality traits seem very specialized, assigning a low value makes sense.
  - \( P(E|\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.3 \)
  
- For fields other than business administration (\(P(E|\neg \text{H})\)):
  - Traits are more common across a range of fields besides business administration.
  - \( P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) \approx 0.6 \)
  
- For fields other than computer science (\(P(E|\neg \text{H})\)):
  - Adam’s traits fit moderately to well in several fields besides computer science.
  - \( P(E|\neg \text{computer science}) \approx 0.5 \)

### Posterior Probabilities (P(H|E))
Using Bayes’ rule:

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(\text{H} | \text{E}) = \frac{P(\text{E} | \text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H})}{P(\text{E})} = \frac{0.9 \times 0.1}{0.3} \approx 0.3 \]

**Business Administration:**
\[ P(\text{H} | \text{E}) = \frac{P(\text{E} | \text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H})}{P(\text{E})} = \frac{0.2 \times 0.2}{0.6} \approx 0.067 \]

**Computer Science:**
\[ P(\text{H} | \text{E}) = \frac{P(\text{E} | \text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H})}{P(\text{E})} = \frac{0.5 \times 0.2}{0.5} \approx 0.2 \]

### Conclusion
We can now assemble the final values:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.067,
  "computer science": 0.2
