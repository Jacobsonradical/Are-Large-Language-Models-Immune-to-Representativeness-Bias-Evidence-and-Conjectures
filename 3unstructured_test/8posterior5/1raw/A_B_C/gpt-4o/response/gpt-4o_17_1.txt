To answer this question, we will apply Bayes' theorem (P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)) for each field to update our beliefs about Adam's field of study given the personality sketch E.

### Hypotheses:
- \( H_1 \): Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( H_2 \): Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( H_3 \): Adam was enrolled in business administration.

### Priors (P(H)):
These represent our initial beliefs about Adam's enrollment in each field without any additional information and could be based on how common each field is among graduate students in the U.S. Let's assume equal priors for simplicity (though in reality, other information might suggest differing priors):
- \( P(H_1) = 0.33 \)
- \( P(H_2) = 0.33 \)
- \( P(H_3) = 0.33 \)

### Likelihoods (P(E|H)):
These represent the probability of the personality sketch given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|H_1) \): High, as Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy align well with agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assign this a value of 0.9.
- \( P(E|H_2) \): Moderate, as Adam's intelligence and puzzle-solving skills align with computer science, but there is less alignment with his empathy and love for nature. Let's assign this a value of 0.4.
- \( P(E|H_3) \): Low, as business administration does not strongly align with Adam's personality traits. Let's assign this a value of 0.1.

### Evidence (P(E)):
This is the total probability of the evidence, which can be found by summing the products of the priors and likelihoods for all hypotheses.

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_1)P(H_1) + P(E|H_2)P(H_2) + P(E|H_3)P(H_3) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.9 \times 0.33) + (0.4 \times 0.33) + (0.1 \times 0.33) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.297 + 0.132 + 0.033 = 0.462 \]

### Applying Bayes' Rule:
Now, we can find the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \).

1. \( P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \times P(H_1)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 \times 0.33}{0.462} \approx 0.643 \)

2. \( P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \times P(H_2)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \times 0.33}{0.462} \approx 0.286 \)

3. \( P(H_3|E) = \frac{P(E|H_3) \times P(H_3)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.33}{0.462} \approx 0.071 \)

### Results:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.643,
  "computer science": 0.286,
  "business administration": 0.071
}
