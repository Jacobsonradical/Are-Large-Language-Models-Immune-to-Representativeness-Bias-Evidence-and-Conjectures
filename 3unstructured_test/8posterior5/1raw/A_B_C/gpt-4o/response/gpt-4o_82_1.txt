Sure, I can provide a rough estimate based on the personality sketch of Adam.

Let's establish some figures based on general knowledge and the given information:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

   - P(H): The proportion of graduate students in this field (let's assume 0.1 given the general population of graduate students).
   - P(E|H): The probability of having Adam's personality sketch if he's in this field (let's assume 0.8, considering his love for nature, plants, animals, and dedication).
   - P(E|\neg H): The probability of having Adam's personality sketch if he's not in this field (let's assume 0.2, as the combination of his traits is unique but not exclusive to this field).

2. **Computer Science**

   - P(H): The proportion of graduate students in this field (let's assume 0.25 given the higher enrollment in computer science programs).
   - P(E|H): The probability of having Adam's personality sketch if he's in this field (let's assume 0.2, considering his high intelligence and abstract reasoning, but the other traits are less aligned).
   - P(E|\neg H): The probability of having Adam's personality sketch if he's not in this field (let's assume 0.2 since his traits are universal to an extent).

3. **Business Administration**

   - P(H): The proportion of graduate students in this field (let's assume 0.15 given a significant but smaller proportion compared to computer science).
   - P(E|H): The probability of having Adam's personality sketch if he's in this field (let's assume 0.1, as his traits don't specifically align with business administration).
   - P(E|\neg H): The probability of having Adam's personality sketch if he's not in this field (let's assume 0.2 as a generic baseline).

Now, applying Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, we will estimate \( P(E) \) as the weighted sum of \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) across the fields and normalizing values.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2(1 - 0.1)} \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.2 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2(1 - 0.25)} \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{0.1 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2(1 - 0.15)} \]

Calculating these:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.18} = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \approx 0.3077 \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.05}{0.05 + 0.15} = \frac{0.05}{0.2} = 0.25 \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.015}{0.015 + 0.17} = \frac{0.015}{0.185} \approx 0.0811 \]

Therefore, the estimated probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3077,
  "computer science": 0.25,
  "business administration": 0.0811
}
