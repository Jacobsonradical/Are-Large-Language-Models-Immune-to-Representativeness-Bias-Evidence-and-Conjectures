To apply Bayes' Rule, we need to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis (graduate field of study) given the evidence (Adam's personality sketch). The formula for Bayes' Rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence, which can be derived from \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \). However, because we don't have the exclusivity and exhaustive properties to derive \( P(E) \) precisely, we will overlook this term's detail keeping its normalization implicit.

Let's assume plausible values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \); these are often subjective estimates when precise data is not available.

1. **Business Administration**
   - \( P(H) \): Given it's a common graduate field, let's assume \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that someone with Adam's personality sketch is studying business administration is relatively low because the sketch suggests a strong interest in nature and animals. Let's set \( P(E| \text{business administration}) = 0.05 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): This can be high because these traits are rare in this field compared to more relevant fields. Let's set \( P(E| \neg \text{business administration}) = 0.9 \).

2. **Computer Science**
   - \( P(H) \): It's another common graduate field, so assume \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that someone with Adam's personality is studying computer science is moderate, as curiosity and intelligence align but not directly with animals or nature. Let's set \( P(E| \text{computer science}) = 0.3 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): This would be slightly higher as many people in different fields may share some of these traits, let's say \( P(E| \neg \text{computer science}) = 0.7 \).

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - \( P(H) \): This is less common but quite aligned with Adam's traits, so assume \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Very high likelihood as the personality sketch perfectly matches this field. Set \( P(E| \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.9 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Lower as these traits are well suited for this field compared to others. Let's set \( P(E| \neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.3 \).

Now let's calculate \( P(H|E) \) (normalized implicitly):

{
  "business administration": \(\frac{P(E| \text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{(P(E| \text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) + P(E| \neg \text{business administration}) \cdot P(\neg \text{business administration}))} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.2}{(0.05 \cdot 0.2 + 0.9 \cdot 0.8)} = \frac{0.01}{0.73} \approx 0.0137\),
  "computer science": \(\frac{P(E| \text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{(P(E| \text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) + P(E| \neg \text{computer science}) \cdot P(\neg \text{computer science}))} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{(0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.7 \cdot 0.8)} = \frac{0.06}{0.62} \approx 0.0968\),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \(\frac{P(E| \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{(P(E| \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) + P(E| \neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}))} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{(0.9 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9)} = \frac{0.09}{0.36} = 0.25
