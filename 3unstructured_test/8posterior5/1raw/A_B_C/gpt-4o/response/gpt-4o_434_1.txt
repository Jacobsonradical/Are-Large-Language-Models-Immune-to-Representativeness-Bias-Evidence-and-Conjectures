To calculate the probabilities using Bayes' rule, we first need to define the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of the personality sketch given enrollment in that field, and the likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \) of the personality sketch given non-enrollment in that field. Since exact numerical values may not be available, we will make reasonable assumptions based on the information given.

### Preliminary Estimates

**Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
- Business Administration: Generally popular among graduate students.
- Computer Science: Very popular and attracts high-intelligence students.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Less common but aligns well with Adam's interests.

**Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
- Business Administration: Low likelihood for someone with Adam's personality. Let's assume \( P(E|H) \) is low.
- Computer Science: Moderate likelihood due to high intelligence but not necessarily aligned with his love for nature and animals.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: High likelihood as it fits well with his curiosity about nature and love for animals.

**Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
- Business Administration: Higher likelihood for a typical student not matching Adam's profile.
- Computer Science: Moderate since many non-CS students also display intelligence but not Adam’s particular interests.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Lower likelihood because Adam’s personality is a strong fit for this field.

### Calculations Using Bayes' Rule

Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that \( P(E) \) normalizes the probabilities and does not directly impact the relative comparison, our focus will be on the terms:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

#### Assumed Values

Let's assume simple values for ease of calculation.

- \( P(H) \) values:
  - Business Administration: 0.3
  - Computer Science: 0.3
  - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.2

- \( P(E|H) \) values:
  - Business Administration: 0.1
  - Computer Science: 0.4
  - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.7

- \( P(E|\neg H) \) values are not required directly for the proportionate comparison since we're focusing on \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(H) \).

### Proportional Calculations

- Business Administration:
  \[ P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.3 = 0.03 \]

- Computer Science:
  \[ P(H|E) \propto 0.4 \times 0.3 = 0.12 \]

- Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
  \[ P(H|E) \propto 0.7 \times 0.2 = 0.14 \]

### Normalize Values

To convert proportional values to probabilities:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{Normalized}} = \frac{P(H|E)}{\sum P(H|E)} \]

Total sum of proportional values:
\[ 0.03 + 0.12 + 0.14 = 0.29 \]

Normalized probabilities:
- Business Administration:
  \[ \frac{0.03}{0.29} \approx 0.103 \]
  
- Computer Science:
  \[ \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.414 \]
  
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
  \[ \frac{0.14}{0.29} \approx 0.483 \]
