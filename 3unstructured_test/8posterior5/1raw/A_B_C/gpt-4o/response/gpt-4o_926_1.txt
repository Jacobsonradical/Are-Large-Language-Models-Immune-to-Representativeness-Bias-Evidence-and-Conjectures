To apply Bayes' Rule, we need to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to estimate \( P(E|H) \) (the probability of observing E given H), \( P(H) \) (the prior probability of H), and \( P(E) \) (the overall probability of E). For the purpose of this exercise, we'll assume relative probabilities based on typical characteristics and the context provided.

### Business Administration
- **P(H\) (Prior Probability):**
  - Assume business administration is moderately common among graduate fields: **0.2**.
- **P(E|H) (Probability of E given H):**
  - Given Adam’s empathy, love for animals, and nature-oriented curiosity, it's less likely that business admin suits him: **0.1**.
- **P(E|\neg H) (Probability of E given not H):**
  - Reflects how likely a student not in business admin fits Adam's profile which applies to more nature and abstract fields: **0.9**.
  
Using Bayes' Rule to compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.1 \times 0.2 + 0.9 \times 0.8} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.72} = \frac{0.02}{0.74} \approx 0.027 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H) (Prior Probability):**
  - Considering this is less common than business but still plausible given Adam’s interests: **0.1**.
- **P(E|H) (Probability of E given H):**
  - Adam’s genuine curiosity about nature and love for animals strongly suggest this field: **0.8**.
- **P(E|\neg H) (Probability of E given not H):**
  - Less likely for those not in this field but still somewhat possible for other nature-focused fields: **0.2**.
  
Using Bayes' Rule to compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.8 \times 0.1 + 0.2 \times 0.9} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.18} = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \approx 0.308 \]

### Computer Science
- **P(H) (Prior Probability):**
  - Quite common among graduate fields, including students with abstract thinking: **0.3**.
- **P(E|H) (Probability of E given H):**
  - Adam’s intelligence and puzzle-solving skills are a good match, but nature interest is neutral: **0.4**.
- **P(E|\neg H) (Probability of E given not H):**
  - Those not in computer science fitting Adam’s profile might be lower, but not extremely rare: **0.6**.

Using Bayes' Rule to compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{computer science}} = \frac{0.4 \times 0.3}{0.4 \times 0.3 + 0.6 \times 0.7} = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.42} = \frac{0.12}{0.54} \approx 0.222 \]
