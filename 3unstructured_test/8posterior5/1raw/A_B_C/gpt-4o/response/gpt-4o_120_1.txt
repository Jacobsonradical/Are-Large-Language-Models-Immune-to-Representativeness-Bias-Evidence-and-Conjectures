To evaluate the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field based on his personality sketch, we will apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch being observed.

Since \( P(E) \) can be considered as a normalizing constant across different fields in this setting, we mainly need to estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) qualitatively and then compute \( P(H|E) \).

Given the personality sketch of Adam, we can estimate these components as follows:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): Business Administration is a popular graduate field, but given Adam's interests and personality, he seems less likely to choose it initially. Let's assign a lower prior probability, say \( 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The sketch mentions strong empathy, high intelligence, but less directly related traits for Business Administration. Let's assign likelihood \( 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The sketch seems less representative of Business Administration traits, so let's assign \( 0.8 \).

2. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Computer Science is also a popular field. Adam's interests in solving puzzles and high intelligence align well with this field. Let's assign a moderate prior probability, say \( 0.3 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Strong match with Adam liking to solve puzzles and high intelligence, so a higher likelihood \( 0.6 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Less direct representation in non-Computer Science fields, so let's assign \( 0.4 \).

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Given Adam's love for nature, animals, and plants, this field seems to be a strong fit. Let's assign a higher prior probability, say \( 0.5 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Strong match with Adamâ€™s interests and empathy, so a higher likelihood \( 0.8 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): This field-specific traits highly correlate with the given sketch, so lower likelihood for non-field, let's assign \( 0.2 \).

Now we compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Considering the overall probability \( P(E) \) which we can treat as a normalizing constant that factors out:

\[
P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.02}{P(E)}
\]
\[
P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} = \frac{0.18}{P(E)}
\]
\[
P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4}{P(E)}
\]

Since we are asked to provide values representing the relative likelihoods rather than normalized probabilities, we ignore \( P(E) \):

{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.18,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4
}
