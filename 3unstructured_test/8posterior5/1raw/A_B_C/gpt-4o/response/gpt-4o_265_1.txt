Let's analyze each field and compute the probabilities step-by-step using Bayes' rule.

Bayes' Rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here's the process:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS)**:
    - **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in AVS. Let's assume it's relatively low given the variety of graduate fields. For the sake of calculation, let's say 0.05 (5%).
    - **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam matches the personality description given that he is in AVS. This is likely to be high because his love for nature, plants, and animals aligns well with AVS. Let's estimate it to be 0.80 (80%).
    - **P(E|¬H)**: The probability that Adam matches the personality description given that he is not in AVS. Since his traits are somewhat general but particularly fit AVS, let's assume it to be 0.30 (30%).

2. **Computer Science (CS)**:
    - **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in CS. Given the popularity of CS, we'll assume a higher prior. Let's say 0.20 (20%).
    - **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam matches the personality description given that he is in CS. While his intelligence and interest in puzzles align well, his deep love for nature and animals does not. Let's estimate it to be 0.40 (40%).
    - **P(E|¬H)**: The probability that Adam matches the personality description given that he is not in CS. Because CS isn't particularly aligned with his interests in nature and animals, we can assume it slightly lower relative to the positive match. Let's say 0.35 (35%).

3. **Business Administration (BA)**:
    - **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in BA. Considering the range of fields of study and the popularity of BA, let's assume it to be 0.15 (15%).
    - **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam matches the personality description given that he is in BA. His traits don't significantly align with typical BA traits such as leadership, extroversion, and less emphasis on nature. Let's estimate it around 0.25 (25%).
    - **P(E|¬H)**: The probability that Adam matches the personality description given that he is not in BA. Given the mismatch, let's assume it slightly higher. We'll use 0.35 (35%).

Now we plug these into Bayes' rule to update our probabilities with the given evidence, noting that \[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \].

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(E) \approx (0.80 \cdot 0.05) + (0.30 \cdot 0.95) = 0.04 + 0.285 = 0.325 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.05}{0.325} \approx 0.123 \]

### Computer Science:
\[ P(E) \approx (0.40 \cdot 0.20) + (0.35 \cdot 0.80) = 0.08 + 0.28 = 0.36 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.40 \cdot 0.20}{0.36} \approx 0.222 \]

### Business Administration:
\[ P(E) \approx (0.25 \cdot 0.15) + (0.35 \cdot 0.85) = 0.0375 + 0.2975 = 0.335 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.25 \cdot 0.15}{0.335} \approx 0.112 \]

Finally, we represent the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \):

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.123,
  "computer science": 0.222,
  "business administration": 0.112
}
```

Please note that these values are estimates based on assumed priors and likelihoods. Adjusting these assumptions would yield different probabilities.
