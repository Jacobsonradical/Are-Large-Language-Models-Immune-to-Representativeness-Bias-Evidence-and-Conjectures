To determine the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we'll use Bayes' rule, which states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific graduate field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the evidence (personality sketch) given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of the evidence given that Adam is not enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence.

Since we are comparing probabilities across fields, we don't need the exact value of \( P(E) \) as it is a common denominator. We can focus on the numerators and normalize the results if necessary.

### Assumptions:
- We'll assume some prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field being likely among the population of graduate students.
- We'll use subjective judgment to estimate \( P(E|H) \) based on how well Adam's personality sketch matches typical characteristics in the field.
- \( P(H) \) for each field is considered relatively equal unless otherwise noted.

### Estimates:
**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- \( P(H) \): Moderate (0.25) — This field fits Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work.
- \( P(E|H) \): High (0.8) — These traits are highly relevant in this field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Moderate (0.3) — The personality sketch can partially fit other fields but not as strongly.

**Computer Science:**
- \( P(H) \): Moderate (0.25) — Many graduates enroll in this field, but it does not strongly fit Adam’s love for nature and animals.
- \( P(E|H) \): Moderate (0.4) — Solving puzzles and high intelligence aligns but empathy and nature aspect are less relevant.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Moderate (0.4) — The personality sketch minus the nature aspect can fit other analytical/technical fields.

**Business Administration:**
- \( P(H) \): Moderate (0.25) — A common graduate field but less compelling for Adam.
- \( P(E|H) \): Low (0.2) — The personality sketch does not fit well; empathy fits but less so curiosity about nature and love for animals.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Moderate to High (0.4) — Empathy and intelligence are applicable to many fields.

### Calculation:
Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

We will then normalize these values to see which field is most likely.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
  \[ P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.25 = 0.2 \]

- **Computer Science:**
  \[ P(H|E) \propto 0.4 \cdot 0.25 = 0.1 \]

- **Business Administration:**
  \[ P(H|E) \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.25 = 0.05 \]

Normalize:
\[ P_{\text{ag}}\_P(H|E) = \frac{0.2}{0.2 + 0.1 + 0.05} = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \approx 0.571 \]
\[ P_{\text{cs}}\_P(H|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.35} \approx 0.286 \]
\[ P_{\text{ba}}\_P(H|E) = \frac{0.05}{0.35} \approx 0.143 \]

### Final Answer:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.571,
  "computer science": 0.286,
  "business administration": 0.143
}
```

These are the estimated probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field, based on the given personality sketch.
