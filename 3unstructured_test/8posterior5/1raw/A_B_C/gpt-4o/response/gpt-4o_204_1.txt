To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we start by assessing our priors and likelihoods. 
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was in a particular field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was not in that field.

### Let's assume some hypothetical values for priors and likelihoods:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H)**
    - \( P(H) \): Let's assume the prior probability that any given student is in this field is 0.1 (10%).
    - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam’s personality sketch, he seems highly likely to be in this field due to his love for nature, animals, and empathy. Let’s set this probability at 0.7 (70%).
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): This would be lower since not all fields fit Adam's personality as well. Let’s set this at 0.2 (20%).

2. **Computer Science (H)**
    - \( P(H) \): Computer Science is quite popular, so let's set the prior at 0.3 (30%).
    - \( P(E|H) \): While Adam is intelligent and good at abstract concepts, his love for nature and empathy might not fit as well. Let’s set this at 0.3 (30%).
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Since Adam’s traits are less common in computer science, let's set this at 0.5 (50%).

3. **Business Administration (H)**
    - \( P(H) \): Business Administration is common, so let's also set the prior at 0.3 (30%).
    - \( P(E|H) \): Adam’s traits do not particularly align with a typical business administration student. Let’s set this at 0.1 (10%).
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability considering his traits is somewhat neutral so let's set it at 0.6 (60%).

### Calculation via Bayes' Rule

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

For each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{(0.7 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9)} = \frac{0.07}{0.07 + 0.18} = \frac{0.07}{0.25} = 0.28 \]

2. **Computer Science**
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.3}{(0.3 \cdot 0.3) + (0.5 \cdot 0.7)} = \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.35} = \frac{0.09}{0.44} = 0.205 \]

3. **Business Administration**
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.3}{(0.1 \cdot 0.3) + (0.6 \cdot 0.7)} = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.42} = \frac{0.03}{0.45} = 0.067 \]

Thus, the probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.28",
  "computer science": "0.205",
  "business administration": "0.067"
}
