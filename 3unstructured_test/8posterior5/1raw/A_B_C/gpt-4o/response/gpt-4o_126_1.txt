To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) through Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Bayes' rule can be expressed as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, \( P(E) \) will remain the same for all fields, so we can use a proportional comparison for simplicity.

Here are my estimations:

### Estimations for Business Administration:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H_{\text{business}}) \)**
   - Let’s assume the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration is moderate because business courses are popular among graduate students.
   - \( P(H_{\text{business}}) \approx 0.2 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \)**
   - The personality traits described for Adam do not align strongly with what we typically expect from business administration students (e.g., interest in nature, empathy, love for animals).
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \approx 0.1 \)

3. **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}}) \)**
   - If Adam is not in business administration, the probability of him having these traits might be more consistent with general population traits or traits of other graduate fields.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business}}) \approx 0.5 \)

### Estimations for Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H_{\text{agriculture}}) \)**
   - We can assume the prior probability of Adam being in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is lower because these fields are specialized.
   - \( P(H_{\text{agriculture}}) \approx 0.1 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{agriculture}}) \)**
   - The personality sketch aligns very well with the traits and interests typically associated with Agricultural and Veterinary Science (e.g., love for animals, interest in nature and plants).
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{agriculture}}) \approx 0.9 \)

3. **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agriculture}}) \)**
   - If Adam is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, these traits are less likely to coincide purely by chance.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agriculture}}) \approx 0.3 \)

### Estimations for Computer Science:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) \)**
   - Let’s assume the prior probability that Adam is in Computer Science is moderate to high because it's a common and growing field of study.
   - \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) \approx 0.3 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \)**
   - The analytical traits like intelligence and solving puzzles align well, but the strong empathy and love for nature/animals are less typical, though not impossible.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \approx 0.4 \)

3. **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}}) \)**
   - If Adam is not in Computer Science, possessing these traits is quite general and can belong to a variety of other fields.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}}) \approx 0.4 \)

### Applying Bayes' Rule:

To find \( P(H|E) \), we need to calculate:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) P(H) \]

### Business Administration:

\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[ P(H_{\text{agriculture}}|E) \propto 0.9 \times 0.1 = 0.09 \]

### Computer Science:

\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) \propto 0.4 \times 0.3 = 0.12 \]

These values are proportional and can be normalized if needed, but we can already compare their relative likelihoods directly.

Thus, the probability estimates for each field given the personality sketch \( E \) are roughly:

{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.09,
  "computer science": 0.12
}
