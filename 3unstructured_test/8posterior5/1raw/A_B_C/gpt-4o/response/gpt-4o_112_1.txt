To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the different fields, we can use Bayes' rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to estimate the following probabilities for each field:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in that specific field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is not enrolled in that specific field.

It's also important to note that these values are estimates based on the provided information. Let's walk through the estimates:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - **P(H_agriculture) (Prior):** Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, it seems reasonable to assign a relatively high prior probability.
     - \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \)
   - **P(E|H_agriculture) (Likelihood):** There is a high likelihood that a person in this field would have the characteristics described.
     - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \)
   - **P(E|\neg H_agriculture) (Likelihood complement):** If Adam is not in this field, there's a lower probability he has this specific set of characteristics.
     - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \)
   - **P(E) (Evidence):** This is a normalizing constant that ensures the probabilities sum to 1 over all possible hypotheses, but for simplicity's sake, let's assume it sums up that we can compare relative proportions.
     - \( P(E) \approx 0.4 \)

2. **Business Administration:**
   - **P(H_business) (Prior):** It's less likely given his interests in nature and animals.
     - \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \)
   - **P(E|H_business) (Likelihood):** Lower likelihood that a person in this field would have Adam's characteristics.
     - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \)
   - **P(E|\neg H_business) (Likelihood complement):** Accounting for the upper likelihood.
     - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.7 \)
   - **P(E):**
     - \( P(E) \approx 0.4 \)

3. **Computer Science:**
   - **P(H_computer_science) (Prior):** Although Adam has high intelligence and understands abstract concepts, his strong interest in nature and animals makes this field less likely than agricultural but more likely than business.
     - \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \)
   - **P(E|H_computer_science) (Likelihood):** Although not a perfect match, individuals in this field can still have such interests and empathy.
     - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.5 \)
   - **P(E|\neg H_computer_science) (Likelihood complement):**
     - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \)
   - **P(E):**
     - \( P(E) \approx 0.4 \)

Using these estimates, we compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Calculations:
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.2}{0.4} = 0.4
   \]

2. **Business Administration:**
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.1}{0.4} = 0.075
   \]

3. **Computer Science:**
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \times 0.2}{0.4} = 0.25
   \]
