Sure, let's go through each field one by one and apply Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \).

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) if Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) if Adam was not enrolled in that field.

Given \( H_1 \) as the hypothesis for "agricultural and veterinary science," \( H_2 \) as the hypothesis for "business administration," and \( H_3 \) as the hypothesis for "computer science," we need to estimate these probabilities for each field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H):** Assume a moderate prior probability since it's a specialized field. Let's estimate it as 0.1.
- **P(E|H):** High, given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and warm heart. Let's say 0.8.
- **P(E|\neg H):** Lower than \( P(E|H) \) but not extremely low because other fields might also accommodate his interests. Suppose 0.3.

### Business Administration
- **P(H):** Given the description, business administration seems less likely. Let's give it a lower prior probability, say 0.05.
- **P(E|H):** Low, because the description doesnâ€™t strongly line up with business administration traits. Let's estimate it at 0.2.
- **P(E|\neg H):** Again, more likely than the converse but not high. Let's say 0.4.

### Computer Science
- **P(H):** Computer science is a broad field with many graduate students. Let's assume a moderate prior probability of 0.2.
- **P(E|H):** Medium, as intelligence and proficiency in abstract concepts are strong indicators for computer science. Suppose 0.6.
- **P(E|\neg H):** Higher than the other two because intelligence and abstract thinking are applicable in various fields. Let's say 0.5.

Now, let's calculate \( P(H|E) \):

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H_3|E) = \frac{P(E|H_3) \cdot P(H_3)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

We can ignore \( P(E) \) since we are comparing the probabilities, not finding their absolute values. We'll re-scale the results at the end if needed.

Let's calculate:

\[ P(H_1|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]

\[ P(H_2|E) \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.05 = 0.01 \]

\[ P(H_3|E) \propto 0.6 \cdot 0.2 = 0.12 \]

The highest is for Computer Science, followed by Agricultural and Veterinary Science, and the least likely is Business Administration. Normalizing these:

\[ P'(H_1|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.01 + 0.12} \approx 0.34 \]

\[ P'(H_2|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.08 + 0.01 + 0.12} \approx 0.04 \]

\[ P'(H_3|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.08 + 0.01 + 0.12} \approx 0.52 \]

So, the probabilities adjusted to add up to 1 are approximately:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.34,
  "business administration": 0.04,
  "computer science": 0.52
}
