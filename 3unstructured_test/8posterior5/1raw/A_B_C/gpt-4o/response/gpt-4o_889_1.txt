Sure, let's go through Bayes' theorem step-by-step to determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in each field based on the personality sketch.

Firstly, let's break down the general principles:

- \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field, before considering the evidence \(E\).
- \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam is enrolled in a particular field \(H\).
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam is not enrolled in that particular field \(H\).

Then, we can use Bayes' rule to determine \(P(H|E)\):

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

Since exact probabilities cannot be calculated without specific data, we'll estimate based on the given information.

### Estimations

#### Business Administration
1. \(P(H)\): Let's assume there's a moderate prior probability that Adam could be studying Business Administration since many students choose this field.
2. \(P(E|H)\): Adam's personality sketch does not particularly match common traits associated with Business Administration students (e.g., strong interest in finance, leadership). Hence, it might be lower.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): Likelihood that other disciplines feature students with Adam's personality traits.

#### Computer Science
1. \(P(H)\): There's a relatively high prior probability that Adam might be studying Computer Science, as it's a popular field.
2. \(P(E|H)\): Adam's interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence suggests he might fit into Computer Science.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): Likelihood that other disciplines feature students with Adam's personality traits.

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. \(P(H)\): There's a reasonable prior probability, given his love for nature and animals fits well with this field.
2. \(P(E|H)\): High, as his personality matches well with this field.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): Likelihood that other disciplines feature students with Adam's personality traits.

### Calculation

Let's assign some hypothetical values, though note these values can be subjective:

#### Business Administration
- \(P(H) = 0.2\)
- \(P(E|H) = 0.1\)
- \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.3\)

#### Computer Science
- \(P(H) = 0.3\)
- \(P(E|H) = 0.7\)
- \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.3\)

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \(P(H) = 0.1\)
- \(P(E|H) = 0.8\)
- \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.3\)

Let's calculate \(P(H|E)\) for each field using Bayes' theorem.

#### Business Administration
\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)}\]

#### Computer Science
\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)}\]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)}\]

Given that \(P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)\), it's complex to solve without exact values. For comparison, we base on relative values:

- Business Administration: \(\frac{0.02}{P(E)}\)
- Computer Science: \(\frac{0.21}{P(E)}\)
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \(\frac{0.08}{P(E)}\)

Normalizing for comparison:

- Business Administration: 0.02
- Computer Science: 0.21
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.08

Thus, the comparative values give us a sense of the relative probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.21,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08
}
```

Again, exact values depend highly on the proper dataset for prior and likelihood estimations.
