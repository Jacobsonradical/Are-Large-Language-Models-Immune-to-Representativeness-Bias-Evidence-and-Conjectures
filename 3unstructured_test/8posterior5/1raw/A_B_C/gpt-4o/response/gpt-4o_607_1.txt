To calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Theorem, we'll need estimates for the following:

1. \( P(H) \), the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \), the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in each field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \), the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not enrolled in each field.

Then, we compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, to simplify, we'll estimate relative probabilities without an exact denominator. This gives us proportional values indicating likelihoods.

### Estimates:

#### Business Administration:

- \( P(H) \): Business administration is a common field, let's estimate \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Unlikely given Adam's personality sketch, estimated \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): More common outside business administration, estimated \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

#### Computer Science:

- \( P(H) \): Also a common field, let's estimate \( P(H) = 0.3 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Likely given his intelligence and puzzle-solving skills, estimated \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Estimated \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

- \( P(H) \): Less common but fits his love for nature and animals, estimate \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Highly likely given the personality sketch, estimated \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Less likely outside this field, estimated \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

### Proportional Calculations:

#### Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

#### Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.7 \cdot 0.3 = 0.21 \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.09 \]

### Normalization:
To get values between 0 and 1, we normalize the proportional results. The sum of the proportions is \( 0.02 + 0.21 + 0.09 = 0.32 \).

- Business Administration: \( \frac{0.02}{0.32} \approx 0.0625 \)
- Computer Science: \( \frac{0.21}{0.32} \approx 0.65625 \)
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( \frac{0.09}{0.32} \approx 0.28125 \)
