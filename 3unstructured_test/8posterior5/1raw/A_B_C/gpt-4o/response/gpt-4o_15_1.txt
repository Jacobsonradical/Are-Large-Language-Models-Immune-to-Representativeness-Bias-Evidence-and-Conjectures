To determine \( P(H|E) \), we can use Bayes' Theorem, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, we'll consider intuition-based estimates for our probabilities.

### 1. Business Administration

- **P(H):** Probability of a graduate student being enrolled in business administration is moderately high, perhaps around 0.2 (since business administration is a popular choice).
- **P(E|H):** Given the personality sketch, the probability that Adam would have these traits if he were in business administration might be quite low, around 0.1, since business administration may not require curiosity about nature, empathy, and a love for animals.
- **P(E|¬H):** If Adam is not in business administration, his personality traits might still fit into other fields, perhaps around 0.5.

### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H):** Probability of a graduate student being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is moderate, around 0.1. This field is less common than business administration but highly relevant to Adam's personality.
- **P(E|H):** Given the personality sketch, the probability that Adam would have these traits if he were in agricultural and veterinary science might be quite high, around 0.9, as this field aligns closely with his interests in nature, empathy, and love for animals.
- **P(E|¬H):** If Adam is not in this field, the remaining fields may not align as well, around 0.4.

### 3. Computer Science

- **P(H):** Probability of a graduate student being enrolled in computer science is high, perhaps around 0.3, since it's a very popular field.
- **P(E|H):** Given the personality sketch, the probability that Adam would have these traits if he were in computer science might be moderate, around 0.4, considering his intelligence and puzzle-solving ability, though not perfectly aligning with other traits.
- **P(E|¬H):** If Adam is not in computer science, his traits might still fit into other fields, around 0.4.

We will make an intuitive estimation for \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(E) \approx 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.8 = 0.02 + 0.4 = 0.42 \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.42} = \frac{0.02}{0.42} \approx 0.048 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(E) \approx 0.9 \cdot 0.1 + 0.4 \cdot 0.9 = 0.09 + 0.36 = 0.45 \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{0.45} = \frac{0.09}{0.45} \approx 0.2 \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(E) \approx 0.4 \cdot 0.3 + 0.4 \cdot 0.7 = 0.12 + 0.28 = 0.4 \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{0.4} = \frac{0.12}{0.4} \approx 0.3 \]

Now, consolidating:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.048,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```
