To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the following:

1. \( P(H) \): Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field
2. \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in each field
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in each field
4. \( P(E) \): Total probability of observing Adam's personality sketch (this can be computed as a sum including all possible fields, but for simplicity, we will assume it is a constant and normalize later if needed)

Now, let's estimate these probabilities for each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): A reasonable estimation based on general distribution of graduate fields might be moderate due to interest in nature and animals. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): The personality sketch fits well because of curiosity about nature and love for animals. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given that Adam’s traits could apply to various fields but less so without agricultural and veterinary science, we can assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

### Computer Science
- \( P(H) \): This field is quite common among graduate students, so let’s assume \( P(H) = 0.3 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): While computational skills and puzzle-solving align with computer science, the focus on nature and animals is less relevant. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Since Adam's traits still apply well across other fields but not exclusively here, \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \).

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): This is also a common field, but less related to Adam’s traits. Let’s assume \( P(H) = 0.25 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Business administration ties into appreciation and understanding of hard work and dedication, but less with nature and animals. Let’s assume \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Adam’s traits fit moderately in non-business fields, \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.7 \).

Now, let’s compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant, we’ll compare relative values and scale.

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{P(E)} \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.3}{P(E)} \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.25}{P(E)} \]

To simplify, we’ll consider contributions only:

\[ P(E) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.4 \times 0.3 + 0.3 \times 0.25 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.12 + 0.075 = 0.315 \]

Therefore, the normalized posterior probabilities are:

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.315} \approx 0.381 \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.315} \approx 0.381 \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.075}{0.315} \approx 0.238 \]

Thus, in the required format:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.381,
  "computer science": 0.381,
  "business administration": 0.238
}
