To apply Bayes' Theorem in computing \(P(H|E)\), let's denote:

- \(P(H)\) as the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field.
- \(P(E|H)\) as the likelihood of Adam having the given personality sketch given that he is in a specific field.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\) as the likelihood of Adam having the given personality sketch given he is not in that specific field.

Finally, we use these to compute \(P(H|E)\), the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch. Recall Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \(P(E)\) can be computed as:
\[P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)\]

Assume we are given:

1. Agricultural and veterinary science (\(H_1\))
2. Computer science (\(H_2\))
3. Business administration (\(H_3\))

Let's assign some plausible values based on the sketch provided.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
**P(H):**
The likelihood of any graduate student in the U.S. being in agricultural and veterinary science might be relatively low compared to other fields.
\[P(H_1) = 0.05\]

**P(E|H):**
Given Adam's personality sketch, his love for nature, plants, and animals fits well into this field.
\[P(E|H_1) = 0.7\]

**P(E|\neg H):**
For fields that are not Agricultural and Veterinary Science, while some characteristics might hold, the match isn't perfect.
\[P(E|\neg H_1) = 0.1\]

### Computer Science
**P(H):**
The likelihood of any graduate student in the U.S. being in computer science is relatively higher.
\[P(H_2) = 0.3\]

**P(E|H):**
Given his high intelligence and interest in solving puzzles, this could align with computer science.
\[P(E|H_2) = 0.4\]

**P(E|\neg H):**
For fields that are not Computer Science, there might be some limited match.
\[P(E|\neg H_2) = 0.1\]

### Business Administration
**P(H):**
The likelihood of any graduate student in the U.S. being in business administration is higher or comparable to computer science, but still not overwhelming for his personality.
\[P(H_3) = 0.2\]

**P(E|H):**
Given his strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication, some traits might align here but not as strongly.
\[P(E|H_3) = 0.2\]

**P(E|\neg H):**
For fields that are not Business Administration, there might be some match but less relevant.
\[P(E|\neg H_3) = 0.15\]

We now compute \(P(E)\) for each case:

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.05) + (0.1 \cdot 0.95) = 0.035 + 0.095 = 0.13\]

For Computer Science:
\[P(E) = (0.4 \cdot 0.3) + (0.1 \cdot 0.7) = 0.12 + 0.07 = 0.19\]

For Business Administration:
\[P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.2) + (0.15 \cdot 0.8) = 0.04 + 0.12 = 0.16\]

Applying Bayes' Theorem, we get:

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science (\(H_1\)):**
\[P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{0.13} = \frac{0.035}{0.13} \approx 0.269\]

**Computer Science (\(H_2\)):**
\[P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{0.19} = \frac{0.12}{0.19} \approx 0.632\]

**Business Administration (\(H_3\)):**
\[P(H_3|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.16} = \frac{0.04}{0.16} = 0.25\]

Final Answer:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.27,
  "computer science": 0.63,
  "business administration": 0.25
}
