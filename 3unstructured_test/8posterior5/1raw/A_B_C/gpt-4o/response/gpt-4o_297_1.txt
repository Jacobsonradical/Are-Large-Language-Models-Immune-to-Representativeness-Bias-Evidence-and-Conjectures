To address this, we'll use the Bayesian formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability of Adam being enrolled in a certain field given the personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch existing given Adam is in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch existing given Adam is not in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) can be derived as the total probability of the evidence, but for relative probabilities, it's sufficient to compare the values for different hypotheses.

Let's assign plausible estimates to these probabilities.

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration is low, as his interests and disposition do not strongly align with traditional business studies.
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.05 \)
   
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam having such a personality sketch given he is in Business Administration is relatively low. Business students might not generally have strong empathy or a deep love for nature and animals.
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \)

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam having this personality sketch if he is not in Business Administration is higher.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.7 \)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.3 \times 0.05}{0.3 \times 0.05 + 0.7 \times 0.95} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.015}{0.015 + 0.665} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.015}{0.68} \approx 0.022 \]

### Computer Science
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Computer Science is moderate, as Adam is good at understanding abstract concepts and enjoys solving puzzles.
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.30 \)
   
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam having such a personality sketch given he is in Computer Science is moderate. Many computer science students are known for their problem-solving skills and intellectual curiosity.
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.6 \)

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam having this personality sketch if he is not in Computer Science is also reasonable.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.6 \)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.6 \times 0.30}{0.6 \times 0.30 + 0.6 \times 0.70} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.18}{0.18 + 0.42} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.18}{0.60} \approx 0.30 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is also moderate, given his interests in nature, plants, and animals.
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.25 \)
   
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam having such a personality sketch given he is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is high, as this field directly corresponds to his interests.
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \)

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam having this personality sketch if he is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science might be lower.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.9 \times 0.25}{0.9 \times 0.25 + 0.4 \times 0.75} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.225}{0.225 + 0.3} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.225}{0.525} \approx 0.429 \]

Therefore, the relative probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": 0.022,
  "computer science": 0.300,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.429
}
