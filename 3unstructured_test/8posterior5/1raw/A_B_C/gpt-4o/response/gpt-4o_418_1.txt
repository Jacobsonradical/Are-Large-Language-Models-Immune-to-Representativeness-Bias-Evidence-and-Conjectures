Let's analyze the problem using Bayesian inference. We'll assign probabilities based on the given description and common considerations.

**1. Business Administration**
- P(H): Let's assume that out of all graduate fields, the prior probability of someone randomly being in Business Administration is relatively high due to its popularity.
  - P(H) ≈ 0.15
- P(E|H): The personality sketch of Adam does not strongly align with typically sought-after traits in business administration such as leadership or a preference for human interaction over nature.
  - P(E|H) ≈ 0.02
- P(E|¬H): The likelihood of having Adam's traits, given that he is not in Business Administration, is generally higher since his characteristics align more with other types of fields involving nature, abstract thinking, and empathy.
  - P(E|¬H) ≈ 0.15

Applying Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) \approx P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \)

Substituting:
\[ P(E) \approx (0.02 \times 0.15) + (0.15 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.003 + 0.1275 = 0.1305 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.02 \times 0.15}{0.1305} \approx \frac{0.003}{0.1305} \approx 0.023 \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.02 \]

**2. Computer Science**
- P(H): Let's assume that the probability of a student picking Computer Science as a graduate field is moderately high and has risen in recent years.
  - P(H) ≈ 0.20
- P(E|H): Adam's traits of intelligence, enjoyment of puzzles, and good understanding of abstract concepts align well with computer science.
  - P(E|H) ≈ 0.60
- P(E|¬H): Given Adam's specific traits, the probability of these traits appearing in someone not studying Computer Science is moderate.
  - P(E|¬H) ≈ 0.30

Substituting in Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(E) \approx (0.60 \times 0.20) + (0.30 \times 0.80) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.12 + 0.24 = 0.36 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.60 \times 0.20}{0.36} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.36} = 0.333 \]

**3. Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
- P(H): Let's assume that this field is less commonly chosen compared to the other two, but still a reasonable option.
  - P(H) ≈ 0.10
- P(E|H): Adam's traits strongly align with this field due to his love for nature, empathy, and appreciation for hard work and animals.
  - P(E|H) ≈ 0.90
- P(E|¬H): The probability of not being in Agricultural and Veterinary Science but having these traits is lower.
  - P(E|¬H) ≈ 0.10

Substituting in Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(E) \approx (0.90 \times 0.10) + (0.10 \times 0.90) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.09 + 0.09 = 0.18 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.90 \times 0.10}{0.18} \approx \frac{0.09}{0.18} = 0.50 \]

Therefore, the Bayesian judgment for each field would be:

{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.333,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.50
