To compute the probability of Adam enrolling in each field given his personality sketch, we'll use Bayes' theorem: \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \).

Let's analyze the fields.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in this field might be moderate since graduate students do specialize in this field.
   - **P(E|H)**: Given his interest in nature, plants, and animals, along with his empathy and love for animals, it's highly likely he'd be enrolled in this field.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of his personality fitting other fields might be lower relative to this one.

2. **Business Administration**
   - **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is in this field might be lower given his personality sketch, but it's a common field of graduate study.
   - **P(E|H)**: Adam's traits do not strongly indicate business administration. Empathy and intelligence are useful, but his focus on nature and animals seems less relevant here.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of his personality fitting non-business fields seems higher given his interests.

3. **Computer Science**
   - **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is in this field is moderate since computer science is also a common graduate field.
   - **P(E|H)**: Adam is good at puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, which align well with computer science, though his interest in nature and animals does not.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of his personality fitting non-computer science fields could be seen as moderate, considering the diversity of graduate programs.

Now let's estimate values:

For simplicity, let's assume:
\(P(E) = 1\), as we're interested in relative comparisons here.

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 
  {
    "P(H)": 0.3,
    "P(E|H)": 0.8,
    "P(E|¬H)": 0.1
  },
  "business administration": 
  {
    "P(H)": 0.25,
    "P(E|H)": 0.2,
    "P(E|¬H)": 0.7
  },
  "computer science": 
  {
    "P(H)": 0.3,
    "P(E|H)": 0.5,
    "P(E|¬H)": 0.4
  }
}

Using Bayes' theorem:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": ((0.8 * 0.3) / (0.8 * 0.3 + 0.1 * 0.7)) = 0.703,
  "business administration": ((0.2 * 0.25) / (0.2 * 0.25 + 0.7 * 0.75)) = 0.055,
  "computer science": ((0.5 * 0.3) / (0.5 * 0.3 + 0.4 * 0.75)) = 0.308
}

Finally, the answers given the calculations:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.703,
  "business administration": 0.055,
  "computer science": 0.308
}
