To calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to use Bayes' Rule, which is expressed as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch for a given field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of Adam's personality sketch.

While we may not have exact values, we can make reasonable assumptions based on the given information and the context. Here's an attempt to provide a reasonable estimation:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): The likelihood that a random graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is likely lower compared to more common fields like computer science or business administration. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam’s curiosity about nature, plants, strong empathy, and love for animals, this field seems highly compatible with his personality. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam’s personality given any field other than agricultural and veterinary science is relatively lower. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

2. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): The likelihood that a random graduate student is enrolled in computer science is relatively high. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.3 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam enjoys solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, which aligns well with this field. However, his empathy and love for animals are not directly relevant. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam’s personality given any field other than computer science is still relatively moderate. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

3. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): The likelihood that a random graduate student is enrolled in business administration is also relatively high. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.3 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam’s personality traits do not seem to strongly align with this field. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam’s personality given any field other than business administration is relatively higher. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

Now, we'll compute \( P(H|E) \):

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{P(E)} \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \times 0.3}{P(E)} \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.3}{P(E)} \]

Let's sum these to calculate \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.05) + (0.4 \times 0.3) + (0.1 \times 0.3) + \text{other probabilities} \]

\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.12 + 0.03 + \text{other probabilities} \]

Since we are only interested in relative probabilities, we will compute them without normalizing by \( P(E) \):

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.05 = 0.04 \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.4 \times 0.3 = 0.12 \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.3 = 0.03 \]

Normalizing values:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.12 + 0.03} = 0.1905 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{computer science}} = \frac{0.12}{0.04 + 0.12 + 0.03} = 0.5714 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} = \frac{0.03}{0.04 + 0.12 + 0.03} = 0.1429 \]
