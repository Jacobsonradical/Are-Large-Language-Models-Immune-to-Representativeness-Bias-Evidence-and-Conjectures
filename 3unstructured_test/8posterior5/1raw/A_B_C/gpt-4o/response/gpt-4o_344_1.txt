To compute the posterior probability, \( P(H|E) \), for each hypothesis given the evidence \( E \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of the hypothesis.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the evidence given the hypothesis.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis.

Let's assume some rough estimates for these probabilities based on typical characteristics of students in these fields:

### Business Administration

- \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): Prior probability of being a graduate student in business administration. It's a common field, so we might assume \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): Probability that someone in business administration has Adam's traits. Business students may not typically have a strong focus on nature, empathy for animals, etc., so \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \): Probability that someone not in business administration has Adam's traits. Given the wide variety of other fields, this might be relatively common, so \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.5 \).

### Computer Science

- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): Prior probability of being a graduate student in computer science. It's a popular field, so we might assume \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.25 \).
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): Probability that someone in computer science has Adam's traits. Computer science students might appreciate problem-solving but less so empathy for animals and nature, so \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.3 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \): Probability that someone not in computer science has Adam's traits. Given the wide variety of other fields, this might be \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.5 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \): Prior probability of being a graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. It's a less common field compared to the others, so we might assume \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \): Probability that someone in agricultural and veterinary science has Adam's traits. This field aligns very well with Adamâ€™s traits, so \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.9 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \): Probability that someone not in this field has Adam's traits. This might be less common, given Adam's specific interests, so \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.3 \).

Now, we use Bayes' rule to find \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Using these estimates:

{
  "business administration": 
  \(\frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{(0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.5 \cdot 0.8)} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.4} \approx 0.047 \),
  
  "computer science": 
  \(\frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.25}{(0.3 \cdot 0.25) + (0.5 \cdot 0.75)} \approx \frac{0.075}{0.075 + 0.375} \approx 0.167 \),
  
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 
  \(\frac{P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{(0.9 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9)} \approx \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.27} \approx 0.25 \).
