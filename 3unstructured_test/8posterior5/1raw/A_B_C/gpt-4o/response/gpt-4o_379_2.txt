To use Bayes' Rule to compute the probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch \( E \), we need to consider the following probabilities:
1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not enrolled in that field.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) \) can be found using:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Given that we don't have exact numerical values for base rates and probabilities, we need to make some reasonable assumptions:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Assume a moderately high base rate (0.3) since computer science is a popular graduate field.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Moderately low (0.2) as the personality traits don't strongly align with typical interests in CS.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Assume average (0.5) since the traits are not exclusive to non-CS fields.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): Assume moderately high base rate (0.2) as business admin is also popular.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Low (0.1) since his traits don't strongly align with typical interests in business administration.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Assume average (0.5).

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Assume lower base rate (0.1) due to it being a less common graduate field.
   - \( P(E|H) \): High (0.8) because his traits align very well with interests in nature, animals, and dedication.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Assume low (0.3) as these traits are more specific to this field.

Now, we calculate \( P(H|E) \):

1. **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{0.2 \cdot 0.3 + 0.5 \cdot 0.7} = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.35} = \frac{0.06}{0.41} \approx 0.146 \]

2. **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.4} = \frac{0.02}{0.42} \approx 0.048 \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.27} = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \approx 0.229 \]

Thus, the probabilities of Adam being in each field given his personality are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.146,
  "business administration": 0.048,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.229
}
```

Note: These values are rough estimates derived from the given personality sketch and assumed base rates of enrollment in each field. Adjustments may be needed based on more precise data.
