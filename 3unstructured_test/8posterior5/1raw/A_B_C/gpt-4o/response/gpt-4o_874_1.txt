To apply Bayes' rule and compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch of Adam, we'll need to estimate the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in each field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in each field.
4. \( P(E) \): The evidence, which can be computed as \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \).

Let's start by assigning reasonable estimates for these probabilities:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam was in this field. Let's estimate this at around \( 0.1 \) (as it’s a more specialized field).
2. \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam’s personality sketch (curiosity about nature, love for animals), this matches very well, so let's estimate this at \( 0.7 \).
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch for someone not in this field. Given the mismatch, let's estimate this at \( 0.2 \).

### Business Administration
1. \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam was in this field. Let’s estimate this at around \( 0.2 \) (a more common graduate field).
2. \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam’s personality sketch (empathy, intelligence), this somewhat matches but not strongly, so let's estimate this at \( 0.3 \).
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch for someone not in this field. Given the weak match, let's estimate this at \( 0.4 \).

### Computer Science
1. \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam was in this field. Let’s estimate this at around \( 0.3 \) (a common and strongly growing field).
2. \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam’s personality sketch (intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts), this matches fairly well, so let's estimate this at \( 0.6 \).
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch for someone not in this field. Given the weaker alignment, let's estimate this at \( 0.3 \).

To apply Bayes' rule, we use:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
For simplicity, assume \( P(\neg H) \) for each field is the sum probability distributed among all other fields.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(E) = 0.7 \times 0.1 + 0.2 \times (1 - 0.1) = 0.07 + 0.18 = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.1}{0.25} = \frac{0.07}{0.25} = 0.28 \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(E) = 0.3 \times 0.2 + 0.4 \times (1 - 0.2) = 0.06 + 0.32 = 0.38 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{0.38} = \frac{0.06}{0.38} \approx 0.16 \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(E) = 0.6 \times 0.3 + 0.3 \times (1 - 0.3) = 0.18 + 0.21 = 0.39 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.3}{0.39} = \frac{0.18}{0.39} \approx 0.46 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.28,
  "business administration": 0.16,
  "computer science": 0.46
}

Note: These values are rough estimations based on the given description. More precise calculations would require detailed data on the actual distribution of students in each field and a more concrete personality-to-field mapping.
