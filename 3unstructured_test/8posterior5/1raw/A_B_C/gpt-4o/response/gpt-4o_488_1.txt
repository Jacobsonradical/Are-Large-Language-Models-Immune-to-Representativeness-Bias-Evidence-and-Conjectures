Sure, let's go through the Bayesian calculation step by step for each field. We'll estimate \( P(H) \) (the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field), \( P(E|H) \) (the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is in that field), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) (the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not in that field). 

Given the provided information:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field can be considered relatively low for each specific field because there are many fields in which a graduate student could be enrolled.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch (E) given that Adam is in that specific field. 
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not in that specific field. 

### Estimates:

1. **Business Administration (H₁):**
   - **P(H₁)**: Graduate programs in Business Administration are relatively common, but not a clear fit for Adam's interests and personality.
   - **P(E|H₁)**: Business Administration doesn't align well with a strong empathy for animals and nature, so this would be low.
   - **P(E|¬H₁)**: This is more likely to fit since Adam's personality suggest he could belong to other fields of nature/science.

2. **Computer Science (H₂):**
   - **P(H₂)**: Computer Science is a widely popular field among graduate students.
   - **P(E|H₂)**: Adam's interest in solving puzzles aligns with Computer Science, though his empathy for animals and nature fits less well.
   - **P(E|¬H₂)**: This still fits well for nature and animals-focused fields.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H₃):**
   - **P(H₃)**: This is less common than other fields but fits his personality exceptionally well.
   - **P(E|H₃)**: High, as this field aligns well with empathy for animals, appreciation for nature, and dedication.
   - **P(E|¬H₃)**: Personality sketch is less likely to fit other fields compared to this one.

### Bayesian Calculation:

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} 
\]
We will assume generic values for \( P(E) \), because it is just a normalizing constant that ensures the probabilities sum to one over all fields (though in this case, we don't need it for the individual probabilities).

Based on the above qualitative analyses, let's assign hypothetical numerical values for easier calculation:

{
  "business administration": "P(H) = 0.1, P(E|H) = 0.1, P(E|\neg H) = 0.9",
  "computer science": "P(H) = 0.2, P(E|H) = 0.3, P(E|\neg H) = 0.7",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "P(H) = 0.05, P(E|H) = 0.8, P(E|\neg H) = 0.2"
}

For each field, using Bayes’ rule:
\[ 
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) 
\]

So:

1. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.1 = 0.01 \)

2. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(H|E) \propto 0.3 \cdot 0.2 = 0.06 \)

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04 \)

The resulting probabilities (before normalization):

{
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.06 + 0.04} = \frac{0.01}{0.11} \approx 0.09 \),
  "computer science": \( \frac{0.06}{0.11} \approx 0.55 \),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{0.04}{0.11} \approx 0.36 \)
}

So, based on these rough numbers (knowing they need not add to 1 due to other possible fields):

{
  "business administration": "0.09",
  "computer science": "0.55",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.36"
}
