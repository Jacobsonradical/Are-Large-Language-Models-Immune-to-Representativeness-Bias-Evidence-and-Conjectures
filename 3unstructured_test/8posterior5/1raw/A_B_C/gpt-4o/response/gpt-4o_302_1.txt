Sure, let's break this down step by step for each field.

### Calculation of P(H|E) using Bayes' Theorem

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence.

### Assumptions:
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field would be based on general enrollment statistics for each field of study. Since we don’t have specific data, we'll assume equal priors for simplicity.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood that the evidence given the hypothesis fits Adam’s personality sketch.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood that the evidence occurs regardless of the hypothesis.

Since we don't have specific numerical data, we'll have to estimate these values based on qualitative analysis.

### Evaluations:

#### Business Administration:

1. **P(H)**: Moderate, since Business Administration is a common field but Adam's interests do not directly align with typical business management studies.
2. **P(E|H)**: Low to Moderate, Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals is not typically associated with Business Administration.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: More likely to find someone with his interests in fields other than business.

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

1. **P(H)**: Moderate to High, since Adam’s interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy aligns well with this field.
2. **P(E|H)**: High, Adam's personality fits very well with students in this field.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: Lower, because students in other fields are less likely to have such a strong alignment with all these characteristics.

#### Computer Science:

1. **P(H)**: Moderate, since Computer Science is also a common field but does not perfectly align with Adam's expressed interests.
2. **P(E|H)**: Low to Moderate, Adam’s problem-solving skills and intelligence fit this field, but his love for animals and empathy are less typical here.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: Higher, since Adam’s other characteristics are less likely to be seen in a computer science environment.

### Estimations: (assigned values are qualitative guesses based on reasoning)

- **Business Administration**:
    - \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \)
    - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \)
    - \( P(E|¬H) \approx 0.7 \)
  
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \)
    - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \)
    - \( P(E|¬H) \approx 0.2 \)
  
- **Computer Science**:
    - \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \)
    - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.4 \)
    - \( P(E|¬H) \approx 0.6 \)

### Applying Bayes’ Theorem:

Using Bayes’ rule to compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for all disciplines (it is a normalizing constant), we focus on the numerator:

- **Business Administration**:
    \[ P(H|E) \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.2 = 0.04 \]

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    \[ P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \]

- **Computer Science**:
    \[ P(H|E) \propto 0.4 \cdot 0.3 = 0.12 \]

### Normalizing (optional but provides probabilities that sum up to 1 for comparison):

Let’s normalize these values:

Total = \( 0.04 + 0.24 + 0.12 = 0.40 \)

- **Business Administration**: \( \frac{0.04}{0.40} = 0.10 \)
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: \( \frac{0.24}{0.40} = 0.60 \)
- **Computer Science**: \( \frac{0.12}{0.40} = 0.30 \)

### Final Probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.10,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.60,
  "computer science": 0.30
}
```

This means there is a higher probability that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science based on his personality sketch.
