To calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we start with the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) of Adam being enrolled in each field. Without specific information, we'll assume these probabilities are equal for simplicity. We'll also assess the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), which is the probability of the personality sketch given the hypothesis of each field, and \( P(E|\neg H) \), the probability of the personality sketch given any field other than \( H \).

1. **Prior Probabilities**: Assuming equal prior probabilities for simplicity:
    \[
    P(\text{computer science}) = P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = P(\text{business administration}) = \frac{1}{3}
    \]

2. **Likelihoods**: Estimating \( P(E|H) \) based on how well Adam's personality matches each field:
    - \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \): Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, but his love for nature and animals might not align as closely with this field.
    - \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \): Adam's curiosity about nature and love for animals strongly suggest this field.
    - \( P(E|\text{business administration}) \): Adam's personality traits do not strongly suggest business administration.

    Assuming:
    \[
    \begin{align*}
    P(E|\text{computer science}) & = 0.3 \\
    P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) & = 0.8 \\
    P(E|\text{business administration}) & = 0.1 \\
    \end{align*}
    \]

3. **Evidence**: \( P(E) \), the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch, is a weighted average:
    \[
    P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{CS}})P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}})P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) + P(E|H_{\text{BA}})P(H_{\text{BA}})
    \]
    \[
    P(E) = 0.3 \times \frac{1}{3} + 0.8 \times \frac{1}{3} + 0.1 \times \frac{1}{3} = 0.4
    \]

4. **Bayes' Rule**:
    \[
    P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)}
    \]

Computing each field:

\[
\begin{align*}
P(\text{computer science} | E) & = \frac{0.3 \times \frac{1}{3}}{0.4} = \frac{0.1}{0.4} = 0.25 \\
P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science} | E) & = \frac{0.8 \times \frac{1}{3}}{0.4} = \frac{0.267}{0.4} = 0.67 \\
P(\text{business administration} | E) & = \frac{0.1 \times \frac{1}{3}}{0.4} = \frac{0.033}{0.4} = 0.083 \\
\end{align*}
\]

Thus, the results are:

\[
\{
  "computer science": 0.25,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.67,
  "business administration": 0.083
\}
\]
