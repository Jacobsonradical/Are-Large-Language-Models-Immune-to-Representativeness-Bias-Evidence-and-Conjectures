To determine \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not enrolled in that field.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we are comparing multiple hypotheses, we will focus on the relative values of \( P(H|E) \) for each field.

Let's assume the following:

### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): Moderately likely since it's a common graduate field.
- \( P(E|H) \): High. Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy align well with this field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Lower, as not all fields will have such a strong correlation with Adam's qualities.

### 2. Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): Moderately likely since it's a common graduate field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Low. Adam's personality doesn't strongly align with the typical skills emphasized in business administration.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Higher than agricultural/vet science because many fields (excluding agriculture/veterinary sciences) don't align closely with Adam's qualities.

### 3. Computer Science
- \( P(H) \): Moderately likely since it's a common graduate field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Moderate. Adam's high intelligence and puzzle-solving ability align well, but not his interest in nature and animals.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Lower, as computer science might not align as closely with Adam's qualities when compared to others outside agriculture/veterinary science.

Given these assumptions:

### Assigning Probabilities
#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.40 \)

#### Business Administration
- \( P(H) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.70 \)

#### Computer Science
- \( P(H) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.50 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.50 \)

### Calculating Posterior Probabilities
(Note that we are primarily interested in the relative probabilities rather than their exact values normalized to 1.)

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.3}{P(E)} \]

2. **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \times 0.3}{P(E)} \]

3. **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.5 \times 0.3}{P(E)} \]

Since the denominators are the same, we compare the numerators:

### Comparative Values
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.24,
  "business administration": 0.06,
  "computer science": 0.15
}
```

Thus, based on Adam's personality sketch \( E \) and the above hypothetical probabilities, it is more likely that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
