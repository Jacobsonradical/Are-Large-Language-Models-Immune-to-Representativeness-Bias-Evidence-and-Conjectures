To determine \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for all fields and we are comparing relative probabilities, we can focus on the numerators \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) without normalizing by \( P(E) \).

Assumptions for initial probabilities:

- Let \( P(H) \) for each field reflect a rough relative frequency of graduate students in those fields.
- Assigning some reasonable intuitive probabilities:
  - Computer Science is a common graduate field.
  - Agricultural and Veterinary Science is less common but aligns well with Adam's interests.
  - Business Administration is also common but does not align well with Adam's interests.

Let's assume the following rough priors \( P(H) \):

- \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.3 \)

Next, assess \( P(E|H) \), the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given these fields:

- Due to Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for nature, he is more likely to be found in agricultural and veterinary science.
- He has a high intelligence and enjoys solving puzzles, which is favorable for computer science.
- His personality sketch seems less compatible with business administration.

Estimate \( P(E|H) \):

- \( P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.4 \)
- \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.1 \)

Given these values, compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) = 0.4 \times 0.3 = 0.12 \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) = 0.1 \times 0.3 = 0.03 \]

Now normalize to make the relative values comparable:

- Sum of all computed values: \( 0.12 + 0.08 + 0.03 = 0.23 \)

Normalized probabilities:

- \( P(\text{computer science}|E) = 0.12 / 0.23 \approx 0.52 \)
- \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = 0.08 / 0.23 \approx 0.35 \)
- \( P(\text{business administration}|E) = 0.03 / 0.23 \approx 0.13 \)

Thus, the relative probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.52,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.35,
  "business administration": 0.13
}
