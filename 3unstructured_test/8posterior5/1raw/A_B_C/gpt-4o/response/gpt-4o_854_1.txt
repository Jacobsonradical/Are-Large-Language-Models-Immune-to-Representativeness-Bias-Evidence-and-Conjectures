Let's analyze and estimate the probabilities for each field based on Adam's personality sketch and background as a graduate student in the U.S.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
1. **P(H):** The prior probability of a graduate student being in this field. Let's assume it to be relatively low but not negligible:
   - P(H) ≈ 0.1
2. **P(E|H) (agricultural and veterinary science):** The probability of Adam having the described personality sketch given that he is in this field. Adam's traits such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well:
   - P(E|H) ≈ 0.9
3. **P(E|¬H):** The probability of having those personality traits given that Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Since these traits are not exclusive to this field:
   - P(E|¬H) ≈ 0.2

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where,
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]
\[ P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) = 0.09 + 0.18 = 0.27 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{0.27} ≈ 0.333 \]

### Business Administration:
1. **P(H):** The prior probability of a graduate student being in this field. This is relatively higher than agricultural science:
   - P(H) ≈ 0.2
2. **P(E|H) (business administration):** Adam's personality sketch does not align strongly with typical traits required for business administration:
   - P(E|H) ≈ 0.2
3. **P(E|¬H):** Remains same as in previous calculation:
   - P(E|¬H) ≈ 0.2

\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.2) + (0.2 * 0.8) = 0.04 + 0.16 = 0.20 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.20} = 0.2 \]

### Computer Science:
1. **P(H):** The prior probability of a graduate student being in this field. Computer Science is a common and popular field:
   - P(H) ≈ 0.3
2. **P(E|H) (computer science):** Traits like high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts fit well with computer science:
   - P(E|H) ≈ 0.6
3. **P(E|¬H):** Again, remains unchanged:
   - P(E|¬H) ≈ 0.2

\[ P(E) = (0.6 \cdot 0.3) + (0.2 \cdot 0.7) ≈ 0.18 + 0.14 = 0.32 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.3}{0.32} ≈ 0.5625 \]

Based on these calculations, we can summarize the posterior probabilities where \( P(H|E) \) represents the likelihood of Adam being in a specific field given his personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.333,
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.5625
}
