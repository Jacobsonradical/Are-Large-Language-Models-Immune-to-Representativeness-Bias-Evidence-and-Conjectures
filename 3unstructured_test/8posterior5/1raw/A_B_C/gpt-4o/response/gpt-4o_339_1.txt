To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to assess the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood of not being in that field \( P(E|\neg H) \). Using Bayes' rule, the posterior probability is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be calculated as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) + \ldots + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For simplicity, we will assume the priors \( P(H) \) for each field are equally likely unless there's a strong reason to think otherwise. This might not be perfect but gives us a fair start.

Let's take the fields one by one.

1. **Business Administration:**
    - \( P(H) \): Assuming priors equally likely and given the variety of graduate fields, we might take \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \).
    - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals, business administration seems less plausible. Therefore, let's assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \).
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Assuming many other fields might better match Adam's personality description, we could take \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \).

    Applying Bayes’ rule:
    \[
    P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.1 \cdot 0.1 + (1 - 0.1) \cdot 0.3} \approx \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.27} = \frac{0.01}{0.28} \approx 0.036
    \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
    - \( P(H) \): We'll assume the prior probability \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \) as before.
    - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam’s strong affinity for nature, plants, and animals, this field seems very probable. Therefore, let's assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \).
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Considering that many fields do not match Adam's description well, let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \).

    Applying Bayes’ rule:
    \[
    P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.8 \cdot 0.1 + (1 - 0.1) \cdot 0.2} \approx \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.18} = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \approx 0.308
    \]

3. **Computer Science:**
    - \( P(H) \): Assuming the prior probability \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \).
    - \( P(E|H) \): Adam’s high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts make this field somewhat plausible. Therefore, let's assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.4 \).
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given the mismatch in empathy and love for nature in many other fields, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.25 \).

    Applying Bayes’ rule:
    \[
    P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.1}{0.4 \cdot 0.1 + (1 - 0.1) \cdot 0.25} \approx \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.225} = \frac{0.04}{0.265} \approx 0.151
    \]

Here's the summary based on our calculations using Bayes' rule:

{
  "business administration": 0.036,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.308,
  "computer science": 0.151
