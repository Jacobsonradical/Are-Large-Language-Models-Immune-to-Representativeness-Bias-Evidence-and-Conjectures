To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we'll use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since the total probabilities don’t need to add up to 1, we will focus on assessing the relative values rather than exact figures. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This is the probability that Adam is in a field without any additional information. We assume equal priors for simplicity:

\[ P(\text{business administration}) = P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = P(\text{computer science}) = \frac{1}{3} \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).

3. **Marginal likelihood \( P(E) \)**: This would be a normalizing constant, but we can ignore it in a relative comparison since it will be the same for all fields.

Note: We assume some intuitive expectations about how well Adam’s personality traits would match each field, considering his background and interests. 

- For **business administration**:
  - Adam's personality traits (love for nature, animals, empathy) are less aligned with business administration.
  - \( P(E|\text{business administration}) \) is expected to be low.
  - \( P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) \) would be higher, but not explicitly needed in relative comparison.

- For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
  - Adam’s curiosity about nature and love for animals directly align with this field.
  - \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \) is expected to be high.
  - \( P(E|\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \) would be higher given the direct fit.

- For **computer science**:
  - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which relates well to computer science.
  - \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \) is moderate to high.
  - \( P(E|\neg \text{computer science}) \) would be moderate given the match.

Given these qualitative assessments, we approximate the values:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These values represent the relative posterior probabilities, \( P(H|E) \), that Adam was enrolled in each specified field based on the provided personality sketch.
