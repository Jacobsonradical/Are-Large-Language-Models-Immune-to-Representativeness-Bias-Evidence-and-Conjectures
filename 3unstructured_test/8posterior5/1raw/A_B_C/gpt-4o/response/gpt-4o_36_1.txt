To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study using Bayes' theorem, we can break it down into the following components:
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam is in a particular field of study.
- \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood of Adam having this personality sketch given he is in this field of study.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likelihood of Adam having this personality sketch given he is not in this field of study.
- \( P(E) \): Normalizing constant, representing the overall probability of Adam having this personality sketch.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant, which is the same for all fields, we will focus on the numerator \( P(E|H) \times P(H) \).

The exact values of \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) would typically come from empirical data or assumptions about relative likeliness. For simplicity, we will use informed estimates.

1. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is in Computer Science, given that Computer Science is a common field, let's assume \( 0.20 \) (20%).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that a Computer Science graduate student has Adam’s personality traits, given the prevalence of problem-solving and intelligence. Let's estimate \( 0.30 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam’s personality outside of Computer Science, which we assume might be \( 0.15 \).

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, given it’s less common than Computer Science but relevant to his interests, let's assume \( 0.10 \) (10%).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that a student in this field has Adam’s characteristics, given his love for nature and animals. Let’s estimate \( 0.60 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam’s personality outside of Agricultural and Veterinary Science, assumed to be \( 0.15 \).

3. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is in Business Administration, considering it’s a common field, let's assume \( 0.25 \) (25%).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of a Business Administration student having Adam’s traits, given the mismatch with his characteristics, we can estimate \( 0.05 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam’s personality outside of Business Administration, assumed to be \( 0.15 \).

Now, we plug these estimates into Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \times P(H)
\]

For simplicity, let’s normalize each probability \( P(H|E) \) afterward to keep them on a comparable scale:

\[
\text{Computer Science: } P(H|E) \propto 0.30 \times 0.20 = 0.06
\]
\[
\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science: } P(H|E) \propto 0.60 \times 0.10 = 0.06
\]
\[
\text{Business Administration: } P(H|E) \propto 0.05 \times 0.25 = 0.0125
\]

Now, compute the total to normalize:
\[
\text{Total} = 0.06 + 0.06 + 0.0125 = 0.1325
\]

Finally, normalize to get the posterior probabilities:

\[
P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.1325} \approx 0.453
\]
\[
P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.1325} \approx 0.453
\]
\[
P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.0125}{0.1325} \approx 0.094
\]

The final answer is:

{
  "computer science": 0.453,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.453,
  "business administration": 0.094
}
