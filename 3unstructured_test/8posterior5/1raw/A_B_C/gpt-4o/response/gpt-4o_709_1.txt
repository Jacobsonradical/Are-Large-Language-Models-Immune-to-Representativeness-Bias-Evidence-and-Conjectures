To determine \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Rule, we need to estimate the probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Here, 

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in each field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in the field.

We can use Bayes' Theorem, which states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Since \( P(E) \) is the same for all hypotheses, we focus on the numerator without normalizing the probabilities fully.

Let's assume some approximations:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **\( P(H) \)**: Moderate probability, given this is a relatively niche field but Adam's interests align well.
2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: High probability, as his traits strongly align with agricultural and veterinary science.
3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Moderate to low probability, as not all non-Agri/Vet students would exhibit these traits.

### Business Administration
1. **\( P(H) \)**: Given the popularity of the field, a moderately high chance, although lower than general population due to Adamâ€™s specific traits.
2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: Low to moderate probability, since his traits (empathy, love for nature) align less with common traits for business students.
3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Moderate probability.

### Computer Science
1. **\( P(H) \)**: High overall enrollment makes it quite probable.
2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: Moderate to high probability for students as abstract thinking and puzzle-solving align well.
3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Low to moderate probability, as many students outside this field also enjoy nature.

### Estimations:

Based on qualitative reasoning:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.45,
  "business administration": 0.10,
  "computer science": 0.20
}

### Reasoning

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: \( P(H) \approx 0.10 \), \( P(E|H) \approx 0.80 \), \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.30 \). \( P(H|E) \) is higher due to alignment with his traits.
- **Business Administration**: \( P(H) \approx 0.20 \), \( P(E|H) \approx 0.10 \), \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.40 \). \( P(H|E) \) remains low because his traits do not align well.
- **Computer Science**: \( P(H) \approx 0.25 \), \( P(E|H) \approx 0.50 \), \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.30 \). \( P(H|E) \) suggests a moderate alignment.

These estimations provide rough calculations, reflecting the consistency of his traits with each field.
