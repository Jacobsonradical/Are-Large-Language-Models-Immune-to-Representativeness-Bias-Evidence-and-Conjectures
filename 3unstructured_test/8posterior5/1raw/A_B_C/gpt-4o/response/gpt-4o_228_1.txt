To apply Bayes' theorem, we need to consider a few probabilities:

1. **Prior Probability** \( P(H) \): The initial probability of Adam being enrolled in each field without any additional information.
2. **Likelihood** \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was enrolled in the field.
3. **Marginal Likelihood** \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was not enrolled in the field.

We are interested in finding the **Posterior Probability** \( P(H|E) \): The probability that Adam was enrolled in the field given his personality sketch.

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

1. \( P(H) \): Moderate, let's say about 0.2 (considering many fields of study exist).
2. \( P(E|H) \): High, as Adam's love for nature, animals, and empathy aligns well. Let's estimate this at 0.7.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): Lower compared to Agricultural and Veterinary Science, say 0.3.

Using Bayes' theorem \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \) and knowing that \( P(E) \) is a normalization constant, we get an estimate proportional to:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.7 \cdot 0.2 \]

### For Computer Science:

1. \( P(H) \): Moderate, let's say about 0.2 (considering many fields of study exist).
2. \( P(E|H) \): Medium, as his intelligence and love for solving puzzles align with computer science. Let's estimate this at 0.4.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): Comparatively higher than agricultural and veterinary science, say 0.5 due to broader interests aligning partly with non-computer science fields.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.4 \cdot 0.2 \]

### For Business Administration:

1. \( P(H) \): Moderate, let's say about 0.2 (considering the many fields of study exist).
2. \( P(E|H) \): Low, as there's minimal alignment with business administrative traits and Adam's personality. Estimate this at 0.1.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): Higher than 0.1, since multiple non-business fields (like agricultural science) would display Adam's traits better. Say 0.6.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 \]

### Normalization:

Let's normalize these probabilities so they sum up to 1:

1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( 0.7 \times 0.2 = 0.14 \)
2. Computer Science: \( 0.4 \times 0.2 = 0.08 \)
3. Business Administration: \( 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02 \)

Summing these, the normalization coefficient \( P(E) \) is:
\[ 0.14 + 0.08 + 0.02 = 0.24 \]

### Final Probabilities (Normalized):

1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( \frac{0.14}{0.24} \approx 0.58 \)
2. Computer Science: \( \frac{0.08}{0.24} \approx 0.33 \)
3. Business Administration: \( \frac{0.02}{0.24} \approx 0.08 \)

Our best estimates are:
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.58,
  "computer science": 0.33,
  "business administration": 0.08
