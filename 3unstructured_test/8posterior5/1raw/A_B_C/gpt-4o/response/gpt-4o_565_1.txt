To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate the following probabilities:

- \( P(H) \): the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field.
- \( P(E|H) \): the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given Adam was not enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(H|E) \): the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field given the personality sketch.

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for all fields and serves as a normalizing constant, we can focus on the numerator and compare the relative values of \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for each field.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

- \( P(H) \): Graduate programs in agricultural and veterinary science are less common than some other fields, so let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, it is highly likely he fits well in this field, so \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of his personality sketch given that he is not in this field is moderate as some aspects can be common across various fields, so let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

2. **Business Administration**

- \( P(H) \): Business administration is a very common graduate field, so let's assume \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): The personality traits listed are not particularly indicative of a business administration student, so let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): As before, the traits could moderately describe someone not in business administration, so let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

3. **Computer Science**

- \( P(H) \): Computer science is another relatively common field, so let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): His intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts are highly consistent with computer science, so let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Similar to the other fields, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

Now we calculate \( P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \):

- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.9 \cdot 0.05 = 0.045 \]

- For Business Administration:

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.15 = 0.03 \]

- For Computer Science:

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.7 \cdot 0.2 = 0.14 \]

Normalizing these values to get probabilities:

- Sum = \( 0.045 + 0.03 + 0.14 = 0.215 \)

\[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.215} \approx 0.209 \]
\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.215} \approx 0.140 \]
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.14}{0.215} \approx 0.651 \]

So, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.209,
  "business administration": 0.140,
  "computer science": 0.651
}
