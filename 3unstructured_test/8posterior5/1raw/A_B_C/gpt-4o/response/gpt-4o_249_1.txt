To estimate the probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) and then calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis using Bayes' rule, let's break down the steps:

1. **Define the Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
   - The prior probability \( P(H) \) represents how likely Adam was to enroll in each field without any other information:
     - Let’s assume a uniform prior due to no specific initial information. Therefore, \( P(H) \) for each field will be approximately equal.
   
2. **Estimate the Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   - \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of Adam having the given personality sketch if he were enrolled in the respective field.
     - **Computer Science**: People in this field often have high intelligence and problem-solving skills, but not necessarily a strong empathy towards animals or plants.
     - **Business Administration**: This field may not typically require or attract individuals with a strong empathy for nature, though it could involve hard work and dedication.
     - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: High fit given Adam’s curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and understanding of hard work.

3. **Estimate the Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \) represents the probability of the personality sketch if Adam were not in the respective field. This will vary based on the general likelihood of someone possessing such traits in other fields.
     - For simplicity, assume \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the same across fields and less specific than the matched likelihoods.

4. **Use Bayes' Rule** to Compute \( P(H|E) \):
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   Here we set up the ratios considering the relative fit of Adam's personality sketch with each field.

Let’s estimate the values and calculate:

### Computer Science
- \( P(H) \approx 1/3 \)
- \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \) (high intelligence but less nature/animal fit)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.1 \)

\[
P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.1} = 0.3
\]

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \approx 1/3 \)
- \( P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \) (hard work and dedication, but less nature/animal fit)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.1 \)

\[
P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.1} = 0.2
\]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \approx 1/3 \)
- \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \) (strong fit with nature, empathy, animals, and hard work)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.1 \)

\[
P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.1} = 0.8
\]

All values normalized to be relative probabilities.

Given these estimations, the output in the specified format is:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}
```

This suggests that based on Adam’s personality sketch, it is most probable that he was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
