Sure, let's go through it step by step for each field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H_ag)**: This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in this field. Given his interests and personality traits, this seems relatively high since he has a love for nature and animals.
- **P(E|H_ag)**: This is the probability that we would observe Adam's traits if he were enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. This is also high, given his love for nature, curiosity about plants, empathy towards animals, and appreciation for hard work.
- **P(E|\neg H_ag)**: This is the probability that we would observe Adam's traits if he were NOT enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. While still possible, it seems less likely compared to being enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

### Computer Science
- **P(H_cs)**: This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science. Given the general population of graduate students, this field is quite popular, so the base rate is moderate.
- **P(E|H_cs)**: This measures how likely it is that someone in Computer Science fits Adam's personality sketch. Some traits like intelligence and enjoying puzzles fit well, but others like love for nature and animals don't fit strongly.
- **P(E|\neg H_cs)**: This is the probability that we'd see Adam's personality traits if he were not in Computer Science. Given the mixed fit, this might be moderate.

### Business Administration
- **P(H_ba)**: This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration. This is a common field, so the base rate would be moderate to high.
- **P(E|H_ba)**: This is the likelihood of Adam's traits given he is in Business Administration. The traits don't fit particularly well with this field.
- **P(E|\neg H_ba)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's traits if he were not in Business Administration. Given the low fit to the field, this may be higher.

Now let's assign some approximate values for better estimation and calculation.

### Quantitative Estimates
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - P(H_ag) = 0.2
   - P(E|H_ag) = 0.8
   - P(E|\neg H_ag) = 0.3

2. **Computer Science**:
   - P(H_cs) = 0.3
   - P(E|H_cs) = 0.5
   - P(E|\neg H_cs) = 0.5

3. **Business Administration**:
   - P(H_ba) = 0.3
   - P(E|H_ba) = 0.2
   - P(E|\neg H_ba) = 0.6

Using Bayes' rule: \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \), where \( P(E) = P(E|H) P(H) + P(E|\neg H) P(\neg H) \).

### Calculations
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.2) + (0.3 \times 0.8) = 0.16 + 0.24 = 0.4 \)
   - \( P(H_ag|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.2}{0.4} = 0.4 \)

2. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(E) = (0.5 \times 0.3) + (0.5 \times 0.7) = 0.15 + 0.35 = 0.5 \)
   - \( P(H_cs|E) = \frac{0.5 \times 0.3}{0.5} = 0.3 \)

3. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(E) = (0.2 \times 0.3) + (0.6 \times 0.7) = 0.06 + 0.42 = 0.48 \)
   - \( P(H_ba|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.3}{0.48} \approx 0.125 \)

Let's summarize the results:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.125
