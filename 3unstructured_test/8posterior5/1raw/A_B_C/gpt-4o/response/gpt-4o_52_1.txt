First, let's denote the probabilities for each hypothesis (H) and the personality sketch (E):

- **P(H)**: Probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
  - This is the prior probability of Adam being in a given field.
- **P(E|H)**: Probability of the evidence given the hypothesis.
  - This is the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in a specific field.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability of the evidence given not the hypothesis.
  - This is the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in that specific field.
- **P(H|E)**: Probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
  - This is the posterior probability of Adam being in a specific field given his personality sketch, calculated using Bayes' Rule.

Bayes' Rule is defined as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant, we can focus on the numerator to compare relative probabilities.

Now, let's assign some plausible values:

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: Likely low, as his curiosity about nature, animals, and empathy don't strongly correlate with characteristics usually associated with business administration.
  - Let's assume: \( P(H_{business}) = 0.1 \)
- **P(E|H_{business})**: His personality traits are less likely if he were in business administration.
  - Let's assume: \( P(E|H_{business}) = 0.2 \)
- **P(E|\neg H_{business})**: Given the generic nature of the sketch, this could be moderate across other fields.
  - Let's assume: \( P(E|\neg H_{business}) = 0.6 \)

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: High, his interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy fit well. 
  - Let's assume: \( P(H_{agriculture}) = 0.2 \)
- **P(E|H_{agriculture})**: Very high, considering his personality traits.
  - Let's assume: \( P(E|H_{agriculture}) = 0.8 \)
- **P(E|\neg H_{agriculture})**: Lower, given these unique traits.
  - Let's assume: \( P(E|\neg H_{agriculture}) = 0.4 \)

### Computer Science
- **P(H)**: Moderate, as his intelligence and interest in puzzles align well.
  - Let's assume: \( P(H_{cs}) = 0.3 \)
- **P(E|H_{cs})**: Moderate, as some traits align while others may not.
  - Let's assume: \( P(E|H_{cs}) = 0.5 \)
- **P(E|\neg H_{cs})**: Higher, as these traits do not specifically exclude CS.
  - Let's assume: \( P(E|\neg H_{cs}) = 0.7 \)

Let's calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

### Business Administration
\[ P(H_{business}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{business}) \cdot P(H_{business})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.02}{P(E)} \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H_{agriculture}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{agriculture}) \cdot P(H_{agriculture})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.16}{P(E)} \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} = \frac{0.15}{P(E)} \]

Now normalize to get relative probabilities:

\[ \text{Sum of numerators} = 0.02 + 0.16 + 0.15 = 0.33 \]

Therefore, the relative probabilities:

\[ P(H_{business}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.33} \approx 0.061 \]
\[ P(H_{agriculture}|E) = \frac{0.16}{0.33} \approx 0.485 \]
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{0.15}{0.33} \approx 0.455 \]

Thus, the final posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.061,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.485,
  "computer science": 0.455
}
```
