To calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need the following components for each field \( H \):

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field \( H \).
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in \( H \).
3. \( P(E| \neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in \( H \).

Bayes' Rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assume \( P(H) = 1/n \) for the given fields because we don't have a reason to believe that Adam had a higher or lower chance of being enrolled in one field over the others initially.

Now let's set approximate values based on the given personality sketch and then compute \( P(H|E) \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. \( P(H) \): Assuming equal probability across the three fields, \( P(H) \approx 1/3 \).
2. \( P(E|H) \): The traits of having a genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy align well with agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, \( P(E|H) \) is high, let's say 0.8.
3. \( P(E| \neg H) \): Considering traits may align less with other disciplines but still plausible, \( P(E| \neg H) \) should be moderate, let's say 0.3.

### Computer Science
1. \( P(H) \): Assuming equal probability across the three fields, \( P(H) \approx 1/3 \).
2. \( P(E|H) \): Being good at solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with computer science. However, the other interests might be less relevant. Let's set \( P(E|H) \) to 0.4.
3. \( P(E| \neg H) \): As the other traits like love for animals and nature do not align as well, let's set \( P(E| \neg H) \) to 0.6.

### Business Administration
1. \( P(H) \): Assuming equal probability across the three fields, \( P(H) \approx 1/3 \).
2. \( P(E|H) \): Traits such as empathy and understanding hard work have some relevance, but the specific interests in nature and animals are less aligned. Let's set \( P(E|H) \) to 0.2.
3. \( P(E| \neg H) \): Since multiple traits do not align well, possibly \( P(E| \neg H) \) would be higher, set at 0.7.

Now, given all probabilities:

### Calculate \( P(H|E) \):
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Since \( P(E) \) is constant across fields for relative comparison, we can ignore it for ordering purposes.

\[
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H)P(H)
\]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[
P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \times \frac{1}{3} = 0.2667
\]

#### Computer Science
\[
P(H|E) \propto 0.4 \times \frac{1}{3} = 0.1333
\]

#### Business Administration
\[
P(H|E) \propto 0.2 \times \frac{1}{3} = 0.0667
\]

These relative probabilities suggest that Adam was most likely enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, followed by Computer Science, and then Business Administration.
