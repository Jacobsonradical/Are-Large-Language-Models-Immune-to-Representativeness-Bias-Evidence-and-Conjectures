To estimate the probabilities, we'll evaluate \( P(H) \) for prior probabilities, \( P(E|H) \) for the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given the hypothesis he is enrolled in a particular field, and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for the likelihood of the sketch if he is not in that field.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where \( P(E) \) can be computed using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's focus on each field separately:

### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **Prior probability \( P(H) \)**: Assume a reasonable but relatively modest prior likelihood given the broad range of available graduate fields (let's say 0.1).
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, there's a high probability his personality fits this field (let's assign 0.8).
- **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: While not enrolled in agricultural science, some elements like curiosity and empathy may still align, but to a lesser extent (say 0.2).

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.18} = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \approx 0.31 \]

### 2. Computer Science

- **Prior probability \( P(H) \)**: Computer science is a popular field for graduate students, so a higher prior probability might be appropriate (let's assume 0.2).
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The abstract thinking and puzzle-solving aspects fit well, so it's fairly high but not as high as in agricultural science (let’s assign 0.6).
- **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Adam's quiet nature and empathy might not fit as well with those outside computer science (let's say 0.3).

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{0.6 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.24} = \frac{0.12}{0.36} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.33 \]

### 3. Business Administration

- **Prior probability \( P(H) \)**: This is another common graduate field, so we'll set it somewhat high (let’s assume 0.15).
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Business administration might not align as well with his empathy and love for nature, though the appreciation for hard work fits (let's assign 0.3).
- **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Students not in business administration can still appreciate nature and empathy (let's set 0.4).

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.15}{0.3 \cdot 0.15 + 0.4 \cdot 0.85} = \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.34} = \frac{0.045}{0.385} \approx 0.12 \]

Here are the probabilities for each field:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.31,
  "computer science": 0.33,
  "business administration": 0.12
}
```

These values are rough estimates based on the subjective analysis of the given data and assumptions.
