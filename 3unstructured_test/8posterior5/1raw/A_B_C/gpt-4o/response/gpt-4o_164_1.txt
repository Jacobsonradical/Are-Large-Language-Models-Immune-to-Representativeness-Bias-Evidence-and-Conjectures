To compute P(H|E) using Bayes' Rule for each field, we need to evaluate P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|¬H). Recall, Bayes' Rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that P(E) for each case would be the same (the personality sketch does not directly depend on the field), we can proportionally evaluate P(H|E) using the numerator, which is P(E|H) * P(H).

Let’s start with the hypotheses:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H = agricultural and veterinary science)
- **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that Adam is in this field. Since this is a niche field, let’s assume P(H) = 0.1 (assuming there are 10 possible fields he could be in).
- **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam's personality sketch fits if he is in this field. Given his affinity for nature, animals, hard work, and empathy, let's set this to a high value, say P(E|H) = 0.75.
- **P(E|¬H)**: The probability that Adam's personality sketch fits if he is **not** in this field. Given the rarity of such specific interests, let’s assume P(E|¬H) = 0.25.

Now calculate: 
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.75 \times 0.1 = 0.075 \]

### Business Administration (H = business administration)
- **P(H)**: Assume business administration is a common field, so let’s use P(H) = 0.2.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam’s personality fits this field. Considering business majors often focus on analytics and practical applications rather than nature and animals, let's set P(E|H) = 0.1.
- **P(E|¬H)**: Assuming the same reasoning as before, P(E|¬H) = 0.3, it's a bit more plausible outside this field than inside.

Now calculate:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02 \]

### Computer Science (H = computer science)
- **P(H)**: Computer science is also a popular field, let's use P(H) = 0.2.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam’s personality fits this field. Given Adam's high intelligence and love for solving puzzles, let’s set P(E|H) = 0.5.
- **P(E|¬H)**: The general fit probability staying at P(E|¬H) = 0.25.

Now calculate:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.5 \times 0.2 = 0.1 \]

Given the approximate results:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.075,
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.1
}
```

These values indicate how likely Adam is to be enrolled in each field, given his personality sketch. Notice that the summed probabilities do not exceed 1, acknowledging that probabilities are not definitively normalized here due to the simplified approach and presence of other possible fields.
