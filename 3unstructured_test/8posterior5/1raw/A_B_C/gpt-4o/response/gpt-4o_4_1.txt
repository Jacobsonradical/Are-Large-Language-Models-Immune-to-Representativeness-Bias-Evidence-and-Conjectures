Sure, let's first define the probabilities. 

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the evidence given that Adam was enrolled in the field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the evidence given that Adam was not enrolled in the field.
4. \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field given the evidence.

Let's evaluate these for each field:

### Business Administration:
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam was in business administration. This could be low given Adam's interests in nature, animals, and abstract concepts.
- \( P(E|H) \): Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he were in business administration. Low, as his described interests and personality traits don't align well with typical business administration characteristics.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of observing similar evidence if he were not in business administration. Likely high since the personality traits seem more aligned with other fields.

Using a qualitative assessment:
- \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.8 \)

Applying Bayes Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \times 0.1}{0.1 \times 0.1 + 0.8 \times 0.9} = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.72} \approx 0.0138 \]

### Computer Science:
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam was in computer science. Moderate, given his high intelligence and interest in solving puzzles.
- \( P(E|H) \): Higher probability as computer science might attract individuals who enjoy puzzles and abstract concepts, though the nature and animal interests don't fit perfectly.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Fairly high as these personality traits are not exclusive to computer science.

Using a qualitative assessment:
- \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|H) \approx 0.5 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.6 \)

Applying Bayes Rule:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.5 \times 0.3}{0.5 \times 0.3 + 0.6 \times 0.7} = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.42} \approx 0.2632 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- \( P(H) \): Likely higher than the other fields given Adam's stated interests in nature, plants, and animals.
- \( P(E|H) \): Very high as the interests and personality traits align perfectly with agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Lower than for other fields since the specificity of his interests is more indicative of this field.

Using a qualitative assessment:
- \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \)

Applying Bayes Rule:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.9 \times 0.2}{0.9 \times 0.2 + 0.4 \times 0.8} = \frac{0.18}{0.18 + 0.32} = \frac{0.18}{0.5} \approx 0.36 \]

Therefore, the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0138,
  "computer science": 0.2632,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.36
}
