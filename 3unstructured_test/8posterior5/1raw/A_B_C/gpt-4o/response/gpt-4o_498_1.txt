Sure! When solving for \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we're using the formula:

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)}\]

where:
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the probability of observing the evidence E given that H is true.
- \(P(E)\) is the overall probability of the evidence E, which can be computed using the law of total probability, but is constant across all hypotheses considered.

To compute \(P(H|E)\), we don't need \(P(E)\) explicitly because we'll be comparing the ratios.

Let's consider the values for \(P(H)\), \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E|\neg H)\) for each field. We can then use relative probabilities to infer the most likely field Adam is enrolled in.

1. **Computer Science:**
   - \(P(H)\): Moderate prior probability, as computer science is a popular graduate field.
   - \(P(E|H)\): Lower, since his interests and personality seem more aligned with fields involving nature, animals, and empathy.
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\): Higher, since many other fields match his interests better.

\[P(H|E) \approx 0.1\]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \(P(H)\): Lower prior probability, as fewer students enroll in this field compared to computer science.
   - \(P(E|H)\): High, since his curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals fits perfectly.
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\): Lower, fewer other fields match his profile so well.

\[P(H|E) \approx 0.5\]

3. **Business Administration:**
   - \(P(H)\): Moderate prior probability since business administration is a common graduate field.
   - \(P(E|H)\): Lower, as his interests don't align with common business administration topics.
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\): Higher, since many other fields account better align with his given attributes.

\[P(H|E) \approx 0.05\]

So, summarizing the answers:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.05
}
