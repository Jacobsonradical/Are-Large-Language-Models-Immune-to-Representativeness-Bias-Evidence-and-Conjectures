To calculate the probabilities \( P(H|E) \), we start by defining \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for the three fields: business administration, agricultural and veterinary science, and computer science. We do not have actual numerical data, so we will use logical reasoning to estimate these probabilities. Note that these are subjective estimates.

For each field:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \) (the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration): Given that many students enroll in this field, let's assume \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \) (the probability of observing Adam's personality traits given he is in business administration): Adam’s traits (love for animals, curiosity about nature, empathy, etc.) seem less related to business administration. So, let's assume \( P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \) (the probability of observing these traits given he is not in business administration): Nature and animal appreciation are more common in other fields, so \( P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) \approx 0.8 \).

   Using Bayes’ Rule:

   \[
   P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)}
   \]

   Since \( P(E) = P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) + P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) \cdot P(\neg \text{business administration}) \):

   \[
   P(E) \approx (0.1 \cdot 0.1) + (0.8 \cdot 0.9) = 0.01 + 0.72 = 0.73
   \]

   Thus,

   \[
   P(\text{business administration}|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.73} = \frac{0.01}{0.73} \approx 0.0137
   \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \) (the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science): Fewer students may choose this compared to business, assume \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.05 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \) (the probability of observing Adam’s traits given he is in agricultural and veterinary science): Traits strongly match this field, so \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.9 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Since already approximated under the assumption, \( P(E|\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.2 \).

   Using Bayes’ Rule:

   \[
   P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)}
   \]

   Since \( P(E) \approx (0.9 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95) = 0.045 + 0.19 = 0.235 \)

   Thus,

   \[
   P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \approx \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.235} = \frac{0.045}{0.235} \approx 0.1915
   \]

3. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) \) (the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science): Given today's trends, let’s assume \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.15 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \) (the probability of observing Adam’s traits given he is in computer science): Understanding abstract concepts and intelligence are somewhat fitting but less so nature/animals, so \( P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.2 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Same assumption, \( P(E|\neg \text{computer science}) \approx 0.5 \).

   Using Bayes’ Rule:

   \[
   P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)}
   \]

   Since \( P(E) \approx (0.2 \cdot 0.15) + (0.5 \cdot 0.85) = 0.03 + 0.425 = 0.455 \)

   Thus,

   \[
   P(\text{computer science}|E) \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{0.455} = \frac{0.03}{0.455} \approx 0.0659
   \]
