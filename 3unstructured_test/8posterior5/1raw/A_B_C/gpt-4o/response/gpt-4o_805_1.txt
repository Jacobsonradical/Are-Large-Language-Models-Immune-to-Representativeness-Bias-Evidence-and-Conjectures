To evaluate the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis \( H \) (i.e., the field in which Adam was enrolled) given the evidence \( E \) (the personality sketch of Adam), we need to use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

This process involves three main steps:

1. **Estimating \( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the fields.
2. **Estimating \( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood of the evidence given each hypothesis.
3. **Estimating \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The likelihood of the evidence given the negation of each hypothesis.

For simplicity's sake, we'll assume that \( P(E) \) is constant across all hypotheses because it gets normalized out when comparing probabilities.

Let's make qualitative judgments on these probabilities based on the information provided in the personality sketch of Adam.

### Estimations

#### 1. Business Administration
- **P(H)**: Business administration is a common field, so we might give it a moderate prior probability.
- **P(E|H)**: The personality traits described (warm heart, empathy, love for nature and animals) are less typical for business students. Hence, \( P(E|H) \) might be lower.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Given that the traits are not very typical for business students, but typical for other fields, \( P(E|\neg H) \) will be higher.

#### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: Less common than business but still a notable field. Moderate prior probability.
- **P(E|H)**: The traits described (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy) are highly indicative of someone in agricultural and veterinary sciences. Hence, \( P(E|H) \) will be high.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: These traits may be less common outside this field, so \( P(E|\neg H) \) will be lower.

#### 3. Computer Science
- **P(H)**: Very common graduate field, so moderate to high prior probability.
- **P(E|H)**: Given that Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is of high intelligence, this may fit, but the love for nature and animals is less typical. Hence, \( P(E|H) \) would be moderate.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: These traits may also fit other fields, though perhaps not as closely as agriculture and veterinary sciences, so \( P(E|\neg H) \) will be moderate.

### Judgments and Calculations

Let's assign some hypothetical numerical values to these (they are subjective estimates):

#### Business Administration
- \( P(H) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \)
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.02}{P(E)} \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \)
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} = \frac{0.21}{P(E)} \]

#### Computer Science
- \( P(H) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \)
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} = \frac{0.09}{P(E)} \]

Given these, now we normalize them:

\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.21 + 0.09 = 0.32 \]

Thus,

1. **Business Administration:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.32} \approx 0.0625 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.21}{0.32} \approx 0.656 \]

3. **Computer Science:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.32} \approx 0.281 \]
