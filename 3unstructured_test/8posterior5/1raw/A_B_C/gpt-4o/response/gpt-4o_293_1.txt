To calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis (H), we need to use Bayes' rule, which can be expressed as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we don't have direct numerical data for \( P(H) \), the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field. We need to make reasonable assumptions based on general knowledge and available information. Let's consider each hypothesis:

1. **Agricultural and veterinary science (H1)**
   - \( P(H_1) \): This could be relatively low given the number of students in this field compared to other fields.
     Let's assume \( P(H_1) = 0.1 \) (10%).
   - \( P(E|H_1) \): Given Adam's interests and personality (curiosity about nature, love for animals), this probability should be high.
     Let's assume \( P(E|H_1) = 0.8 \) (80%).
   - \( P(E|\neg H_1) \): This is less likely but possible, as his personality could fit other fields too.
     Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_1) = 0.3 \) (30%).
   
2. **Computer science (H2)**
   - \( P(H_2) \): This field generally has a higher enrollment rate.
     Let's assume \( P(H_2) = 0.3 \) (30%).
   - \( P(E|H_2) \): His personality traits do align with computer science (solving puzzles, high intelligence).
     Let's assume \( P(E|H_2) = 0.5 \) (50%).
   - \( P(E|\neg H_2) \): Given his interest in nature and animals, this is lower.
     Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_2) = 0.4 \) (40%).
   
3. **Business administration (H3)**
   - \( P(H_3) \): This field also has a significant number of students.
     Let's assume \( P(H_3) = 0.2 \) (20%).
   - \( P(E|H_3) \): His personality traits are less aligned with business administration.
     Let's assume \( P(E|H_3) = 0.2 \) (20%).
   - \( P(E|\neg H_3) \): His personality does not strongly fit this field.
     Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_3) = 0.35 \) (35%).

Now, let's compute \( P(H|E) \):

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

For computer science:
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \]

For business administration:
\[ P(H_3|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

\( P(E) \) can be calculated as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) + P(E|H_3) \cdot P(H_3) + \cdots \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.5 \cdot 0.3) + (0.2 \cdot 0.2) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.15 + 0.04 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.27 \]

Now plug in \( P(E) \):

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.27} \approx 0.296 \]

For computer science:
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.3}{0.27} \approx 0.556 \]

For business administration:
\[ P(H_3|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.27} \approx 0.148 \]

So, the results are:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.296,
  "computer science": 0.556,
  "business administration": 0.148
}
