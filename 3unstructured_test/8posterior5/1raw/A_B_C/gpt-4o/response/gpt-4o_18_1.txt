To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each of the fields using Bayes' Rule, we need to evaluate the following quantities for each field:

1. \( P(H) \) - the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
2. \( P(E|H) \) - the likelihood that Adam's personality sketch matches if he was enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - the likelihood that Adam's personality sketch matches if he was not enrolled in that field.

The Bayes' Rule formula is:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) (the overall probability of the personality sketch) remains constant, we can simplify our comparisons using relative values.

Given that exact numerical data for these probabilities is not provided, I'll make reasonable estimates based on common sense and knowledge about these fields and Adam's personality sketch.

### Field: Computer Science
- **Prior Probability, \( P(H_{CS}) \)**: Moderate. Many students pursue computer science, but not all of them fit Adam's personality profile.
    - \( P(H_{CS}) \approx 0.2 \)
- **Likelihood, \( P(E|H_{CS}) \)**: Moderate. A curiosity about nature and empathy are not typically core traits for a computer science student, but his intelligence and puzzle-solving abilities do fit well.
    - \( P(E|H_{CS}) \approx 0.3 \)
- **Complement Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \)**: Determined after considering the other fields, but generally lower than fields fitting his personality better.
    - \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \approx 0.5 \)

### Field: Business Administration
- **Prior Probability, \( P(H_{BA}) \)**: Moderate to low. Many students pursue business administration, but fewer with a personality like Adam's.
    - \( P(H_{BA}) \approx 0.1 \)
- **Likelihood, \( P(E|H_{BA}) \)**: Low. Empathy may fit, but curiosity about nature and love for animals are less common.
    - \( P(E|H_{BA}) \approx 0.1 \)
- **Complement Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \)**: Higher because Adam’s personality matches better with other fields.
    - \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \approx 0.6 \)

### Field: Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **Prior Probability, \( P(H_{AVS}) \)**: Moderate. This field is less common, but fits Adam's profile well.
    - \( P(H_{AVS}) \approx 0.1 \)
- **Likelihood, \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \)**: High. Strong fit with love for animals, curiosity about nature, and empathy.
    - \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \approx 0.7 \)
- **Complement Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \)**: Lower, because Adam’s personality sketch is especially fitting for this field.
    - \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \approx 0.3 \)

### Bayes' Rule Application Estimates:
Given these estimates, we can compute the relative probabilities for each field.

For \( P(H_{CS}|E) \):
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = 0.06 \]

For \( P(H_{BA}|E) \):
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = 0.01 \]

For \( P(H_{AVS}|E) \):
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \propto \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = 0.07 \]

Normalizing so their sum is 1 (though it isn't necessary for our case), we get rough proportions:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.07,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.53
}
```
These estimates suggest that Adam is most likely to be enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, followed by Computer Science, and least likely in Business Administration.
