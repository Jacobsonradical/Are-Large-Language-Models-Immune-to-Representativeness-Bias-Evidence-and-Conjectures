Let's start by analyzing and assigning probabilities based on the available information.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

#### P(H):
Commonly, people with interests and qualities similar to Adam are likely to be inclined towards this field. This field appeals to those who have a curiosity about nature, a love for animals, and a strong understanding of hard work and dedication. Let's be somewhat generous in our estimation: 
\[ P(H) \approx 0.2 \, (i.e., 20\%) \]

#### P(E|H):
Given that Adam's personality aligns very well with this field, we can give this a high probability: 
\[ P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \, (i.e., 90\%) \]

#### P(E|\neg H):
Since not all graduate students exhibit such a high dedication and alignment with the natural sciences, let's estimate: 
\[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.1 \, (i.e., 10\%) \]

#### P(H|E):
Using Bayes' Rule: 
\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} 
= \frac{0.9 \times 0.2}{0.9 \times 0.2 + 0.1 \times 0.8} 
= \frac{0.18}{0.18 + 0.08} 
= \frac{0.18}{0.26} 
\approx 0.692 
\]

### Business Administration:

#### P(H):
Normally, this field is not very closely associated with empathy toward animals, curiosity about nature, etc. Let's estimate:
\[ P(H) \approx 0.1 \, (i.e., 10\%) \]

#### P(E|H):
Adam's dedication and intelligence might somewhat correlate, but it's not a strong fit: 
\[ P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \, (i.e., 30\%) \]

#### P(E|\neg H):
This would be the same as before: 
\[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.1 \, (i.e., 10\%) \]

#### P(H|E):
Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} 
= \frac{0.3 \times 0.1}{0.3 \times 0.1 + 0.1 \times 0.9}
= \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.09}
= \frac{0.03}{0.12}
= 0.25
\]

### Computer Science:

#### P(H):
Many attributes such as intelligence and solving puzzles align with this field. 
\[ P(H) \approx 0.3 \, (i.e., 30\%) \]

#### P(E|H):
Since Adam's traits like intelligence and puzzle-solving are highly compatible here, but the strong empathy and love for animals are less related, adjust accordingly: 
\[ P(E|H) \approx 0.6 \, (i.e., 60\%) \]

#### P(E|\neg H):
Remaining consistent: 
\[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.1 \, (i.e., 10\%) \]

#### P(H|E):
Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
= \frac{0.6 \times 0.3}{0.6 \times 0.3 + 0.1 \times 0.7}
= \frac{0.18}{0.18 + 0.07}
= \frac{0.18}{0.25}
= 0.72
\]

Finally, the computed probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.692,
  "business administration": 0.25,
  "computer science": 0.72
}
