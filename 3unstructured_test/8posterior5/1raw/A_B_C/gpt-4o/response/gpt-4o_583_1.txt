Sure, let's break it down step by step using Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we don't have the exact numbers for these probabilities, so we'll be making qualitative judgments based on the provided personality sketch and general knowledge of the fields in question.

1. **Business Administration (BA)**
   - \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration. Given his characteristics and the nature of BA, this is likely quite low, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood that Adam's personality sketch fits a student of BA. The description doesn't particularly align well with typical BA traits. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of seeing Adam's personality sketch if he is not in BA. This could be quite varied, but given the focus on nature, empathy, and abstract thinking, people not in BA might fit this profile better, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.7 \).

2. **Computer Science (CS)**
   - \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Computer Science. Given his intelligence and aptitude for solving puzzles, this is somewhat plausible but not certain. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.3 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood that Adam's personality fits a CS student. Intelligence and solving puzzles do fit well, but the strong empathy and love for nature are a bit less typical. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.5 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of seeing Adam's personality sketch if he is not in CS. Since his traits are not highly specific to CS, \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \).

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AgVet)**
   - \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. His interest in nature and animals strongly aligns with this field. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.4 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood that Adam's personality sketch fits a student of AgVet. This is very high given his interests and empathy. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of seeing Adam's personality sketch if he is not in AgVet. It's somewhat less likely among the general population, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

So, applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

But since we don't know \(P(E)\) exactly, we need to compare the relative likelihoods which are proportional to \( P(H|E) \cdot constant = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

Calculations:

1. **Business Administration**
   - \( P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \)
   - \( P(H|E) \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.1 = 0.02 \)

2. **Computer Science**
   - \( P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \)
   - \( P(H|E) \propto 0.5 \cdot 0.3 = 0.15 \)

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - \( P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \)
   - \( P(H|E) \propto 0.9 \cdot 0.4 = 0.36 \)

Normalizing to get probabilities:

- Total = \( 0.02 + 0.15 + 0.36 = 0.53 \)

\[
\begin{align*}
P(\text{BA}|E) &= \frac{0.02}{0.53} \approx 0.038 \\
P(\text{CS}|E) &= \frac{0.15}{0.53} \approx 0.283 \\
P(\text{AgVet}|E) &= \frac{0.36}{0.53} \approx 0.679 \\
\end{align*}
\]

Given the normalization, the probabilities should sum to 1, but since it was mentioned that the sum does not need to be 1 because there are other fields, I will denote values without normalization:

{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.15,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.36
