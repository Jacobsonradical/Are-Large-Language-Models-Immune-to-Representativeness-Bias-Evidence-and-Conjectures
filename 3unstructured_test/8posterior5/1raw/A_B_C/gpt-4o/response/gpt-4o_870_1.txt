To solve this problem using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the various probabilities as follows:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being in a particular field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam is in a particular field.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam is not in a particular field.
4. **P(H|E)**: The posterior probability of Adam being in a particular field given the personality sketch E.

Let's make our estimates for these probabilities:

### Computer Science
- **P(H=CS)**: This depends on the general likelihood of a graduate student being in computer science. Let's assume P(H=CS) = 0.1 (10%).
- **P(E|H=CS)**: Given Adam's traits such as high intelligence and abstract thinking, he could fit into computer science, although his love for nature and animals may be less aligned. Let's estimate P(E|H=CS) = 0.3.
- **P(E|¬H=CS)**: The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in CS. Given the variety of other fields, let's assume a moderate likelihood P(E|¬H=CS) = 0.7.

### Business Administration
- **P(H=BA)**: The likelihood of a graduate student being in business administration. Let's assume P(H=BA) = 0.1 (10%).
- **P(E|H=BA)**: Adam's personality doesn't strongly align with typical business administration traits, so let's estimate this as low, P(E|H=BA) = 0.1.
- **P(E|¬H=BA)**: Again, moderate likelihood given other fields, P(E|¬H=BA) = 0.7.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H=AVS)**: The likelihood of a graduate student being in agricultural and veterinary science. We assume P(H=AVS) = 0.05 (5%) due to its specificity.
- **P(E|H=AVS)**: Given Adam's traits, he seems to align very well with this field, so we can consider this high. Let's estimate P(E|H=AVS) = 0.9.
- **P(E|¬H=AVS)**: The personality sketch given other fields would be moderate to low. Let's assume P(E|¬H=AVS) = 0.6.

Now, applying Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be decomposed as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

However, for simplicity, we can compare the relative likelihoods since \( P(E) \) will cancel out as a normalizing factor.

### Relative Likelihoods Calculation

1. **Computer Science:**
\[ P(H=CS|E) \propto P(E|H=CS) \cdot P(H=CS) \]
\[ P(H=CS|E) \propto 0.3 \cdot 0.1 = 0.03 \]

2. **Business Administration:**
\[ P(H=BA|E) \propto P(E|H=BA) \cdot P(H=BA) \]
\[ P(H=BA|E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.1 = 0.01 \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(H=AVS|E) \propto P(E|H=AVS) \cdot P(H=AVS) \]
\[ P(H=AVS|E) \propto 0.9 \cdot 0.05 = 0.045 \]

Next, we normalize these values to get probabilities that sum to 1:

Sum of all proportional values:
\[ 0.03 + 0.01 + 0.045 = 0.085 \]

Normalized probabilities:

1. **Computer Science:**
\[ P(H=CS|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.085} \approx 0.35 \]

2. **Business Administration:**
\[ P(H=BA|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.085} \approx 0.12 \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(H=AVS|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.085} \approx 0.53 \]

So, the final probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.35,
  "business administration": 0.12,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.53
}
```
