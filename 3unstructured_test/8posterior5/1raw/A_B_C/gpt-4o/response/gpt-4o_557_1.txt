To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we'll use Bayes' rule, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field. Here's a qualitative estimate to derive quantitative probabilities:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H):** Let's assume the base rate for this field among all graduate students is around 0.1 (10%).
- **P(E|H):** Given Adam's love for nature, animals, and plants, as well as his empathy and intelligence, the probability that he exhibits these traits if he's in this field is quite high, say 0.9.
- **P(E|\neg H):** If Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science, but in other fields, the likelihood of him having these traits might be relatively lower, say around 0.3.

### Computer Science
- **P(H):** Let's assume the base rate for this field among all graduate students is around 0.2 (20%).
- **P(E|H):** Given Adam's interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence, but considering his stronger inclination towards nature and animals, it might be moderately likely he fits the profile, let's say 0.4.
- **P(E|\neg H):** If Adam is in other fields, the likelihood of him having these traits might be relatively consistent, say around 0.5.

### Business Administration
- **P(H):** Let's assume the base rate for this field among all graduate students is around 0.15 (15%).
- **P(E|H):** Given Adam's traits, it seems less likely he fits the profile associated with business administration, so let's estimate it around 0.2.
- **P(E|\neg H):** If Adam is in other fields, the likelihood of him having these traits might be relatively higher, say around 0.6.

Then to find \( P(E) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_1)P(H_1) + P(E|H_2)P(H_2) + P(E|H_3)P(H_3) + P(E|\neg H_1 \neg H_2 \neg H_3)P(\neg H_1 \neg H_2 \neg H_3) \]

Following the above estimations, let's compute:
\[ P(E) = 0.9 \times 0.1 + 0.4 \times 0.2 + 0.2 \times 0.15 + P(E|\neg (H_1 \cup H_2 \cup H_3))P(\neg (H_1 \cup H_2 \cup H_3)) \]
For simplicity, we assume:
\[ P(E|\neg (H_1 \cup H_2 \cup H_3))P(\neg (H_1 \cup H_2 \cup H_3)) ≈ 0.5 \times 0.55 = 0.275 \]
Thus:
\[ P(E) ≈ 0.09 + 0.08 + 0.03 + 0.275 = 0.475 \]

Now, applying Bayes' rule:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.1}{0.475} ≈ 0.189 \]

### Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.2}{0.475} ≈ 0.168 \]

### Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.15}{0.475} ≈ 0.063 \]

The probabilities after computing through Bayes' rule are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.189,
  "computer science": 0.168,
  "business administration": 0.063
}
