To determine \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we'll apply Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the personality sketch \( E \), we need to estimate the following:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in each field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in each field.
4. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of Adam's personality sketch.

Since \( P(E) \) is a constant across all fields, we only need to compare the numerators \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) to determine the relative probabilities.

### Estimations:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

   - \( P(H) \): Likely low to moderate given the total number of graduate students, but higher than many less common fields. Estimating \( P(H) \) ≈ 0.05 (5%).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Very high, as Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy strongly align with this field. Estimating \( P(E|H) \) ≈ 0.9 (90%).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Lower since not all other fields would comfortably fit the empathy and nature-related traits. Estimating \( P(E|\neg H) \) ≈ 0.2 (20%).

2. **Computer Science:**

   - \( P(H) \): Likely higher than Agricultural and Veterinary Science, given its popularity. Estimating \( P(H) \) ≈ 0.15 (15%).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Moderate, since curiosity, intelligence, and problem-solving fit well, but less emphasis on nature and animals. Estimating \( P(E|H) \) ≈ 0.4 (40%).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Higher compared to the probability computed for Agricuture and Veterinary Science. Estimating \( P(E|\neg H) \) ≈ 0.5 (50%).

3. **Business Administration:**

   - \( P(H) \): Likely moderate given its popularity. Estimating \( P(H) \) ≈ 0.1 (10%).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Low to moderate, as appreciation for hard work fits but not others such as empathy for animals and nature. Estimating \( P(E|H) \) ≈ 0.3 (30%).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): High considering a broad range of non-enrolled fields. Estimating \( P(E|\neg H) \) ≈ 0.7 (70%).

Now, calculating the relative probabilities:

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.9 \cdot 0.05 = 0.045 \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.4 \cdot 0.15 = 0.06 \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.3 \cdot 0.1 = 0.03 \]

Normalizing these values to get relative probabilities:
\[ P(H|E)_{total} = 0.045 + 0.06 + 0.03 = 0.135 \]

Hence:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{0.045}{0.135} \approx 0.333 \),
  "computer science": \( \frac{0.06}{0.135} \approx 0.444 \),
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.03}{0.135} \approx 0.222 \)
}
