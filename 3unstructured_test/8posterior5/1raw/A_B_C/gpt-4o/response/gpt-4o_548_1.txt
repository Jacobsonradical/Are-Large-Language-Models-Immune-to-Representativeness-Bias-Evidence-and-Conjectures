Let's use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probabilities P(H|E) for each field of study given the personality sketch of Adam.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam having the personality sketch E given that he is in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of Adam having the personality sketch E. 

For simplicity, let's assume equal prior probabilities for all fields, i.e., \( P(H) = \frac{1}{N} \) where \( N \) is the number of possible fields, but as you suggested, we focus on three fields randomly chosen out of many, thus each has the same prior probability.

Let's also make reasonable judgments for \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \) based on compatibilities:

### For business administration:
- **Prior probability, P(H)**: Business is quite a popular field, so let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
- **Likelihood, P(E|H)**: Adam's characteristics don't neatly align with business administration (for instance, curiosity about nature and animals), so we'll give it a low likelihood, say \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
- **Likelihood, P(E|\neg H)**: This would be more or less reflecting the diversity of other fields. There are many diverse other fields than business, so let's say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.3} = \frac{0.02}{0.3} = 0.0667 \]

### For agricultural and veterinary science:
- **Prior probability, P(H)**: Assuming equal distribution, \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
- **Likelihood, P(E|H)**: Adam's characteristics align well with agricultural and veterinary science, so we'll set a higher likelihood, such as \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).
- **Likelihood, P(E|\neg H)**: This would concern other diverse fields. Say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.2}{0.3} = \frac{0.14}{0.3} = 0.4667 \]

### For computer science:
- **Prior probability, P(H)**: Assuming equal distribution, \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
- **Likelihood, P(E|H)**: Intelligence and puzzle-solving could relate, let's assume moderate alignment, \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \).
- **Likelihood, P(E|\neg H)**: Again, involving the diversity of other fields, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.2}{0.3} = \frac{0.08}{0.3} = 0.2667 \]

Here is the answer in the requested format:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0667,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4667,
  "computer science": 0.2667
}
```

Note that these probabilities are only illustrative and based on assumed values. Exact probabilities would depend on more precise data and context-specific priors and likelihood estimates.
