To compute \( P(H|E) \), which is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given the personality sketch (E), we will use Bayes' theorem which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To use Bayes' theorem effectively, we need to estimate the following probabilities for each field:

1. \( P(H) \) - The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each specific field.
2. \( P(E|H) \) - The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in that specific field (we can consider the average probability across other fields for simplicity).

We will assume equal distribution across various graduate fields for simplicity, even though it might not be the case. It means that \( P(H) \) could be approximated as a uniform distribution unless we have specific statistics.

Let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \) for each field due to many fields and limited data. To summarize our approach:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  - \( P(H) \): Given that it is 1 of many possible fields, we assume \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \).
  - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's love for animals, plants, and nature, this probability is high. Let's approximate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \).
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Average probability, let's approximate \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \).

- **Computer Science**:
  - \( P(H) \): Same reasoning, \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \).
  - \( P(E|H) \): Being good at abstract concepts and puzzles fits well, let's say \( P(E|H) \approx 0.6 \).
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Average probability, \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \).

- **Business Administration**:
  - \( P(H) \): Same reasoning, \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \).
  - \( P(E|H) \): Less fit for the given personality sketch, maybe \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \).
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Average probability, \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \).

The probability \( P(E) \) could be treated as normalization constant to ensure all posterior probabilities sum to 1, but for relative comparison, we can ignore this constant.

Now calculating \( P(H|E) \):

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

2. **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

3. **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

Ignoring \( P(E) \) for relative comparison:

\[
\begin{aligned}
P(H|E) &\propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \\
&\propto \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
0.8 \cdot 0.1 & \text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science} \\
0.6 \cdot 0.1 & \text{Computer Science} \\
0.3 \cdot 0.1 & \text{Business Administration}
\end{array}
\right.
\end{aligned}
\]

\[
\begin{aligned}
&\propto \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
0.08 & \text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science} \\
0.06 & \text{Computer Science} \\
0.03 & \text{Business Administration}
\end{array}
\right.
\end{aligned}
\]

Thus, our respective values would be:

\[
\begin{aligned}
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
\end{aligned}
\]

Note that these values are relative and not actual probabilities unless normalized to sum to 1. They give us the relative likelihood given the personality sketch (E).
