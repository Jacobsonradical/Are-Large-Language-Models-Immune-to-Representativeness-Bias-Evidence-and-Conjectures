Sure, let's calculate the desired probabilities using Bayes' rule. We'll need to estimate the following probabilities for each field:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is not enrolled in a particular field.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
However, since \( P(E) \) is constant for all the fields here, we can compare the relative probabilities without calculating \( P(E) \) explicitly.

We should make reasonable assumptions to fill in these values, keeping in mind the given personality sketch.

### Assumptions:
- Probabilities \( P(H) \): It is fair to assume that the distribution of graduate students across these fields is not uniformly distributed. Fields like business administration and computer science might have higher enrollment than agricultural and veterinary science.
  - \( P(H_{business}) = 0.4 \)
  - \( P(H_{cs}) = 0.4 \)
  - \( P(H_{agri}) = 0.2 \)

- \( P(E|H) \): This is the likelihood that a student in each field fits Adam's personality sketch.
  - For business administration, the traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals) might not be as emphasized.
    - \( P(E|H_{business}) = 0.1 \)
  - For computer science, the ability to solve puzzles and understand abstract concepts fit, but the empathy and love for animals are less relevant.
    - \( P(E|H_{cs}) = 0.3 \)
  - For agricultural and veterinary science, the match is high due to the focus on nature, plants, and animals.
    - \( P(E|H_{agri}) = 0.8 \)

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Measures how likely Adam's traits appear in other fields.
  - This considers traits like curiosity, empathy, intelligence, which might be higher in science-related fields.
    - \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \)

### Calculation:
We don't need \( P(E) \) if we only need relative likelihoods, so let's use Bayes:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

For each field:
- **Business administration**:
\[ P(H_{business}|E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.4 = 0.04 \]

- **Computer science**:
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) \propto 0.3 \cdot 0.4 = 0.12 \]

- **Agricultural and veterinary science**:
\[ P(H_{agri}|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.2 = 0.16 \]

### Normalization:
The values computed give us relative weights but are not probabilities yet. To reflect the relative strengths more accurately:
\[ P(H_{business}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.12 + 0.16} \approx 0.125 \]
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.04 + 0.12 + 0.16} \approx 0.375 \]
\[ P(H_{agri}|E) = \frac{0.16}{0.04 + 0.12 + 0.16} \approx 0.5 \]

### Final Estimates:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.125,
  "computer science": 0.375,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5
}
```

These are relative probabilities under the given assumptions and can be fine-tuned with more accurate data or assumptions.
