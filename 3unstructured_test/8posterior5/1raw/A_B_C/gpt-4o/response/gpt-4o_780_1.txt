To determine P(H|E) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to compute the following probabilities:

- P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field H.
- P(E|H): The likelihood that Adam has the given personality sketch if he was enrolled in the field H.
- P(E|\neg H): The likelihood that Adam has the given personality sketch if he was not enrolled in the field H.

Let's make reasonable assumptions to estimate these probabilities for each field.

### Business Administration

**P(H)**: The probability that a random graduate student is pursuing business administration might be relatively moderate, say 0.2 (20%).

**P(E|H)**: The likelihood of having Adam's personality sketch in business administration might be low because business administration students might not typically exhibit strong curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals. Let's say 0.1 (10%).

**P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of having Adam's personality sketch if not in business administration might be higher because there are several other fields where such traits are more common, say 0.6 (60%).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(Business\ Administration|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.6 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.48} = \frac{0.02}{0.50} = 0.04 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

**P(H)**: The probability that a random graduate student is pursuing agricultural and veterinary science might be lower, say 0.1 (10%).

**P(E|H)**: The likelihood of having Adam's personality sketch in agricultural and veterinary science is higher because his traits strongly align with this field. Let's say 0.7 (70%).

**P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of having Adam's personality sketch if not in agricultural and veterinary science might be lower here, say 0.2 (20%).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(Agricultural\ and\ Veterinary\ Science|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.7 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.07}{0.07 + 0.18} = \frac{0.07}{0.25} = 0.28 \]

### Computer Science

**P(H)**: The probability that a random graduate student is pursuing computer science is relatively high, say 0.3 (30%).

**P(E|H)**: The likelihood of having Adam's personality sketch in computer science might be moderate. While his intelligence and puzzle-solving skills fit, other traits like love for animals and nature curiosity might not fit as well. Let's say 0.3 (30%).

**P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of having Adam's personality sketch if not in computer science might be higher, let's assume 0.5 (50%).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(Computer\ Science|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.3}{0.3 \cdot 0.3 + 0.5 \cdot 0.7} = \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.35} = \frac{0.09}{0.44} = 0.2045 \]

Now we have the probabilities for each field:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.04,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.28,
  "computer science": 0.2045
}
