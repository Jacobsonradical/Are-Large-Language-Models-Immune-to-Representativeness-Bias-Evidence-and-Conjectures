To compute the posterior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field given his personality sketch, we'll use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here's a step-by-step breakdown for each field:

### Business Administration

1. **P(H) - Prior Probability**:
   - Business administration is a common field, but considering Adam's interests and traits, it's less likely than typical.
   - Estimate: \(P(H) \approx 0.1\)

2. **P(E|H) - Likelihood**:
   - Given that Adam has strong empathy, warm-heartedness, and intelligence, these can be useful in business, but his love for nature and animals doesn't align closely with this field.
   - Estimate: \(P(E|H) \approx 0.2\)

3. **P(E|\neg H) - Evidence under other fields**:
   - Given the wide range of other potential fields and the fit to agricultural and veterinary science, the likelihood of the personality sketch given any field other than business administration is relatively high.
   - Estimate: \(P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.8\)

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{0.8} = 0.025 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H) - Prior Probability**:
   - This field is less common but closely aligns with Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals.
   - Estimate: \(P(H) \approx 0.1\)

2. **P(E|H) - Likelihood**:
   - Adam's traits strongly align with this field, making it highly likely.
   - Estimate: \(P(E|H) \approx 0.9\)

3. **P(E|\neg H) - Evidence under other fields**:
   - Given Adam's traits, if he weren't in agricultural and veterinary science, the probability of these traits is lower.
   - Estimate: \(P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4\)

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.1}{0.4} = 0.225 \]

### Computer Science

1. **P(H) - Prior Probability**:
   - Computer science is a common field for graduate students, and Adam's intelligence and love for solving puzzles are relevant traits.
   - Estimate: \(P(H) \approx 0.2\)

2. **P(E|H) - Likelihood**:
   - While he has relevant traits for computer science, his strong love for nature and animals doesn't align closely.
   - Estimate: \(P(E|H) \approx 0.3\)

3. **P(E|\neg H) - Evidence under other fields**:
   - The probability of the personality traits under other fields is higher compared to computer science.
   - Estimate: \(P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.7\)

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{0.7} = 0.086 \]

### Summary of the computed probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.025,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.225,
  "computer science": 0.086
}
```

These values estimate the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in each field based on his personality traits and Bayes' rule.
