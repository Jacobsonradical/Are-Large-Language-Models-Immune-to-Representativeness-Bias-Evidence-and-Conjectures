Sure, let's analyze these probabilities step by step.

1. **Prior Probabilities (P(H)):**
    - P(business administration) = 0.25 (assuming equal chances for simplicity and general popularity in graduate studies)
    - P(agricultural and veterinary science) = 0.25 (assuming equal chances for simplicity)
    - P(computer science) = 0.25 (assuming equal chances for simplicity)

2. **Likelihood (P(E|H)):**
    - P(E|business administration) = 0.1 (high intelligence might fit, but a deep love for animals and nature doesn't particularly align with this field)
    - P(E|agricultural and veterinary science) = 0.7 (a deep love for animals and nature is highly relevant)
    - P(E|computer science) = 0.6 (high intelligence and solving puzzles seem relevant, but deep love for animals and nature less so)

3. **Likelihood given not H (P(E|¬H)):**
    - P(E|¬business administration) = 0.75 (assuming the personality sketch fits better with other fields)
    - P(E|¬agricultural and veterinary science) = 0.375 (assuming about half the probability since nature and animals align closely)
    - P(E|¬computer science) = 0.4 (solving puzzles might fit into other STEM fields)

Now, we can compute P(H|E) using Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E| \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

4. **Computation:**

- **For Business Administration:**
  \[
  P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.75 \cdot 0.75) = 0.025 + 0.5625 = 0.5875
  \]
  \[
  P(business administration|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.5875} \approx 0.0425
  \]

- **For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
  \[
  P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.25) + (0.375 \cdot 0.75) = 0.175 + 0.28125 = 0.45625
  \]
  \[
  P(agricultural and veterinary science|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.25}{0.45625} \approx 0.3834
  \]

- **For Computer Science:**
  \[
  P(E) = (0.6 \cdot 0.25) + (0.4 \cdot 0.75) = 0.15 + 0.3 = 0.45
  \]
  \[
  P(computer science|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.25}{0.45} \approx 0.3333
  \]

So, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0425,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3834,
  "computer science": 0.3333
}
```

These values give a rough but quantified sense of the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in each field, given his personality sketch.
