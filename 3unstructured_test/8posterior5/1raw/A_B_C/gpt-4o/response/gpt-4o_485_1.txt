To apply Bayes' rule and make use of the personality sketch of Adam (denoted as \(E\)), we need to estimate the various probabilities needed:

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given we need to compute \(P(H|E)\) for each of the fields based on Adam's personality sketch, we can break it down step-by-step.

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality traits given he's enrolled in each field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality traits given he's not enrolled in each field.
4. **P(E)**: The overall probability of these personality traits, which we don't need to compute directly because it cancels out as a normalizing constant.

We don't have precise numerical values for prior probabilities \(P(H)\), so we'll assume them to be moderate and reasonable general probabilities for a U.S. graduate student choosing these fields. We will assign somewhat arbitrary but reasonable values since exact data isn't provided.

Let's estimate:

**Assumptions:**
- \(P(H) = 0.2\) for business administration (plausible but not highly specific to his personality sketch).
- \(P(H) = 0.3\) for computer science (plausible given high intelligence and abstract concept understanding).
- \(P(H) = 0.1\) for agricultural and veterinary science (less common but fits very well with personality sketch of love for nature and animals).

**Likelihood: P(E|H)**
- \(P(E|H)\) for business administration: Low, given the personality doesn’t particularly fit. Let's assume 0.1.
- \(P(E|H)\) for computer science: Moderate, fitting high intelligence and puzzle-solving traits. Let's assume 0.5.
- \(P(E|H)\) for agricultural and veterinary science: High, fitting his love for nature and animals. Let's assume 0.8.

**Overall probability \(P(E)\) calculation faces limitations without precise category values of \(\neg E\), but we will see it as part of the normalization.**

Let's calculate the conditional probabilities \(P(H|E)\) using the Bayes' rule formula:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

For practicality and simplicity, circular normalization, we will still assume \(P(E)\) as a common-term constant effectively.

We'll start individually:

1. **Business administration**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.02}{P(E)} \]

2. **Computer science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \times 0.3}{P(E)} = \frac{0.15}{P(E)} \]

3. **Agricultural and veterinary science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.08}{P(E)} \]

When Normalized simply for comparative, let’s focus on proportions given,

\[
\text{Normalization constant } P(E) = 0.02 + 0.15 + 0.08 = 0.25
\]

Then normalizing:

For business administration,
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.25} = 0.08
\]

For computer science,
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.15}{0.25} = 0.60
\]

For agricultural and veterinary science,
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.25} = 0.32
\]

Thus the results are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.08,
  "computer science": 0.60,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.32
}
```
