Let's break this down step-by-step for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - \(P(H)\) (Probability that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science): This is probably moderate, given the context in the U.S., let's say 0.2.
    - \(P(E|H)\) (Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science): High, because his interests in nature, plants, and animals align well, let's use 0.8.
    - \(P(E|\neg H)\) (Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is **not** in Agricultural and Veterinary Science): Lower, perhaps 0.4, because his specific interests are less likely to align with other fields.

    Using Bayes Rule:
    \[
    P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
    \]
    \[
    P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{0.8 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.16}{0.16 + 0.32} = \frac{0.16}{0.48} \approx 0.33
    \]

2. **Business Administration**:
    - \(P(H)\): This is moderately high in the U.S., let’s say 0.2.
    - \(P(E|H)\): Low, as Adam's interests do not particularly align with typical business administration traits, let’s use 0.1.
    - \(P(E|\neg H)\): Higher, perhaps 0.35, because his interest set is more likely to be found outside business administration.

    Using Bayes Rule:
    \[
    P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.35 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.28} = \frac{0.02}{0.30} \approx 0.067
    \]

3. **Computer Science**:
    - \(P(H)\): High in the U.S. for graduate studies, let’s say 0.4.
    - \(P(E|H)\): Moderate, as his intelligence and knack for puzzles align, let’s say 0.5.
    - \(P(E|\neg H)\): Also moderately high, perhaps 0.45, as his interests could align with interdisciplinary fields or other sciences.

    Using Bayes Rule:
    \[
    P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.4}{0.5 \cdot 0.4 + 0.45 \cdot 0.6} = \frac{0.20}{0.20 + 0.27} = \frac{0.20}{0.47} \approx 0.426
    \]

So, the probabilities based on our values and using Bayes Rule are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.33,
  "business administration": 0.067,
  "computer science": 0.426
}
```
