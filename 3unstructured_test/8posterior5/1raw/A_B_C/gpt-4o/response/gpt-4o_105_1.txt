To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch using Bayes' theorem, we'll use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't know the exact prior probabilities and likelihoods, we have to make some educated guesses based on the information provided.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
**P(H)**: The prior probability that a graduate student is in this field. Let's assume this to be relatively low considering the wide range of possible fields.
\[ P(H) \approx 0.05 \]

**P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is in this field. Since his interests align well with nature and animals, let's assume this to be high.
\[ P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \]

**P(E|¬H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in this field. Given his strong alignment with the field, this will be lower.
\[ P(E|¬H) \approx 0.1 \]

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) \text{ being the same for all fields relative comparisons only} \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.05 \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.04 \]

### Computer Science
**P(H)**: The prior probability that a graduate student is in this field. Assuming this is high because computer science is a popular field.
\[ P(H) \approx 0.3 \]

**P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is in this field. His love for solving puzzles and high intelligence fits well, though not perfect.
\[ P(E|H) \approx 0.4 \]

**P(E|¬H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given he is not in this field. This will be slightly higher.
\[ P(E|¬H) \approx 0.2 \]

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.3}{ P(E) } \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.4 \times 0.3 \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.12 \]

### Business Administration
**P(H)**: The prior probability that a graduate student is in this field. A moderate probability considering its popularity.
\[ P(H) \approx 0.2 \]

**P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is in this field. This personality doesn't strongly align with business admin traits.
\[ P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \]

**P(E|¬H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given he is not in this field. This should be slightly higher.
\[ P(E|¬H) \approx 0.2 \]

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.2 \times 0.2 \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.04 \]

### Final Probability Estimates
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.04,
  "computer science": 0.12,
  "business administration": 0.04
}
```

These values provide a relative sense of the likelihood for each field based on Adam's personality sketch. Note that these probabilities don’t sum to 1 since we’re not considering the full exhaustive set of possible fields.
