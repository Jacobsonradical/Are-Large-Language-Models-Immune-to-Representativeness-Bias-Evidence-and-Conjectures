To determine the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll need to make some reasonable assumptions for the probabilities \( P(H) \) (the prior probability that Adam could be in each field), \( P(E|H) \) (the likelihood that Adam's personality sketch fits someone in that field), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) (the likelihood that Adam's personality sketch fits someone not in that field). For simplicity, we assume equal priors for each field since we lack exact data.

Let's denote:
- \( H_1 \) as Adam being enrolled in business administration,
- \( H_2 \) as Adam being enrolled in computer science,
- \( H_3 \) as Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Given assumptions:
- \( P(H_1) = P(H_2) = P(H_3) \approx 0.33 \) (assuming equal priors).
- We'll assess \( P(E|H) \) based on how well Adam's personality traits fit each field.
- \( P(E) = P(E|H_1)P(H_1) + P(E|H_2)P(H_2) + P(E|H_3)P(H_3) \)

Now, let's reason about the likelihoods:
- Business administration: Adam's traits like empathy and puzzle-solving might fit less well compared to other fields as business administration might prioritize different skills.
  - \( P(E|H_1) \approx 0.1 \)
- Computer science: Adam has high intelligence, likes solving puzzles, and understands abstract concepts, which align well with CS.
  - \( P(E|H_2) \approx 0.5 \)
- Agricultural and veterinary science: Adam has a strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for nature, which are strong fits for this field.
  - \( P(E|H_3) \approx 0.7 \)
- The general fit \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 + 0.1 + 0.2 \div 3 \) (average fit for other unspecified fields for not being too extreme).

Now, we compute using Bayesâ€™ theorem:

For business administration:
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.33}{0.1 \cdot 0.33 + 0.5 \cdot 0.33 + 0.7 \cdot 0.33} \approx \frac{0.033}{0.433} \approx 0.076 \]

For computer science:
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.33}{0.433} \approx \frac{0.165}{0.433} \approx 0.381 \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H_3|E) = \frac{P(E|H_3) \cdot P(H_3)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.33}{0.433} \approx \frac{0.231}{0.433} \approx 0.533 \]

Thus, the probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": "0.076",
  "computer science": "0.381",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.533"
