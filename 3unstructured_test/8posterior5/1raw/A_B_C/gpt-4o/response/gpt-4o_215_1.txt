To compute \(P(H|E)\) for each field using Bayes' rule, we use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we are looking at multiple fields, we'll assess \(P(H)\), \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E | \neg H)\) for each field and then compute the posterior probabilities.

### Step-by-step computation:

1. **Prior Probability, \(P(H)\)**:
   - There are many fields a graduate student can study, so let's assume a uniform prior. Since there are three fields in this analysis, we might assign equal prior probabilities for simplicity:
     \[
     P(H_{\text{computer science}}) = P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = \frac{1}{3}
     \]

2. **Likelihood, \(P(E|H)\)**:
   - **Computer Science**: Adam's personality sketch shows strong abstract thinking, empathy, and puzzle-solving skills, which may be relevant but are not typical stereotypes of computer science students. Let's assume:
     \[
     P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.3
     \]

   - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: His interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as strong empathy, align well with this field:
     \[
     P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.8
     \]

   - **Business Administration**: A typical business administration student might not necessarily fit Adam's personality sketch, especially regarding nature and animals, but abstract thinking might apply:
     \[
     P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.2
     \]

3. **Marginal Probability, \(P(E)\)**:
   We find \(P(E)\) as the sum of the weighted likelihoods across all hypotheses:
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}}) + P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) + P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}})
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.333) + (0.8 \cdot 0.333) + (0.2 \cdot 0.333) = 0.1 + 0.267 + 0.067 = 0.434
   \]

4. **Posterior Probability, \(P(H|E)\)**:
   - **Computer Science**:
     \[
     P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.333}{0.434} \approx 0.23
     \]

   - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
     \[
     P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.333}{0.434} \approx 0.61
     \]

   - **Business Administration**:
     \[
     P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.333}{0.434} \approx 0.15
     \]

Final result:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.23,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.61,
  "business administration": 0.15
}
