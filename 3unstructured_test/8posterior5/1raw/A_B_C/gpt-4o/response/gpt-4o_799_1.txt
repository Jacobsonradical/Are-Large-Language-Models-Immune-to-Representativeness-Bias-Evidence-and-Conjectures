To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis (field of study), we can use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where 
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (the probability that Adam is enrolled in that field before considering the personality sketch).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood (the probability of observing Adam's personality given that he is enrolled in that field).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of the evidence (the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch, regardless of the field of study).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in the specified field.

Because we don't have exact numerical values, we will estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) based on reasonable assumptions.

### Computer Science
- \( P(H) \): Likely moderate, as computer science is a popular field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Likely low to moderate, Adam's love for nature and animals doesn't strongly align with computer science, but his intelligence and problem-solving skills do.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likely moderate since many other fields may share the problem-solving skillset without the mismatch of interest.

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): Likely moderate to high, it's a very common field of study.
- \( P(E|H) \): Likely low, Adam's curiosity about nature and empathy don't align strongly with business administration.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likely moderate to high, other fields align better with his personality traits.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): Likely lower than business, but not insignificant since agricultural and veterinary sciences are specialized fields.
- \( P(E|H) \): Likely high, Adam's interest in nature, empathy, and love for animals strongly align with this field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likely low to moderate, few other fields would fit his personality as well.

Estimated Numerical Values:
- \( P(H) = \{ \text{Computer Science}: 0.3, \text{Business Administration}: 0.4, \text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}: 0.2 \} \)
- \( P(E|H) = \{ \text{Computer Science}: 0.3, \text{Business Administration}: 0.2, \text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}: 0.8 \} \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Let's assume 0.5 for a broad distribution 

Using Bayes Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \), for simplicity, we could assume \( P(E) = \sum P(E|H_i)P(H_i) \) (considering the probabilistic context).

{
  "computer science": \( \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.3}{0.3 \cdot 0.3 + 0.2 \cdot 0.4 + 0.8 \cdot 0.2} = \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.08 + 0.16} \approx 0.23 \),
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.4}{0.3 \cdot 0.3 + 0.2 \cdot 0.4 + 0.8 \cdot 0.2} = \frac{0.08}{0.09 + 0.08 + 0.16} \approx 0.20 \),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{0.3 \cdot 0.3 + 0.2 \cdot 0.4 + 0.8 \cdot 0.2} = \frac{0.16}{0.09 + 0.08 + 0.16} \approx 0.40 \)
