To calculate \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need the following:

- \(P(H)\): The prior probability of being enrolled in each field.
- \(P(E|H)\): The probability of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given enrollment in the field \(H\).
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given enrollment in any field other than \(H\).

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

It's difficult to provide exact numeric values without detailed data, but we can make educated guesses based on typical traits associated with each field and the sketch provided.

1. **Computer Science**:
   - \(P(H_{CS})\): Computer science is a very common graduate field; let's assume 0.2.
   - \(P(E|H_{CS})\): Given the personality sketch, Adam seems more inclined towards fields involving nature and animals rather than computer science, so let's assign a lower probability, say 0.2.
   - \(P(E|\neg H_{CS})\): This would be high as \(E\) could apply to many other fields, say 0.95.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \(P(H_{AV})\): Less common than computer science, let's assume 0.1.
   - \(P(E|H_{AV})\): High probability given Adam's love for nature and animals, say 0.8.
   - \(P(E|\neg H_{AV})\): Moderate probability as \(E\) fits well with this field, say 0.6.

3. **Business Administration**:
   - \(P(H_{BA})\): Another common graduate field, let's assume 0.15.
   - \(P(E|H_{BA})\): Lower probability given that business administration doesn’t strongly align with Adam’s sketch, say 0.1.
   - \(P(E|\neg H_{BA})\): High probability as \(E\) fits better elsewhere, say 0.9.

To simplify, assume \(P(E) \approx 1\) (normalizing factor since we're directly comparing):

Using the above information:

For Computer Science (\(CS\)):
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{1} = 0.04 \]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science (\(AV\)):
\[ P(H_{AV}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AV}) \cdot P(H_{AV})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{1} = 0.08 \]

For Business Administration (\(BA\)):
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{1} = 0.015 \]

Here is the final output:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.04,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08,
  "business administration": 0.015
}
```

Note that these probabilities are qualitative rather than quantitative, illustrating that Adam’s personality sketch makes it more likely for him to be in Agricultural and Veterinary Science compared to Computer Science or Business Administration.
