Sure, let's analyze each field for Adam given his personality sketch and the process described.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in this field based on general statistics and the number of students in this field. Let's assume a rough prior of 0.1 given that agricultural and veterinary sciences tend to have a moderate number of students.
   - **P(E|H):** The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his love for nature, plants, animals, strong empathy, and warm heart, this is quite high. Let's estimate it at 0.8.
   - **P(E|¬H):** The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Considering that his traits align well with this field, it might be significantly lower. Let's estimate it at 0.2.

2. **Business Administration**
   - **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration. Business administration is a very common field, so let's assume a prior of around 0.2.
   - **P(E|H):** The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is enrolled in business administration. Given his interest in nature, puzzles, empathy, etc., doesn't align strongly with business administration. Let's estimate it at 0.2.
   - **P(E|¬H):** The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is not enrolled in business administration. This could be higher since his characteristics fit more other fields better. Let's estimate it at 0.6.

3. **Computer Science**
   - **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science. Computer science is also quite common. Let's use a prior of 0.2.
   - **P(E|H):** The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is enrolled in computer science. His enjoyment of solving puzzles and his high intelligence apply well here, though his interests in nature and animals don't align as well. Let's estimate it at 0.4.
   - **P(E|¬H):** The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is not enrolled in computer science. Let's estimate it similarly at around 0.4.

Now let's calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

Let's compute the posteriors:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
1. \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9} \)
2. \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.18} \)
3. \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \approx 0.3077 \)

### Business Administration:
1. \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.2 \cdot 0.2 + 0.6 \cdot 0.8} \)
2. \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.48} \)
3. \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.52} \approx 0.0769 \)

### Computer Science:
1. \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8} \)
2. \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.32} \)
3. \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.40} \approx 0.20 \)

Thus, the final probabilities would be:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3077,
  "business administration": 0.0769,
  "computer science": 0.20
}
```

These values are indicative of the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in each respective field based on his personality traits and the given priors.
