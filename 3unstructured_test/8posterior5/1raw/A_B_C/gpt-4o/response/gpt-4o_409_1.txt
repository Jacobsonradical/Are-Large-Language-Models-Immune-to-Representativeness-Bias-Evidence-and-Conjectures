To use Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the following:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each specific field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam’s personality sketch given he is enrolled in each specific field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam’s personality sketch given he is not enrolled in each specific field.
4. \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in each specific field given his personality sketch.

Bayes' rule states that:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

We need to make some reasonable assumptions to proceed:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**\[ P(H_{AVS}) \]: Since Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, and a love for animals, we can assume a relatively higher probability.

2. **Business Administration**\[ P(H_{BA}) \]: Since Adam appears to have a warm heart, strong empathy (traits not typically aligned with business administration), we can assume a lower probability.

3. **Computer Science**\[ P(H_{CS}) \]: Given his high intelligence and aptitude for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, we can assume a moderate probability.

Let's assign approximate values based on these assumptions:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- \( P(H_{AVS}) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|H_{AVS}) = 0.7 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \approx 0.4 \)

### Business Administration

- \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \approx 0.5 \)

### Computer Science

- \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.6 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \approx 0.5 \)

### Calculation:

First, we will calculate \( P(E) \) assuming \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) \) for simplicity:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H)) \]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[ P(E)_{AVS} = (0.7 \cdot 0.3) + (0.4 \cdot 0.7) \]
\[ P(E)_{AVS} = 0.21 + 0.28 = 0.49 \]

For Business Administration:

\[ P(E)_{BA} = (0.2 \cdot 0.2) + (0.5 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E)_{BA} = 0.04 + 0.4 = 0.44 \]

For Computer Science:

\[ P(E)_{CS} = (0.6 \cdot 0.3) + (0.5 \cdot 0.7) \]
\[ P(E)_{CS} = 0.18 + 0.35 = 0.53 \]

Now, applying Bayes’ rule:

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)_{AVS}} \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.3}{0.49} = \frac{0.21}{0.49} \approx 0.429 \]

For Business Administration:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)_{BA}} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.44} = \frac{0.04}{0.44} \approx 0.091 \]

For Computer Science:

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)_{CS}} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.3}{0.53} = \frac{0.18}{0.53} \approx 0.34 \]

So, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.429,
  "business administration": 0.091,
  "computer science": 0.34
}
