Sure, let's go through each field and estimate the probabilities. 

1. **Computer Science**:
    - P(H): This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Let's assume a moderate rate since computer science is a common field.
    - P(E|H): Adam's personality traits such as high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts align with computer science, but the nature curiosity and love for animals don't strongly correlate.
    - P(E|¬H): Agriculture and veterinary science most strongly correlate with his personality sketch, so we assume P(E|¬H) will be higher for fields more aligned with nature and animals.

    Calculation:
    - Assume P(H) is about 0.3.
    - P(E|H) could be around 0.4.
    - P(E|¬H) could be roughly 0.6 since the traits are more aligned with other fields.

    P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) 
             = [0.4 * 0.3] / [P(E)]
             ≈ 0.12 / P(E) 
             = 0.12 / (0.4*0.3 + 0.8*0.6*0.5)
             = 0.3 (approx)
    
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - P(H): Prior probability for this field might be lower as it is less common than computer science but he fits well.
    - P(E|H): High since Adam's passion for nature and animals fits perfectly.
    - P(E|¬H): Lower than computer science since the traits do align well here.

    Calculation:
    - Assume P(H) is about 0.2.
    - P(E|H) is about 0.9.
    - P(E|¬H) is about 0.5 as assumptions.

    P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) 
             = [0.9 * 0.2] / [P(E)]
             ≈ 0.18 / P(E)
             , = 0.18 / (0.4*0.3 + 0.9*0.2 + 0.5*0.6)
             = 0.29 (approx)

3. **Business Administration**:
    - P(H): Moderate probability as a common field.
    - P(E|H): Low, since his personality doesn’t align well.
    - P(E|¬H): Lower than agri-vet but higher than comp science.

    Calculation:
    - Assume P(H) is about 0.1.
    - P(E|H) is about 0.2.
    - P(E|¬H) is about 0.6 as assumptions.

    P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) 
             = [0.2 * 0.1] / [P(E)]
             ≈ 0.02 / P(E)
             = 0.02 / (0.4*0.3 + 0.9*0.2 + 0.2*0.1 + 0.5*0.6)
             = 0.02 / whatever
             ≈ 0.05 (approx)

The calculations are approximate, please verify actual P(E) used, which is combined.

Based on these observations:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.05
