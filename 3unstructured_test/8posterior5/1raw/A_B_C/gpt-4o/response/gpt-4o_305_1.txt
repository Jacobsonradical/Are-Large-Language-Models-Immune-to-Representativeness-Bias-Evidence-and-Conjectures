Let's denote the relevant fields as \( C \) for computer science, \( A \) for agricultural and veterinary science, and \( B \) for business administration. Based on the information provided, we will estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field, then use Bayes' Rule to compute \( P(H|E) \).

**For Computer Science (C):**

- **P(H):** Computer science is a common graduate field. Let's assume \( P(C) = 0.2 \).

- **P(E|H):** While computer science students can certainly have empathy, a love for animals, and enjoy solving puzzles, the description doesn't directly align strongly with typical computer science interests. Let's assume \( P(E|C) = 0.3 \).

- **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of Adam having these traits given that he is not in computer science is relatively high due to their general nature. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg C) = 0.7 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[
P(C|E) = \frac{P(E|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.06}{P(E)}
\]

**For Agricultural and Veterinary Science (A):**

- **P(H):** Agricultural and veterinary science is a less common field but aligns well with Adam's interests in nature, plants, and animals. Let's assume \( P(A) = 0.1 \).

- **P(E|H):** The personality sketch strongly fits this field. Let's assign \( P(E|A) = 0.8 \).

- **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of Adam having these traits given that he is not in agricultural and veterinary science is moderate. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg A) = 0.5 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[
P(A|E) = \frac{P(E|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.08}{P(E)}
\]

**For Business Administration (B):**

- **P(H):** Business administration is a common graduate field. Let's assume \( P(B) = 0.3 \).

- **P(E|H):** The personality traits described do not strongly correlate with the typical interests of business administration students. Let's assume \( P(E|B) = 0.1 \).

- **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of Adam having these traits given that he is not in business administration is relatively high. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg B) = 0.6 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[
P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} = \frac{0.03}{P(E)}
\]

Given these probabilities, we approximate:

\[
P(E) \approx P(E|C) \cdot P(C) + P(E|A) \cdot P(A) + P(E|B) \cdot P(B)
\]

\[
P(E) \approx (0.3 \cdot 0.2) + (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.1 \cdot 0.3) = 0.06 + 0.08 + 0.03 = 0.17
\]

Thus, we can refine our calculations:

\[
P(C|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.17} \approx 0.35
\]

\[
P(A|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.17} \approx 0.47
\]

\[
P(B|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.17} \approx 0.18
\]

So the final answers are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.35,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.47,
  "business administration": 0.18
}
```
