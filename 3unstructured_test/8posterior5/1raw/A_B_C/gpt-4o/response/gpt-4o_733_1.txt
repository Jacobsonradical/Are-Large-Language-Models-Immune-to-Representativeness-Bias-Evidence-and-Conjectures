Sure! Let's analyze the likelihood and prior probabilities for each hypothesis, and then compute the posterior probabilities using Bayes' rule.

Given:
- \( P(H) \): Probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was not in that field.
- \( P(H|E) \): Posterior probability of Adam being in that field given his personality sketch.

### 1. Computer Science

#### Assumptions:

- \( P(H) \): Let's assume the prior probability of Adam being in computer science is 0.2.
- \( P(E|H) \): Adam's traits such as high intelligence, abstract thinking, and puzzle-solving fit computer science fairly well, let's estimate this as 0.3.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): These traits are generally beneficial for other fields as well, estimating this as 0.15.

#### Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.3 \times 0.2) + (0.15 \times 0.8) = 0.06 + 0.12 = 0.18 \]

So,

\[ P(H|E)_{cs} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.18} = \frac{0.06}{0.18} = \frac{1}{3} = 0.333 \]

### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

#### Assumptions:

- \( P(H) \): Let's assume the prior probability of Adam being in agricultural and veterinary science is 0.1.
- \( P(E|H) \): Adam's traits like a love for nature, empathy for animals, and appreciation for hard work fit very well, let's estimate this as 0.5.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): These specific traits might not be as common in other fields, estimating this as 0.05.

#### Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.5 \times 0.1) + (0.05 \times 0.9) = 0.05 + 0.045 = 0.095 \]

So,

\[ P(H|E)_{agv} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.1}{0.095} = \frac{0.05}{0.095} \approx 0.526 \]

### 3. Business Administration

#### Assumptions:

- \( P(H) \): Let's assume the prior probability of Adam being in business administration is 0.1.
- \( P(E|H) \): Adam's traits such as warm heart, empathy, and appreciation for dedication fit poorly with business administration, let's estimate this as 0.1.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Opposite traits would perform better for this field, estimating this as 0.2.

#### Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.1) + (0.2 \times 0.9) = 0.01 + 0.18 = 0.19 \]

So,

\[ P(H|E)_{ba} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.19} = \frac{0.01}{0.19} \approx 0.053 \]
