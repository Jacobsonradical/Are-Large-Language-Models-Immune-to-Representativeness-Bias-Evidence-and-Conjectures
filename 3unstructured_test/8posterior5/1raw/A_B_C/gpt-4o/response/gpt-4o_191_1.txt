To calculate the probability of Adam being enrolled in each field given his personality sketch, we will use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch being true given that Adam is in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch being true given that Adam is not in that field.

Let's assume the following hypothetical probabilities:
- P(H) are general estimates for a graduate student in the U.S. choosing a particular field.
- P(E|H) and P(E|\neg H) are based on how well Adam's personality sketch matches typical traits associated with those fields.

### Prior Probabilities
- **P(computer science):** 0.20 (since CS is a fairly common graduate field)
- **P(business administration):** 0.15 (somewhat common)
- **P(agricultural and veterinary science):** 0.05 (less common, but still possible given the U.S. context and Adam's interests)

### Likelihoods (P(E|H) and P(E|\neg H))

**Computer Science:**
- P(E|H): Adamâ€™s genuine curiosity about nature and solving puzzles aligns moderately well with computer science curiosity and problem-solving skills.
- Estimate: 0.25
- P(E|\neg H): We need to account for the probability of these traits without being in CS, which let's estimate as a slightly lower likelihood since CS isn't the only field for problem solvers.
- Estimate: 0.15

**Business Administration:**
- P(E|H): Traits like empathy and understanding people are valuable but less common as primary traits in business administration.
- Estimate: 0.05
- P(E|\neg H): These traits would still be present generally, given their more general applicability.
- Estimate: 0.20

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- P(E|H): Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work aligns very well with this field.
- Estimate: 0.50
- P(E|\neg H): Less likely as these specific traits are strong indications towards this field.
- Estimate: 0.10

### Posterior Probabilities (P(H|E))

Let's use normalized Bayes' rule to avoid exact P(E) computations:

For **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} \propto P(E|H)_{CS} \cdot P(H)_{CS} = 0.25 \times 0.20 = 0.05 \]

For **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} \propto P(E|H)_{BA} \cdot P(H)_{BA} = 0.05 \times 0.15 = 0.0075 \]

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E)_{Agri} \propto P(E|H)_{Agri} \cdot P(H)_{Agri} = 0.50 \times 0.05 = 0.025 \]

Normalizing these:
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.05}{0.05 + 0.0075 + 0.025} \approx 0.57 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.0075}{0.05 + 0.0075 + 0.025} \approx 0.086 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{Agri} = \frac{0.025}{0.05 + 0.0075 + 0.025} \approx 0.286 \]

Thus, the estimated probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.57,
  "business administration": 0.086,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.286
}
```

These are approximations based on hypothetical priors and likelihoods. Adjusting the priors and likelihoods would change these probabilities significantly.
