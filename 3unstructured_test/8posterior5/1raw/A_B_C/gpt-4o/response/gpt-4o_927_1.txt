Let's start by estimating the probabilities and then applying Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \). Note that these are subjective estimates based on the given personality sketch.

### Computer Science

**Hypothesis (H):** Adam was enrolled in computer science.

- \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
  - For U.S. graduate students, computer science is a common field. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \) (20%).

- \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood of the personality sketch if Adam was in computer science.
  - Computer science students often have high intelligence and enjoy solving puzzles, but the strong empathy and love for animals are less typical. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \) (30%).

- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was not in computer science.
  - There are many other fields where high intelligence, puzzle-solving, empathy, and love for nature might be more common. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \) (10%).

Using Bayes' rule: 

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.1 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.08} = \frac{0.06}{0.14} \approx 0.429 \]

### Business Administration

**Hypothesis (H):** Adam was enrolled in business administration.

- \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
  - Graduate fields in business administration are also common. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15%).

- \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood of the personality sketch if Adam was in business administration.
  - Business administration is rarely associated with a love of nature and animals, though problem-solving and intelligence are relevant. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \) (10%).

- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was not in business administration.
  - In fields unrelated to business administration, the traits might be more common. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.15 \) (15%).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{0.1 \cdot 0.15 + 0.15 \cdot 0.85} = \frac{0.015}{0.015 + 0.1275} = \frac{0.015}{0.1425} \approx 0.105 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

**Hypothesis (H):** Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

- \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
  - This field is less common overall but more aligned with Adam's traits. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \) (5%).

- \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood of the personality sketch if Adam was in agricultural and veterinary science.
  - Given his traits, this field aligns very closely: curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \) (90%).

- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was not in agricultural and veterinary science.
  - The traits might be common in other fields, but less so compared to agriculture and veterinary sciences. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.25 \) (25%).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.9 \cdot 0.05 + 0.25 \cdot 0.95} = \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.2375} = \frac{0.045}{0.2825} \approx 0.159 \]

So our final estimates for \( P(H|E) \) are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.429,
  "business administration": 0.105,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.159
}
