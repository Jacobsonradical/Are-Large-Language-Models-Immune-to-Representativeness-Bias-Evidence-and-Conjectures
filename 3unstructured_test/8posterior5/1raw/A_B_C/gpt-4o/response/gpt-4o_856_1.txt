To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) through Bayes' rule, we follow these steps:

1. **Bayes' Rule**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For the given hypotheses:
- \( H_{\text{CS}} \): Adam was enrolled in Computer Science.
- \( H_{\text{BA}} \): Adam was enrolled in Business Administration.
- \( H_{\text{AVS}} \): Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

We need to estimate the following probabilities for each field:
1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of E given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of E given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.

We can start by assigning reasonable estimates.

### Computer Science
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): Computer Science is a popular field. Let's assume that 20% of graduate students are in Computer Science.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): Given the personality sketch of Adam, it's less likely for someone with a deep love for animals and strong empathy to be in Computer Science. Let's estimate this at 0.05.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \): Considering other fields could better match someone with Adam's personality sketch, let's estimate this at 0.15 (as there's a higher chance E aligns with non-computer science fields).

### Business Administration
- \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): Business Administration is also a popular field. Let's assume that 15% of graduate students are in Business Administration.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): Given Adam's traits, especially his love for nature and animals, it's unlikely. Let's estimate this at 0.02.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \): Similar to above, as more fitting fields remain likely, let's assume 0.15.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \): Agricultural and Veterinary Science is less popular than the above fields. Let's assume 5%.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \): This field aligns very well with Adam's love for nature, animals, and empathy. Let’s estimate this as quite high, at 0.8.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \): As many fields likely don’t align with E as well as Agricultural and Veterinary Science, let’s put this at 0.10.

### Using Bayes' Rule
We now compute the posterior probabilities. 

Firstly, for each field, \[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{CS}}) + \dots \]
(sum of probabilities considering all fields)

We’ll normalize P(E) for these scores:

1. **Computer Science**
   \[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.20}{0.05 \cdot 0.20 + 0.02 \cdot 0.15 + 0.8 \cdot 0.05} \]
   \[ = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.003 + 0.04} \]
   \[ = \frac{0.01}{0.053} \approx 0.1887 \]

2. **Business Administration**
   \[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.02 \cdot 0.15}{0.05 \cdot 0.20 + 0.02 \cdot 0.15 + 0.8 \cdot 0.05} \]
   \[ = \frac{0.003}{0.053} \approx 0.0566 \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   \[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.05 \cdot 0.20 + 0.02 \cdot 0.15 + 0.8 \cdot 0.05} \]
   \[ = \frac{0.04}{0.053} \approx 0.7547 \]

Thus the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.1887,
  "business administration": 0.0566,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7547
}
```

This indicates a much higher posterior probability of Adam being in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, a moderate probability in Computer Science, and low in Business Administration given the personality sketch.
