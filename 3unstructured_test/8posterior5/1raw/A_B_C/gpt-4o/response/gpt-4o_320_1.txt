To solve this problem using Bayes' theorem, we need three primary components for each hypothesis:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in that specific field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in that specific field.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \(P(E)\) is the same for all hypotheses, it becomes a normalizing constant, and we only need to compare the numerators to understand the relative probabilities. Let's break down each field:

### Computer Science
- **P(H):** Moderate (fields like computer science have a reasonable number of graduate students)
- **P(E|H):** Low to moderate (personality traits like curiosity about nature and strong empathy are less stereotypical for computer science)
- **P(E|\neg H):** We assume a baseline depending on the diversity of all other fields.

### Business Administration
- **P(H):** Moderate (fields like business administration also have a reasonable number of graduate students)
- **P(E|H):** Low (traits like a deep love for animals and curiosity about nature are less likely for business)
- **P(E|\neg H):** Same baseline assumption.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H):** Lower (fewer students compared to CS or Business)
- **P(E|H):** High (this field aligns well with Adam's interests and traits)
- **P(E|\neg H):** Same baseline assumption.

### Numerical Assumptions:

Let me denote the following values:

- **P(computer science)**: 0.3
- **P(business administration)**: 0.3
- **P(agricultural and veterinary science)**: 0.1

For **P(E|H)**, let's assume rough likelihood estimates based on matching traits:

- **P(E|computer science)**: 0.2
- **P(E|business administration)**: 0.1
- **P(E|agricultural and veterinary science)**: 0.8

For **P(E|\neg H)**, let's assume a baseline of 0.3.

### Calculation:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{\sum P(E|H_i) \cdot P(H_i)}
\]

For **Computer Science**:
\[
P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{(0.2 \cdot 0.3 + 0.1 \cdot 0.3 + 0.8 \cdot 0.1)}
= \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.03 + 0.08} = \frac{0.06}{0.17} \approx 0.353
\]

For **Business Administration**:
\[
P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.3}{(0.2 \cdot 0.3 + 0.1 \cdot 0.3 + 0.8 \cdot 0.1)}
= \frac{0.03}{0.06 + 0.03 + 0.08} = \frac{0.03}{0.17} \approx 0.176
\]

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[
P(H|E)_{AVS} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{(0.2 \cdot 0.3 + 0.1 \cdot 0.3 + 0.8 \cdot 0.1)}
= \frac{0.08}{0.06 + 0.03 + 0.08} = \frac{0.08}{0.17} \approx 0.471
\]
