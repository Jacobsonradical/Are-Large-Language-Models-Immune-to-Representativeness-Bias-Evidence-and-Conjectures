To solve this, we can use Bayes' theorem which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being in a specific field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is in that specific field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in that specific field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of Adam's personality sketch.

While we won't be able to calculate exact probabilities without concrete data, we can make educated guesses to estimate these probabilities.

### Hypothesis: Computer Science (denoted as \( H_{CS} \))
- \( P(H_{CS}) \): Probability that a random graduate student is in computer science.
  - Let's assume graduation distribution: roughly high \(\approx 0.3\)
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Probability of Adam’s personality sketch given he is in computer science.
  - Curiosity about nature and plants: Low
  - Enjoys solving puzzles: High
  - Warm heart, empathy, love for animals: Neutral/Low
  - High intelligence: High
  - Understanding and appreciation for hard work: Neutral/High
  - Estimated value: \(\approx 0.3\)
- \( P(E| \neg H_{CS}) \): Estimated to be lower than the specific likelihood.
  - \(\approx 0.03\)

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.3}{0.05} \approx 0.018 \]

### Hypothesis: Business Administration (denoted as \( H_{BA} \))
- \( P(H_{BA}) \): Probability that a random graduate student is in business administration.
  - Let's assume graduation distribution: moderate \(\approx 0.2\)
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): Probability of Adam’s personality sketch given he is in business administration.
  - Curiosity about nature and plants: Low
  - Enjoys solving puzzles: Neutral/Low
  - Warm heart, empathy, love for animals: Neutral
  - High intelligence: High
  - Understanding and appreciation for hard work: High
  - \(\approx 0.1\)
- \( P(E| \neg H_{BA}) \): 
  - \approx 0.03

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.05} \approx 0.004 \]

### Hypothesis: Agricultural and Veterinary Science (denoted as \( H_{AGV} \))
- \( P(H_{AGV}) \): Probability that a random graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science.
  - Let's assume graduation distribution: moderate \(\approx 0.1\)
- \( P(E|H_{AGV}) \): Probability of Adam’s personality sketch given he is in agricultural and veterinary science.
  - Curiosity about nature and plants: High
  - Enjoys solving puzzles: Neutral/High
  - Warm heart, empathy, love for animals: High
  - High intelligence: Neutral/High
  - Understanding and appreciation for hard work: High
  - \(\approx 0.6\)
- \( P(E| \neg H_{AGV}) \):
  - \approx 0.03

\[ P(H_{AGV}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.1}{0.05} \approx 0.12 \]

So, the updated probabilities using Bayes' rule are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.018,
  "business administration": 0.004,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.12
}
```
