To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate the following:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in the field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in the field.

Let's analyze each field one by one:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in this field is likely moderate as it is a commonly chosen field among students interested in nature, plants, and animals. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's traits, this field seems quite plausible since it aligns well with his love for nature, plants, and animals. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's traits given that he is not in this field is lower because the traits are more specific to this field. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

   Using Bayes' rule:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{0.8 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8}
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) \approx 0.4
   \]

2. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in this field is likely lower given his personality traits. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's traits, this field seems less plausible as it doesn't typically align with his love for nature and animals. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's traits given that he is not in this field may be higher. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.7 \).

   Using Bayes' rule:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.7 \cdot 0.9}
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) \approx 0.03
   \]

3. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in this field is moderate given his interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's traits, this field is somewhat plausible but not a perfect fit. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.5 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's traits given that he is not in this field is moderate. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

   Using Bayes' rule:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.5 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.8}
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) \approx 0.2
   \]

Thus, the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.03,
  "computer science": 0.2
