To solve this problem using Bayes' Rule, we need to determine the following probabilities for each field (computer science, business administration, agricultural and veterinary science):

1. P(H) - The prior probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is enrolled in the field of "H".
2. P(E|H) - The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is enrolled in the field H.
3. P(E|¬H) - The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is not enrolled in the field H.

Finally, we use Bayes' Rule to compute P(H|E), the posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in field H given the personality sketch E.

Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where,
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

Let's assign some reasonable values for these probabilities:

1. P(H) - This represents the prior probability of a randomly selected graduate student being in a particular field. Without specific data, we will assume some reasonable constant probability:
    - P(CS) = 0.25 (computer science)
    - P(BA) = 0.25 (business administration)
    - P(AVS) = 0.10 (agricultural and veterinary science)
    - P(¬CS) = 0.75
    - P(¬BA) = 0.75
    - P(¬AVS) = 0.90

2. P(E|H) - This represents the likelihood of Adam having the personality sketch given that he is enrolled in a particular field:
    - For computer science, Adam's high intelligence and skills in abstract concepts are strong matches, but his empathy and love for animals are less typical: P(E|CS) = 0.4
    - For business administration, Adam's traits are less typical, leading to a lower probability: P(E|BA) = 0.1
    - For agricultural and veterinary science, his love for animals and nature is a strong match: P(E|AVS) = 0.7

3. P(E|¬H) - This represents the likelihood of Adam having the personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in a particular field:
    - Since the majority of graduate students may not perfectly fit Adam's personality profile: 
        - P(E|¬CS) = 0.2
        - P(E|¬BA) = 0.3
        - P(E|¬AVS) = 0.3

Now, calculate P(H|E) for each field.

1. P(CS|E) = \[ \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.25}{(0.4 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75)} = \frac{0.1}{0.25} = 0.4 \]

2. P(BA|E) = \[ \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{(0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.3 \cdot 0.75)} = \frac{0.025}{0.275} ≈ 0.091 \]

3. P(AVS|E) = \[ \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.10}{(0.7 \cdot 0.10) + (0.3 \cdot 0.90)} = \frac{0.07}{0.34} ≈ 0.206 \]

So, the final results are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.091,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.206
}
```
