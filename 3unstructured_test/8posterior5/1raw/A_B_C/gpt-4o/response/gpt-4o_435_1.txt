To compute the probabilities, we will apply Bayes' theorem: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is common across all hypotheses, it can be treated as a normalizing constant. Therefore, \( P(H|E) \) is proportional to \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \). This allows us to focus on estimating \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field.

Given Adam’s traits, the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) might be distributed according to general enrollment numbers, but we can make educated guesses about them:

- For **computer science (CS)**: Probability \( P(H_{CS}) \) is relatively high due to the large number of students in this field but might not align perfectly with Adam's personality sketch.
- For **business administration (BA)**: Probability \( P(H_{BA}) \) is medium, considering it's a popular field but less likely given Adam's described personality traits.
- For **agricultural and veterinary science (AVS)**: Probability \( P(H_{AVS}) \) is lower in general compared to CS but higher given Adam's affinity with nature and animals.

### Assumptions
1. **Computer Science (CS)**
   - \( P(H_{CS}) \approx 0.3 \)
   - \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Adam's traits partly fit, giving \( P(E|H_{CS}) \approx 0.1 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \): Still reasonable because of general alignment, maybe \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \approx 0.2 \)

2. **Business Administration (BA)**
   - \( P(H_{BA}) \approx 0.2 \)
   - \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): Low fit, giving \( P(E|H_{BA}) \approx 0.05 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \): Higher than \( P(E|H_{BA}) \) due to mismatch, maybe \( P(E|\neg H_{BA}) \approx 0.3 \)

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS)**
   - \( P(H_{AVS}) \approx 0.1 \)
   - \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \): Very good fit, giving \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \approx 0.6 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \): Lower because it fits well, maybe \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \approx 0.1 \)

### Estimation of \( P(H|E) \)
Let’s normalize the probabilities as we final calculations.

1. **Computer science (CS)**
   \[
   P(H_{CS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) = 0.1 \times 0.3 = 0.03
   \]

2. **Business administration (BA)**
   \[
   P(H_{BA}|E) \propto P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) = 0.05 \times 0.2 = 0.01
   \]

3. **Agricultural and veterinary science (AVS)**
   \[
   P(H_{AVS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) = 0.6 \times 0.1 = 0.06
   \]

### Normalizing
Total = \(0.03 + 0.01 + 0.06 = 0.1\)

Normalized:
1. **Computer science (CS)**
   \[
   \frac{0.03}{0.1} = 0.3
   \]

2. **Business administration (BA)**
   \[
   \frac{0.01}{0.1} = 0.1
   \]

3. **Agricultural and veterinary science (AVS)**
   \[
   \frac{0.06}{0.1} = 0.6
   \]
