To apply Bayes' theorem, we need to estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field. Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where \( P(E) \) can be calculated as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E| \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Given there's no comprehensive data, we'll have to estimate the probabilities based on reasonable assumptions.

### Field: Business Administration
- **P(H)**: Probability of being enrolled in Business Administration. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \)
- **P(E|H)**: Given personality traits, how likely that person is in Business Administration. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.05 \) (traits don't closely match business administration typically).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability of these traits given not in Business Administration. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.95 \)

\[ P(E) = 0.05 \times 0.2 + 0.95 \times 0.8 = 0.01 + 0.76 = 0.77 \]

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.2}{0.77} \approx 0.013 \]

### Field: Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: Probability of being enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \)
- **P(E|H)**: Given traits, likely in Agri+Vet Science. Assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \) (traits match well).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability of traits if not in Agri+Vet Science. Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \)

\[ P(E) = 0.8 \times 0.1 + 0.3 \times 0.9 = 0.08 + 0.27 = 0.35 \]

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.35} \approx 0.229 \]

### Field: Computer Science
- **P(H)**: Probability of being enrolled in Computer Science. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \)
- **P(E|H)**: Given traits, likely in Computer Science. Assume \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \) (some traits match like problem-solving).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability of traits if not in Computer Science. Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.7 \)

\[ P(E) = 0.3 \times 0.2 + 0.7 \times 0.8 = 0.06 + 0.56 = 0.62 \]

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{0.62} \approx 0.097 \]
