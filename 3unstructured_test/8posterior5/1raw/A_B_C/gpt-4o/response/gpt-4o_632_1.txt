To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study, I'll use Bayes' rule:

\( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \)

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis before observing the evidence \(E\).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence \(E\) given the hypothesis \(H\).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of observing the evidence \(E\).

Since \( P(E) \) is constant across all hypotheses, it only scales our probabilities and doesn't affect the relative values of \( P(H|E) \). I'll assume some reasonable values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) based on the provided personality sketch \(E\).

### Assumptions:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Prior Probability \( P(H) \): Since it's a less common field, I'll assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Since Adam's personality sketch aligns well with this field (curiosity about nature, love for animals), \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).
   - Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the personality sketch occurring outside this field might be moderate, \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Prior Probability \( P(H) \): More common field, let's say \( P(H) = 0.3 \).
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Lower fit with Adam's personality and interests, \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
   - Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \): Higher chance the personality would align outside business, \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.7 \).

3. **Computer Science**:
   - Prior Probability \( P(H) \): Also a common field, \( P(H) = 0.3 \).
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): While his skills in solving puzzles and intelligence are a good fit, the nature/animal interest is less aligned. \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).
   - Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \): Moderate, \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \).

### Computing Posterior Probabilities:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:

\( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.09}{P(E)} \)

2. **Business Administration**:

\( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} = \frac{0.03}{P(E)} \)

3. **Computer Science**:

\( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} = \frac{0.09}{P(E)} \)

### Normalizing (assuming total must add up to 1):

Although the total doesn't have to add up to 1, for clarity, let's find the normalization constant \( P(E) \):

\( P(E) = 0.09 + 0.03 + 0.09 = 0.21 \)

### Posterior Probabilities:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:

\( P(H|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.21} \approx 0.4286 \)

2. **Business Administration**:

\( P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.21} \approx 0.1429 \)

3. **Computer Science**:

\( P(H|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.21} \approx 0.4286 \)

Thus, the updated values for each field are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4286,
  "business administration": 0.1429,
  "computer science": 0.4286
}
