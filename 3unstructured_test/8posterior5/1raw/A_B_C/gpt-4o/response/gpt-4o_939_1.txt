To determine the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given Adam's personality sketch (E), we'll use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam’s described personality traits assuming he is in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's described personality traits assuming he is not in that field.
- \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \) is the total probability of observing Adam’s described personality traits.

Let’s assume some fairly generic priors and likelihoods:

1. Business Administration:
   - \( P(H) = 0.2 \) (assuming business might be a fairly common field for graduate students)
   - \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \) (Adam's traits do not strongly align with typical business administration students)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \)

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{(0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.4 \cdot 0.8)} = \frac{0.02}{0.34} \approx 0.059 \]

2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
   - \( P(H) = 0.1 \) (less common field, especially as compared to business administration)
   - \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \) (Adam's traits align closely with this field)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \)

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{(0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.4 \cdot 0.9)} = \frac{0.08}{0.44} \approx 0.182 \]

3. Computer Science:
   - \( P(H) = 0.3 \) (fairly common field for graduate students)
   - \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \) (intelligence and problem-solving suggest a fit, but heart and empathy are less relevant)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \)

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{(0.4 \cdot 0.3) + (0.4 \cdot 0.7)} = \frac{0.12}{0.4} = 0.3 \]

Consolidating these calculations into the requested format:

{
  "business administration": 0.059,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.182,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

Please note these values are estimations based on assumed probabilities for illustration purposes. In practice, the exact probabilities would require specific data and more precise assumptions about the distribution of personality traits among different fields.
