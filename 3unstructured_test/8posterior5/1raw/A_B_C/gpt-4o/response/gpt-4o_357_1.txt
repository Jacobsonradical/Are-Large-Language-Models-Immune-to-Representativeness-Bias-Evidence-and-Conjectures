To compute \( P(H|E) \) through Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood of the evidence given that Adam is not in the field \( P(E|\neg H) \). Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Given the description of Adam, the likelihood of each field (P(H)) might vary:
- Computer Science (CS) typically involves high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts, but it might not strongly align with a deep love for animals and nature.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS) aligns well with a deep love for animals, nature, and plants, as well as empathy.
- Business Administration (BA) does not strongly align with Adam's characteristics, especially his curiosity about nature and love for animals.

Assumptions for prior probabilities \( P(H) \) can be roughly estimated:
- P(CS): 0.3
- P(AVS): 0.1
- P(BA): 0.4
- P(Other): 0.2

Let’s estimate the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \):
- P(E|CS) might be moderate due to Adam’s intelligence, but lower due to his interests in nature and animals.
- P(E|AVS) would be high, aligned with his love for nature, empathy, and animals.
- P(E|BA) would be low as it does not fit well with Adam's personality traits.

Assuming approximate values:
- P(E|CS): 0.4
- P(E|AVS): 0.9
- P(E|BA): 0.1

Assuming the evidence given he is not in the field \( P(E|\neg H) \):
- P(E|\neg CS): Considering his characteristics don't strongly align with CS, it would lead to a higher P(E|\neg CS).
- P(E|\neg AVS): Lower, as AVS strongly aligns with his characteristics.
- P(E|\neg BA): Higher, as BA doesn’t fit well with his characteristics.

Assuming rough values here as well:
- P(E|\neg CS): 0.6
- P(E|\neg AVS): 0.3
- P(E|\neg BA): 0.8

For each field, calculate through Bayes' rule:

\[
P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(E|\neg \text{CS}) \cdot P(\neg \text{CS})}
\]

\[
P(\text{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{AVS}) \cdot P(\text{AVS})}{P(E|\text{AVS}) \cdot P(\text{AVS}) + P(E|\neg \text{AVS}) \cdot P(\neg \text{AVS})}
\]

\[
P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{BA}) \cdot P(\text{BA})}{P(E|\text{BA}) \cdot P(\text{BA}) + P(E|\neg \text{BA}) \cdot P(\neg \text{BA})}
\]

Substituting values:

\[
P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.3}{(0.4 \times 0.3) + (0.6 \times 0.7)} = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.42} = \frac{0.12}{0.54} \approx 0.222
\]

\[
P(\text{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.1}{(0.9 \times 0.1) + (0.3 \times 0.9)} = \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.27} = \frac{0.09}{0.36} \approx 0.25
\]

\[
P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.4}{(0.1 \times 0.4) + (0.8 \times 0.6)} = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.48} = \frac{0.04}{0.52} \approx 0.077
\]

Hence, the probabilities are roughly:

{
  "computer science": 0.222,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.25,
  "business administration": 0.077
}
