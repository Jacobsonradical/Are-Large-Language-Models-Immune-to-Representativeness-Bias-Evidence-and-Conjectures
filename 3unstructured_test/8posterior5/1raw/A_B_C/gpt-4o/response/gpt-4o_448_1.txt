To calculate P(H|E) for each field, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem, which is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We don't have the exact values of \( P(H) \) (the prior probability of each field) or \( P(E) \) (the overall probability of Adam’s personality sketch), but we can make educated estimates.

First, let's estimate the priors \( P(H) \):
- \( P(\text{business administration}) \): Business administration is fairly common, but not as directly related to Adam's interests. Let's assign a moderate prior: 0.2.
- \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \): This field aligns well with Adam’s interests, making it a strong candidate. A higher prior: 0.3.
- \( P(\text{computer science}) \): Computer science is common and is a potential fit for someone who enjoys solving puzzles and understands abstract concepts. Moderate prior: 0.2.

For simplicity, we'll assume that the remaining fields sum to 0.3 (so \( P(E) = 1 \)).

Now let's estimate \( P(E|H) \), the likelihood of Adam's personality given each field:
- \( P(E|\text{business administration}) \): Lower likelihood, as business administration may not typically attract those deeply interested in nature, animals, and puzzles. Let's assign: 0.2.
- \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \): High likelihood, as this field directly aligns with Adam's interests. Let's assign: 0.6.
- \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \): Moderate likelihood, as interest in puzzles and abstract thinking fits, but not as closely related to nature and animals. Let's assign: 0.3.

Finally, we estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \):
We need a rough average of how likely Adam’s personality sketch is if he is not in these fields. Let's assume:
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Now we apply Bayes' theorem to calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[
\begin{align*}
P(\text{business administration} | E) &= \frac{P(E | \text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{1} = 0.04 \\
P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science} | E) &= \frac{P(E | \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.3}{1} = 0.18 \\
P(\text{computer science} | E) &= \frac{P(E | \text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{1} = 0.06 \\
\end{align*}
\]

So we can write our answer as follows:

\[
{
  "business administration": 0.04,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.18,
  "computer science": 0.06
}
\]
