To find the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each of the fields of specialization, we will use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the fields of graduate study being assessed, we need to estimate prior probabilities \( P(H) \), likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood of observing the evidence \( P(E|\neg H) \).

### **1. Business Administration**
- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Moderate, as Business Administration is a common graduate field.
  - \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \)
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Low, as the personality traits described (curiosity about nature, love for animals) are less likely to be associated with this field.
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \)
- **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is the likelihood of observing the evidence given any other field.
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.9 \) (because the traits fit better with non-business fields)

### **2. Computer Science**
- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: High, as Computer Science is a very common and growing graduate field.
  - \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \)
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Medium, as some traits (high intelligence, good at solving puzzles) align well with this field, but others (love for animals, curiosity about nature) do not.
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.4 \)
- **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: 
  -  \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.6 \) (because these traits better align with non-computer science fields, though still somewhat fitting)

### **3. Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Moderate, given it matches some components strongly but is less common.
  - \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \)
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: High, as the personality traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals) are strongly aligned with this field.
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \)
- **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: 
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \) (as other fields are less likely to align with these specific traits)

### **Posterior Probabilities Calculation**

Let's assume \( P(E) = 1 \) to simplify the calculation (normalization can be done later if needed).

#### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.9} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.9} \approx 0.022 \]

#### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{0.6} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.6} \approx 0.2 \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.5} \approx \frac{0.08}{0.5} \approx 0.16 \]

Final results formatted as requested:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.022,
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.16
}
```

These are the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) based on the given evidence and priors.
