Based on the personality sketch of Adam and the provided fields, let's analyze the probabilities step by step.

1. **Prior probability \( P(H) \)**:
   1. **business administration (BA)**: Let's estimate 0.1 (since BA is a common graduate field but doesn't align well with Adam's interests).
   2. **agricultural and veterinary science (AVS)**: Let's estimate 0.2 (as it aligns well with his love for nature, plants, and animals).
   3. **computer science (CS)**: Let's estimate 0.2 (as it aligns well with his intelligence and interest in solving puzzles).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   1. **business administration**: Let's estimate 0.1 (since his traits don’t strongly match BA).
   2. **agricultural and veterinary science**: Let's estimate 0.9 (since his traits strongly align with the field).
   3. **computer science**: Let's estimate 0.6 (since his traits partially match CS but not entirely).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   The likelihood of observing E given that Adam is not enrolled in field H.

   1. **business administration**: Let’s estimate 0.6 (assuming most other fields are not highly aligned with the personality sketch).
   2. **agricultural and veterinary science**: Let’s estimate 0.2 (since the majority of other fields don’t align well with the sketch).
   3. **computer science**: Let’s estimate 0.4 (since some other fields might also align reasonably well).

Using Bayes’ Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \)

Now, let's calculate the posterior probabilities:

### Business Administration (BA)

\[ P(E|BA) = 0.1 \]
\[ P(H) = 0.1 \]
\[ P(E|\neg BA) = 0.6 \]
\[ P(\neg BA) = 0.9 \]

\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.1) + (0.6 \cdot 0.9) = 0.01 + 0.54 = 0.55 \]

\[ P(BA|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.55} \approx 0.0182 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS)

\[ P(E|AVS) = 0.9 \]
\[ P(H) = 0.2 \]
\[ P(E|\neg AVS) = 0.2 \]
\[ P(\neg AVS) = 0.8 \]

\[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.2) + (0.2 \cdot 0.8) = 0.18 + 0.16 = 0.34 \]

\[ P(AVS|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.2}{0.34} \approx 0.5294 \]

### Computer Science (CS)

\[ P(E|CS) = 0.6 \]
\[ P(H) = 0.2 \]
\[ P(E|\neg CS) = 0.4 \]
\[ P(\neg CS) = 0.8 \]

\[ P(E) = (0.6 \cdot 0.2) + (0.4 \cdot 0.8) = 0.12 + 0.32 = 0.44 \]

\[ P(CS|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{0.44} \approx 0.2727 \]

Here are the results:

{
  "business administration": 0.0182,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5294,
  "computer science": 0.2727
