Let's break the problem down step by step and use Bayes' rule to find the desired probabilities in the format requested.

First, we need to understand what information we have and what we need to calculate.

### Definitions:
E = Personality sketch of Adam.
H = Hypothesis that Adam was in a specific field (business administration, agricultural and veterinary science, computer science).

### Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

- \(P(H)\): Prior probability that Adam was in a specific field.
- \(P(E|H)\): Probability of observing the sketch E given H.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): Probability of observing the sketch E given not H (any other field).
- \(P(E)\): Overall probability of observing the sketch E.

For simplicity, let's assume:
1. Each field is equally likely before considering the sketch E, so \( P(H) = P(\neg H) = \frac{1}{n} \), where \( n \) is the number of fields we're considering. Here \( n = 3 \).

Let's assign reasonable estimates:

- Business Administration: Adam's traits don't strongly align with typical traits expected in business administration (quiet, empathetic, love for nature and animals). So, \(P(E| H_{business})\) is likely to be low.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Adam's traits strongly align with this field (love for nature, animals, empathy). So, \(P(E| H_{agricultural})\) is likely very high.
- Computer Science: Adam's traits somewhat align with this field (intelligence, puzzle-solving, understanding abstract concepts), but not perfectly. So, \(P(E| H_{computer})\) is moderate.

These assignments will help us calculate \( P(H|E) \).

Here are our estimates:

#### Business Administration:
- \( P(H_{business}) = \frac{1}{3} \)
- \( P(E|H_{business}) \approx 0.1 \)

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- \( P(H_{agricultural}) = \frac{1}{3} \)
- \( P(E|H_{agricultural}) \approx 0.8 \)

#### Computer Science:
- \( P(H_{computer}) = \frac{1}{3} \)
- \( P(E|H_{computer}) \approx 0.5 \)

To estimate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{business}) \cdot P(H_{business}) + P(E|H_{agricultural}) \cdot P(H_{agricultural}) + P(E|H_{computer}) \cdot P(H_{computer}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.1 \cdot \frac{1}{3} + 0.8 \cdot \frac{1}{3} + 0.5 \cdot \frac{1}{3} \]
\[ P(E) = \frac{0.1 + 0.8 + 0.5}{3} \]
\[ P(E) = \frac{1.4}{3} \approx 0.467 \]

Now, we compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

#### Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{business}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{business}) \cdot P(H_{business})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{business}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.467} \]
\[ P(H_{business}|E) \approx \frac{0.0333}{0.467} \]
\[ P(H_{business}|E) \approx 0.071 \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_{agricultural}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{agricultural}) \cdot P(H_{agricultural})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{agricultural}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.467} \]
\[ P(H_{agricultural}|E) \approx \frac{0.2667}{0.467} \]
\[ P(H_{agricultural}|E) \approx 0.571 \]

#### Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{computer}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{computer}) \cdot P(H_{computer})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{computer}|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.467} \]
\[ P(H_{computer}|E) \approx \frac{0.1667}{0.467} \]
\[ P(H_{computer}|E) \approx 0.357 \]

Thus, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.071,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.571,
  "computer science": 0.357
}
```

These values reflect the relative likelihoods of Adam being enrolled in each of these fields given his personality sketch.
