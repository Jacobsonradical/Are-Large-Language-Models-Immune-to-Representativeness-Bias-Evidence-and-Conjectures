To apply Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate the following probabilities for each hypothesis \( H \) (which represents Adam being enrolled in a specific field):

1. \( P(H) \) - Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
2. \( P(E|H) \) - Probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - Probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in that field.

Then, we use Bayes' rule to find \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since \( P(E) \) (the overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \)) is constant for all comparisons, we can focus on evaluating the numerators.

Let's start with reasonable estimations for the priors (\( P(H) \)):

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.2
}

Next, estimate \( P(E|H) \) for each field based on how well the personality sketch matches typical students in those programs:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4
}

For \( P(E|\neg H) \), consider the likelihood of finding someone with Adam's profile who is not in each specific field:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

Now, calculate \( P(H|E) \).

{
  "business administration": \(\frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)}\),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \(\frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)}\),
  "computer science": \(\frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)}\)
}

While the exact value of \( P(E) \) is not provided, we can compare the relative likelihoods.

{
  "business administration": \(\frac{0.02}{P(E)}\),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \(\frac{0.07}{P(E)}\),
  "computer science": \(\frac{0.08}{P(E)}\)
}

Simplifying relative values without exact \( P(E) \):

{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.07,
  "computer science": 0.08
}

However, these are the relative values. We normalize these for easier interpretation:

Sum of unnormalized probabilities: \( 0.02 + 0.07 + 0.08 = 0.17 \)

Normalized values:

{
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.02}{0.17} = 0.118 \),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{0.07}{0.17} = 0.412 \),
  "computer science": \( \frac{0.08}{0.17} = 0.471 \)
}

So, the final relative probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": 0.118,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.412,
  "computer science": 0.471
}

These values provide insight into the adjusted likelihoods based on the given personality sketch.
