To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each graduate field (computer science, agricultural and veterinary science, and business administration), we will follow the Bayesian approach. Specifically, we'll use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here's a step-by-step breakdown for each field of specialization:

### Computer Science
1. **Prior Probability (\(P(H)\))**: Given the popularity of computer science programs, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.3 \).
2. **Likelihood (\(P(E|H)\))**: The personality sketch includes traits like high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts, which are suitable for computer science. However, the sketch lacks direct indicators like a fascination with technology or programming. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).
3. **Complement Probability (\(P(E|\neg H)\))**: For non-CS given the personality sketch, it seems more likely, so let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.8 \).

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{0.2 \cdot 0.3 + 0.8 \cdot 0.7} = \frac{0.06}{0.62} \approx 0.097 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **Prior Probability (\(P(H)\))**: Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \) given it's a more specialized field.
2. **Likelihood (\(P(E|H)\))**: Adam's love for nature, animals, and empathy strongly aligns with this field. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).
3. **Complement Probability (\(P(E|\neg H)\))**: If not this, it would be unlikely to fit as well. Assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{0.9 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.09}{0.36} = 0.25 \]

### Business Administration
1. **Prior Probability (\(P(H)\))**: A common field. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.4 \).
2. **Likelihood (\(P(E|H)\))**: The traits don't strongly align with business administration. Assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
3. **Complement Probability (\(P(E|\neg H)\))**: If not business, it could fit elsewhere. Assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.7 \).

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.4}{0.1 \cdot 0.4 + 0.7 \cdot 0.6} = \frac{0.04}{0.46} \approx 0.087 \]

So, based on this Bayesian analysis, the results are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.097,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.25,
  "business administration": 0.087
}
```

Please note that these are estimations based on assumed probabilities, and exact values may vary with more detailed data.
