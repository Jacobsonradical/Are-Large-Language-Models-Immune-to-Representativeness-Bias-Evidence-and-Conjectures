To compute \( P(H|E) \) (the probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field \( H \) given the personality sketch \( E \)) through Bayes' rule, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Estimate \( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field. Since the exact probabilities aren't given, we will assume some reasonable priors based on general knowledge.

2. **Estimate \( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in \( H \).

3. **Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in \( H \).

4. **Apply Bayes' Rule**: Use the formula \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \). Note that \( P(E) \) is a normalization constant and is the same for all fields.

For the purpose of this calculation, let's assume \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \) can be approximated as follows based on common assumptions:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): 0.1 (Assume it's less common than business administration and computer science)
   - \( P(E|H) \): 0.8 (Adam's traits align really well with this field)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): 0.2 (Adam's traits are less likely outside this field)

2. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): 0.3 (Assume it's one of the more common fields)
   - \( P(E|H) \): 0.1 (Adam's personality sketch doesn't align well with this field)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): 0.4 (Adam's traits may be somewhat common outside this field)

3. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): 0.3 (Assume it's one of the more common fields)
   - \( P(E|H) \): 0.4 (Adam's intelligence and problem-solving skills fit this field relatively well)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): 0.35 (Adam's traits could also work outside this field)

Now we can use Bayes' Rule directly:

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.08}{P(E)} \]

For **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} = \frac{0.03}{P(E)} \]

For **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} = \frac{0.12}{P(E)} \]

Now, let's normalize these probabilities by dividing each by the sum of these products:

Let \( k = \frac{1}{0.08 + 0.03 + 0.12} = \frac{1}{0.23} \):

\[
\begin{aligned}
P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) & = k \cdot 0.08 = \frac{0.08}{0.23} \approx 0.348 \\
P(\text{Business Administration}|E) & = k \cdot 0.03 = \frac{0.03}{0.23} \approx 0.130 \\
P(\text{Computer Science}|E) & = k \cdot 0.12 = \frac{0.12}{0.23} \approx 0.522
\end{aligned}
\]

Thus, the final probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.348,
  "business administration": 0.130,
  "computer science": 0.522
}
