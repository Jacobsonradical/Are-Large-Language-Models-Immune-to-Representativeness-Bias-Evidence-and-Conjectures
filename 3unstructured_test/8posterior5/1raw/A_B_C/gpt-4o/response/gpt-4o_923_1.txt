To approach this problem, we'll start by estimating the probabilities for each hypothesis (P(H)), the likelihoods (P(E|H)), and the probabilities of the evidence not given the hypothesis (P(E|¬H)). Then we'll use Bayes' Rule to compute P(H|E). Here's a structured approach:

1. **P(H)** (Prior probability): We'll assign a rough guess for the likelihood of Adam being in each field before considering his personality sketch.
2. **P(E|H)** (Likelihood): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given he is in the specified field.
3. **P(E|¬H)** (Likelihood of not H): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given he is not in the specified field.

Given these probabilities, we use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Typically, without more context, P(E) can be challenging to determine exactly. However, since we are comparing relative probabilities across different fields, we can avoid computing \(P(E)\) explicitly because it will be the same denominator for each hypothesis.

### Assumptions and Estimates:

- **P(H)**: 
  - Computer science: \(P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.3\) (Assume 30% of grad students might be in this popular field)
  - Business administration: \(P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.2\) (Assume 20% in this high-demand field)
  - Agricultural and veterinary science: \(P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) = 0.1\) (Assume 10% as it’s more specialized)

- **P(E|H)**:
  - Computer science: \(P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.3\) (Moderate match due to problem-solving skills but less alignment with nature/animals)
  - Business administration: \(P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1\) (Less alignment with nature/animals and empathy, though still plausible)
  - Agricultural and veterinary science: \(P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) = 0.7\) (High match with love for animals, nature, and empathy)

- **P(E|¬H)**:
  - Computer science: \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.5\) 
  - Business administration: \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.5\)
  - Agricultural and veterinary science: \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{AgVet}}) = 0.3\)

### Applying Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \dfrac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Let's compute the relative probabilities (without normalizing since the total odds do not need to add to 1):

- **Computer science**:
  \[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto 0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09 \]

- **Business administration**:
  \[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02 \]

- **Agricultural and veterinary science**:
  \[ P(H_{\text{AgVet}}|E) \propto 0.7 \times 0.1 = 0.07 \]

Putting these relative probabilities together:

\[ 
{
  "computer science": 0.09,
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.07
}
 \]

In relative terms, while the numbers aren't probabilities that add to 1, they give a sense of likelihood with **computer science** being the highest, followed by **agricultural and veterinary science** and then **business administration**.
