To answer this question using Bayesian reasoning, we need to determine the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in that field.
4. \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field given his personality sketch.

We will use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) (the marginal likelihood) is constant for all fields, we can use a proportionality approach instead of calculating exact values. 

We will make some reasonable assumptions for these probabilities based on the provided personality sketch.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Assume a moderate prior probability since this is a specific but not exceedingly rare graduate field.
   - \( P(E|H) \): High likelihood, as Adam's characteristics (curiosity about nature, love for animals) align well with this field.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Moderate likelihood, as some of Adam's characteristics (intelligence, empathy) are not exclusive to this field.
  
2. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Assume a higher prior probability since this is a common field of study.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Moderate likelihood, as some traits (solving puzzles, high intelligence) fit well, but others (love for animals, curiosity about nature) are less relevant.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): High likelihood, as the personality traits can be commonly found in other fields as well.

3. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): Assume a high prior probability since this is a common field of study.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Low to moderate likelihood, as most traits (love for animals, curiosity about nature) do not strongly align with this field.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): High likelihood, as the traits can be applicable to many other fields.

Given these assumptions, we estimate:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These values are subjective and based on the alignment of Adam's personality traits with the typical interests and characteristics associated with these fields.
