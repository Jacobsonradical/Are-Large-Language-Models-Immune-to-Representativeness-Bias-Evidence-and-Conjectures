To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) for the given fields, we need to evaluate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Here's the breakdown for each of these fields:

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- \( P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) \): This could be high, given Adam's interests and personality. Let's denote it as 0.4.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \): Given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, this is also likely high. Let's denote it as 0.8.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AgVet}}) \): Among the options provided, if Adam was not studying AgVet, consider the likelihood of encountering such a compatible personality sketch. Since only some fields might exhibit such traits, let's set it at 0.3.

**Business Administration:**
- \( P(H_{\text{BizAdmin}}) \): Given Adam’s attributes, this feels less likely. Let's denote it as 0.1.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{BizAdmin}}) \): The personality sketch doesn’t strongly align with typical attributes of business students. Let's denote it as 0.2.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BizAdmin}}) \): This remains general to the other fields' likelihoods. Let's denote it as 0.6.

**Computer Science:**
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): Given Adam’s intelligence and abstract thinking, this could be moderately likely. Let's denote it as 0.3.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): While CS students are often intelligent and good at solving puzzles, the love for animals and nature is less aligned. Let's denote it as 0.4.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \): Similar to above. Let's denote it as 0.5.

Now, apply Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be computed for each hypothesis using:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Since we're dealing with relative probabilities and not needing to normalize completely, we can focus on relative outcomes for clarity:

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(H_{\text{AgVet}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.4}{(0.8 \cdot 0.4) + (0.3 \cdot 0.6)} \approx 0.64 \]

**Business Administration:**
\[ P(H_{\text{BizAdmin}}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{(0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.6 \cdot 0.9)} \approx 0.035 \]

**Computer Science:**
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{(0.4 \cdot 0.3) + (0.5 \cdot 0.7)} \approx 0.255 \]

Thus, the normalized probabilities for simplicity:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.64,
  "business administration": 0.035,
  "computer science": 0.255
}
