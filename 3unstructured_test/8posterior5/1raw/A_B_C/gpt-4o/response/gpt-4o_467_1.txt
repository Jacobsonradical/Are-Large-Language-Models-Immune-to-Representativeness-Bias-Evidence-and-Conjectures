Let us break down the probabilities required for Bayes' theorem.

### Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in field \(H\) given the evidence \(E\).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence \(E\) given that Adam was enrolled in field \(H\).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in field \(H\).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of observing the evidence \(E\) across all possible fields.

Let's consider each field and the required elements:

### Business Administration:
- **P(H)** for business administration: Graduate students in business administration are common, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
- **P(E|H)** for business administration: The personality traits of curiosity about nature, love for animals, and solving puzzles are less typical for business administration, \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: This is the probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is not in business administration. Considering the evidence aligns with fields other than business administration, assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.5} = 0.04 \]

### Computer Science:
- **P(H)** for computer science: Graduate students in computer science are likely common, \( P(H) = 0.25 \).
- **P(E|H)** for computer science: The traits like puzzle-solving and high intelligence align well, although love for nature and animals is less typical, \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Evidence suggests more alignment with non-computer science fields, so \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.25}{0.5} = 0.15 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- **P(H)** for agricultural and veterinary science: Less common than CS and business administration, \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
- **P(E|H)** for agricultural and veterinary science: Strong alignment with nature, animals, and empathy, \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Less likely to have such combinations in other fields, \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.3} = \frac{0.08}{0.3} \approx 0.267 \]

### Final Probabilities:
{
  "business administration": 0.04,
  "computer science": 0.15,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.267
