To compute \( P(H|E) \) for the given fields of study, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll make some informed approximations for the required probabilities.

For simplicity, let's assume: 
- \( P(H) \) for any specific field being randomly chosen is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field without additional information (say 1% or 0.01 since there are many fields of graduate studies).
- \( P(E|H) \) denotes the probability of observing Adam's personality traits given he is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) refers to the probability of observing Adam's personality traits given he is not enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality traits across all fields, which may be approximated by summing the weighted probabilities.

### Assumptions and Probabilities:
1. **Computer Science**:
   - \(P(H)\): Computers science has a high enrollment rate generally, but personality traits matching are not strong (0.01).
   - \(P(E|H)\): Traits like intelligence and solving puzzles align well, but curiosity about nature doesn't typically match (0.1).
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\): Assuming broad interest across other fields, we'll average this out (0.01).

2. **Business Administration**:
   - \(P(H)\): Business programs are also common, personality traits do not align strongly (0.01).
   - \(P(E|H)\): Curiosity about nature and empathy less common in business students (0.01).
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\): Averaging across non-business fields (0.01).

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \(P(H)\): Less common than other fields, but the traits fit well (0.005).
   - \(P(E|H)\): Strong alignment with interest in nature and animals (0.8).
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\): Less likely in general population, but still possible (0.01).

### Calculations using Bayes' Theorem:

1. **Computer Science**:
   \[
   P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{P(E|H)_{CS} \cdot P(H)_{CS}}{P(E)}
   \]

   Since \( P(E) \) is constant across all calculations:
   \[
   P(H|E)_{CS} \propto P(E|H)_{CS} \cdot P(H)_{CS} = 0.1 \cdot 0.01 = 0.001
   \]

2. **Business Administration**:
   \[
   P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{P(E|H)_{BA} \cdot P(H)_{BA}}{P(E)}
   \]

   \[
   P(H|E)_{BA} \propto P(E|H)_{BA} \cdot P(H)_{BA} = 0.01 \cdot 0.01 = 0.0001
   \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[
   P(H|E)_{AVS} = \frac{P(E|H)_{AVS} \cdot P(H)_{AVS}}{P(E)}
   \]

   \[
   P(H|E)_{AVS} \propto P(E|H)_{AVS} \cdot P(H)_{AVS} = 0.8 \cdot 0.005 = 0.004
   \]

### Rescaling to a Probability Distribution (Optional):

To provide these as probabilities adding up to 1, we could normalize these proportional values:

- Sum of proportions:
  \[
  0.001 + 0.0001 + 0.004 = 0.0051
  \]

- Normalize each:
  \[
  P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.001}{0.0051} \approx 0.196
  \]

  \[
  P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.0001}{0.0051} \approx 0.0196
  \]

  \[
  P(H|E)_{AVS} = \frac{0.004}{0.0051} \approx 0.784
  \]

### Answer:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.196,
  "business administration": 0.0196,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.784
}
```

These values represent our best estimate of Adam's likely graduate field based on his personality traits.
