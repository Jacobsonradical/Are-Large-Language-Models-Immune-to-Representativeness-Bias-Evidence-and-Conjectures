To answer the question, we'll apply Bayes' theorem, which in this context is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality given that he is in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality given that he is not in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant, we focus on the numerator of Bayes' theorem to compare \( P(H|E) \) across different hypotheses.

Let's make reasonable assumptions about the probabilities based on typical characteristics associated with each field.

1. **Business Administration**
   - \( P(H) \): Since Business Administration is a common field of graduate study, we can assume a moderate prior probability, say 0.2.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The personality traits described (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals) are less commonly associated with Business Administration, leading to a low probability, say 0.1.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): As Business Administration is broad and students could have diverse personalities, we'll assign a 0.5.

2. **Computer Science**
   - \( P(H) \): Computer Science is another common graduate field, so assume 0.2.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Intelligence and interest in solving puzzles align well with Computer Science, giving us a higher probability, say 0.7.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Similar to Business Administration, this field is broad; let's assign 0.4.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - \( P(H) \): This field is somewhat less common than Business Administration and Computer Science but still notable, so assume 0.1.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's traits strongly align with this field (nature, plants, animals), giving a high probability, say 0.9.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given the strong alignment of traits, we assume a low value, say 0.2.

Now, we use these values to apply Bayes' rule:

\[
\text{For Business Administration:} \quad P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02
\]

\[
\text{For Computer Science:} \quad P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.7 \cdot 0.2 = 0.14
\]

\[
\text{For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:} \quad P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.09
\]

Normalizing these values to sum to 1:

\[
\text{Sum} = 0.02 + 0.14 + 0.09 = 0.25
\]

\[
P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.25} = 0.08
\]

\[
P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.14}{0.25} = 0.56
\]

\[
P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.25} = 0.36
\]

Therefore:

{
  "business administration": 0.08,
  "computer science": 0.56,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.36
}
