To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, we need to follow Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is constant for all hypotheses, we only need to compare the numerators for each hypothesis to determine their relative probabilities.

Here is a step-by-step outline for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

- **P(H):** The prior probability that a random graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. This might be low compared to some other fields, but not extremely rare. Let's estimate \( P(H) \) as 0.05.
- **P(E|H):** The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is in this field. Given his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy, \( P(E|H) \) should be quite high. Let's estimate it as 0.8.
- **P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in this field. This might be fairly moderate as these traits could be seen in students from other related fields. Let's estimate it as 0.2.

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04 \]

2. **Business Administration**

- **P(H):** The prior probability that a random graduate student is in business administration. This might be relatively high given the popularity of the field. Let's estimate \( P(H) \) as 0.15.
- **P(E|H):** The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is in this field. Given his traits, this likelihood should be low as they do not typically align with business administration traits. Let's estimate it as 0.1.
- **P(E|\neg H):** This would be higher as Adam’s traits are likely more common in non-business fields. Let's estimate it as 0.4.

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.15 = 0.015 \]

3. **Computer Science**

- **P(H):** The prior probability that a random graduate student is in computer science. Similar to business administration, this could be relatively high. Let's estimate \( P(H) \) as 0.20.
- **P(E|H):** The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is in this field. Given his intelligence and affinity for solving puzzles, \( P(E|H) \) could be moderately high. Let's estimate it as 0.5.
- **P(E|\neg H):** Since different personality traits could fit this category, let’s estimate it as 0.3.

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.5 \cdot 0.20 = 0.10 \]

Finally, normalizing these values to obtain probabilities (though summing to 1 is not required here), our results are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.04,
  "business administration": 0.015,
  "computer science": 0.10
}
```

Thus, Adam is most likely enrolled in Computer Science based on his personality traits, with relatively lower but significant probabilities for Agricultural and Veterinary Science, and the lowest probability for Business Administration.
