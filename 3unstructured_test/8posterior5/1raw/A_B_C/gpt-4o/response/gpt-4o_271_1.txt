To solve this, we will estimate the relevant probabilities and then apply Bayes' Rule to calculate \(P(H|E)\) for each field. Bayes' Rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality given he is enrolled in that field.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\) is the probability of observing Adam's personality given he is not enrolled in that field.
- \(P(E)\) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality.

For simplicity, let's assume:
- The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in any given field, \(P(H)\), is equal across all fields. In this simplified model, we may set this roughly at 0.1 (i.e., 10%) considering the wide range of possible fields.
- The overall probability \(P(E)\) can be treated as a normalizing factor which will cancel out in our comparative calculations.

### Business Administration
- \(P(H)\): Let's assume \(P(H)\) = 0.1.
- Personality traits such as a love for nature and animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work do not strongly align with typical characteristics for someone in business administration. Hence, \(P(E|H)\) is likely low, say 0.01.
- Conversely, \(P(E|\neg H)\) should be higher as such traits could apply broadly to several other fields. For simplicity, let's say 0.05.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \(P(H)\): Let's assume \(P(H)\) = 0.1.
- Adam’s personality strongly aligns with this field, given his curiosity about nature, animals, and empathy. Hence, \(P(E|H)\) would be high, say 0.8.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\) would be relatively lower for other non-related fields, say 0.02.

### Computer Science
- \(P(H)\): Let's assume \(P(H)\) = 0.1.
- The traits like high intelligence and problem-solving aptitude fit well with computer science, but the love for nature and animals might not directly align. Hence, \(P(E|H)\) might be moderate, say 0.3.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\) would generally be lower but not as low as in business administration, say 0.04.

Now calculating \(P(H|E)\) for each field comparatively:

### Business Administration
\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.01 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} 
\]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} 
\]

### Computer Science
\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} 
\]

To normalize the probabilities:

### Business Administration
\[ 
P(H|E)_{BA} \propto 0.01 \cdot 0.1 = 0.001 
\]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ 
P(H|E)_{AG} \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 
\]

### Computer Science
\[ 
P(H|E)_{CS} \propto 0.3 \cdot 0.1 = 0.03 
\]

The normalized values sum to 0.001 + 0.08 + 0.03 = 0.111. Here are the relative probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.001 / 0.111 ≈ 0.009,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08 / 0.111 ≈ 0.721,
  "computer science": 0.03 / 0.111 ≈ 0.27
}

So final values rounded:

{
  "business administration": 0.009,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.721,
  "computer science": 0.27
}
