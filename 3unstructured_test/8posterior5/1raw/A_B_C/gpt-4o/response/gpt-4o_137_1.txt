To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each given field using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in each field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in each field.

Let's assess and estimate these probabilities for each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **Prior probability, \( P(H) \)**: Let's assume an average graduate program distribution and give a higher prior probability for fields that seem more relevant to Adam's sketch. For Agricultural and Veterinary Science we estimate:
  \[
  P(H) = 0.1
  \]
  
- **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: Given the strong alignment of the personality sketch with this field (curiosity about nature, love for animals), this is expected to be high:
  \[
  P(E|H) = 0.7
  \]
  
- **Likelihood given not \( H \), \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of the personality sketch occurring outside this field is lower but not negligible:
  \[
  P(E|\neg H) = 0.2
  \]

### Computer Science
- **Prior probability, \( P(H) \)**: Given the popularity of this field among graduate students, we'll set a moderate prior:
  \[
  P(H) = 0.2
  \]
  
- **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's quiet nature and intelligence, but no specific mention of computer science interest, the alignment is modest:
  \[
  P(E|H) = 0.3
  \]
  
- **Likelihood given not \( H \), \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of the personality sketch for students not in computer science is fairly common:
  \[
  P(E|\neg H) = 0.3
  \]

### Business Administration
- **Prior probability, \( P(H) \)**: Business administration is also an average choice among graduate students, so we'll use a moderate prior:
  \[
  P(H) = 0.2
  \]
  
- **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's personality does not strongly align with typical traits for this field (e.g., interest in nature vs. business). Also, no mention of business interests:
  \[
  P(E|H) = 0.1
  \]
  
- **Likelihood given not \( H \), \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Traits described in the sketch might often be seen outside business field:
  \[
  P(E|\neg H) = 0.3
  \]

### Applying Bayes' Rule
Using Bayes' rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \).

Calculate \( P(E) \) for each field before finding \( P(H|E) \).

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[
P(E) = (0.7 \times 0.1) + (0.2 \times 0.9) = 0.07 + 0.18 = 0.25
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.1}{0.25} = 0.28
\]

2. **Computer Science**:
\[
P(E) = (0.3 \times 0.2) + (0.3 \times 0.8) = 0.06 + 0.24 = 0.3
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{0.3} = 0.2
\]

3. **Business Administration**:
\[
P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.2) + (0.3 \times 0.8) = 0.02 + 0.24 = 0.26
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.26} = \approx 0.077
\]
