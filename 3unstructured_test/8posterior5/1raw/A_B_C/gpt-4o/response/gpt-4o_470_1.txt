To apply Bayes' Rule, we'll use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we are not given explicit probabilities, we can assume reasonable values based on the description provided and general knowledge. Let's break down each hypothesis accordingly:

1. **Business Administration**  
   - \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): This is the general probability that a graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in Business Administration. Assuming it is a common field, let's set \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \) to 0.2.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): Given personality sketch E, it doesn't strongly indicate anything specific about business administration, so let's assign a lower probability, such as 0.1.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \): This is the probability of observing E if Adam is not in Business Administration. Given the general nature and his specific interests, we'll assume it is around 0.3.
   - Therefore:
     \[
     P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.3} = \frac{0.02}{0.3} \approx 0.067
     \]

2. **Computer Science**  
   - \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): This is the general probability that a graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in Computer Science. It's quite common, so let's assign it 0.3.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): Solving puzzles and high intelligence are good fits for computer science, let's set this to 0.4.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \): Assuming the general appeal of E across non-CS fields, we assign 0.3.
   - Therefore:
     \[
     P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{0.3} = \frac{0.12}{0.3} = 0.4
     \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**  
   - \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \): This is the general probability of a graduate student being enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. It's less common but fits better, so we set \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \) to 0.1.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \): Given the strong indicators for nature, animals, and empathy, letâ€™s assign 0.7.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \): This still needs to have a reasonable overlap with other fields, so set 0.3.
   - Therefore:
     \[
     P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.3} = \frac{0.07}{0.3} \approx 0.233
     \]

Now putting it all together:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.067,
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.233
}
```

These values represent the relative probability of Adam being enrolled in each specified field given the personality sketch provided.
