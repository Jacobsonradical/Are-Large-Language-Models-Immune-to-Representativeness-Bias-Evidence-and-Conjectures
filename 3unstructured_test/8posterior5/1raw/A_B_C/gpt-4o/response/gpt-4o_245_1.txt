Given the personality sketch of Adam, we will evaluate the probability of the fields he might be enrolled in using Bayesian reasoning. Here’s the step-by-step approach:

1. **Prior Probabilities, P(H):** We need to estimate the prior probabilities that Adam is enrolled in each field based on general knowledge about graduate students. Without specific statistical data, let's assume the following approximate priors:

   - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.05
   - Business Administration: 0.15
   - Computer Science: 0.25

2. **Likelihoods, P(E|H):** We estimate the likelihood that Adam's personality sketch fits a student in each field:

   - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, and his empathy and warm heart, he is highly likely to fit in this field. Let's set this likelihood high, around 0.9.
   - Business Administration: Adam's empathy and intelligence could suit him for business, but his interest in nature and animals is less relevant here, so we set this likelihood lower, around 0.2.
   - Computer Science: While Adam's intelligence and puzzle-solving skill are relevant, his interest in nature and animals is less so. Still, let's give a moderate likelihood, around 0.4.

3. **Complement Likelihoods, P(E|¬H):** This represents the probability of Adam's personality given that he is NOT in each specific field:

   - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Given Adam's personality, if he is not in this field, the personality is less likely but not impossible. Let's estimate around 0.1.
   - Business Administration: If not in this field, Adam's empathy and interest in nature and animals make this less likely but still possible. Estimate around 0.3.
   - Computer Science: If not in this field, his personality is still somewhat likely elsewhere given his intelligence and abstract thinking, so estimate around 0.5.

Using Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probabilities \(P(H|E)\):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assuming we're just comparing these fields and not the overall probabilities:

To make calculation easier, we will estimate \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

However, we’ll estimate relative to each other for clarity.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.05}{(0.9 \times 0.05) + (0.2 \times 0.15) + (0.4 \times 0.25)} \]
\[ \approx \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.03 + 0.1} \]
\[ \approx \frac{0.045}{0.175} \]
\[ \approx 0.257 \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.15}{(0.9 \times 0.05) + (0.2 \times 0.15) + (0.4 \times 0.25)} \]
\[ \approx \frac{0.03}{0.045 + 0.03 + 0.1} \]
\[ \approx \frac{0.03}{0.175} \]
\[ \approx 0.171 \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.25}{(0.9 \times 0.05) + (0.2 \times 0.15) + (0.4 \times 0.25)} \]
\[ \approx \frac{0.1}{0.045 + 0.03 + 0.1} \]
\[ \approx \frac{0.1}{0.175} \]
\[ \approx 0.571 \]

Combining these results:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.257,
  "business administration": 0.171,
  "computer science": 0.571
}
```

Note: These values are relative probabilities normalized against each other within this set of fields.
