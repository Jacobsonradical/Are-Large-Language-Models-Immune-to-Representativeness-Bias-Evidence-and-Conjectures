To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Bayes' rule is stated as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant and is the same for all hypotheses, we can ignore it for relative comparisons. 

First, we make some subjective judgments:

1. **P(H): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field.**

Given the typical distribution of graduate students across various fields, we can assume:
- Computer Science may have a decent number of students.
- Business Administration is a popular field.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science is less common but still significant.

Let's assign the following approximate priors:
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{AgVetSci}}) = 0.2 \)

2. **P(E|H): The likelihood of Adam’s personality given the field.**

- \( P(E| H_{\text{CS}}) \): Adam's warmth, empathy, and love for animals are less typical, while intelligence and problem-solving fit well.
  - Subjective estimate: \( 0.3 \)

- \( P(E| H_{\text{BA}}) \): Warm heart and empathy could fit, but the love for nature and animals is less typical.
  - Subjective estimate: \( 0.1 \)

- \( P(E| H_{\text{AgVetSci}}) \): Strongly aligns with his curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals.
  - Subjective estimate: \( 0.8 \)

3. **P(E|\neg H): The conditional probability of Adam’s personality given he is not in the specified field.**

Given there are many fields, typically unrelated to nature and animals:
- For CS:
  - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \) can be averaged based on other fields:
  - Subjective estimate: \( 0.6 \)

- For Business Administration:
  - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \):
  - Subjective estimate: \( 0.6 \)

- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
  - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AgVetSci}}) \):
  - Subjective estimate: \( 0.4 \)

Given these values, we can now estimate \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

- For Computer Science:
  \[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}})} \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.3}{0.6} = 0.15 \]

- For Business Administration:
  \[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}})} \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.3}{0.6} = 0.05 \]

- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
  \[ P(H_{\text{AgVetSci}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AgVetSci}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AgVetSci}})}{P(E|\neg H_{\text{AgVetSci}})} \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{0.4} = 0.4 \]

Therefore, the posterior probabilities can be summarized as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.15,
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4
}
```
