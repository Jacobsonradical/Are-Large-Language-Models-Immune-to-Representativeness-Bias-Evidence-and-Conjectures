To apply Bayes' theorem to each field, we need to assess the following probabilities:

- P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each specific field.
- P(E|H): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- P(E|¬H): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.

Then, we use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(H|E), the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field given the personality sketch.

Bayes' Theorem: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's make reasonable estimates for these probabilities:

1. **Computer Science**
    - P(H): Let's assume the prior probability Adam was enrolled in Computer Science is moderate (0.2) because it's a common field.
    - P(E|H): Adam has a high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts, which fits computer science, so we estimate 0.4.
    - P(E|¬H): Given the broad usage of abstract problem-solving and intelligence, we estimate the likelihood of this sketch for non-computer science students at 0.1.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
    - P(H): Let's assume the prior probability Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is lower (0.1) given it's less common.
    - P(E|H): Adam's curiosity about nature and love for animals fits well, so we estimate 0.7.
    - P(E|¬H): We estimate a lower likelihood for non-agricultural and veterinary science students at 0.2.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

3. **Business Administration**
    - P(H): Let's assume the prior probability Adam was enrolled in Business Administration is moderate (0.2) since it’s a common field.
    - P(E|H): Traits like a warm heart, empathy, and appreciation for hard work might be less specific to this field, so we estimate 0.1.
    - P(E|¬H): Adam’s attributes might be less common in this field, so we estimate 0.3 for non-business students.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

Since \(P(E)\) is a constant across all fields and will normalize our results, we can drop it for the comparison of relative probabilities:

1. Computer Science:
\[ \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{C} = 0.08 / C \]

2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{C} = 0.07 / C \]

3. Business Administration:
\[ \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{C} = 0.02 / C \]

Let's represent these as relative probabilities.

{
  "computer science": 0.08 / (0.08 + 0.07 + 0.02) = 0.47,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.07 / (0.08 + 0.07 + 0.02) = 0.41,
  "business administration": 0.02 / (0.08 + 0.07 + 0.02) = 0.12
}

Rounded to two decimal places:

{
  "computer science": 0.47,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.41,
  "business administration": 0.12
}
