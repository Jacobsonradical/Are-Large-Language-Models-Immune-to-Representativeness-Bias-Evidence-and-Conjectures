To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \), we use Bayes' Rule, which is given as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll consider \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field, and make educated guesses due to lack of precise numerical data.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: There's a reasonable chance Adam could be in this field due to his love for nature, plants, and animals. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.3 \).
- **P(E|H)**: His personality sketch fits well with this field, so let's assign a higher probability \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Considering there are many other fields, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

### Computer Science
- **P(H)**: Given that Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, he could be in computer science, but his love for nature and animals might not directly imply this field. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
- **P(E|H)**: While his intelligence and puzzle-solving align, his other traits don’t fit well. Let’s assign \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Again considering other fields, we assign \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: Adam’s personality traits don’t align strongly with business administration. Let’s assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
- **P(E|H)**: His warm heart and empathy might be relevant, but not the other traits. Let’s assign \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Considering other fields, we assign \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

### Application of Bayes' Rule
We assume \( P(E) \) to be a normalizing constant. For simplicity, we calculate only the numerators for comparison.

\[
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H)
\]

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.3}{0.8 \cdot 0.3 + 0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.2 \cdot 0.2} \approx \frac{0.24}{0.3} = 0.8 \),
  "computer science": \( \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.8 \cdot 0.3 + 0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.2 \cdot 0.2} \approx \frac{0.06}{0.3} = 0.2 \),
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.8 \cdot 0.3 + 0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.2 \cdot 0.2} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.3} = 0.067 \)
