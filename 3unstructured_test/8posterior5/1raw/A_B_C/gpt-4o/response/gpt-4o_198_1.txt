To apply Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) that Adam's characteristics align with each field, and the marginal likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \), which is the likelihood of Adam's characteristics under the assumption he is not in a specific field.

Let's go step-by-step for each field.

1. **Business Administration**:
   - **P(H)**: Business Administration is a fairly common graduate field, but not necessarily for someone with Adam's interests. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
   - **P(E|H)**: The personality sketch does not strongly align with typical traits of business administration students. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: This is harder to estimate exactly but let it be \( 0.8 \) because Adam's traits seem to be more aligned with other areas. 
   
   Using Bayes' Rule: \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   Assuming \( P(E) \) is normalized across examples (since total doesn't need to add to 1, we can directly compute the relative values),

   \[
   P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.8} = 0.025
   \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **P(H)**: This field aligns well with Adam's interests and characteristics. Let's say \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
   - **P(E|H)**: It is likely Adam's deep love for nature, plants, and animals fits this field. So, estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: Assume this is 0.7.
   
   \[
   P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.7} = 0.171
   \]

3. **Computer Science**:
   - **P(H)**: Computer science is a very common graduate field. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.3 \).
   - **P(E|H)**: Some traits match well, like enjoying solving puzzles and high intelligence, but Adam's love for nature and animals doesn't fit perfectly. Let's put \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \).
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: Assume 0.6.

   \[
   P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{0.6} = 0.2
   \]

Summarizing these probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.025,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.171,
  "computer science": 0.2
