To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each of the hypotheses (fields of study) given the evidence \( E \) (Adam's personality sketch), we'll use Bayes' rule: \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \).

To break it down:

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam having the personality sketch \( E \) given he is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of Adam having the personality sketch \( E \) given he is not enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is a normalization constant ensuring the probabilities sum appropriately, which we can compute as \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Since we are only focusing on the relative probabilities, we can treat the denominator as a proportional constant and simplify the process.

### Estimations

1. **Computer Science:**
   - P(H): Let's assume a prior probability of around 0.1 for Computer Science (CS).
   - P(E|H): Given Adam's attributes, CS doesn't perfectly align but it could still match due to his high intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles, so let's estimate 0.4.
   - P(E|¬H): If he isn't in CS but in another field, the probability that he has these personality traits might be lower, let's say 0.3.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - P(H): Let's assume a prior probability of 0.05 for this field.
   - P(E|H): Given Adam's deep love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work, it seems like a strong match, let's estimate 0.7.
   - P(E|¬H): Even if he isn't in this field, the probability that he possesses these traits might still be present but lower, let's say 0.25.

3. **Business Administration:**
   - P(H): Let's assume a prior probability of 0.1 for Business Administration (BA).
   - P(E|H): Adam's traits don't seem to align very well with BA as this field might not be as closely related to his personality sketch, let's assume 0.2.
   - P(E|¬H): Even if he isn't in BA, the traits might align marginally with other fields, say 0.3.

### Calculations:

Using Bayes' Rule (and focusing on proportional values):

1. **Computer Science:**
   - \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) * P(H) = 0.4 * 0.1 = 0.04 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) * P(H) = 0.7 * 0.05 = 0.035 \]

3. **Business Administration:**
   - \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) * P(H) = 0.2 * 0.1 = 0.02 \]

### Normalizing:

We normalize these values by dividing by the sum of these products:

- Sum = \( 0.04 + 0.035 + 0.02 = 0.095 \)

The normalized probabilities:

1. \[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.04}{0.095} \approx 0.421 \]
2. \[ P(H|E)_{AgriVet} = \frac{0.035}{0.095} \approx 0.368 \]
3. \[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.02}{0.095} \approx 0.211 \]

Thus, the conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.421,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.368,
  "business administration": 0.211
}
```

These values indicate that given Adam's personality sketch, he is most likely to be enrolled in Computer Science, followed by Agricultural and Veterinary Science, and least likely in Business Administration.
