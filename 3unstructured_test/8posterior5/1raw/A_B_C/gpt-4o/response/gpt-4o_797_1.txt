Let's break this down step by step.

### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
**P(H):** The probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science before we see the personality sketch. To maintain simplicity, we can assume equal prior probability for each field since we don't have other information.

**P(E|H):** The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in this field. Given Adam's love for nature, plants, animals, and empathy, this seems quite high.

**P(E|¬H):** The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is **not** in this field (i.e., in some other field other than agricultural and veterinary science). Given the specific traits like love for nature, plants, and animals, this might be lower.

Using these assumptions:

\[
P(H) \approx 0.33
\]
\[
P(E|H) \approx 0.8
\]
\[
P(E|¬H) \approx 0.3
\]

Bayes' Rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H)}
       = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.33}{0.8 \cdot 0.33 + 0.3 \cdot 0.67}
       = \frac{0.264}{0.264 + 0.201}
       = \frac{0.264}{0.465}
       \approx 0.57
\]

### 2. Computer Science
**P(H):** The probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.

**P(E|H):** The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in this field. He enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which fits, but the love for nature and animals is less relevant.

**P(E|¬H):** The probability of observing Adam's personality given he's **not** in this field. 

Using these assumptions:

\[
P(H) \approx 0.33
\]
\[
P(E|H) \approx 0.5
\]
\[
P(E|¬H) \approx 0.4
\]

Bayes' Rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H)}
       = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.33}{0.5 \cdot 0.33 + 0.4 \cdot 0.67}
       = \frac{0.165}{0.165 + 0.268}
       = \frac{0.165}{0.433}
       \approx 0.38
\]

### 3. Business Administration
**P(H):** The probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.

**P(E|H):** The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in this field. His characteristics are less relevant here compared to the previous fields.

**P(E|¬H):** The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is **not** in this field.

Using these assumptions:

\[
P(H) \approx 0.33
\]
\[
P(E|H) \approx 0.3
\]
\[
P(E|¬H) \approx 0.5
\]

Bayes' Rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H)}
       = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.33}{0.3 \cdot 0.33 + 0.5 \cdot 0.67}
       = \frac{0.099}{0.099 + 0.335}
       = \frac{0.099}{0.434}
       \approx 0.23
\]

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.57,
  "computer science": 0.38,
  "business administration": 0.23
}
```

These values provide an estimate of the likelihood that Adam was enrolled in each of these fields based on his personality sketch and prior distribution of fields.
