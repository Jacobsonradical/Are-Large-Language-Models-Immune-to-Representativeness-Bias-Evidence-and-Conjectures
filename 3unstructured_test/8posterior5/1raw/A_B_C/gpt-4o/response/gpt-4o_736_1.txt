To compute the probabilities using Bayes' rule, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Estimate P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
2. **Estimate P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in the specific field.
3. **Estimate P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in the specific field.
4. **Compute P(H|E)**: The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the specific field given his personality sketch.

Let's denote each probability for the specified fields.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H) - Prior Probability**: It's reasonable to assume this field is less common than others. Let's say P(H) ≈ 0.1.
2. **P(E|H) - Likelihood**: Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy, it's highly likely he fits this field. Let's set this at 0.8.
3. **P(E|¬H) - Likelihood of Observing E if H is False**: Adam's personality might still align with certain other fields, but less so. Let's say 0.2.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

Let's calculate P(E):
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) = 0.08 + 0.18 = 0.26 \]

Then,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.26} = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \approx 0.3077 \]

### Computer Science
1. **P(H) - Prior Probability**: Much more common. Let's set it at ≈ 0.3.
2. **P(E|H) - Likelihood**: His intelligence and love for puzzles might align well but less so with nature and empathy. Let's assign 0.2.
3. **P(E|¬H) - Likelihood of Observing E if H is False**: Adam's characteristics are probably more common in other fields. Let's say 0.35.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.3) + (0.35 \cdot 0.7) = 0.06 + 0.245 = 0.305 \]

Then,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{0.305} = \frac{0.06}{0.305} \approx 0.1967 \]

### Business Administration
1. **P(H) - Prior Probability**: Fairly common. Let's set it at 0.25.
2. **P(E|H) - Likelihood**: His attributes less align with business administration. Let's say 0.1.
3. **P(E|¬H) - Likelihood of Observing E if H is False**: More common outside business admin. Let's say 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.3 \cdot 0.75) = 0.025 + 0.225 = 0.25 \]

Then,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.25} = \frac{0.025}{0.25} = 0.1 \]

### Final Results

The results, all together would be:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3077,
  "computer science": 0.1967,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
