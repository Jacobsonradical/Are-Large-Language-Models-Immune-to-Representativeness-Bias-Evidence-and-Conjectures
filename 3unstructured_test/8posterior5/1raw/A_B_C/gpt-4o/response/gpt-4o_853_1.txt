To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific graduate field, given the personality sketch, we will use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence (the personality sketch) given Adam's enrollment in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence given Adam is not in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the evidence, which can be calculated as a weighted sum of \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) over all hypotheses.

Since \( P(E) \) is the same across different fields for the purpose of our relative comparison, we'll evaluate the relative probabilities without explicitly calculating \( P(E) \).

Given the personality sketch of Adam, let's qualitatively assign probabilities for each field.

1. **Business Administration**
   - \( P(H) \): Moderate, business administration is a common field.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Low, Adam's traits and interests (nature, animals, warmth, empathy) do not align strongly with business administration.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Higher than \( P(E|H) \), because his profile doesnâ€™t strongly fit business administration.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - \( P(H) \): Low, less likely than more common fields like business or computer science.
   - \( P(E|H) \): High, Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, animals, empathy, and hard work aligns well with this field.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Lower than \( P(E|H) \), as this field fits very well with his traits.

3. **Computer Science**
   - \( P(H) \): High, computer science is a popular field.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Moderate, Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is intelligent with an understanding of abstract concepts, which fits well. However, his love for nature and animals is less relevant.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Slightly higher than \( P(E|H) \) but not by a large margin, since puzzle-solving and intelligence can indicate other fields as well.

Now let's assign numerical values.

- For business administration:
  - \( P(H) = 0.2 \)
  - \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \)
  - \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \)

- For agricultural and veterinary science:
  - \( P(H) = 0.1 \)
  - \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \)
  - \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \)

- For computer science:
  - \( P(H) = 0.4 \)
  - \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \)
  - \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.7 \)
  
Using Bayes' Theorem without normalizing by \( P(E) \):

- **Business Administration**:
  \[
  P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.02}{P(E)}
  \]

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  \[
  P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.08}{P(E)}
  \]

- **Computer Science**:
  \[
  P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.4}{P(E)} = \frac{0.16}{P(E)}
  \]

Therefore, the relative probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08,
  "computer science": 0.16
}
```
