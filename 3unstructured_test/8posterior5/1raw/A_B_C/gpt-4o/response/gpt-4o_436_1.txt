Let's use Bayesian reasoning to evaluate the probabilities for each field of specialization. We will start with our initial assumptions about the probabilities and then update them based on Adam's personality sketch \( E \).

Hypotheses:
- \( H_1 \): Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( H_2 \): Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( H_3 \): Adam was enrolled in business administration.

We'll denote:
- \( P(H_1) \) as the prior probability that Adam was in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(H_2) \) as the prior probability that Adam was in computer science.
- \( P(H_3) \) as the prior probability that Adam was in business administration.

Next, we'll consider the likelihoods:
- \( P(E|H_1) \): Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H_2) \): Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in computer science.
- \( P(E|H_3) \): Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in business administration.

Finally, we also need to consider the complement likelihoods:
- \( P(E|\neg H_1) \): Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H_2) \): Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not in computer science.
- \( P(E|\neg H_3) \): Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not in business administration.

We can estimate the prior probabilities \( P(H_1) \), \( P(H_2) \), and \( P(H_3) \) from data on the proportion of students in these fields of study among all graduate students. For simplicity, let's assume:

- \( P(H_1) = 0.1 \) (10% of students are in agricultural and veterinary science).
- \( P(H_2) = 0.3 \) (30% of students are in computer science).
- \( P(H_3) = 0.2 \) (20% of students are in business administration).

Now, let's estimate the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \):

- \( P(E|H_1) \approx 0.9 \) (High likelihood because Adam's personality sketch fits well with this field).
- \( P(E|H_2) \approx 0.5 \) (Moderate likelihood because his intelligence and problem-solving ability fit, but less so his love for nature and animals).
- \( P(E|H_3) \approx 0.2 \) (Low likelihood because his personality doesn't align well with the business administration field).

We'll also assume the complement likelihoods \( P(E|\neg H) \):

- \( P(E|\neg H_1) \approx 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H_2) \approx 0.4 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H_3) \approx 0.7 \).

Now, using Bayes' rule, we'll compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_3|E) = \frac{P(E|H_3) \cdot P(H_3)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total evidence and can be computed using:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) + P(E|H_3) \cdot P(H_3) + P(E|\neg H_1) \cdot P(\neg H_1) + P(E|\neg H_2) \cdot P(\neg H_2) + P(E|\neg H_3) \cdot P(\neg H_3) \]

For simplicity, we will just compute the numerators as we are comparing fields (denominator will be same):

\[ P(H_1|E) = 0.9 \times 0.1 = 0.09 \]
\[ P(H_2|E) = 0.5 \times 0.3 = 0.15 \]
\[ P(H_3|E) = 0.2 \times 0.2 = 0.04 \]

In normalized form (summing them up and then dividing):

\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.09+0.15+0.04} \]
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.15}{0.09+0.15+0.04} \]
\[ P(H_3|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.09+0.15+0.04} \]

\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.28} \approx 0.321 \]
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.15}{0.28} \approx 0.536 \]
\[ P(H_3|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.28} \approx 0.143 \]

Thus, the probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.321,
  "computer science": 0.536,
  "business administration": 0.143
}

Please note these values are approximate and based on assumed prior and likelihood probabilities.
