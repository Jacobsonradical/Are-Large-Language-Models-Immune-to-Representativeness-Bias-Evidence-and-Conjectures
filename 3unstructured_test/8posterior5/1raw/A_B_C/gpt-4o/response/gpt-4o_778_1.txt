To apply Bayes' theorem, we need to calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \), which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

In this context:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is in a particular field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not in that particular field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \).

We have three hypotheses for Adam’s field:
- \( H_{\text{CS}} \): Adam is studying computer science.
- \( H_{\text{BA}} \): Adam is studying business administration.
- \( H_{\text{AVS}} \): Adam is studying agricultural and veterinary science.

Let's make reasonable assumptions about these probabilities:

1. **Computer Science:**
    - \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): Computer science is a popular field, so let’s assume \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.2 \).
    - \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): The personality sketch of Adam does not strongly suggest an inclination towards computer science but it is not entirely impossible. Let’s assume \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.3 \).
    - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \): The likelihood of observing Adam’s personality sketch in fields other than computer science. \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.7 \).

2. **Business Administration:**
    - \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): Business administration is also a common field but the personality sketch does not particularly fit the stereotype of a business student. Assume \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1 \).
    - \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): The personality sketch is less likely to belong to a business student. Let’s assume \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1 \).
    - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) \): The likelihood of observing Adam’s personality sketch in fields other than business administration. \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.8 \).

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
    - \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \): Agricultural and veterinary science is less common but fits Adam's personality better. Assume \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.05 \).
    - \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \): The sketch fits very well with this field. Let’s assume \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.9 \).
    - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \): The likelihood of observing Adam’s personality sketch in fields other than agricultural and veterinary science. \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.3 \).

To calculate \( P(E) \), we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{CS}})P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|H_{\text{BA}})P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E|H_{\text{AVS}})P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.2) + (0.1 \cdot 0.1) + (0.9 \cdot 0.05) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.06 + 0.01 + 0.045 = 0.115 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

1. For Computer Science:

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.115} = 0.5217 \]

2. For Business Administration:

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.115} = 0.0869 \]

3. For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.115} = 0.3913 \]

Therefore, the probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": 0.5217,
  "business administration": 0.0869,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3913
