To calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field, let's start by judging the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the evidence given enrollment in that specific field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the evidence given enrollment in other fields.

Then, using Bayes’ rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since \( P(E) \) is common for all fields, we can ignore it for comparison purposes. Thus:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

### Judging the Probabilities:

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- \( P(H) \): Moderate (this field is less common than Computer Science but not rare)
- \( P(E|H) \): High (strong interest in nature, plants and animals, and a warm heart with empathy)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Moderate (empathy, high intelligence, and appreciation of hard work are not uncommon in various fields)

#### Computer Science:
- \( P(H) \): High (a very common graduate field)
- \( P(E|H) \): Moderate (solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts align, but the strong empathy and love for nature/animals are less typical)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Moderate (many other fields also value intelligent, empathetic students)

#### Business Administration:
- \( P(H) \): Moderate to Low (a common graduate field but might not fit the profile well)
- \( P(E|H) \): Low (appreciation for nature, plants, and animals, and high empathy are less fitting)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Moderate (empathy, intelligence, and appreciation of hard work are common across fields)

#### Probabilities:
To simplify calculations, let's use approximate values:
1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \)
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \)

2. Computer Science:
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.4 \)
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.5 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \)

3. Business Administration:
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \)
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \)

Now, we apply Bayes’ rule:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

### Computing \( P(H|E) \):

1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
   \[ P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.2 = 0.16 \]

2. Computer Science:
   \[ P(H|E) \propto 0.5 \cdot 0.4 = 0.20 \]

3. Business Administration:
   \[ P(H|E) \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.3 = 0.06 \]

Now we normalize them so they add up to 1:

Sum = 0.16 + 0.20 + 0.06 = 0.42

Normalized probabilities:

1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
   \[ \frac{0.16}{0.42} \approx 0.38 \]

2. Computer Science:
   \[ \frac{0.20}{0.42} \approx 0.48 \]

3. Business Administration:
   \[ \frac{0.06}{0.42} \approx 0.14 \]

### Final P(H|E):
