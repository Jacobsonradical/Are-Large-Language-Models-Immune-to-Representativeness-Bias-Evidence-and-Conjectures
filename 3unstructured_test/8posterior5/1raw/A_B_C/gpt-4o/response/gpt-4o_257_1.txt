To assess the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in each of the specified fields, let's first outline our priors (P(H)) and our likelihoods (P(E|H) and P(E|¬H)) for each field based on the personality sketch and field characteristics. Bayes' rule helps us calculate the posterior probabilities (P(H|E)):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence E given that Adam is in the particular field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence E given that Adam is not in the particular field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence.

Given Adam's personality sketch, let's make educated estimates for the priors and likelihoods:

### Computer Science:
- **P(H):** Assume a general probability considering the popularity of this field. Let's say \( P(H_{cs}) = 0.30 \).
- **P(E|H):** Adam's interest in puzzles and high intelligence fit well but lack of specific tech affinity is a slight negative. Say \( P(E|H_{cs}) = 0.5 \).
- **P(E|\neg H):** Given that E fits other fields too, assign a general probability. Say \( P(E|\neg H_{cs}) = 0.4 \).

### Business Administration:
- **P(H):** Assumption based on the general interest and common enrollment. Say \( P(H_{ba}) = 0.20 \).
- **P(E|H):** Doesn't strongly align with empathy for animals and nature. Say \( P(E|H_{ba}) = 0.2 \).
- **P(E|\neg H):** May be slightly higher as E fits better in other fields. Say \( P(E|\neg H_{ba}) = 0.5 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- **P(H):** Likely based on Adam’s love for nature, animals. Assume \( P(H_{ag}) = 0.10 \).
- **P(E|H):** Fits Adam's profile perfectly. Assume \( P(E|H_{ag}) = 0.9 \).
- **P(E|\neg H):** General probability considering E fits specifically into this field. Say \( P(E|\neg H_{ag}) = 0.3 \).

Given these assumptions:

### Calculations
1. **Computer Science:**
   \[
   P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.30}{P(E)}
   \]

2. **Business Administration:**
   \[
   P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{ba}) \cdot P(H_{ba})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.20}{P(E)}
   \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   \[
   P(H_{ag}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{ag}) \cdot P(H_{ag})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.10}{P(E)}
   \]

### Normalize
\[
P(E) = 0.5 \cdot 0.30 + 0.2 \cdot 0.20 + 0.9 \cdot 0.10
= 0.15 + 0.04 + 0.09
= 0.28
\]

So,
1. **Computer Science:**
   \[
   P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{0.15}{0.28} \approx 0.54
   \]

2. **Business Administration:**
   \[
   P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.28} \approx 0.14
   \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   \[
   P(H_{ag}|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.28} \approx 0.32
   \]

Thus, our final probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": 0.54,
  "business administration": 0.14,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.32
}
