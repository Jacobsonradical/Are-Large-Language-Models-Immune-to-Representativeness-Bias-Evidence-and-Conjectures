To determine \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch \( E \), we use Bayes' rule, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch if Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch.

Let's analyze each field according to the provided sketch of Adam.

### 1. Computer Science

- **\( P(H) \) (Prior probability)**: Computer science is a popular graduate field in the U.S. I'll estimate a lower probability due to Adam's interests.
  - \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \)
- **\( P(E|H) \) (Likelihood if Adam was enrolled in this field)**: While computer science often involves solving puzzles and requires intelligence, his deep love for nature and animals doesnâ€™t strongly align.
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \)
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \) (Likelihood if Adam was NOT enrolled in this field)**: Given Adam's strong empathy, warmth, and love for nature, these traits may be more common in other fields.
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.6 \)

### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **\( P(H) \) (Prior probability)**: This is less commonly pursued compared to some other fields, but it fits Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals.
  - \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \)
- **\( P(E|H) \) (Likelihood if Adam was enrolled in this field)**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and love for animals, this field highly aligns with his personality.
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \)
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \) (Likelihood if Adam was NOT enrolled in this field)**: Given his traits, if he was not in this field, it may still somewhat fit but less well.
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \)

### 3. Business Administration

- **\( P(H) \) (Prior probability)**: Business administration is a common graduate field.
  - \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \)
- **\( P(E|H) \) (Likelihood if Adam was enrolled in this field)**: While intelligence and appreciation for hard work fit, his empathy and love for nature/animals do not align well with this field.
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \)
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \) (Likelihood if Adam was NOT enrolled in this field)**: His interests suggest he might not fit well here.
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.7 \)

For simplicity, assume:
\[ P(E) = 0.5 \]

Now, we compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

1. **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.5} = \frac{0.06}{0.5} = 0.12 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.5} = \frac{0.08}{0.5} = 0.16 \]

3. **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{0.5} = \frac{0.06}{0.5} = 0.12 \]

Final probabilities:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.12,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.16,
  "business administration": 0.12
}
```
Note: These values indicate relative probabilities and do not sum to 1 by design.
