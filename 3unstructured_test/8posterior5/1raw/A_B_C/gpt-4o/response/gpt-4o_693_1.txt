To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) (the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch), we need to apply Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch, which acts as a normalizing constant and can be considered the same across all fields for relative comparisons. We will consider generic prior probabilities for each hypothesis \( P(H) \), and make educated guesses for \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \) based on the given personality sketch \( E \):

### Prior Probability \( P(H) \)
For simplicity, let's assume the following preliminary prior probabilities for being enrolled in each field just based on the general population of graduate students:
- \( P(H_\text{CS}) \): Probability that a graduate student is in computer science
- \( P(H_\text{BA}) \): Probability that a graduate student is in business administration
- \( P(H_\text{AVS}) \): Probability that a graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science

These are priors without any specific data about Adam:
- \( P(H_\text{CS}) = 0.35 \)
- \( P(H_\text{BA}) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(H_\text{AVS}) = 0.10 \)
- The remaining 0.25 covers other fields.

### Probability of Evidence Given Each Field \( P(E|H) \)
Next, let's estimate how well Adam's personality matches each field:

1. **Computer Science (CS)**
   - Interest in puzzles and high intelligence align well with computer science.
   - Curiosity about nature and empathy are not typically strong indicators for computer science.

   \( P(E|H_\text{CS}) = 0.40 \)

2. **Business Administration (BA)**
   - Empathy and understanding of hard work align somewhat with business administration.
   - However, curiosity about nature and love for animals are less relevant.

   \( P(E|H_\text{BA}) = 0.20 \)

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS)**
   - Strong correlation with curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy.
   - High match with personality characteristics.

   \( P(E|H_\text{AVS}) = 0.80 \)

### Probability of Evidence Given any Other Field \( P(E|\neg H) \)
This is an average over other fields (excluding those specifically considered). We estimate based on the eigenvalue of common overlap:
   
   \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.25 \)

### Applying Bayes' Rule
We normalize probabilities for comparison:
   
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   
Considering \( P(E) \) is constant for comparison:

1. **For Computer Science:**
   \[
   P(H_\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.40 \cdot 0.35}{0.40 \cdot 0.35 + 0.20 \cdot 0.30 + 0.80 \cdot 0.10 + 0.25 \cdot 0.25} \approx \frac{0.14}{normalized factor}
   \]

2. **For Business Administration:**
   \[
   P(H_\text{BA}|E) = \frac{0.20 \cdot 0.30}{0.40 \cdot 0.35 + 0.20 \cdot 0.30 + 0.80 \cdot 0.10 + 0.25 \cdot 0.25} \approx \frac{0.06}{normalized factor}
   \]

3. **For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   \[
   P(H_\text{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.10}{0.40 \cdot 0.35 + 0.20 \cdot 0.30 + 0.80 \cdot 0.10 + 0.25 \cdot 0.25} \approx \frac{0.08}{normalized factor}
   \]

Since we are interested in comparative analysis:
{
  "computer science": \( \approx \frac{.14}{.14 + .06 + .08 + r} \approx 0.48 \),
  "business administration": \( \approx \frac{.06}{.14 + .06 + .08 + r} \approx 0.20 \),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \approx \frac{.08}{.14 + .06 + .08 + r} \approx 0.27 \),
}

Notice that we didn't normalize completely but comparative analysis reveals overall consistency.

In conclusion, the adjusted relative probabilities mentioning the likelihoods:
{
  "computer science": 0.47,
  "business administration": 0.21,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.32
