To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Rule, we need to estimate the following probabilities for each field of specialization:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability that Adam would have the personality sketch E given he was enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability that Adam would have the personality sketch E given he was not enrolled in that field.

Given Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Note that \( P(E) \) is the same for all fields and would ultimately cancel out when comparing relative probabilities.

Let's make some reasonable estimates:

### Computer Science

1. \( P(H) \): Let's assume computer science is a fairly common graduate field. Suppose \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \).
2. \( P(E|H) \): The personality sketch talks about appreciation for nature, animals, and empathy, which doesnâ€™t strongly correlate with a typical computer science profile. Suppose \( P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \).
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): This is more general. Considering the personality sketch without specific alignment to computer science, suppose \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.1 \).

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.04}{P(E)} \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. \( P(H) \): This is less common than computer science but more aligned with the personality sketch. Suppose \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \).
2. \( P(E|H) \): The personality sketch significantly aligns with nature, plants, and animals, making this a strong fit. Suppose \( P(E|H) \approx 0.7 \).
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): Suppose \( P(E|\neg H) \approx the same 0.1 \).

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.07}{P(E)} \]

### Business Administration

1. \( P(H) \): Business administration is quite common. Suppose \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \).
2. \( P(E|H) \): The personality sketch does not strongly align with typical business administration profiles. Suppose \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \).
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): Suppose \( P(E|\neg H) \approx the same 0.1 \).

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.02}{P(E)} \]

Now, for the relative probabilities (ignoring the common denominator \( P(E) \)), we get:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.04,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.07,
  "business administration": 0.02
}
```

These values indicate that Adam is most likely enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, followed by Computer Science, and least likely in Business Administration, based on the provided personality sketch.
