To solve the problem, we need to use Bayes' Rule to update our beliefs about which field Adam is likely to have been enrolled in given the personality sketch \( E \). Bayes' Rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, let's assign the following probabilities based on the information given:

1. **Prior Probabilities** \( P(H) \):
   - \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \)
   - \( P(\text{computer science}) \)
   - \( P(\text{business administration}) \)

   Keeping it simple, and due to lack of specific prior information, we might initially assume equal priors for each, say 0.33. However, we will reflect further on their likely natural priors:

   - Agricultural and veterinary science might be in the range of 0.25, because fewer students enroll in this field compared to others.
   - Computer science around 0.4, given its popularity.
   - Business administration around 0.35, as it's also quite common.

2. **Likelihoods** \( P(E|H) \):
   Let's employ the details of the personality sketch to refine these:

   - \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.8 \):
     Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, this field seems highly relevant.

   - \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \approx 0.3 \):
     His intelligence and interest in solving puzzles align with traits beneficial for computer science, but other aspects (love for nature and animals) don't match as well.

   - \( P(E|\text{business administration}) \approx 0.1 \):
     His traits seem least aligned with a business-oriented field.

3. **Complementary Likelihoods** \( P(E|\neg H) \):
   For these, we want to consider how unlikely the personality sketch would be if Adam were not in each particular field:

   - \( P(E|\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.3 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg \text{computer science}) \approx 0.5 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg \text{business administration}) \approx 0.7 \)

Now let's compute each posterior probability \( P(H|E) \):

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have \( P(E) \), we need to compute it for the three cases and then normalize:

\[ P(E) = P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) + P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) + P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) \]

\[ P(E) \approx (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.3 \cdot 0.4) + (0.1 \cdot 0.35) \]

\[ P(E) \approx 0.2 + 0.12 + 0.035 = 0.355 \]

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.355} \approx 0.563 \]

### Computer Science:
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.4}{0.355} \approx 0.338 \]

### Business Administration:
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.35}{0.355} \approx 0.099 \]

So, the updated probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.563,
  "computer science": 0.338,
  "business administration": 0.099
}
