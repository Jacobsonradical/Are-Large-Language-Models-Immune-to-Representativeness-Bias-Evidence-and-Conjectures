To answer this question using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate some probabilities. Specifically, Bayes' rule tells us that:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given that he is in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing Adam's personality sketch across all fields.
  
For simplicity, let's assume that we don't have specific numerical values for the priors but we can make educated guesses based on typical enrollments in these fields and the provided personality sketch. Let's make reasonable assumptions:

### Computer Science
- **P(H)**: Computer science is a popular field, so let's assume \( P(H_{cs}) \) is moderate.
- **P(E|H)**: Adam's appreciation for abstract concepts fits well but his empathy and love of nature are less common in this field. Let's assume \( P(E|H_{cs}) \) is low to moderate.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Considering that empathy and curiosity about nature are common traits in non-CS fields, \( P(E|\neg H_{cs}) \) is relatively high.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: This is a less common field than computer science but fits well with Adam's personality traits. Suppose \( P(H_{agvet}) \) is low to moderate.
- **P(E|H)**: Adam's empathy, curiosity about nature and plants are a perfect fit. Therefore, \( P(E|H_{agvet}) \) is high.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Given that such traits are not as strongly associated with other fields, \( P(E|\neg H_{agvet}) \) is moderate.

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: Business administration is a very common field. Let's assume \( P(H_{ba}) \) is moderate.
- **P(E|H)**: Adam's traits do not directly fit well with business administration where traits like extroversion and assertiveness might be more common. Assume \( P(E|H_{ba}) \) is low.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Since Adam's traits are somewhat rare in business fields, \( P(E|\neg H_{ba}) \) could be high.

Given the qualitative nature of the probabilities, let's assign numerical values for simplicity:

- **Computer Science**: \( P(H) = 0.3, P(E|H) = 0.2, P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \)
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: \( P(H) = 0.15, P(E|H) = 0.8, P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \)
- **Business Administration**: \( P(H) = 0.4, P(E|H) = 0.1, P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \)

### Calculations

#### Computer Science
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.3}{P(E)} \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H_{agvet}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{agvet}) \cdot P(H_{agvet})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{agvet}|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{P(E)} \]

#### Business Administration
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{ba}) \cdot P(H_{ba})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.4}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same in each denominator, we can drop it for comparison purposes. The simplified values are:
- **Computer Science**: \( 0.2 \times 0.3 = 0.06 \)
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: \( 0.8 \times 0.15 = 0.12 \)
- **Business Administration**: \( 0.1 \times 0.4 = 0.04 \)

Normalizing these (though not necessary as per instruction):

\[ \sum = 0.06 + 0.12 + 0.04 = 0.22 \]

Then we get:

- \( P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.22} \approx 0.27 \)
- \( P(H_{agvet}|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.22} \approx 0.55 \)
- \( P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.22} \approx 0.18 \)

However, as per instruction to avoid normalization, we'll give the direct simplifications.
