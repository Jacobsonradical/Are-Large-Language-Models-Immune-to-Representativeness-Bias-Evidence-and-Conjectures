To answer this question, we'll apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of Adam having personality traits \( E \) given that he is enrolled in the specific field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of Adam having personality traits \( E \) given that he is not enrolled in the specific field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of Adam having personality traits \( E \).

Let's make reasonable assumptions about these probabilities based on the provided personality sketch:

### 1. Computer Science
- **P(H) (prior probability)**: Assuming a reasonable distribution and popularity of fields, let's say the prior probability for computer science is 0.2.
- **P(E|H)**: High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts aligns with computer science. However, the strong empathy and love for nature and animals are not typical traits for the field. Let's set it at 0.2.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The personality traits could fit other fields as well, so let's say 0.1.

Using Bayes Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.2 \cdot 0.2 + (1 - 0.2) \cdot 0.1} = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.08} = \frac{0.04}{0.12} = 0.333 \]

### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H) (prior probability)**: This field is more specialized, so let’s put it at 0.05.
- **P(E|H)**: The personality traits of strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work perfectly align with this field. Let's set this at 0.7.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: These traits can belong to other fields but less frequently. Let's say 0.1.

Using Bayes Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{0.7 \cdot 0.05 + (1 - 0.05) \cdot 0.1} = \frac{0.035}{0.035 + 0.095} = \frac{0.035}{0.13} \approx 0.269 \]

### 3. Business Administration
- **P(H) (prior probability)**: Business administration is quite a common field, so it may have a prior probability of 0.2.
- **P(E|H)**: While high intelligence is required, the other personality traits don’t strongly align with business administration. Let's set this at 0.1.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: These traits can belong to other fields reasonably well, so let's say 0.1.

Using Bayes Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + (1 - 0.2) \cdot 0.1} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.08} = \frac{0.02}{0.10} = 0.2 \]

Thus, the resulting conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.333,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.269,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```
