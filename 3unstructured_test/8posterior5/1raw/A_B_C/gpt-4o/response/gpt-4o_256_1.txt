To employ Bayes' theorem, recall that the probability of a hypothesis H given the evidence E, i.e., \( P(H|E) \), can be computed using the formula:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where:
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \(P(E)\) is the total probability of the evidence.

Let's denote each field with its respective hypothesis \(H_1\), \(H_2\), and \(H_3\).

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1)**
    - \(P(H1)\): The prior probability that a random graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume this is relatively low but not insignificant, say 0.05.
    - \(P(E|H1)\): Given Adam's personality sketch, it is quite likely he is enrolled in this field. Assume 0.8.
    - \(P(E|\neg H1)\): The probability of observing the evidence if Adam is not in this field. This is lower due to his strong fit with the personality sketch, say 0.3.

2. **Business Administration (H2)**
    - \(P(H2)\): The prior probability that a random graduate student is in business administration. Higher than agricultural science due to the popularity, say 0.15.
    - \(P(E|H2)\): Given Adam's personal traits, it's less likely he is in this field, say 0.1.
    - \(P(E|\neg H2)\): The probability of observing the evidence if Adam is not in this field. Higher because many students fit other fields better too, say 0.7.

3. **Computer Science (H3)**
    - \(P(H3)\): The prior probability that a random graduate student is in computer science. This is relatively high, say 0.2.
    - \(P(E|H3)\): Given Adam's intelligence and puzzle-solving skills, but considering the nature interests, this is moderate, say 0.4.
    - \(P(E|\neg H3)\): The probability of observing the evidence if Adam is not in this field, say 0.5.

We need the total probability \(P(E)\):

\[
P(E) = P(E|H1)P(H1) + P(E|H2)P(H2) + P(E|H3)P(H3) + \text{P(E for all other H)}
\]

For simplicity, we'll consider only these hypotheses.

Let's compute the normalized posterior \(P(H|E)\) for each field:

\[
\begin{align*}
P(H1|E) &= \frac{P(E|H1)P(H1)}{P(E)} \\
P(H2|E) &= \frac{P(E|H2)P(H2)}{P(E)} \\
P(H3|E) &= \frac{P(E|H3)P(H3)}{P(E)}
\end{align*}
\]

Assuming \(P(E)\) can be approximately computed as:

\[
\begin{align*}
P(E) &= P(E|H1)P(H1) + P(E|H2)P(H2) + P(E|H3)P(H3) \\
&= (0.8 \times 0.05) + (0.1 \times 0.15) + (0.4 \times 0.2) \\
&= 0.04 + 0.015 + 0.08 \\
&= 0.135
\end{align*}
\]

Computing each posterior:

\[
\begin{align*}
P(H1|E) &= \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.135} \approx 0.296 \\
P(H2|E) &= \frac{0.1 \times 0.15}{0.135} \approx 0.111 \\
P(H3|E) &= \frac{0.4 \times 0.2}{0.135} \approx 0.593
\end{align*}
\]

Thus, the answer is:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.296,
  "business administration": 0.111,
  "computer science": 0.593
}
```

(Note: These values are approximations and should be viewed as indicative rather than exact).
