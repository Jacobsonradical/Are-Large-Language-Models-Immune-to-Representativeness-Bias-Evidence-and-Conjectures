Let's evaluate the probabilities and use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \):

### Steps to Calculate \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \)

#### Assumptions
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
    - Approximately 20% of graduate students in general fields could be assumed to be in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
    - Approximately 25% of graduate students could be assumed to be in Business Administration.
    - Approximately 30% of graduate students could be assumed to be in Computer Science.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
    - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: High likelihood since Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and animals, and high empathy.
    - Business Administration: Low likelihood since none of the described traits directly align with business skills or interests.
    - Computer Science: Moderate likelihood due to Adam's high intelligence and interest in solving puzzles, although other characteristics seem less aligned.

3. **\( P(\neg H) \)** represents the likelihood of the personality traits given Adam is not in that field.

 Given that we need to denote \( P(E|\neg H) \), we assume an average likelihood over several fields.

### Calculate Specific Probabilities

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **Prior \( P(H) \) = 0.20** 
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** High, assume approximately 0.70
- **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):** Assume approximately 0.50 (average over non-agricultural and veterinary fields)

#### Business Administration
- **Prior \( P(H) \) = 0.25** 
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** Low, assume approximately 0.10
- **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):** Assume approximately 0.55

#### Computer Science
- **Prior \( P(H) \) = 0.30** 
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** Moderate, assume approximately 0.50
- **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):** Assume approximately 0.55 

#### Posterior Probabilities
Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We do not have \( P(E) \) defined directly, but can assume it as a normalizing constant if needed. Here's the relative calculation:

### Calculation

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[
   P(H|E)_{\text{Agri}} = \frac{0.70 \times 0.20}{ (0.70 \times 0.20) + (0.10 \times 0.25) + (0.50 \times 0.30)}
    \]

2. **Business Administration**:
   \[
    P(H|E)_{\text{Bus}} = \frac{0.10 \times 0.25}{(0.70 \times 0.20) + (0.10 \times 0.25) + (0.50 \times 0.30)}
   \]

3. **Computer Science**:
   \[
   P(H|E)_{\text{Comp}} = \frac{0.50 \times 0.30}{(0.70 \times 0.20) + (0.10 \times 0.25) + (0.50 \times 0.30)}
   \]

Let's compute these:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[
 P(H|E)_{\text{Agri}} = \frac{0.14}{0.14 + 0.025 + 0.15} = \frac{0.14}{0.315} \approx 0.444
\]

### Business Administration:
\[
 P(H|E)_{\text{Bus}} = \frac{0.025}{0.14 + 0.025 + 0.15} = \frac{0.025}{0.315} \approx 0.079
\]

### Computer Science:
\[
 P(H|E)_{\text{Comp}} = \frac{0.15}{0.14 + 0.025 + 0.15} = \frac{0.15}{0.315} \approx 0.476
\]

### Final Output:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.444,
  "business administration": 0.079,
  "computer science": 0.476
}
