To solve this problem using Bayes' Rule, we need to understand the following probabilities for each hypothesis \( H \) (field of study): the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood of the evidence given the opposite hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H) \).

### Definitions of the Probabilities:

1. Prior Probability, \( P(H) \):
   - This is the initial probability of Adam being enrolled in each field before considering his personality sketch.

2. Likelihood of the Evidence, \( P(E|H) \):
   - This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was enrolled in that field.

3. Likelihood of the Evidence given the Negation, \( P(E|\neg H) \):
   - This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was not enrolled in that field.

### Bayesian Inference:

Bayesâ€™ Rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For our purposes, it will be more practical to compute the probabilities relative to each other rather than calculating exact values for \( P(E) \).

### Belief Judgement:
Let's assign reasonable estimates to these probabilities based on the information given in the personality sketch and the nature of each field.

### Assumptions:

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - Given that business administration, computer science, and agricultural and veterinary science are common graduate programs but not exclusive, let's assume the following (arbitrary yet reasonable) prior probabilities:
     - \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.3 \)
     - \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.4 \)
     - \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.3 \)

2. **Likelihoods**:
   - Given the personality traits:
     - High empathy, love for animals, curiosity about plants, and appreciation for hard work align more strongly with agricultural and veterinary science. Thus:
       - \( P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.1 \)
       - \( P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.2 \)
       - \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.8 \)
     - For negation, we use complementary reasoning but must maintain consistency in summing probabilities properly.

### Computing Posterior Probabilities:

To simplify, we can skip calculating \( P(E) \) since the total sum is not necessary here and we focus on proportional values:

1. **Business Administration**:
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} \]
   \[ \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \]

2. **Computer Science**:
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} \]
   \[ \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.4}{P(E)} \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)} \]
   \[ \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \]

### Proportional Values:

1. **Business Administration**:
   \[ \approx 0.1 \cdot 0.3 = 0.03 \]

2. **Computer Science**:
   \[ \approx 0.2 \cdot 0.4 = 0.08 \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[ \approx 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \]

Normalizing these values relative to each other:

\[ \text{Sum} = 0.03 + 0.08 + 0.24 = 0.35 \]

Then,

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.35} \approx 0.086 \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \approx 0.229 \]
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.24}{0.35} \approx 0.686 \]

### Final Output:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.086,
  "computer science": 0.229,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.686
}
