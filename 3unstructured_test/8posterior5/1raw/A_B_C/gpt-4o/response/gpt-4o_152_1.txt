Let's first break down the probabilities and apply Bayes' rule to each field one by one. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here are the steps for each field:
1. **Business Administration:**

   - **P(H)**: The general probability of a graduate student being in business administration.
   - **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam's traits (E) given that he is in business administration.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of Adam's traits if he is not in business administration.
   - **P(E)**: The overall probability of observing the traits given the distribution across all possible fields.

   Since Adam’s traits include a genuine curiosity about nature, empathy, a love for animals, and abstract thinking, P(E|H) for business administration may be relatively low because these traits are not strongly associated with a business administration focus.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

   - **P(H)**: The general probability of a graduate student being in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam's traits (E) given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of Adam's traits if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - **P(E)**: The overall probability of observing the traits given the distribution across all possible fields.

   Given Adam's strong interest in nature and animals, P(E|H) would be high for agricultural and veterinary science.

3. **Computer Science:**

   - **P(H)**: The general probability of a graduate student being in computer science.
   - **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam's traits (E) given that he is in computer science.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of Adam's traits if he is not in computer science.
   - **P(E)**: The overall probability of observing the traits given the distribution across all possible fields.

   Adam's skill in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts correlates well with computer science, so P(E|H) would be moderate to high for this field.

### Assigning Values

Let's assign some notional values:

1. Business Administration:
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \) (20% as a rough estimate)
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \) (Adam’s traits don't strongly align)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.9 \)

2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \) (10% as a rough estimate)
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \) (Strong alignment with Adam’s traits)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \)

3. Computer Science:
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \) (20% as a rough estimate)
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.5 \) (Moderate alignment with Adam’s traits)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.6 \)

### Computing P(E)
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) P(H) + P(E|\neg H) P(\neg H) \]

Now, let's compute the probabilities:

1. **Business Administration:**
   \[ P(E) \approx (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.9 \cdot 0.8) \] 
   \[ P(E) \approx 0.02 + 0.72 \]
   \[ P(E) \approx 0.74 \]

   \[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.74} \]
   \[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.02}{0.74} \]
   \[ P(H|E) \approx 0.027 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   \[ P(E) \approx (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) \] 
   \[ P(E) \approx 0.08 + 0.18 \]
   \[ P(E) \approx 0.26 \]

   \[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.26} \]
   \[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.08}{0.26} \]
   \[ P(H|E) \approx 0.308 \]

3. **Computer Science:**
   \[ P(E) \approx (0.5 \cdot 0.2) + (0.6 \cdot 0.8) \] 
   \[ P(E) \approx 0.1 + 0.48 \]
   \[ P(E) \approx 0.58 \]

   \[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.58} \]
   \[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.1}{0.58} \]
   \[ P(H|E) \approx 0.172 \]
