To compute the probabilities given the provided personality sketch of Adam (denoted as E) and the hypothesis for each field of study (denoted as H), we'll use Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of the evidence given that the hypothesis is not true.

Since we don't have numerical values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \), we will estimate these probabilities based on logical assumptions and Adam's personality sketch.

### Assumptions:
- **Computer Science**:
  - Prior Probability (\( P(H) \)): Moderate, as computer science is a common field.
  - Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \)): Low to moderate. While high intelligence and abstract thinking fit, nature, plants, and animals are less relevant.
  - Evidence given not this field (\( P(E|\neg H) \)): High, since the likelihood of these attributes fitting other fields seems more plausible.

- **Business Administration**:
  - Prior Probability (\( P(H) \)): Moderate, as business administration is also fairly common.
  - Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \)): Low. Business does not typically align with love for nature, plants, and animals.
  - Evidence given not this field (\( P(E|\neg H) \)): Higher, since Adam's qualities seem less relevant to a business focus.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  - Prior Probability (\( P(H) \)): Lower than Computer Science or Business Administration but still reasonable.
  - Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \)): High. This field aligns very well with Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, and appreciation for hard work.
  - Evidence given not this field (\( P(E|\neg H) \)): Lower, as his attributes are more specific to this field.

### Estimated Probabilities:
1. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \)
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.8 \)
2. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \)
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.9 \)
3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \)
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \)

Using these estimates, we apply Bayes' rule intuitively:
- For Computer Science:
  \[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) \approx 0.3 \cdot 0.3 / (0.3 \cdot 0.3 + 0.3 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9) \approx 0.13 \]
  
- For Business Administration:
  \[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) \approx 0.3 \cdot 0.1 / (0.3 \cdot 0.3 + 0.3 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9) \approx 0.05 \]
  
- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
  \[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) \approx 0.2 \cdot 0.9 / (0.3 \cdot 0.3 + 0.3 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9) \approx 0.54 \]

### Final Probabilities:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.13,
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.54
}
```

The highest probability is for Agricultural and Veterinary Science, aligning well with Adamâ€™s personality sketch.
