To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each of the fields using Bayes' rule, we need to first estimate the probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each hypothesis.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, \( P(E) \) can be considered as a normalizing constant. We can rank the relative probabilities without computing the exact values of \( P(E) \). 

Let's evaluate each field using the information given in the personality sketch.

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: Given that business administration is a common field but not necessarily aligned with Adam's specific interests and traits, we might set this moderate, say around 0.15.
- **P(E|H)**: The traits described (curiosity about nature, empathy, puzzling, animal love) are not typically associated with business administration. We make this low, let's say 0.05.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: This is the probability of Adam having these traits given that he's *not* in business administration. We're not considering him within the domain of business-related disciplines, so this still remains relatively moderate. Let's put it at 0.3.

Thus,
\[ P(H|E)_\text{business administration} \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.05 \cdot 0.15 = 0.0075 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: Adam's interests in nature, plants, animals, and empathy might signal towards this field. Let's say this is moderately high, around 0.25.
- **P(E|H)**: The traits match very well with agricultural and veterinary science (interest in nature and animals, empathy). So this would be high, let's say 0.7.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: This is the probability of the traits without being in agricultural and veterinary science. Given the specificity, let's put this somewhat lower than average, at 0.2.

Thus,
\[ P(H|E)_\text{agricultural and veterinary science} \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.7 \cdot 0.25 = 0.175 \]

### Computer Science
- **P(H)**: Given that computer science is a high-demand field and many are enrolled, let's set this moderate, around 0.2.
- **P(E|H)**: While the traits of solving puzzles and abstract thinking align, the strong empathy and love for nature and animals may align less. So let's set this to moderate 0.4.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Considering broad distributions, this lies moderate. Letâ€™s place this at 0.25.

Thus,
\[ P(H|E)_\text{computer science} \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.4 \cdot 0.2 = 0.08 \]

Now normalizing these values to reflect proper probabilities proportional to the given fields relative in context:

\[
P(H|E)_\text{business administration} = \frac{0.0075}{0.0075 + 0.175 + 0.08} \approx 0.028
\]
\[
P(H|E)_\text{agricultural and veterinary science} = \frac{0.175}{0.0075 + 0.175 + 0.08} \approx 0.643
\]
\[
P(H|E)_\text{computer science} = \frac{0.08}{0.0075 + 0.175 + 0.08} \approx 0.294
\]

Thus, our approximate probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.028,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.643,
  "computer science": 0.294
}
