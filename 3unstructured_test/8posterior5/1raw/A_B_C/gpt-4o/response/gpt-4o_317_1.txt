Let's use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probabilities. We need to provide values for prior probability \( P(H) \), likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and evidence \( P(E|\neg H) \). 

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: 
   Considering the total number of graduate students in all fields, agricultural and veterinary science might have a smaller proportion compared to fields like business administration or computer science. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: 
   Adam’s curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work strongly align with agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

3. **Evidence \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: 
   The characteristics described are less likely for the general population of other fields, though not impossible. Let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

### Computer Science
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: 
   Computer science is a very common graduate field. Let’s assume \( P(H) = 0.3 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: 
   Adam’s high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts might fit well with computer science, but the love for nature and animals is not directly aligned. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \).

3. **Evidence \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: 
   These characteristics are less specific to computer science. Let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

### Business Administration
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: 
   Business administration is also a common graduate field. Let’s assume \( P(H) = 0.3 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: 
   The fields of nature, animals, and solving puzzles don’t align strongly with business administration. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

3. **Evidence \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: 
   Again, these characteristics are less likely for business administration. Let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Now, let's calculate the approximate posterior probabilities using normalized factors for comparison.

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{\sum{P(E|H_i) \cdot P(H_i)}} \]

Here is the summary using non-normalized form (relative probabilities):

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E)_{agricultural} = 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E)_{computer} = 0.4 \times 0.3 = 0.12 \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E)_{business} = 0.1 \times 0.3 = 0.03 \]

In relative terms, \( P(H|E) \) is proportional to these values:
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.08
- Computer Science: 0.12
- Business Administration: 0.03

Now normalizing these values:
- Total = \( 0.08 + 0.12 + 0.03 = 0.23 \)

The normalized probabilities:
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( \frac{0.08}{0.23} \approx 0.347 \)
- Computer Science: \( \frac{0.12}{0.23} \approx 0.522 \)
- Business Administration: \( \frac{0.03}{0.23} \approx 0.130 \)

So the results are roughly:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.35,
  "computer science": 0.52,
  "business administration": 0.13
}
```
