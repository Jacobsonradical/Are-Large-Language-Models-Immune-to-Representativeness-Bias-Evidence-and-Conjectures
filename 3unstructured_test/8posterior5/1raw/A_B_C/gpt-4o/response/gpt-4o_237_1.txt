Let's start by evaluating the probabilities associated with each field of study.

### Computer Science
- **P(H):** The base rate of a graduate student being in computer science. Let's assume P(H) = 0.1 (10% of graduate students are in computer science).
- **P(E|H):** The probability of Adam having personality traits (curiosity about nature, empathy, understanding of abstract concepts) if he is in computer science. Given most people in computer science might not fit this profile perfectly, let's assume P(E|H) = 0.2.
- **P(E|¬H):** The probability of Adam having these traits if he is not in computer science. Since these traits are more common among students in other fields (agricultural and veterinary science, humanities, etc.), let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.6.

By Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|¬H)P(¬H) \]

With our assumptions:
\[ P(E) = 0.2 \times 0.1 + 0.6 \times 0.9 = 0.02 + 0.54 = 0.56 \]

So,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{0.56} = \frac{0.02}{0.56} \approx 0.036 \]

### Business Administration
- **P(H):** The base rate of a graduate student being in business administration. Let's assume P(H) = 0.1 (10% of graduate students are in business administration).
- **P(E|H):** The probability of Adam having these traits if he was in business administration. Given business administration does not typically emphasize these traits, let's assume P(E|H) = 0.1.
- **P(E|¬H):** The probability of Adam having these traits if he is not in business administration. Let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.6 (same logic as before).

With our assumptions:
\[ P(E) = 0.1 \times 0.1 + 0.6 \times 0.9 = 0.01 + 0.54 = 0.55 \]

So,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.1}{0.55} = \frac{0.01}{0.55} \approx 0.018 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H):** The base rate of a graduate student being in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume P(H) = 0.05 (5% of graduate students are in agricultural and veterinary science).
- **P(E|H):** The probability of Adam having these traits if he is in agricultural and veterinary science. Given this field fits the profile well, let's assume P(E|H) = 0.8.
- **P(E|¬H):** The probability of Adam having these traits if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Same as before, let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.6.

With our assumptions:
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \times 0.05 + 0.6 \times 0.95 = 0.04 + 0.57 = 0.61 \]

So,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.61} = \frac{0.04}{0.61} \approx 0.066 \]

Putting it all together:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.036,
  "business administration": 0.018,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.066
