To calculate the probability \( P(H|E) \) for each of the fields, we'll first estimate the relevant probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Then, we will use Bayes' rule: 

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Please note that these probabilities are subjective estimates based on the information provided.

### Business Administration
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that a graduate student is studying business administration might be around 0.15. Business administration is a common graduate field.
2. **P(E|H)**: Given that Adam has a personality sketch indicating a strong interest in nature, animals, and abstract concepts, it is less likely he is studying business administration, say around 0.05.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: For students not in business administration, the traits described in E are more likely, perhaps around 0.3.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.15}{0.05 \cdot 0.15 + 0.3 \cdot (1 - 0.15)} = \frac{0.0075}{0.0075 + 0.255} = \frac{0.0075}{0.2625} \approx 0.0286 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that a graduate student is studying agricultural and veterinary science is likely smaller, around 0.05.
2. **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's specific interests in plants, nature, and animals, the probability that he fits in this field is quite high, let's say 0.6.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: For students not in this field, the characteristics described in E are less likely, around 0.2.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.05}{0.6 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot (1-0.05)} = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.19} = \frac{0.03}{0.22} \approx 0.1364 \]

### Computer Science
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that a graduate student is studying computer science might be around 0.2, a popular field.
2. **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and his interest in puzzles, it is moderately likely he is studying computer science, say around 0.4.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: For students not in computer science, the traits in E could still fit many other fields, so this probability might be around 0.25.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.25 \cdot (1 - 0.2)} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.25 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.2} = \frac{0.08}{0.28} \approx 0.2857 \]

Summarizing the results:

\[
\{
  "business administration": 0.0286,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.1364,
  "computer science": 0.2857
\}
