To compute the posterior probabilities \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' Rule, we'll follow the formula:

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

Where:
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \(P(E)\) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\) is the likelihood of the evidence given not the hypothesis.

For simplicity, we consider \(P(E)\) to be common across all fields and focus on comparing the relative probabilities. Let’s assign rough estimates to these probabilities.

### Hypotheses and Prior Probabilities

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1)**:
  - \(P(H1)\): The prior belief that a random graduate student is in this field. Let's assume it’s moderately likely: 0.2.
  
- **Business Administration (H2)**:
  - \(P(H2)\): The prior belief that a random graduate student is in this field. Assuming it's common but not perfectly fitting Adam’s profile: 0.3.
  
- **Computer Science (H3)**:
  - \(P(H3)\): The prior belief that a random graduate student is in this field. Also common: 0.3.

### Likelihoods

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1)**:
  - \(P(E|H1)\): Adam’s personality traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy) strongly fit this field. Let's say 0.9.
  - \(P(E|\neg H1)\): Suppose traits fitting for other random fields on average: 0.4.

- **Business Administration (H2)**:
  - \(P(E|H2)\): There is less of a direct match for traits like love for animals and empathy. Let's assign: 0.2.
  - \(P(E|\neg H2)\): Higher than \(P(E|H2)\) due to a mismatch: 0.5.
 
- **Computer Science (H3)**:
  - \(P(E|H3)\): Fits traits of puzzle-solving and intelligence but not as much the nature and empathy aspect. Let’s assign: 0.5.
  - \(P(E|\neg H3)\): Higher due to other fields possibly matching better: 0.3.

### Computing Posterior Probabilities using Bayes' Rule

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1)**:

\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.18}{P(E)} \]

For **Business Administration (H2)**:

\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} = \frac{0.06}{P(E)} \]

For **Computer Science (H3)**:

\[ P(H3|E) = \frac{P(E|H3) \cdot P(H3)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H3|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} = \frac{0.15}{P(E)} \]

Since \(P(E)\) is common:

\[
P(H1|E) : P(H2|E) : P(H3|E) = 0.18 : 0.06 : 0.15 
= 3 : 1 : 2.5
\]

Normalizing these to sum to 1 for relative comparison:

\[
\text{Sum} = 3 + 1 + 2.5 = 6.5
\]

So,

\[
P(H1|E) = \frac{3}{6.5} \approx 0.46
\]
\[
P(H2|E) = \frac{1}{6.5} \approx 0.15
\]
\[
P(H3|E) = \frac{2.5}{6.5} \approx 0.38
\]

Thus:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.46,
  "business administration": 0.15,
  "computer science": 0.38
}
