To calculate the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\) for each field using Bayes' Rule, we need the prior probability \(P(H)\), the likelihood \(P(E|H)\), and the marginal likelihood \(P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)\). Since exact values are not provided, we'll assume some reasonable hypothetical values based on typical distribution and the details you provided:

1. **P(H):** Prior probability of the hypothesis.
2. **P(E|H):** Probability of observing E given H.
3. **P(E|\neg H):** Probability of observing E given not H.

### Hypothetical Values:

- \(P(H_{\text{CS}})\) = 0.3 (general ratio for CS students among all graduate students)
- \(P(H_{\text{AVS}})\) = 0.2 (general ratio for agricultural and veterinary science students)
- \(P(H_{\text{BA}})\) = 0.1 (lesser ratio for business administration students)

Assuming the personality traits described fit less with business administration and more with agricultural and veterinary science, we assign:

- \(P(E|H_{\text{CS}})\) = 0.2 (traits loosely match)
- \(P(E|H_{\text{AVS}})\) = 0.8 (traits strongly match)
- \(P(E|H_{\text{BA}})\) = 0.1 (traits weakly match)

For \(P(E|\neg H)\), we consider how likely other students outside each field have similar traits:

- \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}})\) = 0.3
- \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}})\) = 0.3
- \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}})\) = 0.3

### Compute Posterior Probabilities using Bayes’ Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the combined probability across all hypotheses.

For simplicity and normalization, we will ignore \(P(E)\) as the total does not need to add up to 1:

```json
{
  "computer science": (0.2 * 0.3) / [(0.2 * 0.3) + (0.8 * 0.2) + (0.1 * 0.1)] = 0.06 / (0.06 + 0.16 + 0.01) ≈ 0.24,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": (0.8 * 0.2) / [(0.2 * 0.3) + (0.8 * 0.2) + (0.1 * 0.1)] = 0.16 / (0.06 + 0.16 + 0.01) ≈ 0.64,
  "business administration": (0.1 * 0.1) / [(0.2 * 0.3) + (0.8 * 0.2) + (0.1 * 0.1)] = 0.01 / (0.06 + 0.16 + 0.01) ≈ 0.04
}
```

Summarized results:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.24,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.64,
  "business administration": 0.04
}
```

These values suggest that based on the given personality sketch, Adam is most likely to have been enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021.
