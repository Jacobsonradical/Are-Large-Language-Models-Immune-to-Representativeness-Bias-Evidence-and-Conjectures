To calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study, let's apply Bayes' Theorem. Specifically, we need to use the equation:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \).

Given that we need to provide estimates based on the personality sketch, here are the assumptions:

1. **Business Administration**:
    - \( P(H) \): Let's assume the base rate of graduate students in business administration is about 0.2.
    - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's qualities, it seems less likely that he would be enrolled in business administration, so let's assume 0.1.
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Let's assume 0.3 as the likelihood of those traits appearing in students of other fields.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - \( P(H) \): Let's assume the base rate of graduate students in agricultural and veterinary science is 0.05.
    - \( P(E|H) \): Based on his qualities, it seems very likely he would be in this field, so let's assume 0.5.
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Let's assume 0.1.

3. **Computer Science**:
    - \( P(H) \): Let's assume the base rate of graduate students in computer science is 0.25.
    - \( P(E|H) \): Given that Adam is good at solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, it is somewhat likely he would be in this field. Let's assume 0.2.
    - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Letâ€™s assume 0.6.

Next, calculate \( P(E) \):
\[
P(E) = P(E|H_\text{BA}) \cdot P(H_\text{BA}) + P(E|H_\text{AVS}) \cdot P(H_\text{AVS}) + P(E|H_\text{CS}) \cdot P(H_\text{CS}) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]
(where specific term probabilities of \(P(E|\neg H)\) and \(P(\neg H)\) aggregate the average complementary values).

For simplicity, we will just use simple intermediate calculations for now. Estimate:

\[
P(E) \approx \sum [P(E|H) \cdot P(H)] + \text{(assuming others fields collectively)}
\]

Given these assumptions, we calculate \( P(H|E) \):

1. **Business Administration**:
\[
P(H_\text{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.02}{P(E)}
\]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[
P(H_\text{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.025}{P(E)}
\]

3. **Computer Science**:
\[
P(H_\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.05}{P(E)}
\]

Normalizing/Approximating the values computed for comparison:

{
  "business administration": ~0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": ~0.4,
  "computer science": ~0.3
}

These values are approximate conditional probabilities given the data interpreted context.
