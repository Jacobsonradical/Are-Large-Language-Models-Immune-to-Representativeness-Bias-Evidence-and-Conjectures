Sure, let's start by estimating each component needed to compute the probabilities using Bayes' rule. 

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1):**
   - **P(H1):** The prior probability of being enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science without additional information. Let's estimate this as 0.1, assuming agricultural and veterinary science is not one of the larger graduate fields in the U.S.
   - **P(E|H1):** The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he were enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Considering Adam's love for nature, animals, and empathy, this probability is high. Let's estimate this as 0.7.
   - **P(E|\neg H1):** The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he were not enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Since there are other fields (like biology or environmental science) that could explain these traits, let's estimate this as 0.3.

2. **Computer Science (H2):**
   - **P(H2):** The prior probability of being enrolled in Computer Science without additional information. Computer Science is a popular field, so let's estimate this as 0.2.
   - **P(E|H2):** The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he were enrolled in Computer Science. Given his interest in puzzles and high intelligence, this is moderately likely, but his love for nature and animals makes it less likely. Let's estimate this as 0.4.
   - **P(E|\neg H2):** The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he were not enrolled in Computer Science. This is relatively high since Adam's traits can be linked to many other fields. Let's estimate this as 0.5.

3. **Business Administration (H3):**
   - **P(H3):** The prior probability of being enrolled in Business Administration without additional information. Business is also a common field, so let's estimate this as 0.2.
   - **P(E|H3):** The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he were enrolled in Business Administration. Given his empathy and appreciation for hard work, there is some likelihood, but his love for nature and animals makes it less likely. Let's estimate this as 0.3.
   - **P(E|\neg H3):** The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he were not enrolled in Business Administration. Again, this is relatively high since his traits fit other fields better. Let's estimate this as 0.6.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1) + P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2) + P(E|H3) \cdot P(H3) + P(E|\neg H1 \land \neg H2 \land \neg H3) \cdot P(\neg H1 \land \neg H2 \land \neg H3) \]

Estimating \( P(E) \) as a weighted combination:

\[ P(E) \approx (0.7 \cdot 0.1) + (0.4 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.2) + [(1 - (0.1 + 0.2 + 0.2)) \cdot \text{average of estimated probabilities for non-specified fields}] \]

Let's assume the remaining fields have an average \( P(E|\neg H) \) of 0.5 and total probability as 0.5:

\[ P(E) \approx (0.07) + (0.08) + (0.06) + (0.5 \cdot 0.5) = 0.07 + 0.08 + 0.06 + 0.25 = 0.46 \]

Now, computing posterior probabilities:

1. **P(H1|E):**
   \[ P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.46} = \frac{0.07}{0.46} \approx 0.152 \]

2. **P(H2|E):**
   \[ P(H2|E) = \frac{P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.46} = \frac{0.08}{0.46} \approx 0.174 \]

3. **P(H3|E):**
   \[ P(H3|E) = \frac{P(E|H3) \cdot P(H3)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.46} = \frac{0.06}{0.46} \approx 0.130 \]

Therefore, the posterior probabilities are approximately:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.152,
  "computer science": 0.174,
  "business administration": 0.130
}
