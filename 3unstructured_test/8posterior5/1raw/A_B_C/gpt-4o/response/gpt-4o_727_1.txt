To compute \(P(H|E)\) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to determine \(P(H)\) (the prior probability of Adam being in that field), \(P(E|H)\) (the likelihood of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is enrolled in that field), and \(P(E|\neg H)\) (the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in that field).

While precise numerical values for these probabilities aren't provided, we can make reasonable estimations based on the information given.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - **P(H):** Let's assume a prior probability (P(H)). Given Adam's interests, this seems plausible. Let's assume a moderate prior.
   - **P(E|H):** Adam's personality sketch aligns well with someone in agricultural and veterinary science due to his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. Let's assign a high probability to this.
   - **P(E|\neg H):** Since the characteristics match quite well, the probability is relatively lower if he is not in this field.

2. **Business Administration**
   - **P(H):** Business Administration is a common field, but his personality traits do not particularly align well with it. Let's assume a lower prior probability.
   - **P(E|H):** Adam's personality traits do not strongly align with typical business administration students. Let's assign a lower probability here.
   - **P(E|\neg H):** This probability would be higher since the personality traits are not specific to business administration.

3. **Computer Science**
   - **P(H):** Computer Science is quite common, and his intelligence and problem-solving skills align moderately with this field. Let's assume a moderate prior probability.
   - **P(E|H):** Some traits align (like intelligence and problem-solving ability), but others (like strong empathy and love for animals) do not align as well. Let's assign a moderate probability here.
   - **P(E|\neg H):** There will be a relatively moderate probability since some traits fit, but many do not.

Here are the plausible values for these fields:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7, // High likelihood due to matching traits
  "business administration": 0.2, // Low likelihood due to mismatched traits
  "computer science": 0.4  // Moderate likelihood due to partial matching traits
}
```

This analysis is qualitative and based on reasonable assumptions given the personality sketch. Actual numerical values would depend on more precise data.
