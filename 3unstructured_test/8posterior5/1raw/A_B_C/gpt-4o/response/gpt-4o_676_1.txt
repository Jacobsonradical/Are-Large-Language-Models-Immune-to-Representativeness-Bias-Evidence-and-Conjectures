Sure, let's go through each field one by one. Given the information in Adam's personality sketch, I will estimate the probabilities and compute the posterior probabilities using Bayes' rule. Here, \[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \], but for simplicity, I'll just give the posterior probability estimates conceptually.

### Assumptions:
- \( P(H) \) values are assumed as prior beliefs about the likelihood of graduates enrolling in these fields.
- \( P(E|H) \) values are the likelihoods of Adam's personality traits given that he is in each field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) values are the likelihoods of Adam's personality traits given that he is not in each field.

Let's assume the following P(H) based on general graduate enrollment data:
- Business Administration: 0.2
- Computer Science: 0.3
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.1

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|H) \) is likely low because Adam's traits align poorly with typical business administration traits (e.g., curiosity about nature, love for animals), so let's say 0.1.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Let's assume the combined likelihood of Adam's traits among other fields is higher, so let's approximate it as 0.5 to normalize.

Using Bayes rule:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \times P(H) = 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02 \]

### Computer Science
- \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|H) \) is moderate because computer science students can be interested in puzzles, abstract concepts, but not necessarily nature, so let's say 0.4.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Here, let's approximate it as 0.5.

Using Bayes rule:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \times P(H) = 0.4 \times 0.3 = 0.12 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H) \) is high because Adam's traits are highly compatible with this field (curiosity about nature, love for animals), so let's say 0.8.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Here, let's approximate it as 0.5.

Using Bayes rule:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \times P(H) = 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \]

### Normalized Estimates (for consistency)

To provide a more interpretable set of values, let's normalize these:

\[ P(business\ administration|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.12 + 0.08} = \frac{0.02}{0.22} \approx 0.09 \]
\[ P(computer\ science|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.02 + 0.12 + 0.08} = \frac{0.12}{0.22} \approx 0.55 \]
\[ P(agricultural\ and\ veterinary\ science|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.02 + 0.12 + 0.08} = \frac{0.08}{0.22} \approx 0.36 \]

Thus, the output is:

{
  "business administration": 0.09,
  "computer science": 0.55,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.36
}
