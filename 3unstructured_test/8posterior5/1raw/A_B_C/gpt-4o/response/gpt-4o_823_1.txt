Let's evaluate the given probabilities based on the personality sketch of Adam and the potential fields of studies.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1)**
   - **P(H1)**: Prior probability that any graduate student is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
     - A rough approximation might be 0.05 or 5%, considering not many graduate students choose this field compared to more common fields.
   - **P(E|H1)**: Probability that the personality sketch E matches if Adam was in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
     - Given Adam's love for nature, animals, and hard work, this seems very high, maybe around 0.9.
   - **P(E|¬H1)**: Probability that the personality sketch E matches if Adam was not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
     - This might be lower since not all fields align well with the given traits, maybe around 0.2.

Using Bayes' Theorem: 
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is common across all fields for comparison and using simplified relative terms:
\[ P(H1|E) \propto P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1) \]
\[ P(H1|E) \approx 0.9 \cdot 0.05 = 0.045 \]

2. **Business Administration (H2)**
   - **P(H2)**: Prior probability that any graduate student is in Business Administration.
     - A reasonable approximation might be 0.2 or 20%.
   - **P(E|H2)**: Probability that the personality sketch E matches if Adam was in Business Administration.
     - Adam's traits do not strongly align with business administration, so this might be around 0.1.
   - **P(E|¬H2)**: Probability that the personality sketch E matches if Adam was not in Business Administration.
     - Since there are many other fields, let’s guess it at 0.3.

Using Bayes' Theorem: 
\[ P(H2|E) \propto P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2) \]
\[ P(H2|E) \approx 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

3. **Computer Science (H3)**
   - **P(H3)**: Prior probability that any graduate student is in Computer Science.
     - A reasonable approximation might be 0.15 or 15%.
   - **P(E|H3)**: Probability that the personality sketch E matches if Adam was in Computer Science.
     - Adam’s high intelligence and interest in solving puzzles align fairly well, so maybe around 0.4.
   - **P(E|¬H3)**: Probability that the personality sketch E matches if Adam was not in Computer Science.
     - Assuming moderate alignment with other fields, maybe around 0.3.

Using Bayes' Theorem: 
\[ P(H3|E) \propto P(E|H3) \cdot P(H3) \]
\[ P(H3|E) \approx 0.4 \cdot 0.15 = 0.06 \]

Putting it all together, we can normalize these values in context as follows:
\[ \text{Normalize Factor: } 0.045 + 0.02 + 0.06 = 0.125 \]

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{0.045}{0.125} \approx 0.36 \),
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.02}{0.125} \approx 0.16 \),
  "computer science": \( \frac{0.06}{0.125} \approx 0.48 \)
}

So, the final probabilities based on Bayes’ rule are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.36,
  "business administration": 0.16,
  "computer science": 0.48
}
