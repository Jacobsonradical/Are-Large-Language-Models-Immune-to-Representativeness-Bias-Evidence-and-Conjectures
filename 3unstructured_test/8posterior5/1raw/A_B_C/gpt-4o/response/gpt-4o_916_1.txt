To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to assess \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each hypothesis \( H \). Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) remains constant across the fields for comparison, we only need to compute the numerator \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for each field. Let's go through each field one by one.

### Computer Science

1. **\( P(H) \) (Prior Probability)**:
   - The probability that a random graduate student is in computer science. This field is quite popular, so a fair estimate might be around \( 0.15 \).

2. **\( P(E|H) \) (Likelihood)**:
   - Given Adam's traits, how likely are we to observe these traits in a computer science student? Adam's love for puzzles and high intelligence align well with this field, but his deep love for nature and animals might not be a strong indicator. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) to be about \( 0.3 \).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \) (Complement Likelihood)**:
   - This is the probability of observing Adam's traits if he is not in computer science. Since these traits are fairly common among people in other fields, we might estimate this to be about \( 0.2 \).

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} = \frac{0.045}{P(E)} \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **\( P(H) \) (Prior Probability)**:
   - The probability that a random graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. It is less common compared to computer science but plausible, so let's estimate \( 0.05 \).

2. **\( P(E|H) \) (Likelihood)**:
   - Given Adam's traits, how likely are we to observe these traits in this field? His love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication align strongly. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) to be about \( 0.8 \).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \) (Complement Likelihood)**:
   - As before, let's estimate this to be about \( 0.2 \).

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} = \frac{0.04}{P(E)} \]

### Business Administration

1. **\( P(H) \) (Prior Probability)**:
   - The probability that a random graduate student is in business administration. This is also quite a common field, around \( 0.15 \).

2. **\( P(E|H) \) (Likelihood)**:
   - Adam's traits, such as empathy and intelligence, might be somewhat relevant but not strongly indicative of business administration. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) to be about \( 0.2 \).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \) (Complement Likelihood)**:
   - Same as before, let's estimate this to be about \( 0.2 \).

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} = \frac{0.03}{P(E)} \]

Let's normalize these (approximating \( P(E) \) as the sum):

\[ P(E) \approx 0.045 + 0.04 + 0.03 = 0.115 \]

Then:

1. Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.045}{0.115} = 0.391 \]

2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.04}{0.115} = 0.348 \]

3. Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.03}{0.115} = 0.261 \]

Thus, our final results are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.391,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.348,
  "business administration": 0.261
}
