Sure, let's go through each field. I will use the following notations:
- \( P(H) \): The initial probability that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was not enrolled in the field.
- \( P(H|E) \): The probability that Adam was enrolled in the field given his personality sketch, computed using Bayes' rule: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We first need to estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field.

### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): Assume a reasonable base rate for this field among graduate students. Let's say it’s \( 0.05 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Given his interest in nature, animals, and empathy, it’s highly likely. Estimate \( 0.8 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Less likely to have these traits in non-related fields, but not impossible. Estimate \( 0.3 \).

Using Bayes' rule: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} = \frac{0.04}{P(E)} \]

### 2. Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): Assume a reasonable base rate for this field. Let’s say it’s \( 0.15 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Less likely based on his personality sketch. Estimate \( 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): More likely this personality fits outside business administration. Estimate \( 0.4 \).

Using Bayes' rule: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} = \frac{0.015}{P(E)} \]

### 3. Computer Science
- \( P(H) \): Assume a reasonable base rate. Let’s say it’s \( 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Some fit due to his intelligence and puzzle-solving skills. Estimate \( 0.4 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likely to find such traits outside of this field too. Estimate \( 0.3 \).

Using Bayes' rule: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.04}{P(E)} \]

We don’t have \( P(E) \) but it is the same for all fields, so we can ignore it for comparison purposes.

Putting it all together:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.04,
  "business administration": 0.015,
  "computer science": 0.04
}
```

This shows that based on the personality sketch, Adam is equally likely to be enrolled in "agricultural and veterinary science" and "computer science", and less likely to be enrolled in "business administration".
