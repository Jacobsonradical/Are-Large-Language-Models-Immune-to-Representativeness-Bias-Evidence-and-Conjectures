To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each of the given fields, we can use Bayes' rule, which is stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we don't have the exact values for all probabilities, so we'll make qualitative assessments based on the personality sketch provided for Adam.

### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)** (Prior Probability):
  - Agricultural and veterinary science is a plausible field given Adam's love for nature and animals.
  - Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.15 \), since there's a moderately higher chance he may pursue this field.

- **P(E|H)** (Likelihood):
  - The personality traits fit well with this field. 
  - High likelihood: Let's assign \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).

- **P(E|¬H)** (Complement Likelihood):
  - Considering there are many other fields he could be interested in, and not all fit the personality as well.
  - Moderate likelihood for a field not being related to nature, animals, or puzzles: \( P(E|¬H) = 0.3 \).

\[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science} | E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.15}{P(E)} \]

### 2. Business Administration

- **P(H)**:
  - Business administration is less likely given Adam's personality sketch that doesn't emphasize business-oriented traits.
  - Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).

- **P(E|H)**:
  - The traits don't align particularly well with business administration.
  - Low likelihood: Let's assign \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).

- **P(E|¬H)**:
  - Higher than random chance since there are many fields and this one may not align well with his traits.
  - Moderate likelihood: \( P(E|¬H) = 0.4 \).

\[ P(\text{Business Administration} | E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.05}{P(E)} \]

### 3. Computer Science

- **P(H)**:
  - Computer science can be plausible due to his intelligence and love for solving puzzles.
  - Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

- **P(E|H)**:
  - Some traits align (intelligence, puzzles), but not all (nature, animals).
  - Moderate likelihood: Let's assign \( P(E|H) = 0.6 \).

- **P(E|¬H)**:
  - Given the nature connection, moderate chance if not aligned with computer science.
  - Let's assume \( P(E|¬H) = 0.4 \).

\[ P(\text{Computer Science} | E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]

### Normalizing the Probabilities
We need to normalize our final conditional probabilities, so we compute:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_1)P(H_1) + P(E|H_2)P(H_2) + P(E|H_3)P(H_3) + \ldots \]

Where:
- \( H_1 \) is Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( H_2 \) is Business Administration
- \( H_3 \) is Computer Science

\[ P(E) = (0.9 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.05) + (0.6 \times 0.2) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.135 + 0.01 + 0.12 = 0.265 \]

Now we use:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Summarized conditional probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": (0.9 * 0.15) / 0.265 = 0.509,
  "business administration": (0.2 * 0.05) / 0.265 = 0.038,
  "computer science": (0.6 * 0.2) / 0.265 = 0.453
}
```

Therefore:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.509,
  "business administration": 0.038,
  "computer science": 0.453
}
```
