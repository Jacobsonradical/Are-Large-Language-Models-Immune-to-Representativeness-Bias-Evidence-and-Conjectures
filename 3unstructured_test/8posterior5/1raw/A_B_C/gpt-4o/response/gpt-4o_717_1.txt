To apply Bayes' rule and determine the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given Adam's personality sketch, we need to estimate the following:

1. **Prior Probability (\( P(H) \))**: The initial probability of Adam being in a particular field.
2. **Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \))**: The probability of observing the given personality sketch if Adam is in that field.
3. **Complement Likelihood (\( P(E|\neg H) \))**: The probability of observing the given personality sketch if Adam is **not** in that field.

Let's assign some reasonable estimations:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \) for each field**: Given there are many graduate fields, let's assume:
   - Agricultural and veterinary science: \( 0.1 \)
   - Business administration: \( 0.2 \)
   - Computer science: \( 0.1 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - **Agricultural and veterinary science**: Given Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, high empathy, and appreciation for hard work, the likelihood that these traits fit this field is very high. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).
   - **Business administration**: This field does not seem to strongly match Adamâ€™s traits. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
   - **Computer science**: Given Adam's intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles, this is a good fit. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.6 \).

3. **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - **Agricultural and veterinary science**: This would be high because Adam's personality traits do fit a broader range of fields. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).
   - **Business administration**: Given that we don't find these traits compelling for this field, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).
   - **Computer science**: Adam's traits are quite specific and align well with several other fields apart from computer science. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

Now, compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

The denominator \( P(E) \) can be computed as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

Let's do the computations:

1. **Agricultural and veterinary science**:
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) = 0.9 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9 = 0.09 + 0.18 = 0.27
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{0.27} \approx 0.33
   \]

2. **Business administration**:
   \[
   P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.8 = 0.02 + 0.4 = 0.42
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.42} \approx 0.048
   \]

3. **Computer science**:
   \[
   P(E) = 0.6 \cdot 0.1 + 0.4 \cdot 0.9 = 0.06 + 0.36 = 0.42
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.1}{0.42} \approx 0.143
   \]

Hence, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.33,
  "business administration": 0.048,
  "computer science": 0.143
}
