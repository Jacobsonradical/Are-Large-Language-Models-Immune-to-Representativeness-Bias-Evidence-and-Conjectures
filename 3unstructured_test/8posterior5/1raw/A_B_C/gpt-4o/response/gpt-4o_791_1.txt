To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to start with prior probabilities \( P(H) \), likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the complement \( P(E|\neg H) \). Let's hypothetically assign these values based on the given personality sketch of Adam:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): Let's assume a moderate number of graduate students are enrolled in computer science compared to other fields. Suppose \( P(H) = 0.3 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): A quiet boy who likes solving puzzles fits computer science well. Suppose \( P(E|H) = 0.6 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given Adam's interest and personality traits, these might be less aligned with other unrelated fields like business administration, but some traits match other fields. Suppose \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): Fewer students might enroll in this field compared to computer science. Suppose \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's curiosity about nature and love for animals fit perfectly here. Suppose \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): This field is specific, so these traits are less likely in \( \neg H \). Suppose \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

3. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H) \): This is another popular field but might be less attractive to someone with Adam's described interests. Suppose \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): His warm heart and empathy can relate to business administration, particularly in HR or CSR. Suppose \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): These traits might slightly align with other non-business fields. Suppose \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where 
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

4. **Calculations:**

- **Computer Science:**
  \[
  P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.3}{(0.6 \times 0.3) + (0.4 \times 0.7)} = \frac{0.18}{0.18 + 0.28} \approx 0.391
  \]

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
  \[
  P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.2}{(0.9 \times 0.2) + (0.2 \times 0.8)} = \frac{0.18}{0.18 + 0.16} \approx 0.529
  \]

- **Business Administration:**
  \[
  P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{(0.3 \times 0.2) + (0.4 \times 0.8)} = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.32} \approx 0.158
  \]

5. **Results:**

{
  "computer science": 0.391,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.529,
  "business administration": 0.158
