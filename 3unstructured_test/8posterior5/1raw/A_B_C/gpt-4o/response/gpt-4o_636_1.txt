To calculate the probabilities, we need to make some educated estimations based on the given personality traits of Adam and how they align with each field. Let’s step through each field:

1. **Computer Science (CS)**:
   - **P(H)**: The general probability of a graduate student being in CS.
   - **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he is in CS.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he is not in CS.

2. **Business Administration (BA)**:
   - **P(H)**: The general probability of a graduate student being in BA.
   - **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he is in BA.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he is not in BA.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS)**:
   - **P(H)**: The general probability of a graduate student being in AVS.
   - **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he is in AVS.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he is not in AVS.

Assumptions:
1. To proceed, we must make assumptions for P(H) based on the typical distribution of graduate students across fields.
2. Additionally, we must estimate P(E|H) and P(E|\neg H) based on how well Adam’s traits align with each field.

Let's assume:
- **P(CS)** = 0.30 (30% of graduate students might be in CS)
- **P(BA)** = 0.25 (25% of graduate students might be in BA)
- **P(AVS)** = 0.15 (15% of graduate students might be in AVS)

Given Adam's personality traits:
1. **P(E|CS)**: Adam's traits partially align with solving puzzles and abstract concepts, but not as strongly with empathy and animals – let's estimate this to be 0.50.
2. **P(E|BA)**: His traits do not strongly align with business administration roles which are more extroverted and competitive typically – let's estimate 0.10.
3. **P(E|AVS)**: His traits (empathy, love for animals, appreciation for hard work) strongly align with AVS – let's estimate this to be 0.90.

- **P(E|\neg CS)**: Average distribution among non-CS fields – let's estimate this to be 0.30.
- **P(E|\neg BA)**: Average distribution among non-BA fields – let's estimate this to be 0.50.
- **P(E|\neg AVS)**: Average distribution among non-AVS fields – let's estimate this to be 0.30.

Given these assumptions, use Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where P(E) can be computed as the sum of P(E|H) * P(H) across all possibilities.

### Calculations:
1. **Computer Science (CS)**
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(E|\text{BA}) \cdot P(\text{BA}) + P(E|\text{AVS}) \cdot P(\text{AVS}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.50 \cdot 0.30 + 0.10 \cdot 0.25 + 0.90 \cdot 0.15 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.15 + 0.025 + 0.135 = 0.31 \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.50 \cdot 0.30}{0.31} \approx 0.48 \]

2. **Business Administration (BA)**
\[ P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{BA}) \cdot P(\text{BA})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{0.10 \cdot 0.25}{0.31} \approx 0.08 \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS)**
\[ P(\text{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{AVS}) \cdot P(\text{AVS})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.90 \cdot 0.15}{0.31} \approx 0.44 \]
