Let's denote the hypotheses as follows:
- \( H_1 \): Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( H_2 \): Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( H_3 \): Adam was enrolled in computer science.

Here's how we can approach the calculations:
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each of these fields based on commonality and other general knowledge.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in a particular field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not in a particular field.

Based on the given personality sketch:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H_1)**: This could be relatively moderate if we assume that many students do not typically go into agricultural and veterinary science compared to more popular fields like business or computer science.
- **P(E|H_1)**: High, as Adamâ€™s love for animals, nature, and strong empathy aligns well with this field.
- **P(E|\neg H_1)**: Lower than P(E|H_1), but there are other fields where his traits could be commonly found.

### Business Administration

- **P(H_2)**: Possibly higher due to the large number of students pursuing business administration.
- **P(E|H_2)**: Low, as Adam's sketch does not strongly align with typical traits nurtured or required in business administration.
- **P(E|\neg H_2)**: Higher than P(E|H_2) because his traits are less represented in business administration.

### Computer Science

- **P(H_3)**: Moderately high due to the popularity of the field.
- **P(E|H_3)**: Moderate, as his intelligence and capacity for abstract concepts fit; however, his empathy and love for animals are less relevant to the field.
- **P(E|\neg H_3)**: This will be lower because his traits also fit better in fields like life sciences.

Using Bayes' Rule \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \), we can qualitatively approximate:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[
   \text{Prior}, P(H_1) \approx 0.2
   \]
   \[
   P(E|H_1) \approx 0.8 
   \]
   \[
   P(E|\neg H_1) \approx 0.3 
   \]
   \[
   \text{Posterior}, P(H_1|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \approx 0.16 \text{ (after normalization)}
   \]

2. **Business Administration**:
   \[
   \text{Prior}, P(H_2) \approx 0.3
   \]
   \[
   P(E|H_2) \approx 0.1
   \]
   \[
   P(E|\neg H_2) \approx 0.5
   \]
   \[
   \text{Posterior}, P(H_2|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \times 0.3}{P(E)} \approx 0.03 \text{ (after normalization)}
   \]

3. **Computer Science**:
   \[
   \text{Prior}, P(H_3) \approx 0.4
   \]
   \[
   P(E|H_3) \approx 0.5
   \]
   \[
   P(E|\neg H_3) \approx 0.4
   \]
   \[
   \text{Posterior}, P(H_3|E) \approx \frac{0.5 \times 0.4}{P(E)} \approx 0.20 \text{ (after normalization)}
   \]

Here's a summary in the requested format:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.16,
  "business administration": 0.03,
  "computer science": 0.20
}
```

Note: These values are approximate and inferred based on the qualitative assessment given the personality sketch of Adam. The normalization factor \(P(E)\) is not calculated exactly but is considered uniformly across all hypotheses.
