Let's break down the information for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that any given graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume this is relatively low because it is a specialized field. Assume P(H) is 0.05 (5%).
   - **P(E|H)**: If Adam is in this field, the probability of his traits (genuine curiosity about nature and plants, quiet, enjoys puzzles, strong empathy, loves animals, high intelligence, understanding of hard work, and dedication) aligns well. Let's set this at 0.90 (90%).
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: If Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science, the probability of having the same personality sketch is less likely. Let's assume 0.05 (5%).

2. **Computer Science**
   - **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that any given graduate student is in computer science. Given the popularity of this field, let's assume P(H) is 0.30 (30%).
   - **P(E|H)**: If Adam is in computer science, the probability of his traits matching (enjoys solving puzzles, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts) is moderate, but less aligned with his strong empathy and love for animals. Assume 0.30 (30%).
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: If Adam is not in computer science, the probability of having the same personality sketch is quite similar considering many students in other fields might also share these traits. Let's assume 0.10 (10%).

3. **Business Administration**
   - **P(H)**: The prior probability that any given graduate student is in business administration is relatively high. Let's assume P(H) is 0.20 (20%).
   - **P(E|H)**: If Adam is in business administration, the probability of matching his traits (warm heart, strong empathy, understanding hard work) is moderate but less likely related to nature and animals. Assume 0.20 (20%).
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: If Adam is not in business administration, the probability of having the same personality sketch could be quite different since this field generally attracts different personality traits. Assume 0.10 (10%).

Using Bayesâ€™ rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(E) = 0.90 \cdot 0.05 + 0.05 \cdot 0.95 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.045 + 0.0475 = 0.0925 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.90 \cdot 0.05}{0.0925} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.0925} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.486 \]

**Computer Science:**
\[ P(E) = 0.30 \cdot 0.30 + 0.10 \cdot 0.70 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.09 + 0.07 = 0.16 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.30 \cdot 0.30}{0.16} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.16} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.5625 \]

**Business Administration:**
\[ P(E) = 0.20 \cdot 0.20 + 0.10 \cdot 0.80 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.08 = 0.12 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.20 \cdot 0.20}{0.12} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.12} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.333 \]
