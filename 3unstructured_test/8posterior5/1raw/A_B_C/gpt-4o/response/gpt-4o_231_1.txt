Let's break down the process for each of the fields mentioned. 

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science without any other information:
   - This will depend on the overall likelihood of students enrolling in this field. Let's assume it's reasonably likely but not one of the most common fields.
   - Let's assume P(H) = 0.1.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science:
   - Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy fit well with this field.
   - Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.7.

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science:
   - Given that there are many fields where Adam's traits could also be relevant, this might still be likely but less probable than within the field of agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Here \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \).
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9)  = 0.07 + 0.27 = 0.34 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.34} = \frac{0.07}{0.34} \approx 0.2059 \]

### Business Administration

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration:
   - This is a common field, so let's assume P(H) = 0.2.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is in business administration:
   - Adam's traits are not strongly related to business administration, but there are aspects such as solving puzzles and high intelligence that may be relevant.
   - Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.3.

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not in business administration:
   - We already used 0.3 above, so let's stick with that.
   - Let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Here \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \).
\[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8)  = 0.06 + 0.24 = 0.30 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.30} = \frac{0.06}{0.30} = 0.2 \]

### Computer Science

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science:
   - This is also a common field, so let's assume P(H) = 0.2.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is in computer science:
   - His interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts fits well here.
   - Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.5.

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not in computer science:
   - This would be similar to the earlier estimates.
   - Let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Here \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \).
\[ P(E) = (0.5 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8)  = 0.1 + 0.24 = 0.34 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.34} = \frac{0.10}{0.34} \approx 0.2941 \]

Hence, the final calculations are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.2059,
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.2941
}
