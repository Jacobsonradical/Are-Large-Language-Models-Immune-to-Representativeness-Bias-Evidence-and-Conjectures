To determine the probabilities, we will use Bayes' Theorem: 

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is not enrolled in the given field.

We need to first make subjective estimates for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field.

### 1. Business Administration

- **P(H)**: The probability of any given graduate student being enrolled in Business Administration. Given a broad range of fields, let's estimate:
  \[
  P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.2
  \]

- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam having his personality traits if he were in Business Administration.
  Considering that Adam shows traits of curiosity about nature, a love for animals, and empathy which are not typically associated closely with business administration:
  \[
  P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.1
  \]

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of Adam having his personality traits if he were not in Business Administration.
  Since his traits might be more commonly associated with other fields like agricultural sciences:
  \[
  P(E|\neg H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.6
  \]

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}})}{P(E)}
\]

### 2. Computer Science

- **P(H)**: The probability of any given graduate student being enrolled in Computer Science:
  \[
  P(H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.3
  \]

- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam having his personality traits if he were in Computer Science.
  Adam is quiet and enjoys solving puzzles, which is more associated with computer science:
  \[
  P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.4
  \]

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of Adam having his personality traits if he were not in Computer Science:
  \[
  P(E|\neg H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.3
  \]

### 3. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)**: The probability of any given graduate student being enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
  \[
  P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.1
  \]

- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam having his personality traits if he were in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. This field matches well with his love for nature and animals:
  \[
  P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.8
  \]

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of Adam having his personality traits if he were not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
  \[
  P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.3
  \]

\[
P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})}{P(E)}
\]

Now, note that \[
P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}}) + P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}}) + P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})
\]

Which leads to calculations:

For simplicity and without exact normalization:
\[
P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.4 \cdot 0.3) + (0.8 \cdot 0.1) = 0.02 + 0.12 + 0.08 = 0.22
\]

Calculating the posterior probability for each field:

- Business Administration:
\[
P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.22} \approx 0.09
\]

- Computer Science:
\[
P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{0.22} \approx 0.55
\]

- Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[
P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.22} \approx 0.36
\]

Final answer in the given format:

{
  "business administration": 0.09,
  "computer science": 0.55,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.36
}
