Let's break down the probabilities for each field, starting with the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for the fields, the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihoods of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H) \).
  
### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)**: Let's assume that among a wide array of graduate studies, the proportion of students enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is relatively low, say around 0.05 (or 5%).
- **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's personality sketch, particularly his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and warm-hearted nature, it is highly plausible he could be in this field. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).
- **P(E|¬H)**: This probability signifies how likely Adam's traits are if he is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Considering the entire pool of graduate students, it's fairly moderate. Let's estimate \( P(E|¬H) = 0.2 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{0.7 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.95} \approx 0.155 \]

### Computer Science

- **P(H)**: Computer Science is a very popular graduate field. Let's assume a prior of 0.2 (or 20%).
- **P(E|H)**: Adam's intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles support this hypothesis. However, his love for nature and animals is less aligned with this field. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \).
- **P(E|¬H)**: Considering a broader graduate population, this probability might still be moderate. Let's estimate \( P(E|¬H) = 0.3 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8} \approx 0.25 \]

### Business Administration

- **P(H)**: Business Administration is another popular graduate field. Let's assume a prior of 0.15 (or 15%).
- **P(E|H)**: Adam’s traits don't strongly align with Business Administration. Let's conservatively estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).
- **P(E|¬H)**: Given the larger graduate population, let's estimate \( P(E|¬H) = 0.25 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{0.2 \cdot 0.15 + 0.25 \cdot 0.85} \approx 0.12 \]
