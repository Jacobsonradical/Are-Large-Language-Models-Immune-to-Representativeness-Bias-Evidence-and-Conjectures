Let's use Bayes' theorem to compute \( P(H|E) \) for each of the fields:

Bayes' theorem can be formulated as:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

For each field, we need to estimate:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the evidence given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the evidence given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.

We will estimate \( P(H|E) \) for each field: agricultural and veterinary science, computer science, and business administration.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- \( P(H) \): Let's assume this is relatively low, say 0.05, considering the broad range of graduate fields available.
- \( P(E|H) \): Given that Adam has a love for nature, animals, and plants, this probability is high, say 0.9.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the evidence given he is not in this field can be estimated lower, say 0.2, as his interests strongly align with this field.

### Computer Science

- \( P(H) \): Let's assume this is moderately high, say 0.2, considering it is a popular field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, this is moderate, say 0.5.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the evidence given he is not in this field could be moderately high, say 0.4, since analytical skills are valuable in many different fields.

### Business Administration

- \( P(H) \): Given Adam's personality sketch, this seems less likely, so let's set it low, say 0.05.
- \( P(E|H) \): Given his characteristics, this might be low, say 0.2.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): This would be higher given the sketch does not particularly align with business administration, say 0.4.

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step calculation for \( P(H|E) \):

1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   Assuming \( P(E) \) is the same for all fields as a normalization constant:
   \[
   P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.9 \times 0.05 = 0.045
   \]

2. Computer Science:
   \[
   P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.5 \times 0.2 = 0.1
   \]

3. Business Administration:
   \[
   P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \times 0.05 = 0.01
   \]

To get the proportional probabilities into a convenient range, we need to normalize them by summing these values (0.045 + 0.1 + 0.01 = 0.155) and then dividing each tentative \( P(H|E) \) by this sum:

So we normalize:

\[
P(H|E)_{agricultural \ and \ veterinary \ science} = \frac{0.045}{0.155} \approx 0.29
\]
\[
P(H|E)_{computer \ science} = \frac{0.1}{0.155} \approx 0.65
\]
\[
P(H|E)_{business \ administration} = \frac{0.01}{0.155} \approx 0.06
\]

Final answers:

  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.29,
  "computer science": 0.65,
  "business administration": 0.06
