To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study using Bayes' Rule, we need to first understand the relevant probabilities:

Bayes' Rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of Adam having the personality sketch \( E \) given he is enrolled in the field \( H \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of Adam having the personality sketch \( E \) given he is not enrolled in the field \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of Adam having the personality sketch \( E \).

For simplicity, we'll assess these values based on intuitive judgments backed by the provided personality sketch. To avoid unnecessary complexity, we'll not estimate an exact value for \( P(E) \) directly but will use it implicitly for comparison.

Here is the analysis for each field:

### Business Administration
- **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Let's assume the prior probability of enrolling in business administration is moderate given the frequency of business programs.
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Likely low since Adam's interests and personality traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, solving puzzles) don't strongly align with this field.
- **Complementary Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Could be higher relatively since there are other fields that align better with his traits.

### Computer Science
- **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Moderate to high due to the popularity and wide availability of computer science programs.
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Moderate. Adam enjoys solving puzzles and understands abstract concepts, which aligns well with computer science.
- **Complementary Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: High. As many other fields could also explain his traits well.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Lower than computer science but could be moderate depending on the university context.
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: High. Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align perfectly with this field.
- **Complementary Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Lower relative to this field, since this field uniquely aligns with his traits.

### Prior Variables:
- Letâ€™s assume \( P(H) \approx 0.25 \) for each since other computer science could be more prevalent but providing a spread balance.

We'll use relative values to estimate \( P(H|E) \):

### Numerical Values for P(H|E):

Given:

- For Business Administration:
  - \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \)
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \)
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.8 \)

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

### Final Probabilities:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.9
}
```

These values reflect the relative fit for Adam's personality with each field, given the Bayes rule and the alignment discussed.
