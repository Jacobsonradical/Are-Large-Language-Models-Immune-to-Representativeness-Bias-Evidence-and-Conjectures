To apply Bayesian analysis, we break down the calculations into different components: prior probabilities \(P(H)\), likelihoods \(P(E|H)\) and \(P(E|\neg H)\), and then compute the posterior probabilities \(P(H|E)\). Here are the inferred probabilities for each field based on the given personality sketch E of Adam:

1. **Business Administration:**
   - \(P(H)\): Let's assume the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a business administration program is moderate, given no specific evidence. Let's say \(P(H) = 0.2\).
   - \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood of Adam's personality fitting a typical business administration student is not incredibly high. Adam's empathy and love for animals don't strongly align with what you'd typically expect in business administration. Let's estimate \(P(E|H) = 0.2\).
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\): Considering a personality with Adam’s traits fit a field other than business administration better, let's consider the likelihood of the sketch given another field as relatively high. Let's say \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.8\).
   - Applying Bayes' theorem:
     \[
     P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
     \]
     Bayes' Rule components:
     \[
     P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) = 0.2 \cdot 0.2 + 0.8 \cdot 0.8 = 0.04 + 0.64 = 0.68
     \]
     Posterior probability:
     \[
     P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.68} \approx 0.0588 \approx 0.06
     \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \(P(H)\): Let's assume it is likely that a graduate student might be enrolled in this field given no specific evidence. For instance, \(P(H) = 0.3\).
   - \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood that Adam’s personality fits this field well is high due to interests in nature, plants, and animals. Let's say \(P(E|H) = 0.9\).
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\): The likelihood of having Adam's profile in a field other than agricultural and veterinary science is lower. Assume \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.4\).
   - Applying Bayes’ theorem:
     \[
     P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
     \]
     Bayes’ Rule components:
     \[
     P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) = 0.9 \cdot 0.3 + 0.4 \cdot 0.7 = 0.27 + 0.28 = 0.55
     \]
     Posterior probability:
     \[
     P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.3}{0.55} \approx 0.4909 \approx 0.49
     \]

3. **Computer Science:**
   - \(P(H)\): Computer science is a common field, so let's say \(P(H) = 0.25\).
   - \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood of Adam's profile fitting computer science is moderate, given his high intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles. Let's assume \(P(E|H) = 0.6\).
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\): Considering the profiles fitting other fields, let’s estimate this at \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.5\).
   - Applying Bayes’ theorem:
     \[
     P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
     \]
     Bayes’ Rule components:
     \[
     P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) = 0.6 \cdot 0.25 + 0.5 \cdot 0.75 = 0.15 + 0.375 = 0.525
     \]
     Posterior probability:
     \[
     P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.25}{0.525} \approx 0.2857 \approx 0.29
     \]

Based on these calculations, here are the posterior probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.06,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.49,
  "computer science": 0.29
}
