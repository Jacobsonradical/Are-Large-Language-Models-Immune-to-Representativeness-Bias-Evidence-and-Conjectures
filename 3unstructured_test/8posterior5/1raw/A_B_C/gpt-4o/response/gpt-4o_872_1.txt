To calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the probability of the evidence under the negation of the hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H) \). Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be broken down using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Given Adam's personality sketch (E), I'll estimate the values needed for the calculations.

- **Computer Science:**
  - \( P(H) \) (the prior probability of Adam being in Computer Science): Let's assume a general prior of 0.3 (this is an estimation and can vary depending on the context).
  - \( P(E|H) \) (the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given Adam is in Computer Science): Considering Adam's traits like high intelligence, problem-solving skills, and appreciation for hard work, but considering his deep love for nature and animals which might be less common in CS, an estimation of 0.2 seems reasonable.
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \): This represents the probability of seeing Adam's personality sketch among students not in Computer Science. Given that the personality traits might be common in other fields like Agricultural and Veterinary Science, an estimation of 0.5 seems reasonable.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{Computer Science}} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{0.2 \cdot 0.3 + 0.5 \cdot 0.7} = \frac{0.06}{0.35} \approx 0.171 \]

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
  - \( P(H) \): Let's assume a general prior of 0.2.
  - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, a high probability like 0.7 seems reasonable.
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Assuming not having these traits in non-Agricultural and Veterinary Science fields is quite common, a value around 0.3 seems reasonable.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.7 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.14}{0.38} \approx 0.368 \]

- **Business Administration:**
  - \( P(H) \): Let's assume a general prior of 0.2.
  - \( P(E|H) \): While Business Administration students could have empathy and intelligence, the specific love for nature and animals might be less common, estimating 0.1 seems reasonable.
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Assuming the same traits not in Business Administration, a conservative estimation of 0.5 seems reasonable.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{Business Administration}} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.02}{0.42} \approx 0.048 \]

So, the computed values are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.171,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.368,
  "business administration": 0.048
}
```
