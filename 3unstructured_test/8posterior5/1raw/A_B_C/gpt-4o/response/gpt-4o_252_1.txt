To compute the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the three fields (computer science, agricultural and veterinary science, business administration) given his personality sketch \(E\), we'll use Bayes' Rule. We need to estimate \(P(H)\), \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E|\neg H)\), and then plug these into Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assuming \(P(E)\) is the same for all fields and can be disregarded in relative comparisons, we focus on:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

**Estimates for the fields**:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - \(P(H)\): Moderate baseline probability since many students choose this field.
   - \(P(E|H)\): Low to moderate, as Adam's traits (warm heart, empathy, love for animals, curiosity about nature) are not particularly aligned with the stereotype of computer science.
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\): Moderate to high, as these traits might be more common in non-CS fields.
   
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \(P(H)\): Relatively lower baseline probability compared to CS due to fewer students choosing it.
   - \(P(E|H)\): High, as Adam's traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals) align well with this field.
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\): Moderate to high, as these traits are not unique to agriculture but still suggest a preference away from fields not related to nature or animals.

3. **Business Administration**:
   - \(P(H)\): Moderate baseline probability, similar to CS.
   - \(P(E|H)\): Low, as these traits (empathy, love for animals, interest in nature) are not strongly related to business administration.
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\): High, since these traits would likely align better with non-business fields.

Given these assessments, let's assign some probabilities (note these are relative and not exact values):

{
  "computer science": 0.10,  // Moderate P(H), Low P(E|H), High P(E|\neg H)
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.60,  // Low P(H), High P(E|H), Moderate P(E|\neg H)
  "business administration": 0.05   // Moderate P(H), Low P(E|H), High P(E|\neg H)
}

These values suggest Adam's traits are much more aligned with agricultural and veterinary science, which significantly increases his probability of being in that field relative to computer science and business administration.
