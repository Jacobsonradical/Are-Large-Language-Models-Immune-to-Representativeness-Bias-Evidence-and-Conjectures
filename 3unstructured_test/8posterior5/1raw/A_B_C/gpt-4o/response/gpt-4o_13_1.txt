To answer the question, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which states that:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We will analyze each of the fields by estimating the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the complement likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Assumptions are required to estimate these probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability that Adam's characteristics (E) fit each field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability that Adam's characteristics fit other fields (not H).

### Business Administration

- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Business administration is a popular graduate field, but given Adam's interests, it might not be as likely. Let's estimate \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The personality sketch is less characteristic of a business administration student. Let’s give this a low value, \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
- **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Given the large number of other graduate fields, this should be moderately high. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.3} \approx 0.033 \]

### Computer Science

- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Computer science is quite common among graduate students. Let's estimate \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's qualities could reasonably match a computer science student. Let’s estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.5 \).
- **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: We'll assume similar value as before, \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}  \approx \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.15}{0.3} \approx 0.25 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This field seems very close to Adam's interests and personality traits. Let's estimate \( P(H) = 0.05 \) (it's less common but suits Adam well).
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Very high match to Adam’s personality. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
- **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: We can place this similar to other fields, \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}  \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.3} \approx 0.133 \]

So, our results will be:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.033,
  "computer science": 0.25,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.133
}
```

Note: These results are based on subjective estimations and could vary with different assumptions about the probabilities.
