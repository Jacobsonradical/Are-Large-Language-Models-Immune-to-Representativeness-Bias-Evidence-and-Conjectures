To compute the probability of Adam being enrolled in each field given his personality sketch (E), let’s use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Where:

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in that particular field.
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch.

Let's go through each field:

1. **Computer Science (H1)**:
   - \( P(H_1) \): The prior probability of a graduate student in the U.S. being enrolled in computer science is fairly significant, due to the popularity of the field. Let's suppose this is around 0.2.
   - \( P(E|H_1) \): Given Adam's personality sketch, the likelihood he is in computer science is moderate. Interests in puzzles and high intelligence fit, but empathy and love for animals are less typical. Let's say 0.3.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_1) \): The likelihood of observing Adam’s personality sketch given he is not enrolled in computer science could be somewhat higher since empathy and love for animals are more common outside this field. Let's estimate 0.6.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H2)**:
   - \( P(H_2) \): The prior probability is lower compared to computer science. Let's suppose this is around 0.05.
   - \( P(E|H_2) \): Given Adam's personality sketch, including his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, the likelihood he is in this field is high. Let's say 0.8.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_2) \): The likelihood of observing Adam’s personality sketch given he is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science includes larger pools of students, where traits like empathy and love for animals are less specific. Let's estimate this at around 0.4.

3. **Business Administration (H3)**:
   - \( P(H_3) \): The prior probability of a graduate student being in business administration is moderate. Let's suppose around 0.15.
   - \( P(E|H_3) \): Given Adam's personality sketch, the likelihood he is in business administration is low because the traits listed aren’t strongly associated with this field. Let's say 0.1.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_3) \): The likelihood of observing Adam’s personality sketch given he is not in business administration could be moderate, similar to the overall student population. Let's estimate 0.5.

We'll assume \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant and doesn't need to be explicitly calculated for relative comparisons.

### Calculation:
For **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.6 \cdot 0.8 + 0.5 \cdot 0.85} = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.48 + 0.425} = \frac{0.06}{0.965} \approx 0.0622 \]

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.6 \cdot 0.8 + 0.5 \cdot 0.85} = \frac{0.04}{0.965} \approx 0.0415 \]

For **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H_3|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.6 \cdot 0.8 + 0.5 \cdot 0.85} = \frac{0.015}{0.965} \approx 0.0155 \]

Thus, the resulting probabilities are approximately:

{
  "computer science": 0.062,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.041,
  "business administration": 0.016
}

These values indicate that, based on Adam's personality sketch, it's still relatively unlikely he is in these specific fields given our rough but reasonable assumptions.
