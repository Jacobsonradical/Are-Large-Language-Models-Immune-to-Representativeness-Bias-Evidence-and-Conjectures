To apply Bayes' Rule, we need to calculate P(H|E) for each hypothesis H. We start by estimating the prior probabilities P(H), the likelihoods P(E|H), and the marginal probabilities P(E|Â¬H). The latter can be challenging without data, but we can make reasonable estimates based on the personality sketch provided.

### Step-by-Step Calculation

1. **Define Prior Probabilities (P(H))**:
   - We don't have specific data, so we assume prior probabilities based on typical graduate enrollments and plausibility.

   \[
   P(\text{computer science}) = 0.25
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{business administration}) = 0.25
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.25
   \]

2. **Evaluate Likelihoods (P(E|H))** based on how well the personality sketch matches typical students in these fields:

   - **Computer Science**: Generally attracts problem-solvers (high likelihood for puzzles), intelligent individuals, but may not emphasize curiosity about nature and a love for animals.
   
   \[
   P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.3
   \]

   - **Business Administration**: Typically focuses on leadership, management, and operations rather than a love for animals and a strong understanding of nature.
   
   \[
   P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.1
   \]

   - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Highly aligned with curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work.
   
   \[
   P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.7
   \]

3. **Estimate Probability of Evidence (P(E))**:
   - Summing the contributions of each field towards the personality traits.
   - For simplicity, assume the other fields not listed contribute a significant diversity to the P(E).

\[
P(E) = P(E|\text{computer science}) * P(\text{computer science}) + P(E|\text{business administration}) * P(\text{business administration}) + P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) * P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})
\]

\[
P(E) \approx (0.3 * 0.25) + (0.1 * 0.25) + (0.7 * 0.25) = 0.075 + 0.025 + 0.175 = 0.275
\]

4. **Calculate Posterior Probabilities (P(H|E))** using Bayes' Rule:

   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]


### Final calculation:

- For **Computer Science**:

\[
P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.25}{0.275} \approx 0.273
\]

- For **Business Administration**:

\[
P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.275} \approx 0.091
\]

- For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:

\[
P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.25}{0.275} \approx 0.636
\]

### Conclusion:

\[
{
  "computer science": 0.273,
  "business administration": 0.091,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.636
}
