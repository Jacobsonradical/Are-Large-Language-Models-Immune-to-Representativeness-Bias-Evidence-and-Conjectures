Sure, let's go through Bayes' rule step-by-step for each hypothesis \( H \):

Bayes' rule states: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \),
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given that hypothesis \( H \) is true,
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given that hypothesis \( H \) is not true,
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence \( E \).

For simplicity, I'll assume the following plausible values for \( P(H) \):
- \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.25 \)
- \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.05 \)
  (Note: These values are arbitrary and for demonstration only since we don't have actual data.)

Now let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) for each field. Considering the personality sketch:
1. **Computer Science**: 
   - Strength in abstract concepts and puzzles: High likelihood.
   - Love for nature and animals: Not as common.
   - Warm heart and empathy: Neutral to slightly less common.
   - \( P(E|\text{computer science}) ≈ 0.20 \) 

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication: High likelihood.
   - Empathy and warm heart: Beneficial but not defining.
   - Interest in nature/animals: Not typical.
   - \( P(E|\text{business administration}) ≈ 0.10 \)

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Love for nature and animals: Extremely high likelihood.
   - Empathy and strong dedication: Very relevant.
   - Intelligence and abstract thinking: Relevant.
   - \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) ≈ 0.70 \)

For \( P(E|\neg H) \), which is the likelihood of the evidence assuming the hypothesis is not true, we aggregate over all other possible fields which Adam could have been in. We assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.15 \) for simplicity.

Now let's apply these values:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

1. **Computer Science**:
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.20 \times 0.30}{P(E)} = 0.06/P(E) \]

2. **Business Administration**:
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.10 \times 0.25}{P(E)} = 0.025/P(E) \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.70 \times 0.05}{P(E)} = 0.035/P(E) \]

Normalizing these (since \( P(E) \) is the same for all hypotheticals):

{
  "computer science": \( \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.025 + 0.035} ≈ 0.46 \),
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.025}{0.06 + 0.025 + 0.035} ≈ 0.19 \),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{0.035}{0.06 + 0.025 + 0.035} ≈ 0.27 \)
}

Thus, the approximate posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.46,
  "business administration": 0.19,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.27
}
```
