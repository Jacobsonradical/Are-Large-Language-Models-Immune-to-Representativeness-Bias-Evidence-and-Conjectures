To solve this, we'll use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we don't have the probability \( P(E) \) directly. Instead, we compare the relative likelihoods for each hypothesis. We'll estimate probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field based on the given personality sketch.

Let's make some reasonable assumptions:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: A moderate probability, as it's a reasonably common field for someone with Adam's characteristics.
- **P(E|H)**: High. Adam's curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align well with this field.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Lower, as other fields might not fit Adam's profile as well.

### Business Administration
- **P(H)**: Slightly lower for someone with a profile like Adam's.
- **P(E|H)**: Low. Business administration might not align strongly with his curiosity about nature and love for animals.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Higher, since the profile doesn't seem to match well with business administration.

### Computer Science
- **P(H)**: Reasonably high, as it's a common graduate field.
- **P(E|H)**: Moderate. While abstract thinking aligns with computer science, Adam’s specific interests in nature and animals do not strongly align.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Higher, more students in computer science won't match Adam's profile.

Now, let's assign some plausible values to compute \( P(H|E) \):

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H) = 0.2 \]
\[ P(E|H) = 0.8 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.2 = 0.16 \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(H) = 0.1 \]
\[ P(E|H) = 0.2 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \cdot 0.1 = 0.02 \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(H) = 0.3 \]
\[ P(E|H) = 0.5 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.5 \cdot 0.3 = 0.15 \]

These values should be normalized by \( P(E) \). However, without \( P(E) \), we compare their relative magnitudes:

- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.16 / (0.16 + 0.02 + 0.15) ≈ 0.457
- Business Administration: 0.02 / (0.16 + 0.02 + 0.15) ≈ 0.057
- Computer Science: 0.15 / (0.16 + 0.02 + 0.15) ≈ 0.429

Thus, the final relative probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.457,
  "business administration": 0.057,
  "computer science": 0.429
}
```

These values indicate that it's most likely Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, followed by Computer Science, and least likely Business Administration.
