To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field given Adam's personality sketch (E), we'll use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since the total doesn't need to add up to 1, we can focus on the relative likelihoods.

Assessing the probabilities:
1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality given he is in each field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality given he is not in each field.

We'll estimate these values based on common sense and typical characteristics of students in each field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): Let's assume \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.1 \). It's one of many possible fields.
- \( P(E|H) \): Given the sketch, it seems likely. Let's set this high, at 0.9.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): This might be lower, reflecting Adam's strong suitability for agricultural and veterinary science. Let's set this at 0.2. 

### Computer Science
- \( P(H) \): Let's assume \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.15 \). It's a popular field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Given the sketch, while Adam's intelligence and puzzle-solving fit, his strong empathy and love for nature align less with the stereotypical computer science personality. Let's set this at 0.4.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Reflecting a general fit, let's also set this at 0.4.

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): Let's assume \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.15 \), another popular field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Adam's personality traits don't closely align with typical business administration traits (e.g., extroversion, leadership). Let's set this at 0.2.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Reflecting a general fit, let's set this at 0.4.

### Computing \( P(H|E) \)
Bayes' rule simplifies to:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Let's compute:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.9 \times 0.1 = 0.09 \]

2. **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.4 \times 0.15 = 0.06 \]

3. **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.2 \times 0.15 = 0.03 \]

Finally, normalizing these values to ensure relative comparison:

1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.09
2. Computer Science: 0.06
3. Business Administration: 0.03

Hence,

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.09,
  "computer science": 0.06,
  "business administration": 0.03
}
```

These values suggest that given Adam's personality sketch, he is most likely to be enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
