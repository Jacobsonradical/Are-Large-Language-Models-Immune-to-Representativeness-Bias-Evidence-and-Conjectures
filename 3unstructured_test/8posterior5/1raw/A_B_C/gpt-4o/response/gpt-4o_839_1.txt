To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to assign values to \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). The formula for Bayes' rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To simplify, we focus on determining the relative probabilities for each field:

1. **Business Administration**
   - \( P(H) \): This denotes the prior probability that a graduate student is in business administration. Since business administration is a common field among graduate students, let's assume \( P(H) \) is moderately common. Assign a value of 0.2.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam's personality traits given that he is in business administration. His traits seem less characteristic of a typical business administration student. Assign a lower value of 0.1.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam's personality traits when he is not a business administration student. This needs to be higher since Adam's traits are more aligned with other fields. Assign a value of 0.9.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - \( P(H) \): This denotes the prior probability that a graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. This field is less common overall, so we assign a lower prior probability. Assign a value of 0.1.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, this field strongly matches his personality. Assign a higher value of 0.7.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): This needs to be lower since Adam’s traits fit closely with this field. Assign a lower value of 0.3.

3. **Computer Science**
   - \( P(H) \): This denotes the prior probability that a graduate student is in computer science. This field is quite common among graduate students. Assign a value of 0.3.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam’s intelligence and puzzle-solving ability, computer science is a plausible match, although not as strong as agricultural and veterinary science. Assign a medium value of 0.4.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): This needs to be higher since Adam’s traits could fit many other fields as well. Assign a value of 0.6.

Now apply Bayes' rule:

For **Business Administration**:
- \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \)
- \( P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.2) + (0.9 \times 0.8) \)
- \( P(E) = 0.02 + 0.72 = 0.74 \)

- \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \)
- \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.74} \approx 0.027 \)

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
- \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \)
- \( P(E) = (0.7 \times 0.1) + (0.3 \times 0.9) \)
- \( P(E) = 0.07 + 0.27 = 0.34 \)

- \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \)
- \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.1}{0.34} \approx 0.21 \)

For **Computer Science**:
- \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \)
- \( P(E) = (0.4 \times 0.3) + (0.6 \times 0.7) \)
- \( P(E) = 0.12 + 0.42 = 0.54 \)

- \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \)
- \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.3}{0.54} \approx 0.22 \)

So the final probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": 0.027,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.21,
  "computer science": 0.22
