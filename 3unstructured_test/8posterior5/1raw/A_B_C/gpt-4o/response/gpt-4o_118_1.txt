To compute P(H|E) using Bayes' Rule, we need to estimate the following:

1. P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field.
2. P(E|H): The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in each field.
3. P(E|¬H): The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in each field.

We can then use Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't need the total to add up to 1, and we don't have P(E) directly, we can focus on proportional relationships which means we are normalizing the other probabilities.

Let's make educated guesses based on Adam's personality sketch:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - P(H) (prior): Computer science is a popular field, so P(H) might be moderate.
   - P(E|H): Given Adam's high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts, but a strong curiosity about nature, P(E|H) could be moderate.
   - P(E|¬H): If Adam is not in computer science but fits the other fields, P(E|¬H) might be higher.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - P(H) (prior): This is less commonly chosen than computer science, so P(H) might be lower.
   - P(E|H): Adam’s personality fits extremely well with this field (curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy), so P(E|H) could be quite high.
   - P(E|¬H): If not in this field, other fields might poorly match the description, so P(E|¬H) could be lower.

3. **Business Administration**:
   - P(H) (prior): Another popular field, so P(H) may be moderate to high.
   - P(E|H): Adam’s interests and empathy don't align very well with business administration, so P(E|H) might be low.
   - P(E|¬H): Easier to match this descriptive personality to other fields, so P(E|¬H) might be higher.

Considering these and normalizing them, we get:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

Note: These values are heuristic estimates; actual probabilities would require detailed data on field enrollments and matching personality traits.
