To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we will use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we don't have specific numerical values, we'll make reasonable qualitative assumptions:

1. \( P(H) \) - The prior probability that Adam is in each field based on general popularity or proportion of students.
2. \( P(E|H) \) - The probability that Adam's personality sketch \( E \) matches if he is in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - The probability that Adam's personality sketch \( E \) matches if he is not in that field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- **\( P(H) \)**: Relatively lower because fewer students might enroll in this field compared to others.
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: High because Adam's curiosity about nature, warm heart, love for animals, and empathy fit well.
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Lower because this specific combination is less common outside this field.

### Computer Science:
- **\( P(H) \)**: High because it's a very popular graduate field.
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: Moderate, as the personality doesn't strongly align with the typical traits expected in this field (empirical focus on nature and animals might be less relevant here).
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Higher since other fields have similar expectations of intelligence and puzzle-solving ability without a strong nature focus.

### Business Administration:
- **\( P(H) \)**: High because it's a very popular graduate field.
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: Low to moderate, as Adam's personality sketch doesn't particularly align with typical business traits (focus on empathy and nature might be less common here).
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Higher since many other fields would expect strong dedication and intelligence.

### Probabilistic Calculations:

We'll make rough qualitative assumptions to derive posterior probabilities:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \)
   - \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \)
   
   \[
   P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \times 0.2}{0.8 \times 0.2 + 0.8 \times (1 - 0.2)}
   = \frac{0.16}{0.64} \approx 0.25
   \]

2. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \)
   - \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.7 \)
   
   \[
   P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.3 \times 0.3}{0.3 \times 0.3 + 0.7 \times (1 - 0.3)}
   = \frac{0.09}{0.58} \approx 0.15
   \]

3. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \)
   - \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.7 \)
   
   \[
   P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.2 \times 0.3}{0.2 \times 0.3 + 0.7 \times (1 - 0.3)}
   = \frac{0.06}{0.56} \approx 0.11
   \]

Thus:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.25,
  "computer science": 0.15,
  "business administration": 0.11
}
```
