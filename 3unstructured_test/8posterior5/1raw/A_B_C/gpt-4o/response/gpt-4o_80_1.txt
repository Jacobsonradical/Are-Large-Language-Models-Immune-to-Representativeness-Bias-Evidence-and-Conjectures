Let's break this down using Bayes' theorem, which in this context is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(H|E)\) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in the field \( H \) given the personality sketch \( E \).
- \(P(E|H)\) is the probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in field \( H \).
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in field \( H \).
- \(P(E)\) is the probability of the personality sketch \( E \).

Since we are tasked with evaluating specific fields, weâ€™ll need to estimate probabilities \(P(H)\), \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E|\neg H)\) without known exact values. We will use qualitative judgment based on the provided sketch:

1. Business Administration:
   - \(P(H)\) (initial guess based on general enrollment rates): Assume moderate popularity, \( \sim 0.15 \)
   - \(P(E|H)\) (how likely the personality sketch matches): Less likely, as the field is less associated with nature and animals: \( \sim 0.1 \)
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\) (the likelihood of the sketch not specifically matching Business Administration but any other field): Consider the denominator, reflecting various other fields aligning more to the sketch, say \( \sim 0.25 \)
   - Compute \( P(H|E) \): 

    \[
    P(H|E)_{\text{business}} \approx \frac{0.1 \times 0.15}{0.25} = 0.06
    \]

2. Computer Science:
   - \(P(H)\) (base rate for the popularity of the field): High, \( \sim 0.3 \)
   - \(P(E|H)\) (fit of the personality): Partial fit due to puzzle-solving and intelligence, though less so the nature theme: \( \sim 0.3 \)
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\): Consideration of other fields that match better (agriculture, veterinary, etc.): \( \sim 0.25 \)
   - Compute \( P(H|E) \):

    \[
    P(H|E)_{\text{cs}} \approx \frac{0.3 \times 0.3}{0.25} = 0.36
    \]

3. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
   - \(P(H)\): Relatively lower enrollment count but relevant \( \sim 0.05 \)
   - \(P(E|H)\): Very high given the personality sketch fitting well: \( \sim 0.8 \)
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\): Lower likelihood among other fields not matching so closely: \( \sim 0.2 \)
   - Compute \( P(H|E) \):

    \[
    P(H|E)_{\text{agri-vet}} \approx \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.2} = 0.2
    \]

Final analysis:
\[
{
  "business administration": 0.06,
  "computer science": 0.36,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.2
}
\]

Feel free to adjust based on additional specifics or refined priors given embarkation into fields.
