To solve this problem, we need to estimate the probabilities P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|¬H) for each field, and then use Bayes' rule to compute P(H|E).

### Definitions:
- P(H): Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- P(E|H): Probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- P(E|¬H): Probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.
- P(H|E): Posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field given the personality sketch.

Let's make some reasonable assumptions based on the personality sketch:

**Business Administration:**
- P(H_business): Generally, students are spread across various fields, so let's assume P(H) = 0.10.
- P(E|H_business): Business students might not have a genuine curiosity about nature or a deep love for animals. Let's set this to a low value, e.g., 0.05.
- P(E|¬H_business): If not in business, the personality sketch could still fit many other fields, so let's assume this to be relatively moderate, e.g., 0.15.

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- P(H_agri): Fewer students are in this field compared to others, but given Adam's personality, let's set P(H) = 0.05.
- P(E|H_agri): High, because the description matches well with what one might expect in this field. Set this to 0.70.
- P(E|¬H_agri): If not in this field, the description's fit could still be moderate, e.g., 0.20.

**Computer Science:**
- P(H_cs): Quite a popular and broad field, so let's assume P(H) = 0.20.
- P(E|H_cs): The fit is moderate; while computer science students are often intelligent and good at puzzles, the love for nature and animals is less relevant. Set this to 0.30.
- P(E|¬H_cs): If not in computer science, the personality sketch could fit in various other fields. Set this to 0.10.

### Bayesian Calculation:
Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

Now, we compute P(E) for each field.

### Calculations:

1. **Business Administration**
   \[
   P(E) = (0.05 \cdot 0.10) + (0.15 \cdot (1 - 0.10)) = 0.005 + 0.135 = 0.14
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.10}{0.14} \approx 0.036
   \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   \[
   P(E) = (0.70 \cdot 0.05) + (0.20 \cdot (1 - 0.05)) = 0.035 + 0.19 = 0.225
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.70 \cdot 0.05}{0.225} \approx 0.156
   \]

3. **Computer Science**
   \[
   P(E) = (0.30 \cdot 0.20) + (0.10 \cdot (1 - 0.20)) = 0.06 + 0.08 = 0.14
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.30 \cdot 0.20}{0.14} \approx 0.429
   \]
