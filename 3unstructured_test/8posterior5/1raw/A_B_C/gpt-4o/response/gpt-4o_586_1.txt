To calculate the probabilities, we use Bayes' theorem which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the nature of the prompt, we can assign probabilities based on the provided personality sketch and some general knowledge about what kind of characteristics might match different fields. 

Let's break it down for each field:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): Let's assume this is relatively high, say 0.2, as computer science is a common field for high-intelligence students in the U.S.
   - \( P(E|H) \): A high-intelligent person who enjoys solving puzzles fits well into computer science, but the love for animals and nature is not highly relevant, so we might assign a moderate probability, say 0.5.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): For any field other than computer science, the personality traits seem to equally likely or even more likely (especially for nature and animals), so let's give it a higher value, say 0.7.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): This field is less common than computer science, but given Adam's love for animals and nature, it might be higher for him. We can give it a value of 0.1.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The personality sketch fits very well with this field: love for animals and nature, empathy, etc. Let's assign it a value of 0.9.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Fields other than agricultural and veterinary science might accommodate some of the traits but not as strongly. So, let's assign it a value of 0.4.

3. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H) \): Business administration is also a common graduate field and could attract high-intelligence students. Let's assume a value of 0.15.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The traits do not strongly align with business administration, except for perhaps high intelligence and appreciation for hard work. Let's give it a value of 0.3.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Other fields would likely reflect Adam's traits more closely, so let’s assign it a higher value, say 0.6.

Now, let's use Bayes' theorem for each field:

For simplicity, we assume \( P(E) \) to be the denominator is the same across all fields and can be normalized later if needed.

- Computer Science:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1}{P(E)} \]

- Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.09}{P(E)} \]

- Business Administration:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} = \frac{0.045}{P(E)} \]

The relative probabilities (without normalization) are:

{
  "computer science": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.09,
  "business administration": 0.045
}

Now we can normalize these probabilities. The sum of these values is 0.235.

Normalized probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.1 / 0.235 ≈ 0.426,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.09 / 0.235 ≈ 0.383,
  "business administration": 0.045 / 0.235 ≈ 0.191
}

Thus, the outputs are:

{
  "computer science": 0.426,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.383,
  "business administration": 0.191
}
