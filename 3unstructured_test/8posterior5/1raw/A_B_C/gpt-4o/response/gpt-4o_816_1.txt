To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we'll use Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll need to go through the following steps for each field:

1. Assign a value for \( P(H) \) — the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in that field.
2. Assign a value for \( P(E|H) \) — the probability of observing E given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
3. Assign a value for \( P(E|\neg H) \) — the probability of observing E given that Adam is NOT enrolled in that field.
4. Calculate \( P(E) \) using the formula:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Since we are considering only three fields, let's assume a simple scenario where the likelihood that Adam is enrolled in any one of these fields is equal initially (uniform prior). If there is no specific reason to believe that he is more likely to be in one field than the others, we use:
\[ P(H) = \frac{1}{3} \]

Please note that the values for \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \) are somewhat subjective and need to be estimated. 

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior \( P(H) \):**
   \[ P(H_{\text{AgriVet}}) = \frac{1}{3} \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   Since Adam has a curiosity about nature, plants, and a love for animals, the probability that we observe his profile given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is high.
   \[ P(E|H_{\text{AgriVet}}) = 0.8 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   This is less likely, but not impossible, as some of these traits could be shared with students in other fields.
   \[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{AgriVet}}) = 0.4 \]

### Computer Science

1. **Prior \( P(H) \):**
   \[ P(H_{\text{CS}}) = \frac{1}{3} \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   He is good at solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, which is a strong fit for computer science.
   \[ P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.7 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   This should be relatively lower but not zero, as his skills in puzzles and abstract thinking can be present in other fields.
   \[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.5 \]

### Business Administration

1. **Prior \( P(H) \):**
   \[ P(H_{\text{BA}}) = \frac{1}{3} \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   The traits listed are less typical of a business administration student compared to the other fields.
   \[ P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.4 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   This should be higher, as these traits might fit better with some other fields.
   \[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.6 \]

Next, we can calculate \( P(E) \) using the total probability formula:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{AgriVet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AgriVet}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{AgriVet}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{AgriVet}}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot \frac{1}{3}) + (0.4 \cdot \frac{2}{3}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.267 + 0.267 = 0.534 \]

Finally, we compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

\[ P(H_{\text{AgriVet}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AgriVet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AgriVet}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{AgriVet}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.534} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{AgriVet}}|E) = \frac{0.267}{0.534} = 0.5 \]

Likewise for the other fields:

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.534} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.233}{0.534} = 0.436 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.534} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.133}{0.534} = 0.249 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5,
  "computer science": 0.436,
  "business administration": 0.249
}
```
