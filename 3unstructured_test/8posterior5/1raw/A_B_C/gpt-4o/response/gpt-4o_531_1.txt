To determine the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Rule, we need to consider the following terms:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is enrolled in another field.
- \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field given his personality traits.

By Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

### Initial Assumptions and Estimates:

1. **Prior probabilities, \( P(H) \)**:
   - For simplicity, we'll assume that each field of interest has an equal prior probability. Given the wide range of graduate fields, let's assume:
   \[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.1 \]
   \[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.1 \]
   \[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.1 \]

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Agricultural and veterinary science: High given Adam's love for nature, animals, and empathy.
   - Business administration: Low given that Adam's traits don't align strongly with typical business administration characteristics.
   - Computer science: Moderate given that his love for solving puzzles and abstract concepts fits well with computer science.

   Initial approximations:
   \[ P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.7 \]
   \[ P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.2 \]
   \[ P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.5 \]

3. **Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - This is the probability of observing Adam's traits given he is in any other field. Let's make a rough estimate:
   \[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \]

### Calculations:

Let's compute posterior probabilities using Bayes' rule:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.1}{0.3} = \frac{0.07}{0.3} \approx 0.233 \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business administration}})P(H_{\text{business administration}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{0.3} = \frac{0.02}{0.3} \approx 0.067 \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{computer science}})P(H_{\text{computer science}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{0.5 \times 0.1}{0.3} = \frac{0.05}{0.3} \approx 0.167 \]

### Results:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.233,
  "business administration": 0.067,
  "computer science": 0.167
}
```

These values give a rough probabilistic judgment of Adam being enrolled in each field given his personality traits. Note that the chosen priors and conditionals are subjective and could vary with additional information.
