To compute the posterior probabilities \(P(H|E)\), we need to use Bayes' Rule:

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

Since \(P(E)\) is the same for all hypotheses and only serves as a normalizing constant, we can focus on the numerator \(P(E|H) \cdot P(H)\).

### Hypotheses:

1. Business Administration
2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
3. Computer Science

### Prior Probabilities \(P(H)\):

For the sake of this problem, letâ€™s assume generic prior probabilities for each field:

- \(P(\text{business administration}) = 0.2\)
- \(P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.3\)
- \(P(\text{computer science}) = 0.25\)

### Likelihood \(P(E|H)\):

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Less relevant to curiosity about nature, empathy toward animals, and understanding of abstract concepts related to natural sciences.
   - \(P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.1\)

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Highly relevant to curiosity about nature, empathy toward animals, and appreciation for hard work.
   - \(P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.8\)

3. **Computer Science**:
   - Relevant to solving puzzles and high intelligence, though slightly less connected to nature and empathy toward animals.
   - \(P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.4\)

### Complement Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\):

\(P(E|\neg H)\) is not directly required for computing the posterior, but it would involve the expected overall likelihood given all other fields.

### Computation:

Using Bayes' rule normalization factor \(P(E)\) to represent the sum for normalization for simplicity:

\[P(E) = \sum P(E|H) \cdot P(H)\]

#### Calculations:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Numerator: \(P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02\)

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Numerator: \(P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24\)

3. **Computer Science**:
   - Numerator: \(P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) = 0.4 \cdot 0.25 = 0.1\)

Total \(P(E)\):

\[P(E) = 0.02 + 0.24 + 0.1 = 0.36\]

Then:

1. **Business Administration**:
   \[P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.36} \approx 0.056\]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.24}{0.36} \approx 0.667\]

3. **Computer Science**:
   \[P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.36} \approx 0.278\]

### Final Answer:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.056,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.667,
  "computer science": 0.278
}
```
