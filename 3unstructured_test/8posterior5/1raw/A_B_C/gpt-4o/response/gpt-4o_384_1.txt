To compute \( P(H|E) \) (the probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch), we use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) (the overall probability of the personality sketch) is the same across all hypotheses and will cancel out in relative comparisons, we primarily need to focus on \( P(H) \) (the prior probability of each field) and \( P(E|H) \) (the probability of the personality sketch given each field).

Let's estimate these values:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): This field includes interests and skills related to nature, plants, and animals.
  - Estimation: Moderate priors, say \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Given this field, Adam's personality (love for animals, plants, empathy) fits well.
  - Estimation: High fit, say \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of having Adam's personality in other fields.
  - Estimation: Assuming diverse personalities in other fields; say a moderate fit \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.2}{0.3} = \frac{0.18}{0.3} = 0.6 \]

### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \): Common graduate field, but less likely given Adam's distinct personality.
  - Estimation: Lower prior for this specific personality, say \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Less likely for a business-focused student to have such a strong nature, empathy, and animal interest.
  - Estimation: Low fit, say \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Same as above.
  - Estimation: Assuming diverse personalities in other fields; say a moderate fit \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.3} = \frac{0.01}{0.3} = 0.033 \]

### Computer Science
- \( P(H) \): Fairly plausible given high intelligence, puzzle-solving, and understanding abstract concepts.
  - Estimation: Moderate priors, say \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Fit is reasonable but not as strong as in agricultural science (less emphasis on nature, plants, and animals).
  - Estimation: Moderate fit, say \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Same as above.
  - Estimation: Assuming diverse personalities in other fields; say a moderate fit \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.15}{0.3} = \frac{0.06}{0.3} = 0.2 \]

Thus, the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field are:
