To compute the posterior probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the following probabilities:

1. \(P(H)\): The prior probability of being enrolled in each field.
2. \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood of exhibiting the personality traits given enrollment in each field.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): The likelihood of exhibiting the personality traits given not being enrolled in each field.

We will then use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where \(P(E)\) can be derived from the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Since we are only considering the three specified fields, we can assume \(P(\neg H)\) relates to not being in any one of these three fields. 

### Assumptions
- For simplicity, assume \(P(H)\) (prior probabilities) are uniform across the considered fields.
- Estimate \(P(E|H)\) and \(P(E|\neg H)\) based on domain knowledge.

### Estimation for Each Field

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \(P(H)\): Given current context, let's assume equal priors, \(P(H) \approx 0.33\).
   - \(P(E|H)\): High likelihood due to a strong fit with traits like curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals. \(P(E|H) \approx 0.8\).
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\): Considering other fields, likelihood might be lower but still has non-zero value. \(P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.15\).

2. **Computer Science**:
   - \(P(H)\): Prior remains equal, \(P(H) \approx 0.33\).
   - \(P(E|H)\): Moderate likelihood due to abstract thinking and problem-solving, but less emphasis on nature and animals. \(P(E|H) \approx 0.4\).
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\): For rest of fields, likelihood remains non-zero as abstract problem-solving is common. \(P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.25\).

3. **Business Administration**:
   - \(P(H)\): Again, equal priors, \(P(H) \approx 0.33\).
   - \(P(E|H)\): Low likelihood; traits like empathy may fit, but less emphasis on nature, animals, and abstract concepts. \(P(E|H) \approx 0.2\).
   - \(P(E|\neg H)\): Similar to above but slightly higher. \(P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3\).

Plugging these into Bayes' rule, we get:

### Calculations

Let's compute the posterior for "agricultural and veterinary science" as an example:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.33 + 0.15 \cdot 0.67 = 0.264 + 0.1005 = 0.3645
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.33}{0.3645} \approx 0.724
\]

And similarly for others:

### Results

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.724,
  "computer science": 0.361,
  "business administration": 0.181
}
```

These results indicate the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in each field given his personality traits, with a strong indication towards agricultural and veterinary science, followed by computer science, and much less likelihood for business administration.
