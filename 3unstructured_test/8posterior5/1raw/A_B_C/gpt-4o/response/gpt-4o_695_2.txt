To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in each specified field given his personality sketch, we will apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we are only comparing among the three fields, we can omit the denominator \(P(E)\) as it is the same across all fields. Instead, we will focus on estimating and comparing the numerator component \(P(E|H) \cdot P(H)\).

First, let's assign our initial probability values considering Adam is a graduate student in the U.S. (which provides some prior context). Note that these are rough estimates since we don’t have actual data.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **Prior probability, P(H)**: Let's assume that about 5% of graduate students might be in this field.
   \[
   P(H) \approx 0.05
   \]

2. **Likelihood, P(E|H)**: Adam’s interest in plants, nature, animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work strongly aligns with this field.
   \[
   P(E|H) \approx 0.8
   \]

3. **Likelihood, P(E|\neg H)**: Given the large number of other fields, we assume an average likelihood if not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
   \[
   P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.1
   \]

### Computer Science
1. **Prior probability, P(H)**: Let's assume that about 15% of graduate students might be in this field.
   \[
   P(H) \approx 0.15
   \]

2. **Likelihood, P(E|H)**: Adam’s high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could fit, though there’s no direct mention of interest in computers.
   \[
   P(E|H) \approx 0.4
   \]

3. **Likelihood, P(E|\neg H)**: Given the large number of other fields, we assume an average likelihood.
   \[
   P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.1
   \]

### Business Administration
1. **Prior probability, P(H)**: Let's assume about 10% of graduate students might be in this field.
   \[
   P(H) \approx 0.10
   \]

2. **Likelihood, P(E|H)**: Adam’s characteristics don’t strongly align with this field. Business typically values strategic thinking and leadership more directly than the traits outlined.
   \[
   P(E|H) \approx 0.2
   \]

3. **Likelihood, P(E|\neg H)**: Given the large number of other fields, we assume an average likelihood.
   \[
   P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.1
   \]


Now, let's compute \(P(H|E)\) for each field (omitting \(P(E)\)):


\[
\begin{align*}
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) 
\end{align*}
\]

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[
   P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.05 = 0.04
   \]

2. **Computer Science**:
   \[
   P(H|E) \propto 0.4 \times 0.15 = 0.06
   \]

3. **Business Administration**:
   \[
   P(H|E) \propto 0.2 \times 0.1 = 0.02
   \]

Finally, normalizing these for comparison:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|}
\hline
\text{Field} & P(H|E) \\
\hline
\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science} & \approx 0.4 \\
\text{Computer Science} & \approx 0.6 \\
\text{Business Administration} & \approx 0.2 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

Thus, here is the comparison:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4,
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These values depict a higher probability of Adam being in Computer Science and Agricultural and Veterinary Science over Business Administration based on his personality traits and the given data.
