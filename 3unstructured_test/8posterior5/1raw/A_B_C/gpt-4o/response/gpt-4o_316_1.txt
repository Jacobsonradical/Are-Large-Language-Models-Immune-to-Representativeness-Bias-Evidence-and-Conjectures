To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Rule, we'll use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.

### Assumptions:

1. **Prior Probabilities (P(H))**: Let's make an educated guess about the general distribution of graduate students in these fields:
   - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.05 (5%)
   - Computer Science: 0.25 (25%)
   - Business Administration: 0.15 (15%)

2. **Likelihoods (P(E|H))**: Based on Adam's personality sketch:
   - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: High (0.8) due to his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work.
   - Computer Science: Medium (0.3) due to his intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles.
   - Business Administration: Low (0.1) as the characteristics don't strongly align with this field.

3. **Total Probability (P(E))**:
   \[ P(E) = P(E|H_{ag}) \cdot P(H_{ag}) + P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs}) + P(E|H_{ba}) \cdot P(H_{ba}) \]
   \[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.3 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.15) \]
   \[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.075 + 0.015 \]
   \[ P(E) = 0.13 \]

### Calculations using Bayes' Rule:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[ P(H_{ag}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{ag}) \cdot P(H_{ag})}{P(E)} \]
   \[ P(H_{ag}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.13} \]
   \[ P(H_{ag}|E) \approx \frac{0.04}{0.13} \]
   \[ P(H_{ag}|E) \approx 0.3077 \]

2. **Computer Science**:
   \[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs})}{P(E)} \]
   \[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.25}{0.13} \]
   \[ P(H_{cs}|E) \approx \frac{0.075}{0.13} \]
   \[ P(H_{cs}|E) \approx 0.5769 \]

3. **Business Administration**:
   \[ P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{ba}) \cdot P(H_{ba})}{P(E)} \]
   \[ P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{0.13} \]
   \[ P(H_{ba}|E) \approx \frac{0.015}{0.13} \]
   \[ P(H_{ba}|E) \approx 0.1154 \]
