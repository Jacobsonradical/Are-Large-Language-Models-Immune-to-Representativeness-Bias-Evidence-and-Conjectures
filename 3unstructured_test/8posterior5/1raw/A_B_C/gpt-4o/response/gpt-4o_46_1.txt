Let's start by defining some probabilities based on the given personality sketch \( E \).

Given:
- \( E \) = Personality sketch of Adam.
- \( H \) = Hypothesis of the field.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For the purpose of simplicity, let's assume \( P(H) \) for each field denotes the baseline probability of a graduate student being in that field based on general enrollment statistics (though this value could vary, we'll estimate them). Let's set some general baselines:
- \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.2 \)

Since we lack explicit information on \( P(E) \), we will consider relative comparison impacts.

### Computer Science
- \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \): Adam's characteristics like high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts match well, but his curiosity about nature and deep love for animals are less typical.
  \[ P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \approx 0.4 \]

- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{computer science}}) \): This covers other fields like agricultural and veterinary science, related to Adam's interests, making it moderately high.
  \[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.6 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): Strongly matches Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy.
  \[ P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \approx 0.9 \]

- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): Lower, as his specific combination of traits is less common outside this field.
  \[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \]

### Business Administration
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \): His quiet and empathetic nature, as well as his love for animals, does not particularly align with this field.
  \[ P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \approx 0.2 \]

- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{business administration}}) \): Higher probability due to better alignment with other fields.
  \[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.7 \]

Using Bayes' Rule for calculations:

#### Computer Science
\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) \approx \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) \approx \frac{0.12}{P(E)} \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) \approx \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) \approx \frac{0.09}{P(E)} \]

#### Business Administration
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) \approx \frac{0.04}{P(E)} \]

After normalizing relative to total likelihood:

Thus, the relative probabilities are approximately:
\[
P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) > P(\text{computer science}|E) > P(\text{business administration}|E)
\]

Providing approximate values:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These values represent stronger belief towards agricultural and veterinary science, followed by computer science, and lastly business administration based on Adam's personality sketch.
