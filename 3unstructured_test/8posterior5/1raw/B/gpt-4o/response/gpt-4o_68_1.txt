To calculate P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need the following probabilities:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was not enrolled in business administration.

Let's assume the following reasonable estimations:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that a graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in business administration. For estimation purposes, let's consider that business administration is a popular field. We might assign this a prior probability of 0.2 (20%).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch E if Adam was enrolled in business administration. Given Adam's profile (e.g., high empathy, love of nature, interest in puzzles), this seems less typical for a business administration student where traits like being highly social, competitive, or analytically inclined in terms of finance might be more common. Let's estimate this as 0.1 (10%).

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch E if Adam was not enrolled in business administration. Given the wide range of other fields that might better fit his personality (e.g., biology, environmental science), let's assume this is relatively higher at 0.3 (30%).

Now, using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To find \( P(E) \), we need to sum over all possible hypotheses:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

With \( P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.8 \):

\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.24 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.26 \]

Finally, we can calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.077 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given the personality sketch is approximately 0.077 (or 7.7%).
