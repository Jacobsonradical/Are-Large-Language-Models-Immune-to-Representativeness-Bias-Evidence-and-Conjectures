Sure, let's walk through the calculations for the hypothesis \(H\) that Adam was enrolled in the field of business administration. 

1. **P(H)**: The probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration. This can be considered the prior probability. Business administration is a common field, but given Adam's observed traits in the personality sketch, it might be less likely given his interests and strengths. Let's estimate this prior probability as low:
   \[
   P(H) = 0.2
   \]

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is enrolled in business administration. Given that business administration often requires skills in abstract thinking and dedication, but not necessarily a strong interest in nature or animals, let's estimate this probability as moderate:
   \[
   P(E|H) = 0.2
   \]

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is **not** enrolled in business administration. Considering his traits are more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, or even psychology, where curiosity about nature and empathy are highly relevant, this probability might be higher:
   \[
   P(E|\neg H) = 0.8
   \]

Using Bayes' rule to compute \(P(H|E)\):
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where:
\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

\[
P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.2) + (0.8 \cdot 0.8) = 0.04 + 0.64 = 0.68
\]

Thus:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.68} = \frac(0.04}{0.68) \approx 0.059
\]

Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality traits is approximately:
