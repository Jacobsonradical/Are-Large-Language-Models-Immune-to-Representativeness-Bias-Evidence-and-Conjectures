To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration (denoted as \( P(H|E) \)), we will use Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \).

For simplicity, we can assume \( P(E) \) is the same for all hypotheses, and therefore, we only need to compare the values of \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) to determine \( P(H|E) \).

Let's denote:
\[ P(H) \] as the general probability of a graduate student being in business administration. Since we don't have exact numbers, but considering the popularity of business administration, we might assume a moderate prior \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \).

Now, let's assess \( P(E|H) \):
Given Adam's personality sketch, it does not typically align with the common characteristics of a business administration student, who may be more extroverted, financially driven, and less focused on nature and abstract concepts. Therefore, \( P(E|H) \) should be relatively low. Let's estimate it at around \( 0.1 \).

Finally, \( P(E|\neg H) \):
This represents the probability of Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given that he is not enrolled in business administration. Given Adam's traits align more closely with fields like biology, environmental science, psychology, etc., we can estimate this to be higher. Let's approximate it at around \( 0.4 \).

Now, compute \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.32} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.02}{0.34} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0588 \]

Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch is:
\[ 
{
  "business administration": "0.0588"
}
\]
