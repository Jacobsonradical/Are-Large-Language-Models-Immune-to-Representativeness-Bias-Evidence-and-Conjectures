To determine \( P(H|E) \)—the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given the personality sketch \( E \)—we can use Bayes' theorem, which is mathematically represented as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \).

We'll assume:
- A general base rate for a graduate student choosing business administration, \( P(H) \), let’s say 0.2 (this might be lower due to the nature of the personality sketch provided).
- \( P(E|H) \), the probability of seeing Adam’s personality sketch if he is in business administration. Given his qualities such as a curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, empathy, and a love for animals, business administration doesn't seem a close fit. Suppose this value is low, say 0.05.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \), the probability of seeing Adam’s personality sketch if he is not in business administration. Higher than \( P(E|H) \), let’s consider a value of 0.3.

First, compute \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.05 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.01 + 0.24 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.25 \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.2}{0.25} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.25} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.04 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given the personality sketch \( E \):
