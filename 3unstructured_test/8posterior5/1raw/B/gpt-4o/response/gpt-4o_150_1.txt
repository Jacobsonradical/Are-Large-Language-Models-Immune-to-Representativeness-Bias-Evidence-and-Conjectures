To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in business administration, we use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's break down what each term might represent based on the information provided:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The likelihood that a given graduate student is enrolled in business administration, without any specific information about Adam. We need to estimate this value, but let's assume generally:

\[ P(H) \approx 0.20 \] (20% chance a graduate student might be in business administration, just as an illustrative value)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality characteristics given that he is in business administration. Given Adam's deep curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and these traits don’t strongly correlate with the typical traits needed for business administration, this might be relatively low:

\[ P(E|H) \approx 0.10 \] (10% chance that someone in business administration would have these traits)

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality characteristics given that he is not in business administration. Since these traits might be more typical for fields like biology, environmental science, or even psychology, let’s assume it’s higher than \( P(E|H) \):

\[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.25 \] (25% chance that someone not in business administration would have these traits)

4. **Marginal Probability \( P(E) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's characteristics overall. This can be computed as follows:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.10 \cdot 0.20) + (0.25 \cdot 0.80) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.20 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.22 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.10 \cdot 0.20}{0.22} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.02}{0.22} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.091 \]

Hence, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch is approximately 0.091, or about 9.1%.
