To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch (E), we will use the following components as per Bayes' theorem:
- P(H): The prior probability that Adam was studying business administration.
- P(E|H): The probability of observing the personality sketch of Adam given that he was studying business administration.
- P(E|¬H): The probability of observing the personality sketch of Adam given that he was not studying business administration.
- P(H|E): The posterior probability that Adam was studying business administration given his personality sketch.

Let's assign values for these probabilities based on reasonable assumptions:

1. **P(H) (Prior probability)**: 
   - Let's assume that the probability of a graduate student being enrolled in business administration is relatively common compared to all fields. We can subjectively set this at around 0.2 (20%).

2. **P(E|H) (Likelihood of observing E given H)**:
   - A personality sketch of high intelligence, empathy, and interest in nature doesn't inherently suggest a perfect match with business administration, but neither is it entirely implausible. Business administration students come from diverse backgrounds and can have wide-ranging interests and traits. Considering Adam's traits, let's assign this a lower probability, perhaps 0.2 (20%).

3. **P(E|¬H) (Likelihood of observing E given not H)**:
   - Adam's traits seem to fit more easily with fields like biology, environmental science, psychology, etc. Thus, it is more likely that a person with Adam's traits would be in a field other than business administration. Let’s set this probability higher, at 0.5 (50%).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

where:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

\[
P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H)
\]

Substituting the values we assumed:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{(0.2 \cdot 0.2) + (0.5 \cdot 0.8)}
\]

Simplifying:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.4} = \frac{0.04}{0.44} \approx 0.091 
\]

Thus the posterior probability, \( P(H|E) \), that Adam is enrolled in business administration, given his personality, is approximately 0.091.
