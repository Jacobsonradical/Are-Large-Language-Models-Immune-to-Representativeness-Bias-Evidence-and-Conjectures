To evaluate the probability that Adam was enrolled in a business administration program based on the given personality sketch (E), we need to make some educated guesses about the probabilities. 

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is in a business administration program without knowing his personality sketch. Let's assume the probability of any particular field being chosen by a graduate student is roughly equal, given there are many fields out there. We might assign a small prior probability like 0.1.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in a business administration program. Since business administration students might not typically have a focus on nature, animals, and solving puzzles, this might be relatively low. Suppose this is 0.05.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given that he is not in a business administration program. Considering his interests in nature, puzzles, and animals, this might be more common in fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology. Therefore, this might be relatively higher, say 0.2.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Let’s plug in the values:
\[ P(E) = (0.05 \times 0.1) + (0.2 \times 0.9) = 0.005 + 0.18 = 0.185 \]

Now, calculating \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.1}{0.185} = \frac{0.005}{0.185} \approx 0.027 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in a business administration program given the personality sketch is approximately 0.027.
