To calculate the probability \( P(H|E) \) (the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch), we apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in business administration.

Letâ€™s make reasonable estimations based on typical graduate programs:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: 
   Assuming a uniform distribution across various fields for graduate students in the U.S., the chance of being enrolled in any given field might be relatively low. Let's estimate this as \( 0.1 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - A student in business administration might be less likely to have a deep love for nature, plants, and animals, and a high appreciation for hard (often manual or scientific) work compared to other fields.
   Let's estimate this likelihood to be fairly low, around \( 0.2 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - The personality traits described could be more common in fields such as biology, environmental science, or psychology.
   Let's estimate this likelihood to be higher, around \( 0.8 \).

4. **Overall Probability \( P(E) \)**:
   - This can be computed using the law of total probability.
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
   \]
   Given:
   \[
   P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.8 \cdot 0.9 = 0.02 + 0.72 = 0.74
   \]

Using these values in Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.74} = \frac{0.02}{0.74} \approx 0.027
\]
