To solve this problem, we need to estimate the following probabilities for the given field of "business administration":

1. P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
2. P(E|H): The probability of observing the described personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
3. P(E|¬H): The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was not enrolled in business administration.
4. P(H|E): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given the personality sketch E, which we compute using Bayes' rule.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, we'll assume P(E) is the same for all fields and just compare the ratios.

### Estimations:
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Given that business schools are common and many students enroll in this field, but considering Adam's personality sketch and interests, this might not be the highest probability field for him. Let's assume a moderate prior probability like 0.20.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in business administration. Adam has a strong interest in nature, warm heart, empathy, and love for animals, which seems less aligned with typical traits needed for business administration. This might be rather low. Let's estimate it as 0.10.

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in business administration. Since his personality sketch more closely aligns with fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology, this probability should be higher. Let's estimate it as 0.30.

Now, using these values in Bayes' rule to calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we are comparing fields, we don't need the exact value of \( P(E) \). The comparison is based on the relative likelihoods.

Plugging in our values:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.10 \cdot 0.20}{P(E)} \]

### Since P(E) is the same for all fields, we get:

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.02 \]

Finally, normalizing this and keeping in mind it's relative to other equally computed probabilities for other fields (not provided here), we get a value between 0 and 1. It suggests the likelihood that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality profile.
