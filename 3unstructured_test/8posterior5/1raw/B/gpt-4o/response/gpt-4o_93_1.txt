To answer this question, let's break down the components involved:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was studying business administration. This would typically be based on general statistics of field enrollment among graduate students.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood that Adam, having the described personality traits (E), would be enrolled in business administration.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood that Adam, having the described personality traits (E), would be enrolled in a field other than business administration.
4. **P(E)**: The overall probability of observing the evidence, though we use it implicitly through the Bayes rule calculation. 

### Estimations

- **P(H)**: Let's assume the prior probability of Adam studying business administration, based on general statistics, is approximately 0.10 (10%). This is a rough estimate since business administration is a popular field but not overwhelmingly so.

- **P(E|H)**: Considering Adam's personality traits, students in business administration are generally known for interest in commerce, management, and organizational behavior. His traits don't particularly align well with this field (curiosity about nature, puzzles, empathy, etc.). Therefore, we might estimate this likelihood to be quite low. Let's choose an arbitrary value like 0.02.

- **P(E|¬H)**: Let's assume the probability of observing Adam’s traits in fields other than business administration is relatively high since his traits (interest in nature, animals, puzzles) suggest fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology. We could estimate it around 0.30.

### Calculation Using Bayes' Rule

Bayes' rule is formulated as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.02 \cdot 0.10) + (0.30 \cdot 0.90) = 0.002 + 0.27 = 0.272 \]

Now plug these values into Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02 \cdot 0.10}{0.272} \approx \frac{0.002}{0.272} \approx 0.0074 \]

Finally, we format our answer as requested:
