  "business administration": "0.1"
}

Explanation:
1. P(H) - The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration: Assuming a low prior probability based on typical graduate enrollment distributions and Adam's interests, it might be around 0.2.
2. P(E|H) - The likelihood of E given H: While some of his traits could fit a business student (intelligence, understanding hard work), the strong interest in nature, plants, and animals seems less typical. Thus, this value could be around 0.2.
3. P(E|¬H) - The likelihood of E given not H: Considering Adam’s traits are more aligned with fields like biology or environmental studies, this could be around 0.8.
4. Applying Bayes' rule:
   P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|¬H) * P(¬H)]
               = [0.2 * 0.2] / [0.2 * 0.2 + 0.8 * 0.8]
               = 0.04 / (0.04 + 0.64)
               = 0.04 / 0.68
               ≈ 0.0588

Converting 0.0588 to a value between 0 and 1, and considering typical estimation uncertainties, the answer would be approximated to 0.1.
