To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch, we can apply Bayes' theorem. However, it is essential to provide reasonable estimates for the probabilities involved:

1. **P(H):** The prior probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is enrolled in business administration. Let's assume the proportion of graduate students in business administration is around 0.15 (15%).

2. **P(E|H):** The probability of observing the personality traits described if Adam were enrolled in business administration. Given that Adam's traits — curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, empathy, solving puzzles, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work — do not strongly align with typical business administration characteristics, this probability might be relatively low. Let's estimate it at 0.1 (10%).

3. **P(E|¬H):** The probability of observing Adam's traits if he were not enrolled in business administration. Since there are many other fields such as biology, environmental science, psychology, etc., that align better with these traits, this probability is likely to be higher. Let’s estimate it at 0.4 (40%).

Now, using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.15) + (0.4 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.015 + 0.34 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.355 \]

Now calculating \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{0.355} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.015}{0.355} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0423 \]

Therefore,
