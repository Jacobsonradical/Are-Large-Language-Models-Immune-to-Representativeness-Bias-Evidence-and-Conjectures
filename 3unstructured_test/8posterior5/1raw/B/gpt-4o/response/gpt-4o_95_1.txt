Let's start evaluating the probabilities step by step.

1. **P(H) - Prior Probability:** This is the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration before considering the personality sketch, E. Business administration is a fairly common field among graduate students, though not necessarily the most common. For simplicity, let's assume that the prior probability is 0.10 (10%).

2. **P(E|H) - Likelihood:** This is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in business administration. Considering the traits provided — curiosity about nature, love for animals, and interest in solving puzzles — it seems less likely that these traits are highly correlated with a typical business administration student. For business administration, let's assume this is around 0.05 (5%).

3. **P(E|¬H) - Evidence:** This is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in business administration. Suppose we consider that graduate students in other fields like environmental science, biology, or psychology might share these traits, making the probability reasonably high. Let's estimate this to be about 0.20 (20%).

Using Bayes’ Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

First, we calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.05 \times 0.10) + (0.20 \times 0.90) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.005 + 0.18 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.185 \]

Next, we calculate \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.10}{0.185} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.185} \]
\[ P(H|E) ≈ 0.027 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given the personality sketch is approximately 0.027 (2.7%).
