Let's start by defining the probabilities:

- P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- P(E|H): The likelihood of observing the characteristics in the personality sketch if Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- P(E|¬H): The likelihood of observing the characteristics in the personality sketch if Adam was not enrolled in business administration.

P(H): Since we have no prior information about Adam's field of study, we can assume that P(H) might be around 1/10 (as there are many possible fields).
  
P(E|H): The probability of observing Adam's traits given that he is in business administration. Given his traits—curiosity about nature, love for animals, problem-solving, high empathy, etc.—these are not typically strongly associated with business administration. We could assume a low value, let's say 0.1.

P(E|¬H): The probability of observing Adam's traits if he is not in business administration. Given his traits, it seems more probable that he is in a field related to nature, animals, science, or similar. We can assume a higher value, around 0.8.

Now we can use Bayes' rule to compute P(H|E):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

Let's compute P(E) first:

\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.1) + (0.8 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.01 + 0.72 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.73 \]

Now compute P(H|E):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.73} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.73} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0137 \]

So, our final probability, P(H|E), is approximately 0.0137.
