To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \), which is the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch, we need to use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here's a breakdown of the components:

1. \( P(H) \) - The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration.
2. \( P(E|H) \) - The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in business administration.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in business administration.
4. \( P(E) \) - The total probability of the personality sketch \( E \); this can be computed as:
   \[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

We need to judge reasonable values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Here are plausible values based on the information given:

1. \( P(H) \): The probability that any given graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in business administration. Let's assume it's 0.2 (20%).
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that someone in business administration has the personality traits described. These traits are less common or less directly related to business administration, so let's assume a low value, say 0.1 (10%).
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that someone not in business administration has these traits. Given the traits (interest in nature, puzzles, empathy, intelligence), it might be more common among students in fields like biology, psychology, or environmental science. Letâ€™s assume a higher value, say 0.4 (40%).

Now compute \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.2) + (0.4 \times 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.32 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.34 \]

Next, use Bayes' Rule to find \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.34} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.34} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0588 \]

In conclusion:

{
  "business administration": "0.0588"
