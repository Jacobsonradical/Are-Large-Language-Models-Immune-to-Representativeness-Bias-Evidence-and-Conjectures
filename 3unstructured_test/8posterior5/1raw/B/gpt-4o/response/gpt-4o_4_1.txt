To calculate the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch \( E \), we need to use Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

### Step 1: Define the Probabilities
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration (before considering his personality sketch). I'll assume a low but not negligible value since business administration is a common field but doesn't strongly align with Adam's personality traits.
   \[ P(H) \approx 0.1 \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in business administration. The traits described (curiosity about nature, love for animals, interest in puzzles) aren't typically associated with business administration but aren't impossible either. 
   \[ P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \]

3. **Complementary Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of observing personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in business administration. Given Adam's traits, it's more likely he was enrolled in a field more closely related to nature or science. 
   \[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.6 \]

### Step 2: Calculate \( P(E) \)
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \times 0.1) + (0.6 \times 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.54 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.56 \]

### Step 3: Apply Bayes' Rule
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.56} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.56} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0357 \]

### Conclusion
The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch is approximately 0.0357.
