To use Bayes' theorem in this context, we need to make educated guesses about the values of P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|¬H), where H represents the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Let's break this down:

1. **P(H) - The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration:** 
   Given that Adam is a graduate student, there are many fields he could be studying. Business administration is a relatively common field, but not excessively so. Let's assign it a reasonable prior probability.
   - P(H) ≈ 0.10 (10%)

2. **P(E|H) - The probability of Adam's personality sketch, given that he is enrolled in business administration:** 
   Business students might not typically fit Adam's personality profile that strongly emphasizes nature, empathy, and puzzles. However, it's not impossible.
   - P(E|H) might be lower, let's say ≈ 0.03 (3%)

3. **P(E|¬H) - The probability of Adam's personality sketch, given that he is not enrolled in business administration:**
   Given Adam's interests and personality, he might be more likely to be in fields related to biology, environmental science, or psychology. Therefore, this probability might be higher.
   - P(E|¬H) can be higher, let's say ≈ 0.08 (8%)

Now, apply these to Bayes' theorem to find P(H|E):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) * P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To compute P(E), we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|\neg H) * P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.03 * 0.10 + 0.08 * 0.90 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.003 + 0.072 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.075 \]

Now use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.03 * 0.10}{0.075} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.003}{0.075} \]
\[ P(H|E) ≈ 0.04 \]

So, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch is approximately 0.04 (4%).
