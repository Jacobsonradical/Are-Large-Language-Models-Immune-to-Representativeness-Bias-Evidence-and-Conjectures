To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch \( E \), we will use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.

We also need to consider \( P(E|\neg H) \), the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in business administration.

Here's the evaluation step-by-step:

1. **Estimate \( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that any graduate student is enrolled in business administration can vary, but it's generally a popular field. Let's assume a prior probability of around 0.2 (or 20%).

\[ P(H) = 0.2 \]

2. **Estimate \( P(E|H) \)**: We need to estimate the probability of Adam having his specific personality traits if he were studying business administration. Considering business administration might attract people interested in management, finance, and organizational behavior rather than nature, empathy, animals, and abstract concepts, this probability might be low. Let's assume 0.05 (or 5%).

\[ P(E|H) = 0.05 \]

3. **Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This represents how likely Adam's personality sketch fits a student in any other field. Given his traits, it seems more probable he might be enrolled in fields like environmental studies, biology, or psychology, which attract people with a love for nature, animals, and abstract thinking. Therefore, let's assume a higher probability, say 0.2 (or 20%).

\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \]

4. **Estimate \( P(E) \)**: This is the overall probability of Adam's personality sketch. Using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.05 \times 0.2) + (0.2 \times 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.01 + 0.16 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.17 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.2}{0.17} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.17} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0588 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch is approximately 0.0588 or 5.88%.
