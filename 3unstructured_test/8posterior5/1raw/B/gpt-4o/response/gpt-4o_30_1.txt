To assess the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch (E), we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. Here's the breakdown:

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in business administration.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in business administration.
- **P(H|E)**: The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch.

Let's assign some hypothetical values to these probabilities based on general knowledge and intuition:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of a graduate student being in business administration. Suppose it's around 0.2 (a common and popular field for graduate studies).
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam's profile fitting someone in business administration. Given his strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature, it seems less common for business administration students to have such a profile. Let's estimate this at 0.1.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of Adam's profile fitting someone not in business administration. It's plausible that students in fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology might have a profile like Adam's. Let's estimate this at 0.3.

Now, we can use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(H|E) \):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where \( P(E) \) can be found using the law of total probability:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

Using the values we estimated:

\[
P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8)
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.02 + 0.24
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.26
\]

Finally, calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.26}
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.26}
\]
\[
P(H|E) \approx 0.0769
\]

Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch is approximately 0.077.
