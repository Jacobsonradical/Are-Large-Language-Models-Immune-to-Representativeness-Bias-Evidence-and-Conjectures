To answer this question using Bayes' theorem, we will need to estimate the values of \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

### Definitions:
- \( H \): Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( E \): The personality sketch of Adam.

### Estimation:
1. **P(H)**: 
   - The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. 
   - Let's assume this is a prior that reflects the average proportion of graduate students enrolled in business administration programs. Let's assume \( 10\% \) of graduate students are in business administration programs.
   - So, \( P(H) = 0.10 \).

2. **P(E|H)**: 
   - The probability of Adam having his personality traits if he were enrolled in business administration.
   - Adam's traits such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy might be less typical for business administration students who might focus more on economics, strategy, and management.
   - Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.05 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**:
   - The probability of Adam having his personality traits if he were not enrolled in business administration.
   - Given Adam's personality, it seems likely that he might be in a field related to nature, animals, or sciences. Therefore, let's assign a higher probability for him having these traits if not in business administration.
   - So, \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.20 \).

### Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
Where \( P(E) \) is defined as:
\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

### Calculation:
\[
P(E) = (0.05 \cdot 0.10) + (0.20 \cdot 0.90)
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.005 + 0.18 = 0.185
\]

Now applying Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.10}{0.185} = \frac{0.005}{0.185} \approx 0.027
\]

In the required format:

{
  "business administration": 0.027
