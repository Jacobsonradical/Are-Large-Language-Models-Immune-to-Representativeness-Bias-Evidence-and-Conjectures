To estimate the likelihood that Adam was enrolled in business administration, we'll use the following format:

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's characteristics if he were enrolled in business administration.
- **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing Adam's characteristics if he were not enrolled in business administration.
- **P(H|E)**: The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his characteristics, which is calculated using Bayes' theorem.

### Step-by-Step:

1. **P(H)**: Let's consider the popularity of business administration programs among graduate students in the U.S. and suppose that roughly 20% (0.2) of graduate students enroll in such programs. Therefore, we might set P(H) = 0.2.

2. **P(E|H)**: This is the probability of Adam having his described characteristics if he were a business administration student. Business administration often focuses on leadership, management, and finance, which do not directly correlate with curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, love for animals, and strong empathy. Therefore, let’s estimate this probability to be quite low, say around 0.05.

3. **P(E|¬H)**: This is the probability of Adam having his characteristics if he were enrolled in a different field. Given that his characteristics are more aligned with disciplines like biology, environmental science, psychology, etc., this probability can be considered much higher in the broader population of non-business administration students. Let's estimate this to be around 0.9.

4. **P(H|E)**: The posterior probability, calculated using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.2}{(0.05 \cdot 0.2) + (0.9 \cdot 0.8)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.72} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.73} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0137 \]
