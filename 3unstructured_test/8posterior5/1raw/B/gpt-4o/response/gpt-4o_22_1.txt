Since we need to calculate the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given the personality sketch (E), we can use Bayes' theorem, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( H \): Hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( \neg H \): Hypothesis that Adam was not enrolled in business administration.
- \( E \): The personality sketch of Adam.

We need to estimate the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in business administration.
4. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of the personality sketch, which can be calculated using the law of total probability.

For simplification, let's assume that Adam has an equal chance of being enrolled in any graduate program, and there are 5 commonly chosen fields: business administration, biology, computer science, psychology, and environmental science. Therefore, \( P(H) = \frac{1}{5} = 0.2 \).

Given Adam's traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, high empathy, etc.), the probability that a person with those traits is enrolled in business administration (\( P(E|H) \)) is likely low because this field doesn't heavily align with those traits. Let's estimate it to be 0.05.

Conversely, if Adam were not enrolled in business administration, his traits might align more closely with fields like biology, psychology, or environmental science. Therefore, \( P(E|\neg H) \) would be relatively high. Let's estimate it to be 0.25.

Using these probabilities, we can calculate \( P(E) \) as follows:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.05 \cdot 0.2 + 0.25 \cdot 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.01 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.21 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.2}{0.21} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.21} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0476 \]

Thus, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch is approximately 0.0476.
