Let's break this down step by step using the Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \) (i.e., the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration before considering the personality sketch \( E \)).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the evidence \( E \) given that the hypothesis \( H \) is true (i.e., the probability of Adam having this personality sketch if he were enrolled in business administration).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of the evidence \( E \) given that the hypothesis \( H \) is not true (i.e., the probability of Adam having this personality sketch if he were not enrolled in business administration).

Let's assume we don't have specific data on the exact probabilities but can make reasoned estimates based on typical characteristics:

1. **\( P(H) \):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. In general graduate student populations, not all students are in business administration. Let's assume a prior probability of 0.10 (10%) for business administration, as this is a widely-sought field but not overwhelmingly common in all student populations.

2. **\( P(E|H) \):** The probability of Adam having this personality sketch if he were in business administration. While people in business administration can have empathy and be intelligent, the specific mention of a love for nature, plants, and animals, along with a quiet demeanor, does not strongly align with the stereotypical traits of business students. Let's estimate this probability to be 0.05 (5%).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \):** The probability of Adam having this personality sketch if he were not in business administration. Given that this personality sketch more strongly aligns with fields like biology, environmental science, or even psychology, we would expect this to be higher. Let's estimate this probability to be 0.30 (30%).

4. **\( P(E) \):** The overall probability of Adam having this personality sketch. This is derived from combining \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \) weighted by their respective prior probabilities:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.05 \times 0.10) + (0.30 \times 0.90) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.005 + 0.27 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.275 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.10}{0.275} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.275} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.018 \]

Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch is approximately 0.018 (1.8%).

Here is the answer in the requested format:
