Given the limited information about Adam, we can make some educated guesses about the probability values based on the personality sketch and common knowledge.

1. \( P(H) \) - The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration:
   - Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and interest in abstract concepts, it seems less likely he would choose business administration. Let’s assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \) (10%).

2. \( P(E|H) \) - The probability of observing the personality traits given that Adam is enrolled in business administration:
   - While it's possible for someone in business administration to have these traits, it may not be typical. Let’s assume \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \) (20%).

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - The probability of observing the personality traits given that Adam is not enrolled in business administration:
   - Given the traits, it seems more likely that Adam is in a field related to nature, science, or something similarly aligned with his interests. Let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.8 \) (80%).

Applying Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be derived using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's compute \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.8 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.72 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.74 \]

Now plug \( P(E) \) back into Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.74} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.74} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.027 \]

Therefore,

{
  "business administration": "0.027"
