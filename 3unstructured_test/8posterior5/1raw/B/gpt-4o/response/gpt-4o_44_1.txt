Given the details in Adam's personality sketch, we can judge the likelihoods as follows:

- P(H): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration. Since we don't have prior knowledge of his specific interests in relation to business administration, we might consider a low to moderate value, but reasonably assume general enrollment distribution.

- P(E|H): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he were enrolled in business administration. This might be relatively low because business administration does not typically require or directly cultivate a deep curiosity about nature, love for animals, or solving puzzles related to such themes, though the appreciation for hard work could be relevant.

- P(E|\neg H): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he were NOT enrolled in business administration. Given the focus on nature, animals, and abstract concepts, these traits might be more consistent with fields like biology, environmental science, or perhaps psychology, making this higher.

To compute P(H|E) using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's assign the following speculative values for the probabilities:
- P(H) = 0.1 (10%, a moderate assumption without specific preference knowledge)
- P(E|H) = 0.2 (traits somewhat align but not strongly with the field)
- P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 (traits align more with other fields)

We need to estimate P(E):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.2 * 0.1) + (0.5 * 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.45 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.47 \]

Now we can compute P(H|E):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 * 0.1}{0.47} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0426 \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.043 \]
