Let's begin by assessing the different probabilities involved in the Bayesian formula.

1. **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
   - Since Adam is described as having a genuine curiosity about nature and its plants, enjoys solving puzzles, has a deep love for animals, and understands abstract concepts, these traits are less typically associated with business administration than fields related to nature or science. Thus, we might assign a lower prior probability. Let's assume P(H) = 0.1 as a rough estimate.

2. **P(E|H):** The probability of observing the personality traits E given that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
   - It's possible for someone in business administration to have empathy, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work. However, a strong love for nature, plants, and animals might be less typical. Thus, P(E|H) could be medium-low. Let's use P(E|H) = 0.2.

3. **P(E|¬H):** The probability of observing the personality traits E given that Adam was not enrolled in business administration.
   - Given his personality traits, it's more probable that Adam was enrolled in a field like biology, environmental science, or another science-related discipline. Therefore, P(E|¬H) should be relatively high. Let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.7.

Now, we apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be defined using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Calculating \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.7 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.63 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.65 \]

Now, we can find \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.65} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.65} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0308 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch is approximately 0.0308.
