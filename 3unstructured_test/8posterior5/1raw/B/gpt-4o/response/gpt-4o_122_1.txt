Sure, let's first break down the components needed for Bayes' rule:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. This is generally quite low for someone with Adam's described traits because business administration doesn't strongly align with his interest in nature, puzzles, or animals. Let's assume a low value for P(H).
   
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in business administration. Given his traits, it seems low because business administration typically does not require or strongly align with his specific interests and personality traits. However, it is not impossible. Let's assume a low to moderate value.
   
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in business administration. Since his traits align more with fields like biology, environmental science, or similar, this probability would presumably be higher. Let's assume a moderate to high value for this probability.

Now, let's assign some illustrative values to these probabilities:

- **P(H)**: 0.05 (5%)
- **P(E|H)**: 0.1 (10%)
- **P(E|¬H)**: 0.7 (70%)

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the evidence, which can be computed as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

Plugging the values in:
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.05) + (0.7 \cdot 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.005 + 0.665 = 0.67 \]

Now compute \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.05}{0.67} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.67} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0075 \]

So the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch is approximately 0.0075 or 0.75%.

The answer in the specified format:

  "business administration": 0.0075
