Let's begin the process by evaluating the values needed for Bayes' theorem:

1. **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration as a graduate student.
2. **P(E|H):** The probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
3. **P(E|¬H):** The probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam was not enrolled in business administration.

**Assumptions:**

- **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Generally, we would need statistical data to compute this accurately, but let's assume for simplicity's sake that the distribution of graduate students across various fields is roughly equal. Let's assume P(H) = 1/10, assuming there are about 10 common fields.
  
- **P(E|H):** The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he was in business administration. Considering the profile, business administration typically does not directly correlate with a deep interest in nature, empathy towards animals, or solving abstract puzzles, which might be more typical in fields related to environmental sciences, biology, or psychology. Thus, this likelihood seems low. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.05.
  
- **P(E|¬H):** The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he was not in business administration. Since the personality sketch fits better with fields other than business administration, this is relatively high compared to P(E|H). Let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.12.

Now, let's compute P(H|E) using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(E) = (0.05 \cdot 0.1) + (0.12 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.005 + 0.108 = 0.113 \]

Now, calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{0.113} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.113} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0442 \]

Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given the personality sketch is approximately 0.0442.
