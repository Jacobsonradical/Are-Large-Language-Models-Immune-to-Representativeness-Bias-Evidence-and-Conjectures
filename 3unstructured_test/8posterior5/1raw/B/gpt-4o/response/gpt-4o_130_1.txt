To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). Since we don't have exact values, we make reasoned estimates based on Adam's personality sketch and the field in question. 

Let's denote:

- \( H \): Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( \neg H \): Adam was not enrolled in business administration.
- \( E \): The personality sketch of Adam.

**Estimations:**

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
   - Business administration is a common graduate field but not exceptionally fitting of Adam's interests (nature, puzzles, animals, abstract concepts).
   - Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   - Given the field of business administration, the personality sketch of Adam doesn't strongly align with typical characteristics of business students. Still, it is not impossible.
   - A reasonable estimate might be \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   - Given that Adam's personality sketch is better suited for fields like biology, environmental science, psychology, etc., it's more likely for such a profile than for business administration.
   - A reasonable estimate might be \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \).

**Bayes' Rule Application:**

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be computed as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.6 \cdot 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.54 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.56 \]

So,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.56} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.56} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.036 \]

The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration, given the personality sketch, is approximately 0.036.
