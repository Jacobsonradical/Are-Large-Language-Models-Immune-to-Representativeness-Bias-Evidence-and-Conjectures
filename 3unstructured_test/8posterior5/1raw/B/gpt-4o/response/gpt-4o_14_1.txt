To compute \( P(H|E) \) for the field of business administration, we first need to estimate the probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). 

**Definitions:**
- \( H \): Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( E \): The personality sketch of Adam.

To refine our estimations, let's reason through each probability:

1. **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is enrolled in business administration. This will generally depend on the popularity of the field, but let's assume it's around 10%, which is a reasonable estimate given the variety of fields. \( P(H) = 0.10 \).

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in business administration. 
   - Curiosity about nature/plants: Unlikely for business students.
   - Enjoys solving puzzles: Somewhat relevant.
   - Warm heart, strong empathy: Positive but not specific to business.
   - Love for animals: Irrelevant.
   - High intelligence, understanding abstract concepts: Possible but not specific to business.
   - Understanding and appreciation for hard work: Typical for business students.

   Given these considerations, \( P(E|H) \) seems lower, as the personality sketch aligns more with fields in natural sciences or psychology. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) as 0.05.

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in business administration. This is more likely considering the personality characteristics described. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) at 0.30.

Now using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.05 \cdot 0.10) + (0.30 \cdot 0.90) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.005 + 0.27 = 0.275 \]

Now calculating \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.10}{0.275} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.275} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0182 \]

Thus, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given the personality sketch E is approximately 0.0182 or 1.82%.
