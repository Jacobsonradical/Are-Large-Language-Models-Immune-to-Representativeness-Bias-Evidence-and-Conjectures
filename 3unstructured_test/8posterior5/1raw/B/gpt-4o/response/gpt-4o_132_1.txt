To calculate \( P(H|E) \) (the probability that Adam was enrolled in a business administration program given his personality sketch), we need to use Bayes' theorem, which is formulated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This is the initial probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration.
   - Without any additional data, we can assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \), considering the wide range of fields a graduate student might choose. This is an arbitrary choice, and could be different based on more robust statistics.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam is in business administration.
   - Given that business administration typically involves subjects like management, finance, and operations rather than a focus on nature, plants, or animals, \( P(E|H) \) would likely be low. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

3. **Alternate Hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is the probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam is *not* in business administration.
   - Since Adam's interests and personality traits are more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology, the probability of \( E \) given a random non-business field is higher. For example, \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

To compute \( P(H|E) \), we also need the marginal probability \( P(E) \), which is the total probability of observing the evidence \( E \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Plugging in our values:

\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.01 + 0.27 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.28 \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.28} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.28} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.036 \]

Finally, our answer is:

  "business administration": 0.036
