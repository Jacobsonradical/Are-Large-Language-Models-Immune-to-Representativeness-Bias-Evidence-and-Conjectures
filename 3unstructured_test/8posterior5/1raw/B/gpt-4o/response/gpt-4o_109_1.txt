Given the personality sketch E and the hypothesis H, we want to calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule. 

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of H.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of E given H.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of E.

For the field of business administration:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Since we lack specific statistical data, we can assume it based on general knowledge. Business administration is a common field, so let's assign a value of 0.2, indicating that there's a moderate chance among all possible fields of study.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam is in business administration.
   - Although some aspects of E, like high intelligence and appreciation for hard work, could fit business administration, other traits like a deep love for animals and curiosity about nature might be less common in this field.
   - Let's assign a moderate value of 0.1 due to some alignment with business traits.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam is not in business administration.
   - Without specific data, we must generalize. Considering his traits, he seems more likely to be in fields related to science, research, or biology rather than business administration. Hence, the probability of these traits appearing outside business administration could be higher.
   - Let's assign this a value of 0.5.

So now, we can use Bayes' rule to calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Since \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.5 \cdot 0.8) = 0.02 + 0.4 = 0.42 \]

Now, we can find \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.42} = \frac{0.02}{0.42} \approx 0.048 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given the personality sketch is approximately 0.048.
