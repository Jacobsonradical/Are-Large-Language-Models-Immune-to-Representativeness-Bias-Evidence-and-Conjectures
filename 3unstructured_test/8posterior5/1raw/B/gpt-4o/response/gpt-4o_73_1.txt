To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given the personality sketch (E) of Adam, we use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch given that he was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch.

We need to make reasonable estimates for these probabilities.

### Prior Probability \( P(H) \):
Without any specific data, we assume that Adam has an equal probability of being enrolled in any field. For the sake of simplicity, we might assume a uniform distribution over all possible fields. Let's assume there are 10 possible fields he could be enrolled in, which gives:

\[ P(H) = \frac{1}{10} = 0.1 \]

### Probability \( P(E|H) \):
This is the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Business administration students often value hard work and dedication, but the other traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, solving puzzles) are less strongly associated with business administration. Therefore, let's assume:
\[ P(E|H) = 0.2 \]

### Probability \( P(E|\neg H) \):
This is the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in business administration. Given that Adam's traits suggest he might be more aligned with fields such as biology, environmental science, or animal science, the probability of this sketch if he was enrolled in any field other than business administration might be higher. Let's estimate:
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \]

### Total Probability \( P(E) \):
Using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E| \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.27 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

### Posterior Probability \( P(H|E) \):
Now use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.02}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.069 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch is approximately 0.069.
