To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following probabilities:

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in business administration.

Let's estimate these probabilities:

1. **\( P(H) \) (Prior Probability):**
   Simplistically assuming a uniform distribution among various graduate fields, the prior probability may be around 0.1 (considering there are roughly ten broad graduate fields such as science, engineering, humanities, social sciences, business, etc.).

2. **\( P(E|H) \) (Likelihood):**
   Given Adam's attributes (curiosity about nature, loves animals, warm heart, strong empathy, high intelligence, appreciation for hard work), these traits don't strongly align with the typical profile of a business administration student. These programs often emphasize leadership, management, analytics, and less so innate curiosity about nature or empathy. We might assign a low probability here, perhaps around 0.05.

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \) (Likelihood of Evidence given Not-H):**
   Given that Adam's traits align more closely with fields involving nature and animals (like biology, environmental science, or related fields), the probability of \( E \) given not-business-administration would be relatively higher, let's estimate it to be around 0.3.

Now we use Bayes' rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} 
\]
Where,
\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
P(E) = (0.05 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) = 0.005 + 0.27 = 0.275
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{0.275} \approx 0.018
\]

Thus, the conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given the personality sketch \( E \) is approximately 0.018.
