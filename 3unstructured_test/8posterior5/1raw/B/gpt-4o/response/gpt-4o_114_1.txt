To calculate \( P(H|E) \) (the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch E), we will follow the steps outlined:

1. **Estimate \( P(H) \)**: This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. It usually reflects how common the field is, but since we don't have specific statistics, we might assume a reasonable value. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \) (20%).

2. **Estimate \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the likelihood that Adam's personality sketch fits someone in business administration.
   - Business administration students may not typically have a deep love for animals, strong empathy, and a keen interest in nature, but they might value intelligence and understanding hard work. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

3. **Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is *not* enrolled in business administration. Given the provided interests and traits, align more closely with fields outside of business administration (e.g., biology, psychology). So let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

4. **Compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule**:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where \( P(E) \) can be computed as:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

\[
P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.4 \cdot 0.8)
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.02 + 0.32
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.34
\]

Now, calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.34}
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.34}
\]
\[
P(H|E) \approx 0.059
\]

So the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration is approximately 0.059 (or 5.9%).
