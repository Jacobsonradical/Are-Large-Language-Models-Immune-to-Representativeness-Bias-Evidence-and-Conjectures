To address the question, we need to apply Bayes' Rule, which is expressed as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given the personality sketch E.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the personality sketch E.

For this calculation, we need to estimate the following probabilities:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \) (Adam being enrolled in business administration)**:
   Let’s assume the prior probability \( P(H) \) is around 0.1 (10%) since business administration is a common field of study, but it may not fit perfectly with the personality sketch.

2. **Probability \( P(E|H) \) (Personality sketch E given enrollment in business administration)**:
   A typical business administration student may not always exhibit a strong interest in nature, plants, animals, puzzles, and abstract concepts. Thus, \( P(E|H) \) would be reasonably low. Let’s assume it around 0.05 (5%).

3. **Probability \( P(E|\neg H) \) (Personality sketch E given not in business administration)**:
   Given Adam's interests and characteristics, he might more likely be in a field such as biology, environmental science, or a similar discipline. So \( P(E|\neg H) \) should be higher compared to \( P(E|H) \). Let’s assume it around 0.3 (30%).

4. **Total Probability \( P(E) \)**:
   \( P(E) \) can be computed using the law of total probability:
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
   \]
   \[
   P(E) = (0.05 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9)
   \]
   \[
   P(E) = 0.005 + 0.27 = 0.275
   \]

Now we can apply Bayes' Rule to find \( P(H|E) \):
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{0.275}
\]
\[
P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.005}{0.275} \approx 0.018
\]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch is approximately 0.018 (1.8%).
