Let's estimate the probabilities as follows:

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. This depends on the general distribution of graduate students across different fields. Business administration is a common field, so we might estimate this at about 0.15 or 15%.

- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch (E) given that he was enrolled in business administration. Given the traits described (curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, understanding of hard work and dedication), these traits do not closely align with what we typically associate with business administration. Therefore, we might estimate this at around 0.2 or 20%.

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in business administration. Given that these traits might be more common in fields like environmental science, biology, or even psychology, we could estimate this as higher, say around 0.4 or 40%.

Now, we use Bayes' rule to calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H)}
\]

Plugging in the values:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.15}{0.2 \times 0.15 + 0.4 \times (1 - 0.15)}
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.34}
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.37}
\]

\[
P(H|E) \approx 0.081
\]

So, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration, given his personality sketch, is approximately 0.081 or 8.1%.
