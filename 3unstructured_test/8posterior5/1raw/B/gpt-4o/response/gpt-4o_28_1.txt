Let's break down and compute the probabilities:

1. **P(H):** The probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
2. **P(E|H):** The probability of observing personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
3. **P(E|¬H):** The probability of observing personality sketch E given that Adam was not enrolled in business administration.
4. **P(H|E):** The probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given the personality sketch E (using Bayes' rule).

Let's assume:
- The prior probability P(H) that a graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in business administration is around 0.1 (10%).
- Considering Adam's traits, P(E|H) might be low (say 0.1) because his interests and personality do not strongly align with what is typically associated with business administration.
- P(E|¬H), the probability of observing Adam's personality given he is enrolled in other fields (not business administration), might be higher because his traits align more with fields related to nature, animals, and possibly scientific research. Let's assume this value to be about 0.7.

Now we use Bayes' rule to compute P(H|E):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To find P(E), we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.1) + (0.7 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.01 + 0.63 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.64 \]

Now, we can compute P(H|E):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.64} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.64} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.015625 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given the provided personality sketch is approximately 0.0156 (about 1.56%).
