To compute the probability \( P(\text{H} | \text{E}) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to assess \( P(\text{H}) \), \( P(\text{E} | \text{H}) \), and \( P(\text{E} | \neg \text{H}) \).

1. **\( P(\text{H}) \)** - The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. We'll assume this is a common field of study, but not exceptionally likely for someone with his personality sketch.
   
2. **\( P(\text{E} | \text{H}) \)** - The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is studying business administration. Business administration may attract individuals with a variety of traits, but not necessarily the specific ones described in Adam's sketch. His traits seem more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology, so this might be low.
   
3. **\( P(\text{E} | \neg \text{H}) \)** - The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not studying business administration. This encompasses all other fields, some of which, like natural sciences or psychology, may have a higher alignment with his traits.

Let's assume the following values based on the given sketch:
- \( P(\text{H}) \approx 0.1 \) - Business administration is commonly chosen but not the best fit for his personality.
- \( P(\text{E} | \text{H}) \approx 0.1 \) - The traits described are less likely to be found in business administration.
- \( P(\text{E} | \neg \text{H}) \approx 0.5 \) - There are other fields (like environmental science, biology, psychology) that align more closely with his traits.

Now, applying Bayes' rule:
\[ P(\text{H} | \text{E}) = \frac{P(\text{E} | \text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H})}{P(\text{E})} \]
Where:
\[ P(\text{E}) = P(\text{E} | \text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H}) + P(\text{E} | \neg \text{H}) \cdot P(\neg \text{H}) \]
\[ P(\neg \text{H}) = 1 - P(\text{H}) \]
\[ P(\neg \text{H}) = 0.9 \]

Calculate \( P(\text{E}) \):
\[ P(\text{E}) = (0.1 \times 0.1) + (0.5 \times 0.9) \]
\[ P(\text{E}) = 0.01 + 0.45 \]
\[ P(\text{E}) = 0.46 \]

Now calculate \( P(\text{H} | \text{E}) \):
\[ P(\text{H} | \text{E}) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.1}{0.46} \]
\[ P(\text{H} | \text{E}) = \frac{0.01}{0.46} \]
\[ P(\text{H} | \text{E}) \approx 0.0217 \]

Thus, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch \( E \) is approximately \( 0.0217 \).
