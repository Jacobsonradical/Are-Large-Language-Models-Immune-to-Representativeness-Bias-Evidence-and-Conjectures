To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is expressed as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here,
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of Adam having the given personality sketch if he was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of Adam having the given personality sketch if he was not enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given the personality sketch.

First, let's evaluate the probabilities:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration. Without additional context, let's assume this to be 0.2, as this is one of the multiple possible fields he could be enrolled in.

2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of someone with Adam's personality being enrolled in business administration. Given that people in business administration might not typically exhibit such a dedicated interest in nature, plants, animals, and solving puzzles (which are more commonly associated with fields like biology, environmental science, or maybe STEM), we can estimate this probability to be relatively low. Let's set this to 0.1.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of someone with Adam's personality being enrolled in any field other than business administration. Given Adam's profile, fields related to environmental science, biology, or STEM might be more fitting. Hence, we might estimate this likelihood to be higher. Let's assume this to be 0.5.

4. **P(E)**: The probability of having Adamâ€™s personality sketch overall. Using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.5 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.4 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.42 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.42} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.42} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.048 \]

Thus, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given the personality sketch is approximately 0.048.
