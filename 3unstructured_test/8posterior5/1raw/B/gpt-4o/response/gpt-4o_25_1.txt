Sure, let's go through the calculations for the field of business administration.

1. **P(H) - Prior Probability:**
   - Let’s assume that the likelihood of Adam enrolling in any particular field is equal among all fields available to graduate students. Given it's a broad range, let’s assume a reasonable prior probability. For the sake of simplicity, let's set P(H) = 0.05 (5%).

2. **P(E|H) - Likelihood:**
   - The given personality sketch suggests Adam has a curiosity about nature, loves animals, enjoys puzzles, and appreciates hard work. These traits seem less aligned with business administration compared to other fields like environmental science or biology.
   - Thus, P(E|H) might be lower for business administration. Let’s ballpark it at 0.1 (10%).

3. **P(E|\neg H) - Likelihood for Not H:**
   - The likelihood of Adam having the same personality traits given that he is not enrolled in business administration but in some other more suitable field (like environmental science, biology, etc.) should be higher.
   - We might set P(E|\neg H) at around 0.5 (50%).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Let's plug in the numbers:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.05}{0.1 \cdot 0.05 + 0.5 \cdot 0.95} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.475} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.48} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0104 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability is roughly 0.0104 or 1.04%.

So, the answer is:

{
  "business administration": "0.0104"
