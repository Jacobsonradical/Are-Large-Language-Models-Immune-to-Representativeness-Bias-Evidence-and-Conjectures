To evaluate the likelihood that Adam was enrolled in business administration (denoted as hypothesis H) in 2021, given the personality sketch E, we can use Bayes' rule, which is formulated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here's the step-by-step process for estimating these probabilities:

1. **P(H): The Prior Probability**  
   This represents the initial probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration without any additional information. Assuming there are various popular fields for graduate studies (e.g., business, engineering, natural sciences), let's assume P(H) is reasonably small given his personality traits do not directly align with common traits associated with business administration. Let's assume:
   
   \[ P(H) = 0.1 \]

2. **P(E|H): The Likelihood**  
   This is the probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Since Adam enjoys nature, plants, puzzles, has empathy, and loves animals, these traits are not typically aligned with a business administration specialization. Thus, we will assume a lower value for P(E|H):

   \[ P(E|H) = 0.05 \]

3. **P(E|\neg H): The Likelihood of E given not H**  
   This is the probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in some other field than business administration. Fields such as natural sciences or environmental studies seem to align more closely with Adam's interests and strengths. Thus, we assume the probability is higher for E occurring if Adam is not in business administration:

   \[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \]

4. **P(E): The Marginal Probability**  
   This is the total probability of observing the personality sketch E. It can be calculated using:
   
   \[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

   Where \( \neg H \) is the complement of H. Let's calculate this:

   \[
   P(E) = (0.05 \cdot 0.1) + (0.4 \cdot 0.9)
   \]
   
   \[
   P(E) = 0.005 + 0.36
   \]

   \[
   P(E) = 0.365
   \]

Finally, using Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{0.365}
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.365}
\]

\[
P(H|E) \approx 0.0137
\]

Thus, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch is approximately 0.0137.

Here's the answer in the required format:
