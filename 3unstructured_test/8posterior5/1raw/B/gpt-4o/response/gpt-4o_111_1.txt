To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given the personality sketch E, we will use Bayes' rule. Let’s denote and estimate the following probabilities:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was not enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given the personality sketch E.

Let's make some educated guesses for these probabilities.

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The prior probability of being enrolled in business administration could be relatively average among graduate students. Assume a value such as 0.2.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood of seeing the personality sketch for someone in business administration might be lower because the characteristics don't strongly point to a typical business administration student. They seem more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology. Let’s assign a lower value, such as 0.1.

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The likelihood of seeing the personality sketch if Adam was not in business administration is higher, considering the characteristics might fit better with other fields. Assume a value like 0.5.

Now, we can use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be computed using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

First, let’s compute \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.2) + (0.5 \times (1 - 0.2)) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.4 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.42 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.42} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.42} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{2}{42} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.048 \]

Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given the personality sketch is approximately:
