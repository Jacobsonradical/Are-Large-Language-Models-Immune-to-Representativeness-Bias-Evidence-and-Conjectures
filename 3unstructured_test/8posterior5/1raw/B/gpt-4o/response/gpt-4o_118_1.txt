To estimate the probabilities, we need to break down the information given about Adam. Here’s a step-by-step approach:

1. **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Typically, without specific information, we would assume it to be the general enrollment proportion in business administration among graduate students. For simplicity, let’s assume this to be 10% or 0.1 (since business administration is a common field but not the most prevalent).

2. **P(E|H)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch, given that he is studying business administration. Business administration students might have varied interests and skills, but some of Adam’s traits such as problem-solving, high intelligence, and understanding of dedication could align with a business administration profile. If we were to ascribe this a likelihood, let’s assume it’s 0.4.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch, given that he is not studying business administration. Traits such as curiosity about nature and a deep love for animals might be more common among students of natural sciences or similar fields rather than business. Hence, this could be slightly higher than 0.4 as it's representative across many fields. For estimation, let’s assume it to be 0.5.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

First, compute \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.4 \cdot 0.1) + (0.5 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.45 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.49 \]

Now, compute \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.1}{0.49} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.49} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0816 \]

Here is the answer in the required format:
