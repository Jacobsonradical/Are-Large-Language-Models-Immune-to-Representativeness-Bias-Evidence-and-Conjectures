To solve this problem using Bayes' rule, we need to determine the probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration (H) given the personality sketch (E).

### Steps:

1. **Set priors**:
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is studying business administration.
   - \( P(\neg H) \): The prior probability that Adam is studying some field other than business administration. Given no specific information, we might assume equal priors for simplicity (but in real-world scenarios, domain knowledge should influence priors). Therefore, \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \) (assuming 10 possible fields of study).

2. **Likelihoods**:
   - \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch given Adam is studying business administration.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch given Adam is studying other fields.

### Assumptions:
- Business administration is not typically associated with deep curiosity about nature, puzzles, or a deep love for animals. It's more oriented towards managing people, businesses, and operations.
- Fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary studies might have higher likelihoods given the personality sketch.

### Estimates:
- \( P(E|H) \approx 0.02 \): Low, as the personality traits described donâ€™t strongly align with business administration.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.1 \): Other fields may have a higher probability of exhibiting the given personality traits.

### Applying Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Calculations:
- Given \( P(H) = 0.1 \) and \( P(\neg H) = 0.9 \):
\[ P(E) = (0.02 \cdot 0.1) + (0.1 \cdot 0.9) = 0.002 + 0.09 = 0.092 \]

Now, compute \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02 \cdot 0.1}{0.092} \approx \frac{0.002}{0.092} \approx 0.0217 \]

### Final Answer:

  "business administration": 0.0217
