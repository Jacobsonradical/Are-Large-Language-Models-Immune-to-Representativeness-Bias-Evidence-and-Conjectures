To use Bayes' rule to compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration (\( H \)), we need to make educated guesses about the required probabilities based on the personality sketch provided. 

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Given Adam's interests in nature, puzzles, empathy, and animals, business administration does not immediately align with his personality sketch.
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.05 \) (assuming a low prior probability).

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood of observing the personality sketch if Adam was enrolled in business administration.
   - Adam's attributes don't strongly suggest business administration, but they aren't impossible either.
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The likelihood of observing the personality sketch if Adam was not enrolled in business administration.
   - Given his interests, he's more likely to be in fields such as biology, environmental science, or psychology.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.8 \).

4. **\( P(\neg H) \)**: The probability that Adam was not enrolled in business administration. 
   - \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.95 \).

By Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.05) + (0.8 \cdot 0.95) = 0.01 + 0.76 = 0.77 \]

Then compute \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.05}{0.77} = \frac{0.01}{0.77} \approx 0.013 \]

So the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch is approximately:
