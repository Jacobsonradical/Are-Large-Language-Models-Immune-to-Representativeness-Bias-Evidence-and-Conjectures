To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch \( E \), we start by estimating the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of his personality sketch given that he was enrolled in business administration.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of his personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in business administration.

Let's make some reasonable estimates:

1. **Estimate \( P(H) \):**
   - Business administration is a common field, but considering Adam's specific interests in nature, puzzles, empathy, and animals, he might be less likely to choose this path.
   - Let's assign a moderate prior probability, say \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

2. **Estimate \( P(E|H) \):**
   - Business administration does not typically require a deep curiosity about nature, plants, or animals, nor does it strongly correlate with empathy and puzzles. However, strong intelligence and appreciation for hard work are beneficial.
   - Given this, it seems less likely for the personality sketch to fit someone in business administration. We can assign a low value to \( P(E|H) \), say \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

3. **Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   - Contrast this with fields that might better fit Adam's interests, such as biology, environmental science, or psychology, where such a personality makes perfect sense.
   - Assigning a higher likelihood for \( E \) given that Adam is in some other field, we can set \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

Now, we use Bayes' Rule to compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's compute \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.5 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.4 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.42 \]

Now, compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.42} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.42} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.0476 \]

Rescale for simplicity:

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.048 \)

So, we can write:

{
  "business administration": "0.048"
