To compute \( P(H|E) \), the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch, we need to consider the following probabilities:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given that he was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given that he was not enrolled in business administration.

Given Adam's personality sketch, it seems less likely that someone with a strong curiosity about nature, a quiet disposition, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work would choose business administration compared to fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology, which align more closely with his traits.

However, to assign specific values, we can make some educated approximations:

1. \( P(H) \): Let's assume the general prior probability, considering the wide variety of fields graduate students might choose. We can assign a moderate value of \( 0.1 \), acknowledging that business administration is a common field but not necessarily the most likely given the personality sketch.

2. \( P(E|H) \): Given the field of business administration, the likelihood of Adam having such a personality sketch is relatively low since business administration typically attracts individuals with interests in management, finance, and human resources. We can assign a value of \( 0.1 \).

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): Considering fields outside of business administration that align more closely with Adam's interests and traits (like environmental science, biology, etc.), the likelihood of observing such a personality sketch is higher. We can assign a value of \( 0.4 \).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where \( P(E) \) can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

Since \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) \):

\[
P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.1) + (0.4 \cdot 0.9) = 0.01 + 0.36 = 0.37
\]

Therefore,

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.37} = \frac{0.01}{0.37} \approx 0.027
\]

So,

\[
{
  "business administration": "0.027"
}
\]
