Given the personality sketch of Adam and the provided hypothesis, we'll reason through the probabilities.

1. **P(H)** – The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
2. **P(E|H)** – The probability of witnessing the personality sketch E if Adam were enrolled in business administration.
3. **P(E|¬H)** – The probability of witnessing the personality sketch E if Adam was *not* enrolled in business administration.
4. **P(H|E)** – The posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch.

Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, is a quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles, shows empathy, loves animals, possesses high intelligence, and appreciates hard work and dedication. These traits align more with fields such as biology, environmental science, or psychology rather than business administration, but let's analyze the probabilities:

1. **P(H)**: This is the base rate that any given graduate student is enrolled in business administration, typically high because business administration is a popular field. Let's heuristically assume P(H) = 0.3 (30%).

2. **P(E|H)**: Given the field of business administration, it is relatively unlikely to find someone with a personality sketch like Adam's, which is more aligned with the aforementioned fields. Let’s suppose P(E|H) = 0.05 (5%).

3. **P(E|¬H)**: Assuming Adam is enrolled in another field, it's relatively more likely we would encounter his personality traits. Given the multitude of fields and personal interests, let's assume a broader compatibility, so P(E|¬H) = 0.2 (20%).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|¬H) * P(¬H) \]

First, calculate P(E):
\[ P(E) = (0.05 * 0.3) + (0.2 * 0.7) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.015 + 0.14 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.155 \]

Now, use Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 * 0.3}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.015}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.097 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given the personality sketch is approximately 0.097 (9.7%).
