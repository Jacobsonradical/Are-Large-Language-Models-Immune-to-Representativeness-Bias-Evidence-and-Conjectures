To solve this problem using Bayes' theorem, we need to quantify the given values and then plug them into the formula. Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's break it down:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. 
   - Given that this is not mentioned explicitly, let's assume a general average value. In the U.S., the probability a graduate student is enrolled in business administration is not very high since the field encompasses a broad range of programs. We might assume something like \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam has the described personality sketch given that he is enrolled in business administration. 
   - Business administration students might have empathy, intelligence, and dedication but having a strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, and enjoyment of solving puzzles sounds less typical for business administration, so it's somewhat lower. Let's assume \(P(E|H) \approx 0.2\).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that Adam has the described personality sketch given that he is NOT enrolled in business administration.
   - Graduate programs that fit Adam's traits more closely might include environmental science, biology, or psychology. Thus, the probability that Adam has this personality sketch in fields other than business administration is higher. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \).

4. **P(E)**: The total probability that Adam has the described personality sketch. 
   - This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H)) \]

Substitute the assumed values:

\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.5 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.45 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.47 \]

Now, apply these into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{(0.2 \cdot 0.1)}{0.47} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.47} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.043 \]

Thus,

{
  "business administration": "0.043"
}
