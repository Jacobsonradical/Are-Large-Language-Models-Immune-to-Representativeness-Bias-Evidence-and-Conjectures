To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch \( E \), we will use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( H \) is the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in business administration, \( E \) is the personality sketch of Adam, and \( \neg H \) is the hypothesis that Adam was not enrolled in business administration.

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration. Without specific data, we assume a uniform distribution across fields. Let’s estimate \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam’s personality given that he is enrolled in business administration. Business administration students might not typically align with Adam’s deep love for nature and animals, solving puzzles, and empathy. Let’s estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam’s personality given that he is not enrolled in business administration. Given his traits, Adam might more typically belong to fields such as biology, environmental science, or psychology. Let’s estimate this probability as \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

4. **P(E)**: The total probability of observing Adam’s personality. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.1) + (0.3 \times 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.01 + 0.27 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.28 \]

Now, apply Bayes’ theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.1}{0.28} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.28} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.036 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch is approximately 0.036.
