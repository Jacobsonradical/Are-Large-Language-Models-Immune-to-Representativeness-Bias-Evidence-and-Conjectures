To solve the problem using Bayes' theorem, we need to assess the following probabilities:
- P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- P(E|H): The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- P(E|¬H): The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in business administration.

After estimating these values, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(H|E), which is the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch.

Bayes' theorem is defined as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the personality sketch, which can be expanded as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Given that we need to provide values between 0 and 1, let's estimate:

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. This can be assumed based on the general distribution of graduate students across different fields. Suppose about 10% of graduate students are in business administration, so we might set:

  \[ P(H) \approx 0.10 \]

- **P(E|H)**: The probability of having the given personality sketch if Adam is in business administration. Since the personality traits do not closely align with typical traits of business administration students, this probability may be low. Let's estimate:

  \[ P(E|H) \approx 0.20 \]

- **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of having the given personality sketch if Adam is not in business administration. Considering the traits fit better with many other fields (such as natural sciences, biology, etc.), this probability may be higher. Let's estimate:

  \[ P(E|¬H) \approx 0.50 \]

Now, calculate P(E), the total probability of the personality sketch:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.20 \times 0.10) + (0.50 \times 0.90) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.45 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.47 \]

Finally, use Bayes' theorem to compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{(0.20 \times 0.10)}{0.47} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.47} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.043 \]

So, the estimated probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch is approximately 0.043. Represented in the required format:
