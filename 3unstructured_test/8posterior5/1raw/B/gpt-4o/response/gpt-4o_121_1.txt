To solve this problem, we need to estimate three probabilities: \( P(H) \) (the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration), \( P(E|H) \) (the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in business administration), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) (the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not enrolled in business administration). Then, we use Bayes' rule to find \( P(H|E) \), the probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch.

Based on the personality sketch provided:
1. Adam has a curiosity about nature and plants.
2. He enjoys solving puzzles.
3. He has strong empathy and a deep love for animals.
4. He is highly intelligent with a good understanding of abstract concepts.
5. He appreciates hard work and dedication.

These traits don't generally align strongly with traditional expectations of a business administration student, who might be expected to have more traits associated with leadership, finance, management, and strategic thinking.

### Probabilities
- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: 
  We can assume a neutral prior probability such as 0.1 (or 10%) since there are many possible fields a graduate student might be in. 

- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: 
  Since Adam's traits don't strongly align with traditional traits of business administration students, we might assign a relatively low probability here, such as 0.1.

- **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: 
  Given Adam's personality and interests, it might be more probable that he is in a field related to nature, puzzles, or animals, such as environmental science, biology, or psychology. Hence, let's assign this a higher probability, such as 0.4.

### Applying Bayes' Rule

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be computed using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.1) + (0.4 \times 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.01 + 0.36 = 0.37 \]

Now, applying Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.1}{0.37} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.01}{0.37} \approx 0.027 \]
