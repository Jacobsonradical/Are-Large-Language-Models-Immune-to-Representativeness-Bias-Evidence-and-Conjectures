To address the question and compute the desired probabilities, we need to estimate the probabilities based on the information given and general knowledge about the field. Specifically, we will estimate:

1. \( P(H) \) – the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration as a graduate student in 2021.
2. \( P(E|H) \) – the likelihood of the personality sketch, given that Adam was studying business administration.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) – the likelihood of the personality sketch, given that Adam was not studying business administration.

### Estimations:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Business administration is a popular field, but given Adam's personality traits, it seems less likely compared to fields more aligned with a love of nature and animals.
   - Assume \( P(H) \) is relatively low. Let’s set \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Business administration students may have diverse personalities, and some could fit Adam's profile, but it might not be the most common.
   - Let’s set \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - Adam's description appears to be more aligned with other fields such as environmental science, biology, or psychology.
   - Let’s set \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

### Bayes' Rule:

Bayes’ Rule is defined as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let’s calculate it step-by-step:

1. Calculate \( P(\neg H) \):
   \[ P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9 \]

2. Calculate \( P(E) \):
   \[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.4 \cdot 0.9) \]
   \[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.36 \]
   \[ P(E) = 0.38 \]

3. Calculate \( P(H|E) \):
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.38} \]
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.38} \]
   \[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0526 \]

Thus, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch is approximately 0.0526.
