To estimate the probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for Adam being enrolled in business administration, let's break it down:

1. **P(H)**: The probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration. Since we have no specific data, we will use a reasonable assumption that any graduate field has an equal prior probability. Let's assume a prior probability of 0.1 (10%) for business administration.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in business administration. Business administration typically involves people skills and understanding abstract concepts, which aligns somewhat with Adam's traits, but it is not a perfect match. Let's assume a reasonable probability of 0.3 (30%).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not enrolled in business administration. Adam's personality sketch fits well with fields like biology or environmental science, but not as strongly with business administration. Thus, we can assume a higher probability for other fields. Let's assume this probability to be 0.5 (50%).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.3 \cdot 0.1 + 0.5 \cdot (1 - 0.1) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.03 + 0.45 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.48 \]

Now, calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.48} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.48} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0625 \]

So, the probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch is approximately 0.0625, or 6.25%.
