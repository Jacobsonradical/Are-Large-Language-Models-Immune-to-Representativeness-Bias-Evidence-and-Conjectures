To apply Bayes' rule and compute \( P(H|E) \), we need the following probabilities:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field of Business Administration.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the personality traits \( E \), given that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the personality traits \( E \), given that Adam was not enrolled in Business Administration.

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be expanded as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's assume:
- \( P(H) \) (Prior probability that a student is enrolled in Business Administration): 0.2
- \( P(E|H) \) (Probability that a student with Adam's personality traits is in Business Administration): 0.1
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) (Probability that a student with Adam's personality traits is in a different field): 0.9
- \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.8 \)

Now, let's calculate:

\[ P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.2) + (0.9 \times 0.8) = 0.02 + 0.72 = 0.74 \]

Then, applying Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.74} = \frac{0.02}{0.74} \approx 0.027 \]

The likelihood \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration given the provided personality sketch E is approximately 0.027.
