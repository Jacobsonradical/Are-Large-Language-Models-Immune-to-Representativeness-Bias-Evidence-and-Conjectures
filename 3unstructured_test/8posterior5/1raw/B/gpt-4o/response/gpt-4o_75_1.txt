Let's estimate the probabilities needed for applying Bayes' Theorem to determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration (H) given his personality sketch (E).

1. **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Without specific data, we can assume a generic prior. For the sake of calculation, let's consider it 0.1 (assuming there are multiple fields of study and business administration is one of them).

2. **P(E|H):** The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Considering the traits in E, they don't strongly align with typical business administration characteristics but could still plausibly fit. Let's estimate this as 0.2.

3. **P(E|¬H):** The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in business administration. The traits in E suggest a strong fit for other fields such as biology, environmental science, or psychology. These traits are highly generic and would fit many fields better than business administration. Let's assume P(E|¬H) as 0.5.

Using these values with Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be found using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \times 0.1) + (0.5 \times 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.45 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.47 \]

Now apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{0.47} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.47} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0425 \]

So the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch is approximately 0.0425. 

Therefore, the answer is:

{
  "business administration": 0.0425
