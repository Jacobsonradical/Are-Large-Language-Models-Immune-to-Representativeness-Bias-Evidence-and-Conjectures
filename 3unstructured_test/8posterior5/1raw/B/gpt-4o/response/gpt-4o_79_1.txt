To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch (E) using Bayes' rule, we need to determine the following:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in business administration.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in business administration.
4. **P(H|E)**: The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch.

Let's assign some estimates to these probabilities:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Without any additional information, we might assume a uniform distribution over all fields of graduate study. Let's say the probability of being in any specific field, including business administration, is roughly equal across all fields, thus P(H) might be around 0.1 (10%) for simplicity.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality if he was enrolled in business administration. Given that business administration usually attracts people who are interested in corporate settings, leadership, and management, this seems less likely for someone like Adam who is more interested in nature, animals, and abstract thinking. Let's assign P(E|H) a value of 0.2 (20%).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality if he was not enrolled in business administration. Adam's traits are more consistent with fields like biology, environmental science, or perhaps even psychology. These fields might fit his personality better, so P(E|\neg H) would be higher. Let's assign it a value of 0.8 (80%).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Let's calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.8 \cdot 0.9) = 0.02 + 0.72 = 0.74 \]

Now, calculate \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.74} = \frac{0.02}{0.74} \approx 0.027 \]

Thus, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch is approximately 0.027.
