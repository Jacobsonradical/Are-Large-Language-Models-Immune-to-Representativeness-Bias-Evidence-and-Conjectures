To compute P(H|E) using Bayes' Rule, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Define the probabilities:**
   - P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration.
   - P(E|H): The probability of the evidence (personality sketch) given that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration.
   - P(E|\neg H): The probability of the evidence (personality sketch) given that Adam was not enrolled in Business Administration.
   - P(H|E): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration given the evidence.

2. **Assign reasonable estimates to these probabilities:**

- **P(H):** Since Business Administration is a common graduate field, we might assume a baseline probability, though it might not be as high as STEM fields given Adam's interests. Let’s assign a value of 0.10 (10%).
  
- **P(E|H):** Given Adam's personality sketch, Business Administration doesn't seem to directly align with his interests in nature, animals, and abstract concepts. Let’s assign a lower probability that the sketch fits if he were in Business Administration: 0.05 (5%).

- **P(E|\neg H):** Conversely, the probability that the personality sketch is true if Adam is not in Business Administration might be higher since his interests align more with fields like biology, environmental science, or other scientific areas. Let’s assign a value of 0.80 (80%).

3. **Use Bayes' Rule:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Substituting the estimations:
\[ P(E) = (0.05 \cdot 0.10) + (0.80 \cdot 0.90) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.005 + 0.72 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.725 \]

Now, compute \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.10}{0.725} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.725} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0069 \]

Finally, putting the result in the requested format:

  "business administration": "0.0069"
