Sure, let's compute the probability for Adam being enrolled in business administration based on the provided personality sketch \( E \).

First, we need to consider the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \) - The prior probability that Adam is studying business administration.
2. \( P(E|H) \) - The probability of observing the personality sketch if Adam is indeed studying business administration.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - The probability of observing the personality sketch if Adam is not studying business administration.

### Assumptions:

1. **\( P(H) \)**:
   - Given that business administration is a common field, let's assign a generic probability that a graduate student might be enrolled in business administration.
   - Of all possible graduate fields, let's assume a 15% chance that a random graduate student would be studying business administration.
   - Therefore, \( P(H) = 0.15 \).

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**:
   - The personality sketch includes traits like curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work.
   - These traits are not typically associated with business administration directly, but they are not exclusive to any field.
   - It seems less likely that someone with such a personality is focused on business administration, as they might lean towards scientific or caring professions.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.05 \).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - This is the probability of observing Adam's personality if he is not studying business administration.
   - Given his interests and traits, it's likely he could be in fields like biology, environmental science, psychology, etc.
   - These fields might better align with his personality traits.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.30 \).

### Applying Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]

First, calculate \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.05 \times 0.15) + (0.30 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.0075 + 0.255 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.2625 \]

Now, apply Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.15}{0.2625} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.0075}{0.2625} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0286 \]

So, the probability that Adam is studying business administration given his personality sketch is roughly 0.0286.
