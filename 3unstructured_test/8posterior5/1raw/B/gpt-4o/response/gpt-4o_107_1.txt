To answer this question, we need to assign probabilities to P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|¬H) based on the given personality sketch and our assumptions about the field of business administration. Then we'll use Bayes' rule to compute P(H|E).

Let's break it down:

1. P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
2. P(E|H): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he was enrolled in business administration.
3. P(E|¬H): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he was not enrolled in business administration.

Assumptions:
- Adam is described as having a curiosity about nature, a love for animals, a quiet demeanor, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication. These traits may not be strongly associated with business administration, which often emphasizes leadership, strategic thinking, and networking.
- Given the above, we might assume that the fields more strongly correlated with Adam's traits are less related to business administration.

We need to provide reasonable estimates for these probabilities:

1. P(H): Suppose we estimate that, among all graduate students, the proportion enrolled in business administration is around 10%. So, P(H) = 0.10.

2. P(E|H): The probability of Adam's personality traits given that he is a business administration student. Since his traits align less with common perceptions of business administration students, we might estimate this as relatively low, say P(E|H) = 0.30.

3. P(E|¬H): The probability of Adam's personality traits given that he is not a business administration student. Since these traits are more likely to be found in other fields such as environmental science or biology, P(E|¬H) should be higher, say P(E|¬H) = 0.70.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) * P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need P(E):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|\neg H) * P(\neg H) \]

Substitute the values:
\[ P(E) = (0.30 * 0.10) + (0.70 * 0.90) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.03 + 0.63 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.66 \]

Now compute P(H|E):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.30 * 0.10}{0.66} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.66} \]
\[ P(H|E) ≈ 0.045 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch is approximately 0.045.

Here is the answer in the requested format:
