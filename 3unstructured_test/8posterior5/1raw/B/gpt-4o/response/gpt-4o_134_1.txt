To answer this question, we need to estimate the values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \), and then apply Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \).

### Business Administration:

1. **\( P(H) \):** 
   - Let \( P(H) \) be the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a business administration program.
   - Business administration is a common graduate field, but given Adam’s interest in nature, plants, and animals, and his warmth and empathy, it's slightly less likely he’s pursuing business administration compared to other more compatible fields like biology or environmental science. We can estimate \( P(H) \) to be 0.1 (10%).

2. **\( P(E|H) \):** 
   - Let \( P(E|H) \) be the probability of observing Adam’s personality traits given he is studying business administration.
   - While curiosity, empathy, and intelligence can be beneficial in business administration, these traits align more readily with other fields. We estimate \( P(E|H) \) to be 0.3 (30%).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   - Let \( P(E|\neg H) \) be the probability of observing Adam’s personality traits given he is not studying business administration.
   - We expect Adam’s traits to be more common in fields related to science, environment, and social sciences. Therefore, we estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) to be relatively high, around 0.6 (60%).

Now, we apply Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the evidence \( E \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

### Calculation:

\[ P(E) = (0.3 \times 0.1) + (0.6 \times 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.03 + 0.54 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.57 \]

Now, compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.1}{0.57} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.57} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0526 \]

Therefore, the probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration given his personality traits is approximately 0.0526 or 5.26%.
