To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in a business administration program given his personality sketch, we'll employ Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he's in business administration.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of Adam's personality sketch, which can be decomposed using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Given that exact numerical values are not provided for these probabilities, I'll proceed with some reasonable assumptions based on common knowledge and characteristics typically associated with business administration students.

Let's assume the following:
1. The prior probability \( P(H) \) of having any particular graduate field such as business administration is equal among many fields, say 0.1 (or 10%), because Adam could be enrolled in numerous other graduate programs.
2. The likelihood \( P(E|H) \) that someone with Adamâ€™s personality is studying business administration might be lower than average because the personality sketch suggests a person more inclined to fields like natural sciences or social sciences. Let's assume \( P(E|H) \) is roughly 0.05 (or 5%).
3. The likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \) that someone with Adam's personality is in some other field of study (not business administration) might be higher. For instance, it could be 0.95 (or 95%).

Now we calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.05 \cdot 0.1 + 0.95 \cdot 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.005 + 0.855 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.86 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{0.86} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.005}{0.86} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0058 \]

Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch is approximately:

{
  "business administration": "0.0058"
