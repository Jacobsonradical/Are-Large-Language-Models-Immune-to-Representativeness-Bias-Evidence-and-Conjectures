To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration, given his personality sketch, we need to consider the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \) — the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
2. \( P(E|H) \) — the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in business administration.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) — the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in business administration.

Finally, we can use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \), the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch.

### Assumptions
- \( P(H) \): This depends on the general enrollment distribution among graduate students. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \) (i.e., 10%) for business administration as an educated guess.
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam’s interests (curiosity about nature, love for puzzles, deep love for animals, etc.), we can infer that these traits are less common among typical business administration students. So, let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.05 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): This is the probability that Adam's personality sketch matches a graduate student in any other field. His traits suggest he might be more likely in fields related to science, biology, or environmental studies. Let's assume this is \( 0.2 \).

### Calculation using Bayes' Rule
Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(E) = (0.05 \times 0.1) + (0.2 \times 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.005 + 0.18 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.185 \]

Then:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.1}{0.185} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.185} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.027 \]

So the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch is approximately 0.027, or 2.7%.
