Sure, let's go through the process step-by-step.

1. **Assumptions and Estimates**:
   - P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Without additional data, let's assume it's a general field with average popularity among graduate students. So, let's set P(H) to a reasonable value, say 0.10 (10%).
   - P(E|H): The probability that Adam would have the personality sketch E if he were in business administration. Business administration typically focuses on leadership, strategic thinking, and management skills. Adam’s interest in nature, puzzles, empathy, and love for animals doesn’t strongly align with business administration traits. Thus, let's set P(E|H) to a relatively low value, say 0.05 (5%).
   - P(E|¬H): The probability that Adam would have the personality sketch E if he were not in business administration. Given his traits, he might fit better into fields such as biology, environmental science, psychology, or other fields better aligned with his personality. So, let’s assign P(E|¬H) a higher value, like 0.30 (30%).

2. **Bayes Rule Application**:
   - Formula: P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|¬H) * P(¬H)]

   Let's calculate it:
   - P(H|E) = [0.05 * 0.10] / [0.05 * 0.10 + 0.30 * (1 - 0.10)]
   - P(H|E) = [0.005] / [0.005 + 0.30 * 0.90]
   - P(H|E) = [0.005] / [0.005 + 0.27]
   - P(H|E) = 0.005 / 0.275
   - P(H|E) ≈ 0.0182
