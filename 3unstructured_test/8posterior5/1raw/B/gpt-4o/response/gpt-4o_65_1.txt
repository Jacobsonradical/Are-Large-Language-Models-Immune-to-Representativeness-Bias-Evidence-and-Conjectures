To solve for \( P(H|E) \) where \( H \) denotes the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in the field of business administration, we need to estimate:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in business administration.

### Estimations

1. **\( P(H) \):**
   - Graduate students can pursue a variety of fields, and business administration is one of many. Let’s estimate \( P(H) \) to be a reasonable prior probability for a generic graduate student being in business administration. 
   - For the sake of this exercise, let's assign a prior probability that 10% of graduate students are in business administration. 
   \( P(H) \approx 0.10 \)

2. **\( P(E|H) \):**
   - Given the personality sketch \( E \), which includes traits like curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy, these traits are less typical for a business administration student.
   - Therefore, let’s estimate a lower probability for \( P(E|H) \).
   \( P(E|H) \approx 0.02 \) (since these traits do not strongly align with those generally expected for business admin students)

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   - For students not in business administration, there are many other fields that could better match Adam's personality traits, such as biology, environmental science, or psychology.
   - Let’s estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) to be higher than \( P(E|H) \).
   \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.20 \) (a higher value due to alignment with other fields)

### Bayes' Rule:

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let’s calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.02 \times 0.10) + (0.20 \times 0.90) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.002 + 0.18 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.182 \]

Now, calculate \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02 \times 0.10}{0.182} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.002}{0.182} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.011 \]
