To determine \( P(H|E) \), we use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration,
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in business administration,
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \).

We also need:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

### Assumptions and Estimations
Letâ€™s evaluate each term:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
    - The prior probability \( P(H) \) is the likelihood that any given graduate student is studying business administration.
    - We'll assume this to be \( 0.2 \) (20%) based on general statistics about the distribution of graduate programs.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
    - The probability of Adam having the personality sketch \( E \) given that he is enrolled in business administration.
    - Personality traits like genuine curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, empathy, and love for animals are less directly related to business administration.
    - We'll assign a lower value to this, say \( 0.1 \) (10%).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
    - The probability of Adam having the personality sketch \( E \) given that he is **not** enrolled in business administration.
    - Given that Adam's interests and traits seem more aligned with fields such as biology, environmental science, or perhaps psychology, this might be higher.
    - We'll estimate this to be \( 0.5 \) (50%).

Using these values:
- \( P(H) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.8 \)

### Calculation
First, compute \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = (P(E|H) \cdot P(H)) + (P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.5 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.4 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.42 \]

Now, apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.42} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.42} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.048 \]

Thus, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given the personality sketch is approximately 0.048 (or about 4.8%).
