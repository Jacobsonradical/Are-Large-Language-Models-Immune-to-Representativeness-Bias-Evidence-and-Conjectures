To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch (E), we'll use Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule states that:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, \(P(E)\) can be expressed as a combination of \(P(E|H)\) and \(P(E|\neg H)\) weighted by \(P(H)\) and \(P(\neg H)\), respectively:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's break down the components for "business administration":

1. **Prior probability \(P(H)\):** This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration without any personality information. Let's assume a uniform distribution of students across various fields, so we might start with an estimate like 0.1 (assuming 10 possible fields of study).

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\):** This is the probability that Adam has the given personality sketch if he was enrolled in business administration. Business administration students might not typically have such strong inclination toward nature, empathy, and animals. Let's estimate this probability to be fairly low, say 0.1.

3. **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\):** This is the probability that Adam has the given personality sketch if he was not enrolled in business administration. Given his personality sketch, Adam might be more likely in fields like biology, environmental science, psychology, etc. Letâ€™s estimate this probability to be relatively higher, say 0.9.

Now, let's compute the posterior probability using these estimates.

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Given \( P(H) = 0.1 \) and \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.9 \):

\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.1) + (0.9 \cdot 0.9) = 0.01 + 0.81 = 0.82 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.82} = \frac{0.01}{0.82} \approx 0.0122 \]

So, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given the personality sketch is approximately 0.0122 or 1.22%.
