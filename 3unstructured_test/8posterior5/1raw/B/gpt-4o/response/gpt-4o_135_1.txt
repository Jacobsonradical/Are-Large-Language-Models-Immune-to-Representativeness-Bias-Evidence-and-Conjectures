To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration (H) given the personality sketch (E), we need to first estimate the values of:

1. P(H) - The prior probability of Adam being in business administration.
2. P(E|H) - The probability of observing the personality sketch given Adam is in business administration.
3. P(E|¬H) - The probability of observing the personality sketch given Adam is not in business administration.

Then, using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We can estimate P(E) by considering both cases:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

Assuming the following reasonable estimates:

1. P(H) - The prior probability of a graduate student being in business administration. Given the wide range of graduate programs, let's assume P(H) is quite low, say 0.1.
2. P(E|H) - The probability of having the observed personality traits if Adam is in business administration is somewhat moderate since some curiosity and empathy are useful in business administration but not strongly indicative of this field. Let's assume P(E|H) is 0.3.
3. P(E|¬H) - The probability of having the observed personality traits if Adam is not in business administration is higher, as his personality seems more aligned with other fields such as ecology or psychology. Let’s assume P(E|¬H) is 0.7.

We can now use these estimates to compute P(H|E).

First, compute P(E):
\[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.1) + (0.7 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.03 + 0.63 = 0.66 \]

Then, apply Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{(0.3 \cdot 0.1)}{0.66} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.66} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.045 \]

So, P(H|E) is approximately 0.045.

Therefore, the answer is:
