Let's apply the steps in the Bayesian analysis.

1. **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration. Without additional information, we might assume that P(H) (the probability of being enrolled in business administration) is reasonably small based on the general population of graduate students. For simplicity, let's assume it's 0.1.

2. **P(E|H)**: This is the probability of observing the personality sketch E, given that Adam is enrolled in business administration. Considering the personality traits provided, business administration doesn't align very well with a high curiosity about nature, a love for animals, and empathy-focused descriptors. So, P(E|H) might be fairly low. Let's assume it's 0.05.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: This is the probability of observing the personality sketch E, given that Adam is not enrolled in business administration. Since Adam's traits are more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, psychology, etc., P(E|\neg H) should be reasonably high. Let’s assume it’s 0.3.

4. **P(E)**: The overall probability of observing the personality sketch E can be derived by:
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)
   \]
   Substituting the values we assumed:
   \[
   P(E) = (0.05 \times 0.1) + (0.3 \times 0.9) = 0.005 + 0.27 = 0.275
   \]

5. **Using Bayes' rule**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.1}{0.275} = \frac{0.005}{0.275} \approx 0.018
   \]

Hence, the probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch is approximately 0.018 or about 1.8%.
